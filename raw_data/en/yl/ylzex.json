If you and your spouse have decided to take a plunge into parenthood, and want it to happen soon, then this article may help you! We'll be discussing various home remedies to get pregnant and fulfil your dream of becoming a parent. Though there are no full-proof home remedies that are guaranteed to lead to conception, the following ways may help you to conceive faster. What is the Role of Natural Remedies to Conceive Immediately? Health plays a huge factor in getting pregnant, meaning you might need to take certain measures to ensure you are in the prime of health. Home remedies like eating certain foods, exercise, and more will help maintain hormonal balance and prepare your body for pregnancy to increase the chances of conceiving. Taking steps to manage stress, eat right, and stay active through the day will push you further along the journey of becoming a parent. 17 Natural Ways to Conceive Faster There are a number of factors that need to be taken care of when you are trying to conceive, such as your ovulation period, your partner's sperm quality, and your lifestyle and diet. There are plenty of natural and home remedies you can try, most of which are foods which you can include in your daily diet! So, if you are trying to get pregnant, the following foods may be helpful: 1. Dates Dates provide Vitamins B and K, iron, potassium, folate, antioxidants, and other essential minerals. Iron and folate are super important nutrients to have during conception and pregnancy! Thus, nutrient-packed dates are a power food that may help you in conceiving and also during pregnancy. Grind 10-12 seedless dates with two spoons of coriander roots. You may add this paste to a cup of cow's milk and boil it. Consume this mixture for a week after your period gets over, to improve your fertility. 2. Pomegranate Pomegranates are packed with Vitamins C and K, as well as plenty of antioxidants, folate, and potassium. Pomegranates are very effective in increasing blood flow to the pelvic region. They are said to increase female fertility and also help in thickening the uterine lining, which reduces the chances of [miscarriage](https://parenting.firstcry.com/articles/miscarriage-in-pregnancy-types-causes-symptoms/?ref=interlink). Take equal amounts of the bark of the pomegranate tree and seeds, and make a powder. Take half a teaspoon of this powder daily for a few weeks. 3. Maca Root Maca root can be used to treat low fertility in both women and men. It is quite nutritious, as it contains Vitamins B and C, iron, and potassium. This root can help in balancing the hormonal levels of the body and increasing sperm count and motility, thus improving fertility. You may take half a teaspoon of maca root powder with a cup of warm water or milk. Consume the maca root powder for a few months, but avoid it once you get pregnant. 4. Vitamin D A lack of Vitamin D in your body may lead to infertility and even miscarriage among women who may have lost a previous pregnancy. Vitamin D is a very important nutrient for the body: it strengthens bones, teeth and muscles, and improves calcium absorption. Many scientific studies have shown the adverse impact of Vitamin D deficiency on female fertility. The best way to get Vitamin D into your system is by basking in the early morning sunlight for 10 minutes (but be sure to apply sunscreen!), or you can even eat vitamin D-rich foods such as egg yolk and cheese. However, make sure not to take too much Vitamin D, as that can have an adverse impact as well. 5. Cinnamon This wondrous spice helps in better functioning of the female ovaries and thus helps in warding off infertility. It is used in the treatment of [polycystic ovary syndrome](https://parenting.firstcry.com/articles/polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-pcos-signs-causes-treatment/?ref=interlink) or PCOS, which is one of the prime [reasons of infertility](https://parenting.firstcry.com/articles/common-causes-for-not-conceiving?ref=interlink) in women. You can add a teaspoon of cinnamon powder in a cup of warm water and drink this tea for a few months, or you can sprinkle it on top of some meals. 6. Banyan Tree Roots Banyan tree roots have been an effective home remedy for conception. You may take the banyan tree root's powder with warm milk for 3 consecutive days after your period finishes. You can follow this procedure for a couple of months to see results! 7. Garlic One effective natural remedy to get pregnant is to eat garlic. Garlic is known for improving fertility in both men and women. It improves sperm and egg quality. You may take 4 to 5 cloves of garlic and chew it. Drink a glass of warm milk after chewing the garlic cloves. Follow this routine regularly in the winter months to improve fertility. 8. Alum Alum works as one of the greatest home remedies to get pregnant fast. If your periods are regular but you are facing difficulty in getting pregnant, alum is your solution. You may take a small piece of alum and cover it with cotton. Insert it into your vagina at night. Follow this routine till the cotton comes out clean (without any milky layer on the cotton). The absence of white layer is a sign that you are ready to get pregnant. 9. Nutmeg This spice is beneficial in enhancing female fertility. You may include nutmeg in your diet to increase your chances of getting pregnant. You may take equal amounts of nutmeg powder and sugar powder (approximately 3 grams each) and take it with one cup milk (preferably cow's milk) during your periods. 10. Rock Salt You can use rock salt to increase your chances of getting pregnant. Rock salt can be effective in fighting infertility in women, as rock salt has many essential minerals in it like calcium, magnesium, potassium, and iron. You may take a spoonful of rock salt and soak it in 750 ml water. Drink this water early in the morning (before sunrise) for 3 to 6 months to see results. 11. Mustard Paste You may increase your chances of getting pregnant by following this simple and easy home remedy. You may effectively add mustard paste to your everyday diet after the fourth day of your [menstrual cycle](https://parenting.firstcry.com/articles/menstrual-cycle-what-it-is-and-how-does-it-affect-you/?ref=interlink). Mustard is very effective in enhancing fertility in women. But don't overdo it. 12. Holy Basil Holy basil has been used to cure various medical ailments and health conditions. Consumption of holy basil has also proved effective in curing female infertility. Few leaves of holy basil (three to four) can be chewed daily, followed by a glass of milk to improve your chances of getting pregnant. Alternatively, the seeds of basil can be eaten to enhance fertility. 13. Fennel and Rose Petals Another home remedy for conception is the consumption of fennel and rose. If yoga and exercise is something that you cannot follow to increase your chances of getting pregnant, you can have fennel and rose essence to improve your fertility. Mix 10 grams of fennel and 50 grams of rose jam, and take this mixture every night with warm milk (cow's milk). 14. Chasteberry Chasteberry is very beneficial for women who struggle with hormonal imbalance. Increased prolactin levels in the body due to hormonal imbalance may lead to infertility. Consumption of chasteberry helps to combat PCOS and improve ovulation. Take a spoonful of dried chasteberry and infuse it for 10 minutes in boiling water. Drink this tea once a day for a few weeks to enhance fertility. 15. Fennel and Butter This combination is ideal to improve fertility in women who are overweight or heavy. You may take fennel powder (approximately 6 grams) and mix it with 2 parts of pure butter and consume this mixture for three to four months. 16. Spinach Spinach is rich in B vitamin folate, which is a natural form of folic acid. If you are trying to conceive, include spinach in your diet to get enough folate, which is a necessary nutrient added to prenatal vitamins, and it will help your chances of getting pregnant. 17. Salmon Salmon is high in Omega-3 fatty acids, which increases your chances of getting pregnant. As Omega-3 has a positive effect on fertility, it is encouraged to add more salmon and other seafood to your diet to get your fill of this nutrient and conceive sooner. All the above-mentioned foods can effectively improve your chances of getting pregnant. You may try these remedies to get pregnant if you have irregular periods, too. However, it is suggested that you consult your doctor before adopting any of these home remedies to enhance your fertility. Herbal Remedies to Help Get Pregnant There are certain home remedies for conceiving that will help you along your journey to parenthood, especially if you are struggling. Try the below natural remedies to get pregnant fast, and stay consistent for the best results. 1. Eat Antioxidant-Rich Foods Free radicals are known to damage egg cells produced in the body. By eating food that is high in antioxidants, you can effectively reduce the negative effect of free radicals and improve fertility. Include foods that are rich in good antioxidants like Vitamin E, folate, Vitamin C, and more. 2. Increase Fibre Intake Fibre helps remove excessive hormones in the body while controlling blood sugar levels, so your health is kept in check. Include foods rich in fibre in your diet, such as whole grains, beans, and fruits like guava, to improve ovulation and general fertility. 3. Up Your Iron Intake Iron is an essential nutrient for pregnant and childbirth, especially for women in their reproductive years. Eat foods rich in iron, such as beetroot and spinach to improve fertility. If you find your iron levels to be low, consult a doctor about possible supplements. Additional Tips to Keep in Mind Apart from the above-mentioned natural remedies, the following tips may also help in getting you pregnant: 1. Limit your caffeine intake Consuming high amounts of caffeine hinders the absorption of iron in the blood, and it may also cause dehydration. Collectively, these things may lead to infertility issues in women, which can result in problems conceiving and risks of miscarriage or [preterm labour](https://parenting.firstcry.com/articles/how-to-prevent-preterm-labour/?ref=interlink). 2. Avoid sugar Sugar is found in carbohydrates. Eating more than required amounts of sugar may lead to disrupted insulin levels in the body. A carbohydrate-rich diet creates insulin resistance in the body, and may cause problems if you are planning to conceive. Switch to natural sweeteners or fruits as a healthy substitute for sugar. 3. Drink adequate water You should drink good amounts of water if you are planning to have a baby. Water not only keeps the uterus healthy, but it also helps in increasing cervical mucus. The sperms attach better to the thickened cervical mucus and help you in getting pregnant. 4. Be healthy and fit It is very important to exercise every day. If you are on the heavier side of the scale, it might be a good idea to lose some weight, as it would improve your chances of getting pregnant. However, if you are underweight, you may have problems with ovulation. Maintain a healthy and fit body, as it improves your chances of getting pregnant. 5. Sleep well It is very important that you sleep well, for the proper functioning of all your internal organs. Irregular or erratic sleeping habits may take a toll on your hormones. A disrupted hormonal balance may lead to problems in conception. 6. Keep stress away Stress may lead to many health complications and problems, and conceiving is one of them. Increased levels of stress may impact the hormones that are responsible for releasing the egg from the ovaries. Therefore, stress may lead to delayed ovulation or no ovulation at all. 7. Quit smoking Women who smoke may take longer to conceive than women who do not smoke. Also, a pregnant woman who smokes is at great risk of delivering a baby with genetic abnormalities. 8. Don't consume alcohol Alcohol consumption may lead to irregular menstrual cycles, ovulation problems, and disrupted hormonal levels. All of this may lead to complications if you are [planning to get pregnant.](https://parenting.firstcry.com/articles/pregnancy-planning-things-to-do-before-getting-pregnant/?ref=interlink) You may benefit from the above-mentioned tips if you want to get pregnant.
