Let's see how to make spiritual oils at home! DIY essential oils, what a passion! Nature lovers like me love to use essential oils as ingredients of do-it-yourself cleaners to take care of ourselves and our homes. Spiritual oils can be amazing ingredients to boost our magickal practice too, besides being incredibly safe and healthy ingredients to clean our space, relax, and more. Contents How essential oil is made? Specialized laboratories use extraction methods such as steam distillation (of water) and squeezing (for citrus fruits, given the structure of the peel, by pressure). They are complicated and you can hardly make them yourself. The steam permeates the plant material, the plant tissues break down and release the essential oil, the steam drags the essential oil, and together they are cooled in an exchanger and therefore easily separated. Large quantities of flowers and herbs and appliances such as stills are required. |Base Oil||Properties and Benefits| healing, and spiritual growth.| |Jojoba for its stability, moisturizing properties, and versatility.| |Almond Oil||Gentle, nourishing, and good for skin and hair.| at room temperature, moisturizing, and protective.| and easily absorbed by the skin.| moisturizing, and suitable for all skin types.| |Avocado Oil||Rich and moisturizing, beneficial for dry or mature skin.| |Apricot Kernel Oil||Softening, nourishing, and suitable for sensitive Oil||Light, non-greasy, and excellent for massage and skincare.| What is a spiritual oil used for? A spiritual oil is used for many reasons: my favorite is to use some blends to attract serenity and balance at a spiritual level. As we use natural ingredients, if we could follow the entire process all by ourselves, choosing the herbs on our own and following it step-by-step with a mindful approach, I firmly believe the process itself would be a great way to start connecting with our energy and to start being nourished by nature. Plus, we would be using a 100% natural spiritual oil and we would avoid not-so-organic and not-so-natural products that might be dangerous for our health.

As I said, it is possible to make the essential oils yourself using herbs and flowers from your garden and vegetable oil as the base, be it extra virgin olive oil, jojoba oil, almond, or wheat germ. You will get weaker concentrations than those on the market but the satisfaction of having done everything by yourself will pay off a lot. We use the olive oil available in every kitchen for convenience and, as a unit of measurement, we will use a 250 ml cup. For use on the skin, almond oil is more suitable. As for herbs, we can use according to the seasons and as long as they are organic and free of pesticides. They can be used individually or combined; for example, rose and lavender work well together. The collection of the aerial parts of herbs and flowers must be done in the morning and before flowering. Remember to eliminate (but do not kill!) any animals, then wash and dry the herbs with paper towels. Now, let's see the two main methods of preparing DIY essential oils. Cold method Let's start with the cold method: - 250 ml of vegetable oil - 1 cup or 250 ml of leaves, herbs, or fresh flowers Preparation: Put the leaves and flowers in a plastic bag, close it, and crush it slightly with a wooden pestle or a rolling pin. This operation serves to cause the oil to escape from the aerial parts of the plant. Immediately afterward, put them in a large glass jar with a wide mouth and a cork and add the vegetable oil to which the officinal plants will gradually release their aroma. Place it in a warm place but not in direct contact with the sun's rays for a period ranging from 24 to 48 hours. Then filter with the help of cotton gauze. To strengthen the fragrance and the oil concentration, obtain more fresh herbs and flowers in the same quantities (they must be in a 250 ml cup) that you will put back in the plastic bag. Once pounded, they must be added to the oil from the previous container. Leave them to rest in the oil for another 24-48 hours, then filter again. Repeat the ritual one or possibly two more times, until the perfume has an intensity that is pleasing to you. At the end of the procedure, filter again with cotton gauze and with the help of a funnel, transfer everything to a dark glass bottle with a dropper cap, or to a normal bottle to be kept in a dark place. Hot method An alternative method to the above is the hot method, i.e. the oil and herbs are cooked. In this case, get: - 250 ml of vegetable oil - 1 cup or 250 ml of leaves, herbs, or fresh flowers Preparation: Put the intact herbs (without crushing them as in the first procedure) in the oil and put everything to simmer in a large saucepan with a thick bottom in a water bath, for 6 hours. Leave to cool, strain with cotton gauze and then put everything to a dark bottle for use when you need it. The essential oil thus obtained must be used within 6 months of its creation, after each uses it is necessary to remember to rinse your hands and avoid touching your eyes. Never dilute the oil with water. Making spiritual oils Once you have your basic oils, you can spice things up a bit and create your spiritual oil blends. |Essential Oil||Corresponding Properties| |Lavender||Calming, healing, purification, and spiritual growth.| |Rosemary||Protection, focus, and purification.| |Frankincense||Spiritual connection, meditation, and purification.| |Patchouli||Grounding, attraction, sensuality, and abundance.| |Sandalwood||Spirituality, relaxation, grounding, and meditation.| |Cedarwood||Protection, grounding, purification, and abundance.| |Lemon||Purification, cleansing, clarity, and upliftment.| |Eucalyptus||Healing, purification, and clearing negative energy.| |Peppermint||Energy, mental focus, purification, and clarity.| |Jasmine||Love, sensuality, spiritual connection, and harmony.| I usually use these ones as a foundation to create magickal spiritual blends: Lavender essential oil Regenerating the nervous system, stress, depression, melancholy, and sleep disturbances.

Here is my blend of essential oils for serenity: In a small glass bottle or in a 10 ml roll-on put: - 6 drops of the essential oil you have chosen, or 2 drops each of the indicated essential oils. - Add vegetable oil (I usually use jojoba oil because it is fragrance-free and not rancid) to fill. Gently rotate the closed bottle between your hands to harmonize the mixture. You can put a few drops on the palm of your hand and gently rub them together, then bring them closer to your face and inhale the aroma with deep and slow breaths. Or you can spread it in the environment: put 2 drops of each essential oil indicated in your diffuser and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere! Would you give homemade spiritual oils a "}
