But it sometimes can be hard to eat enough fresh veggies, fruits, whole grains, and other healthy options. A multivitamin can be a safe way to boost your nutrients. Do You Need a Supplement?

But if you also eat fortified foods and drinks, you might go over the tolerable upper level (UL) for some nutrients. That can raise your chances of side effects. Some might be mild, like nausea.

A certain mix of antioxidants, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids may slow down ARED. Tips on Use and Storage Always check with your doctor first, especially about how much to take, Jones advises.

You may need a separate supplement. - Buy brands with USP, NSF, or another third-party \"seal of approval.\" It may be easier to remember to take your vitamins if you keep them in your bathroom. But light, moisture, and medicine can make a poor combo. Keep your supplements somewhere cool and dry, such as on your dresser.
