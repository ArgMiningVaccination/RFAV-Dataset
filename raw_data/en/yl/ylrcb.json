He is the chief editor of the first definitive textbook of the field entitled \"I [ntegrative Geriatric Medicine](https://a.co/d/aj5yyvo) \", published by Oxford University Press as part of Andrew Weil Integrative Medicine Library series and is frequent speaker at a variety of international conferences on the topics of Integrative Medicine and Geriatrics, healthy aging, and geriatrics, as well as neurodegenerative diseases. He is also an author of a highly acclaimed book \" [Medical Marijuana: Dr. Kogan's Evidence-Based Guide to the Health Benefits of Cannabis and CBD](https://a.co/d/eRghzrP)\" published by Random House in 2021. Dr. Kogan currently serves as medical director of the GW Center for Integrative Medicine and associate director of the Geriatrics Fellowship Program. He is the founder and director othe George Washington University Integrative Geriatrics Fellowship Track and the director of the Integrative Medicine Track program at the George Washington University School of Medicine, as well as serving as part-time faculty member of the George Washington Institute for Spirituality and Health, and the GW Center for Aging, Health and Humanities. In addition to his academic roles at George Washington University Dr. Kogan serves on a number of national boards and organizations including: the American Board of Integrative Medicine within the American Board of Physician Subspecialists (ABPS), PlantMed, and others. Dr Kogan is also the founder and the chair of the board of [AIM Health Institute](https://www.healthaim.org/what-we-do/), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area that provides integrative medicine services to low-income and terminally ill patients. For Dr. Mikhail Kogan, the practice of medicine, much like the rest of his life, has been a journey spanning many miles and many cultures, with valuable new learning and different perspectives accruing from each stage along the way. Those many experiences - here and abroad, in the classroom and the clinic, professionally and personally - have given Dr. Kogan the skills, , openness, and inquisitiveness that set him apart, and distinguish him as a committed and caring practitioner within integrative medicine. Born in Moscow, in the former Soviet Union, Dr. Kogan emigrated with his family in his teens, first to Israel,and then to the United States, where he obtained his medical degree from the Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He followed a Primary Care and Social Medicine Track residency in Internal Medicine at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, and a fellowship in Geriatric Medicine at the George Washington University Medical Center in Washington, D.C., which led to a position as an assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Geriatrics and Palliative Care. In addition to his training in conventional Western medicine, Dr. Kogan has actively pursued a number of other healing arts and practices that have shaped his understanding of and approach to patient care. He is a graduate of a two-year training course in craniosacral therapy-a subtle osteopathic modality that has a wide range of effectiveness for different conditions such as headaches, back pains, and fatigue. He has also completed a four-year program at the Suluk Academy, a teaching center based on the principles and traditions of Sufism, where he learned how to incorporate meditation, mindfulness, and different spiritual practices into his daily life and his work with the patients. Among his many other areas of study are courses in Nutrition, therapeutic use of vitamins, Functional Medicine, botanicals, and other alternative modalities. Weaving those tools into the fabric of his medical practice has enabled Dr. Kogan to provide innovative and effective treatments to his patients with minimal use of invasive procedures or heavy reliance on medications and to understand the importance of self-exploration, awareness and positive lifestyle changes as essential milestones on his patients' journeys towards better health. Dr. Kogan is dedicated to helping patients with Alzheimer's disease identify and correct underlying metabolic drivers work, which is primarily based on Dr. Dale Bredesen's research and newly created ReCode protocol. Dr. Kogan practices Geriatric and Integrative Medicine in a variety of settings: at the George Washington Hospital, at the GW Center for Integrative medicine, as well as serving patients in home visits.

True to his calling as an integrative practitioner, his leisure time is replete with healthy lifestyle activities that nourish both body and spirit : he enjoys vigorous exercise, frequent nature walks with his family and dogs, mind body practices such as weekly Sufi Meditation classes, beekeeping and gardening. Testimonials: \"Dear Dr.Kogan, Please consider this a note of thanks, rather than a letter to be read into my file. I'm sleeping, pretty much every night, often all the way through the night, and it has changed my life \u2014 so thank you for the time you have taken to evaluate my family and personal medical history, our discussions, your theory about a genetic mutation that might be contributing to my sleeplessness, and your suggestion for remedies. It truly has been years since I have slept comfortably on a regular basis, and I can't tell you the number of doctors to whom I have noted this problem. Sleeplessness has made me constantly exhausted, not clear in my thinking or speaking, anxious, irritable, and very often, just not a nice person. I cannot tell you what a difference this simple fix - as you put it - has made in my life. So, thank you again, you have helped make me a new person, for which I thank you virtually every day! - Gratefully, Carelee USA Countries lived in: Russia, Israel Education MD - Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 2004 BS in Biochemistry - Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 1997 Technicon - Israel Institute of Technology, Israel, Haifa - Biology Major 1992-1995 Moscow Agricultural Academy, Moscow, Russia - Botany Major 1990-1992 Employment Medical Director GW Center for Integrative Medicine, Washington, DC 2011-Present Assistant Professor of Medicine (Associate Professor Title pending, application submitted Sept 2017) 2008-Present George Washington University School of Medicine Integrative Medicine Consultations, Lead Physician 2014-2016 Integrative Health and Wellness, Washington DC Veterans Affairs Hospital Geriatric Fellow 2007-2008 George Washington University, Washington, DC Internal Medicine Resident 2004-2007 Social and Primary Care Program, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY Professional Registrations, Licenses, Certifications * Washington DC Medical License - MD036716, Exp Date 12/31/2018 * American Board of Physician Subspecialties, Integrative Medicine, 2015 * American Board of Internal Medicine, Palliative Care Certification - October 2012 * Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy Certification - June, 2012 * HeartMath, Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback Training Program, professional certification, December 2009 * American Board of Internal Medicine, Geriatric Medicine Certification - November, 2008 * American Board of Internal Medicine Certification - August 2007 * Strain-Counterstrain Osteopathic manipulation certification, Sept 2004 Societies and Honors * Top Washington Doctors Washingtonian Magazine - 2016 * American Board of Integrative Medicine - founding board member * The Drexel 40 under 40 award - Fall 2013 * American Medical Student Association -alumni * Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy Association of North America - member * Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine -member Clinical Skills and Areas of Expertise * Geriatrics and Palliative Care * Integrative Medicine - Practitioner and Medical Director of large academic integrative Medicine Center with 20+ integrative providers * Neurodegenerative Disorders: Memory Disorders, Parkinson's disease * Functional Medicine: with specific interest in GI, Neurodegenerative problems, Heavy Metal Toxicities, Methylation Defects, Cancer * Advanced IV and Oral Nutrients protocols for patients of all ages * Performance Optimization, especially for senior athletes * Osteopathic Medicine: Decade of ongoing training from Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine, Traditional Osteopathic Studies (Craniosacral Therapy) with James Jealous, DO * Reiki level 2 practitioner * Medical Cannabis - one of the first DC MDs to recommend, working closely with DC DOH, took part in developing online DCRX DOH medical cannabis training modules.
