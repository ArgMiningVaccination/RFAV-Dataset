The use of essential plant oils dates back 6,000 years ago. Found to have mystical healing properties by the ancient Chinese to cure many illness and skin afflictions, Egyptians and Romans took a more practical approach, using these essential oils for perfumes, cosmetics and hi-potency drugs. [Aromatherapy](services/massage-therapy) also encourages the use of other harmonizing natural ingredients, including cold pressed vegetable oils, herbs, milk powders, sea salts and a wide array of clays and muds. How Aromatherapy Works When inhaled, the fragrances of essential oils travels across sensitive nerves on the inner lining of the nose to the portion of the brain that controls moods, memories and the ability to learn called the Limbic System. When stimulated by the Aromatherapy essential oils fragrances, the Limbic System releases endorphins transmitters and other \"feel-good\" chemicals found in the human body. Essential oils are not mind-altering drugs, nor bring about changes in behavior patterns or other unfavorable side effects. When used as an inhalant in conjunction with a deep-cleansing massage, the essential oils of Aromatherapy produce true inner-peace within a state of complete tranquility.
