It' s linked to chronic conditions as diverse as cancer, Alzheimer' s, obesity,congestive heart failure, and diabetes.\"Silent inflammation\" is literally astealth bomber, reducing your odds ofliving a long and disease-free life justas effectively (and as silently) as if youwere breathing an invisible, odorless poison gas. Why should you care? If you've ever stubbed your toe, bangedyour head against a beam, or gotten asplinter or an abscess, you know whatacute inflammation is. White bloodcells\u2014also known as leukocytes\u2014mobilize to the injury site, surroundingit like an army blocking off an invading force. Specialized white blood cellscalled macrophages (Latin for \"big eaters\") look and act like little PacMen,initiating defense mechanisms andliterally swallowing up and immobi-lizing any invading pathogens.These activities are collectively known as \"inflammation. \" And thebody needs inflammatory chemicals,because the ability to mobilize themeffectively is an integral part of the natural healing response. But for most people, the inflam- matory army is in overdrive while theanti-inflammatory army is underfunded. People need inflammation to heal\u2014 it' s vital to have those white blood cellsrushing to the site of an injury. But thebody also needs anti-inflammatory compounds to act as correctives whenthere' s too much inflammation.Inflammation and anti-inflammationforces need to be in balance, otherwisethere' s trouble. The slow killer \"Classic (acute) inflammation hurts, \"says Barry Sears, PhD. \"Silent (chronic)inflammation slowly kills. \" In the lattercase, instead of being a transient event,the inflammatory response persists over time, \"like an ornery child who can'tresist picking at a scab\" writes sciencereporter Christine Gorman. Eventually, chronic inflammation can and willdestroy tissue. Little wonder Time presciently titled a cover article in 2004, Inflammation: The Silent Killer. 1 Some foods, like sugar and excess vegetable oils, have the effect of turbo- charging the inflammatory productionpathways, while other foods (like wild salmon with its rich content of omega- 3s, and the antioxidant astaxanthin found in certain marine plants and animals) have precisely the oppositeeffect. This is where things get interesting from a clinical perspective. The body makes inflammatory and anti-inflammatory compounds calledeicosanoids from one source only: fat. The type of fat one consumes has a profound effect on the eicosanoid production factory. Omega-6 fattyacids, the kind found in vegetable oils like corn, safflower, soybean, and canola oil are pro-inflammatory\u2014they're the precursors for the inflam- matory chemicals manufactured in the body.

They're precursors for thebody' s anti-inflammatory compounds. Most researchers agree that the ideal relationship of omega-6 fatty acids toomega-3 fatty acids is about 1-to-1, thesame ratio found in the diet of hunter-gatherer societies. This ratio keeps theeicosanoid production factories inharmony, with the body producing anice balance of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory chemicals as needed. But the ratio of pro-inflammatory fats to anti-inflammatory fats in thetypical W estern diet is far from ideal.It' s usually between 15- and 20-to-1. Steps toward wellness Fortunately, a great deal of inflammationis controllable. If patients can put outthe fire within, or at least stop it fromspreading, they'll be well ahead of thegame. And it all starts with food. The plant kingdom is loaded with natural anti-inflammatories. (Oneexample is quercetin, found in onionsand apples.) Some of the anti-inflam-matory superstars that should be any anti-inflammatory diet wine /trianglertcocoa and chocolate (if low in sugar) /trianglertflaxseed and flax oil And wild salmon, which isn't a member of the plant kingdom but is agreat source of the two most important omega-3s found in food, as well the superstar antioxidant astaxanthin. Grass- fed beef also has omega-3 fats, as do sardines, mackerel, herring, and tuna. Inflammation is likely to emerge as the health concern of the decade, butthe good news is that you can do a great deal to combat it. Healthy whole foods,plenty of omega-3 fats, and a minimumof sugar are a great place to start. Many supplements can help lower inflammation. Here' s a short guide tothe most important ones. Omega-3. Omega-3s are among the most anti-inflammatory substances known and should be part of everyone' s supplement program. Given the variety available in the market, it' s clear that most consumers are sold on them. Omega-7. Omega-7 is a fatty acid found in cold-water fish as well asmacadamia nuts and sea buckthornberries. It has beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome, diabetes, weight,triglycerides, and insulin resistance. Astudy at the Cleveland Clinic foundthat omega-7s lower C-reactiveprotein\u2014a marker for systemic inflammation\u2014by 44 percent. 2 Curcumin. This extract from the Indian spice turmeric has multiple benefitsand is highly anti-inflammatory, whilebeing easy to Research hasdemonstrated its anti-inflammatory,anti-oxidant, anti-thrombotic, effects. 3It also reduces oxidized LDL (bad)cholesterol. 4Magnesium. Magnesium supplements are a must for those who want toprotect their heart. Magnesium lowersblood pressure, helps control bloodsugar, and relaxes the lining of blood vessels. And almost all dietary surveys show that Americans aren't gettingnearly enough. Because blood pressurecan contribute to inflammatory lesions in vascular walls, it' s a good idea toinclude it in an anti-inflammatory supplement program. Resveratrol. Resveratrol is the ingre- dient in red wine that' s best known for its anti-aging properties. It helps protect the arteries, improves their elasticity, inhibits blood clots, and lowers both oxidized LDL and bloodpressure. 5It' s both a strong antioxidant and an anti-inflammatory, inhibiting a number of inflammatory enzymes that can contribute to heart disease.6The recommended dose is 200 mg a day of trans-resveratrol, the active componentof resveratrol. Methyl sulfonyl-methane (MSM). This is a natural anti-inflammatory that blocksthe transmission of pain signals innerve fibers. It' s known as being great for joint health and reducing the pain of arthritis. The biochemical precursor to MSM\u2014dimethyl sulfoxide\u2014hasbeen studied extensively for pain and inflammation. Cocoa flavanols. Plant chemicals in cocoa known as flavanols help thebody synthesize nitric oxide, which is critical for healthy blood flow and blood pressure. Nitric oxide also makes the lining of the arteries less attractive for white blood cell attachment.Researchers in Germany found thatthose who ate the greatest amount offlavanol-rich dark chocolate had lower blood pressure and a nearly 40 percentInflammation is likely to emerge as the health concern of the decade, but the good news is that you can do a great deal to combat it.20 C H I R O P R AC T I C E CO N O M I C S f e B r u A r y 5 , 2 0 1 6 C H I R O E CO.CO MCLINICAL CONCERNS lower risk of heart attack or stroke compared to those who ate little or nochocolate. 7 Boswellia. Boswellia is well-known for its ability to lower inflammation. Adose of 150 mg three times a day isrecommended for two to threemonths. It has been used effectively incombination with ginger, turmeric, andashwaganda, and proven beneficial forinflammation and pain associated withosteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. 8BosPure is an extract that is standardized to contain more than 10percent natural AKBA (acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid), the most powerful form, and can be found in some commercial products. Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). This is an anti-inflammatory omega-6 fatty acidand the active ingredient in eveningprimrose oil, borage oil, and black currant oil. 9,10GLA seems to have a synergistic effect with the long-chain fatty acid EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and should be given together withomega-3 fish oil. About 1000 mg a dayof GLA is recommended. Lowering inflammation may be one of the most important things you can do for your overall health and thehealth of your patients. Fortunately, most of the effective tools are at yourdisposal. JONNY BOWDEN , PhD, CNS, is a nationally known board-certified nutritionist and expert on diet and weight loss.

The implications of multilayered, multimodal treatments are of interestto doctors of chiropractic. Source of the syndrome Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis) isa common condition characterized by insidious onset of pain, restriction ofmovement of the shoulder, and restric-tions of activities of daily living. Infrozen shoulder, the shoulder capsulethickens and becomes stiff, formingbands of tissue called fibrotic adhesions. A patient will present to the chiro- practor' s office with an inability tomove his or her shoulder due to pain,with a restricted range of motion. Acomprehensive and thorough ortho-pedic examination will determinewhich of many potential causes hascreated the Possible diagnosesof shoulder include: arthritis,bicep tendinopathy, neoplasm, tornrotator cuff, and bursitis. 1 According to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, frozenshoulder develops in three stages: 1. Freezing. In this stage, the patient slowly experiences increasing amounts of pain. As the pain worsens, the shoulder loses range of motion. Freezing typically lasts from six weeks to ninemonths. 2. Frozen. Painful symptoms may actually improve during this stage, butthe stiffness remains. During the four-to-six month frozen stage, dailyactivities may be difficult. 3. Thawing. Shoulder motion slowly improves during the thawing stage.Complete return to normal or close tonormal strength and motion typicallytakes from six months to two years. 2 Routes to recovery Y ou have a range of modalitiesavailable to produce results for frozenshoulder syndrome: 1. Interferential electrical muscle stimulation, or interferential therapy (IFT), increases blood flow to the soft tissue and creates a pain-reducing analgesic effect due to blocking thepain receptors. IFT in combination with shoulder exercises is often effective in treating frozen shoulder patients. 3 2. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy, or ultrasound therapy, creates a deep warming in the soft tissue to accelerate blood flow and healing. This modality can be an alternativetreatment, at least in the short-term, for primary adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder. 4In the Chen study, the ultrasound group showed significant improvement when compared to thesteroid group with regard to activitiesof daily living and pain levels at the sixth week of the study. 4 3. Therapeutic exercises will create strength to support the shoulder joint and flexibility to enhance elasticity, which increases ranges of motion.

ROBERT AGOSTINO, EDD24 C H I R O P R AC T I C E CO N O M I C S f e B r u A r y 5 , 2 0 1 6 C H I R O E CO.CO MRESEARCH RESuLTS Therapeutic exercises and mobilization are strongly recommended for reducing pain and improving range of motion and function in patients with stagestwo and three of frozen shoulder. 5 Review of reimbursement In looking at reimbursement rates of a national insurance company accepted by most chiropractors, it is evident they understand chiropractors whoperform extremity adjustments can enhance the glenohumeral joint function of a frozen shoulder. Expected outcomes include decreased patient pain and increased range of motion.But the provider should also considerperforming modalities to both increase patient results and practice revenue. For example: According to the standards of the insurer in question,reimbursements reimburses for one adjustment and three modalities or therapies per treatment. Over the course of one treatment schedule, thiscorrelates to a substantial increase inpractice revenue. Chiropractor A, who performs an extremity adjustment with electricalmuscle stimulation, can expect areimbursement of $39 per treatment. Chiropractor B who performs the four abovementioned billable serviceswill see a reimbursement of $79 pertreatment. Over the course of a 16-treatment schedule (less copays and examinations),chiropractor B will be reimbursed anadditional $640, enjoying increasedpractice revenue.The ethical chiropractor will understand the numbers and ideas above as a call for patient education.The idea of multilayered treatmentsdone over time with copays andinsurance costs is a complex one,especially for many senior chiropracticpatients. An economic analysis thatdoes not include time for explanationsto patients about value for money isincomplete. The DC who conveys the sequence of treatments in commonlanguage with the costs and benefitsset out clearly is acting in the spirit of B.J. Palmer.

Coincidence, in fact, has nothingto do with a message about yourpractice that resonates with your targetaudience. It signifies the success of acarefully constructed plan. When you enter the chiropractic industry with little advertising experi-ence, your efforts to attract and retainpatients can seem aimless and conse-quently be ineffective. T o get on aproductive path, you need a compre-hensive strategy that' s measurable andtailored to your ideal patients. Y ou want your community to remember the name of your practicewhen a problem that youcan solvearises. T o be at the forefront of patients'minds, people have to understand what you do and associate your practicewith a positive experience, starting with their first call to your office. Begin from within If you're facing stagnation or wish toincrease your patient base, a good place to start is by auditing your currentprotocols. Y ou want the structures ofyour practice maximized in value. Thisincludes the procedures followed byyour staff for first-time patients, follow- up calls, and etiquette across all typesof communications. Having these procedures working at their full potential will enhance one ofyour most powerful marketingsources\u2014referrals. One bad patientexperience can spread by word ofmouth and exponentially via socialmedia and review sites. Put an end to any glitches in the matrix with a thorough evaluation ofyour internal operations. Get a bird' s- eye view of your systems by consultingan outside party to conduct the reviewand assist you with the necessary modifications. Engineer community connections No matter how strong your patientreferral network is, your patient basecan always be more robust if your goal is to help more people and increase profits. \"If you're telling me your practice is all referrals, then you're telling me that you can't handle anymore new patients, \" says Charles W ebb, DC, and healthcare marketing consultant. \"Referrals are part of it, but Total recall Healthcare marketing strategies to attract your ideal patients.

But yourapproach in developing a partnershiphas to benefit them at the outset. \"The mistake most doctors make is they goout just to promote themselves, \" W ebbsays. \"'Here' s what I do; can you helpme build my practice?'\" In comparison, you might first offer to educate customers about the benefitsof healthy eating for free as they walkthrough the store. \"Y ou can come inand help these people understand thebusiness, \" W ebb says. \" And instead ofbuying 20 percent of their food goodshere, they buy 50 percent. And you alsoget the opportunity to promote yourself. \" Educational outreach An educational focus should spill overinto your other efforts so that you aren'twasting time trying to convince peoplethat your services are worth theirmoney, W ebb says. During their firstvisit, patients should already understand your values and what your care entails,whether it' s conservative treatment forlow-back pain or counseling for an active lifestyle. This creates less workfor you in the long run. One way to deliver this pre-education is through direct mail, which allowsyou to target specific demographicsand keep track of the results. In thehealthcare industry, this can includeoutreach aimed at patients withspecific health ailments, medicationtreatments, and lifestyles in addition tofactors such as age and gender. But it' s crucial that your mail campaigns communicate the rightmessage. W ebb indicates a postcardthat promotes your degrees and howlong you've been in practice will likelyfail to attract patients. The copy andvisuals should emphasize what you canoffer to a specific group you're tryingto reach, such as athletes, the elderly, or health-conscious professionals andbe crafted accordingly: \"It has to be all about [the patient], \" W ebb says. \"Thatway you don 't have to go through a dog-and-pony show to justify what you do. \" Always test the waters With any marketing strategy, keep track of the time and money you're puttingin and evaluate the ROI. Consider thefirst time you try anything new to be atest period. If one strategy fails, reviseyour efforts based on metrics andanalytics to perfect your target, timing,and message. W ebb also highlights the importance of your promotional materials standingout in the midst of everything yourpatients are bombarded with. So don't let pride stand in the way of asking forhelp and ensure your marketing dollars don 't go to waste. \"I've always sought out advice from people who know morethan me in an area that I want to master, \" W ebb says. With this mindset, you're no longer at the mercy of hoping your optimal patients find out about you. Indeed, the newly found \"luck\" you discover in bringing patients through the door might closely reflect your professional marketing plan.

Y ou stare at your watch for a few seconds and then you look up. Three minutes later you look downand check your watch again\u2014it' s 8:04and you stare with your neck flexeddown for another few seconds. Now imagine doing this look-down-and-stare routine every four minutes untilmidnight. But you're not just lookingat your watch, you're also checkingyour smartphone. According to a T ecmark study, the average person looks at a smartphone221 times a day for a total of aboutthree hours and 15 minutes\u2014aboutonce every four minutes for 16 hoursstraight. A chiropractor should findthis to be worrying because in oneyear the average person will spendalmost 1,200 hours\u201450 days\u2014staringdown at a screen.Repetitive strain injury Professionally speaking, you' d have to agree that without a doubt the magni- tude of this number of repetitionscould become responsible for decadesof chronic neck pain. A preliminarystudy in the 2011 edition of Applied Ergonomics shows a relationship between mobile device use andmusculoskeletal neck pain. Another study, from the 2012 edition of the same journal, tells usthat when people use mobile devices,their posture is often poor (not asurprise). Sarah Hopkins, DC, believesthe long-term side effects of textmessaging and smartphone use cancause a person' s posture to change overtime. \"The body has an incredibleability to adapt, \" Hopkins says.\"Unfortunately, when people arehunched over their cell phone all day,the body adapts to that posture, too. \"Not all thumbs The general public is under the impression that smartphone overuse can cause conditions like \"Blackberrythumb\" or \"iPad finger, \" but texting isactually a full-body activity. Muscles the pectoralis major, latissimusdorsi, masseter, and erector spinae all contract during the traditional textingstance: head down and arm adducted with the elbow bent at 90 degrees. The continual repeated use of these tissues can trigger the release of neurogenic inflammation which can lead to motormuscle inhibition. Negative outcomes Neurogenic inflammation in themusculoskeletal system is generated by nerve impulses and the release of inflammatory substances from thesensory axon at the site of the original The future is looking down T echnology means you will be busy for years to come.

These substances are typically (but not limited to): substance P (SP),calcitonic gene-related peptide(CGRP), and neurokinin-A (NKA). Prolonged inflammation and pain can lead to protective muscle spasm,accumulation of fibrous tissue, andmuscle shortening. Accretion offibrous tissue can form palpable tautmuscle bands and trigger points,creating muscle dysfunction and spasmthat leads to the compression of bloodvessels\u2014creating nociception. 1 In short, nociception is a nerve' s reaction to the chemicals that irritateit. Neurogenic inflammation, whichcan be caused by injury or repetitive strain, is the chemical mixture that irritates the nerve that controls a specific muscle. This causes that muscle to become inhibited and forcesadaptation of the musculoskeletalsystem\u2014which contributes to long-term degradation of mechanics. Accelerating problems Alpha-motor neuron muscle inhibitionoccurs when the nerve that sends the impulse to contract a muscle becomesunable to function at its optimalcapacity because of chemical or physicaltrauma. This results in a perceivedweakness of the muscle that changes the biomechanics of the entire region. The primary cause of motor inhibition is a sufficient amount of neurogenic inflammation released bythe sensory axon to inhibit the motor neuron. So, looking down at asmartphone over 1,500 times a weekcan not only contribute to motorinhibition but also accelerate its onset. Incorporating texting into patient history Y ou can adapt your history-taking to incorporate texting as part of thefunctional orthopedic exam. With tech-savvy patients who are sufferingfrom neck and shoulder discomfort,you can reproduce and exacerbate their pain by taking out a phone andtexting them a series of commonhistory-taking questions. For example: T ext them questions like, \"When did the pain start, \" \"What makes the pain better or worse, \" or\"What medications are you currently taking?\" These questions lead them to text you the answers and even though theexchange only takes three or four minutes, that is usually long enough to exacerbate their symptoms. In addition, it reveals to them the contributing factors to their chief complaint. The eyes have it Smartphone use taxes not only the musculoskeletal system but the ocularsystem as well. Y ou want to be able to explain this to your patients so you canbetter diagnose and treat their condition. 32 C H I R O P R AC T I C E CO N O M I C S f e B r u A r y 5 , 2 0 1 6 C H I R O E CO.CO MPRACTICE CENTRAL Researchers from the Journal of Optometry and Vision Science found the average working distance for text messages to be about 14 inches, whereas the average working distance for viewing a webpage was about 12inches. But those were both closer than the typical working distance of approxi-mately 16 inches when reading printed text, as with a newspaper or magazine.Holding smart phones at such shortdistances can place increased demands on the eyes' ability to correct fordistance. This is why optometrists are also weighing in on the \"text neck\" debate.Otto Lee, OD, believes the use of smartphones, tablets, and computers iscertainly on the rise regardless of age group. The growing concern withsmartphone and computer use stems from the effects of increased exposure to harmful blue-violet light. Many digital devices use LEDs that can emit about 35 percent blue-violet light, says Lee. \"Normal visible light that we can detect ranges from 380 nmto 780 nm. UV A, UVB, and UVCranges from 315 to 1000 nm and candamage human tissue, including theeyes. \" This can increase the risk ofdeveloping cataracts and age-relatedmacular degeneration. Patient protection Lee recommends that antioxidants andvitamins can provide some protectionagainst blue-violet light damage. Inaddition, manufacturers havedeveloped lenses that block outharmful blue-violet light withoutaltering image clarity and color. \"Prevention is the key. Limiting the use of smartphones, tablets, andcomputers is obvious\u2014if you can get your teens or yourself away from them, \" Lee says. He also recommendsregular \"eye breaks, \" which will complement good neck posturebecause eye strain is usually compen-sated by changing neck position. A one-minute break after every ten minutes of screen time is a goodrecommendation. Ounce of prevention T o take the pressure off of the neckand shoulder muscles, patients need tofind smartphones they can hold and type on using only one hand. Some ofthe larger phones, known as \"phablets, \"generally require two hands to use andare less ergonomic. Repeatedly flexing the neck downward to operate a smartphone will likely cause damage over time. T o combat this, patients can try usingvoice dictation and auto-text optionsthat allow them to speak their messageor help it type itself. Also, when theyhave to text, they should try sitting comfortably at a desk or table with their hand resting on the surface about 18 inches away from the body. Thiswill put the neck at a more gradual angle, placing less strain on the muscles. ANTHONY J. LOMBARDI , DC, is the creator of the eXStore assessment system.

BY KAREN APPOLD RIDOFRANZ/THINKSTOCKC H I R O E CO.CO M f e B r u A r y 5 , 2 0 1 6 C H I R O P R AC T I C E CO N O M I C S 35Most chiropractors don 't want to spend much time marketing their practices. Instead, they' d prefer to focus on healing patients. But the fact is that most chiropractic practices need to be promoted to be viable businesses. T urning your staffinto a team of marketing champions(or hiring someone to do this task) isthe best way to market your practicewhile minimizing your involvement.W e gathered some proven experts inthe field to show you how. Theme of the week One effective way to turn your staffinto a new-patient machine is to getthem to embrace a daily patienteducation and referral system, says Len Schwartz, DC. T o achieve this, he suggests choosing a specific topic eachweek to discuss with patients duringtheir visit, such as how chiropracticcare can help to decrease headaches. For example: After greeting a patient, the receptionist would broachthe topic by saying something like,\"Did you know that according to thegovernment chiropractic care is thetreatment of choice for headaches? Thedoctor will tell you more about thiswhen he sees you. \" If there' s a bunch of people in your waiting room and there' s no time tomention this to each person individ-ually, have the receptionist stand upwhen the rush is over and announcethe topic to everyone waiting. If another staff member\u2014such as a massage therapist or rehabilitationassistant\u2014works with a patient, theycan provide additional information,such as stating that a university' sresearch found that chiropractic care isthe treatment of choice for specifictypes of headaches. When patients check out, the receptionist can follow up by askingthem if they know anyone who suffers from headaches. If so, they can be asked if they would be willing to sharewith them some information abouthow chiropractic care can eliminateheadaches. On the patient' s next visit, the receptionist then asks if the informa- tion was shared and what the headache sufferer said about it. If the person is interested in learning more, thereceptionist can offer a free initialconsult. Another strategy to generate leads is a reactivation effort. Have staff send a series of letters to missing patientsthroughout the year. The next step is to follow up with a phone call toconfirm that they received the letter, see how they are doing, and reiterate the special offer (that was alsomentioned in the letter) to get them back into the office. \"This also givesstaff an opportunity to ask patientswhy they have not been in recently, \"Schwartz says. Getting staff buy-in Another suggestion, offered by Jared Yellin, is to compile a one-year educa- tional and relationship-based marketingplan. T o garner staff buy-in, have them help create it. Hold offsite meetings quarterly or so to plan for the nextthree- to 12-month period. Develop such strategies as educational workshopsinside and outside the practice, patientappreciation days, referral programs,interactive community events, andwebinars or teleseminars. Y ellin advises a three-pronged approach to building a staff that' s onfire to grow your practice with yourmarketing plan. Begin by working withstaff to create a list of leverageableleaders consisting of local people,groups, and associations that areconduits to your ideal patient. Staffshould then look at the list of leadersand determine which segment wouldmake the perfect partner for themarketing campaign that month. Next,reach out to these folks and invite them to engage in that campaign. The next task is to make your staff aware that your practice is a business. \"Even when they aren't in the office,staff should still be thinking about the practice and talking to people theyencounter about how it can serve them, \" Y ellin says. \"For example, they should invite people in the community to events you are holding so that they can be exposed to your practice,educated on how you can help them, and eventually converted into practice members who will have their lives transformed. \" The third task is for you and your staff to make declarations each month.This means setting serious goals about building the practice. \"Most people make goals and fall short, \" Y ellin says.\"Dig your feet into the ground and commit to changing lives. If yourdeclaration is to change 25 lives duringthe month of February, everyone on your team will be aware of this decla-ration and they should rally around it, \" Y ellin says. Another facet of building a committed marketing team is to getstaff to view their position as a careerand not just a job. \"Instill a sense of purpose to come to work every day, \" Y ellin says. \"Share with them why you became a chiropractor, so they canconnect with you on an emotional level. \" During an offsite meeting, have each staff member talk about their vision for their life so you know their intentions.Build a plan that will enable each personto accomplish their vision for the nextyear, as the company progresses simultaneously. Rewarding employees when they reach milestones will help to maintainbuy-in. \"I believe in a performance- based compensation structure beyondsalary, \" Y ellin says. \"This enablesindividuals to make more income and36 C H I R O P R AC T I C E CO N O M I C S f e B r u A r y 5 , 2 0 1 6 C H I R O E CO.CO Mhave more freedom in their lives. \" When staff members meet weekly goals, reward them with dinner or take everyone to a movie or sporting event. \" Always have exercises to motivate people to up their game, \"Y ellin says. \"Create a culture where they feel like they are progressing. \" Working with workshops Paul S. Inselman, DC, agrees that it' s important to get your whole team involved, because everyone has a unique perspective. One way to engage staff is by conducting a workshop. \"This gets you and your team solving problems, owning the solutions, and implementing them enthusiastically, \" Inselman says. Begin by writing a topic on a whiteboard, such as \"Who is our ideal patient?\" Then, ask everyone to silently write down bullet points addressing the topic. Next, record on the whiteboard everyone' s ideas regarding how to attract the ideal patient. While doing this exercise, emphasize that no one can be ridiculed, and no idea can be shot down. The goal is to get creativity flowing. Criticism at this juncture is counterproductive. After you've identified your target patient type, including gender, condition, ZIP code, educational status, and hobbies, pinpoint where such individuals can be found. Now evaluate what methods might attract them. For example: Free marketing\u2014such as volunteering at a school or church\u2014or paid marketing\u2014such as doing aMeettheexperts Len Schwartz, DC, owner of Market Domination Specialists, in Philadelphia. pro2pronetwork.com Jared Yellin, president of Synduit in englewood, NJ. synduit.com Paul S.

Ask staff to choose severalideas from the list, rank them in importance, and thenproceed to implement the plan. Y our staff can be marketing champions by showing enthusiasm, looking for ways to praise patients, and makingthem feel better about themselves. Have them educatepatients about the goods and services offered by yourpractice, share anonymous success stories of other patients,and ask for referrals. \"Everyone has to do what they are comfortable doing, \" Inselman says. \" As a leader, delegate tasks to employees whocan best handle them. \" For example, you can assign anextrovert with good communication skills to follow up withpotential patients after a screening rather than a shy introvert. Perform a postmortem analysis following your marketing efforts. Evaluate everything you've done, step by step, and if you were to repeat the activity, what would you change? For example: After a campaign of following up on screened patients, Inselman found that the scripting wasgood based on results, the time of day was right (peopleanswered the phone), but people weren't getting engaged inconversations. \"W e listened to tape recordings of theconversations, and determined that the caller was not strongenough to handle rejections and navigate through, \" he says. Staying on script Keith Maule, of Integrity Management, has a different approach. He believes that for staff to do marketing, theymust do it in a controlled environment. \"W e don't wantthem going out and saying whatever they want, \" he says.\"W e don't even want their ideas. W e know what works. \" For classroom presentations, Maule has staff memorize two prepared scripts. The classes clarify why people of all ages benefit from chiropractic care. But if your staff aren't eager to market your practice, it' s time to hire a marketing person, says Maule, who dubs this person a \"practice representative. \" This individual shouldintroduce him-or herself with both name and title, e.g.,\"Hello, my name is Sally Smith and I represent KeithMaule. \" This way, listeners will know they are talking tosomeone with authority. \"This works perfectly when answering the phone, teaching a class, or doing a screening, \" Maule says. A practice represen- tative should operate inside boundaries, however. They shouldnot diagnose nor recommend care. Their role is to invite the potential patient to come to the office for a consultation. Another recommendation Maule has is to avoid free marketing. \"New patients have to pay, even for a screening, \"he says. \"However, we let them know that we give back tothe community and care about the community. \" The chiro-practor and staff decide which cause to support. This may be a well-known organization or a local person in need. \" As a result, most doctors who adhere to our programs are awardedthe title of outstanding business of the year or similar by local organizationssuch as the chamber of commerce orsmall business association, \" Maule says. This gives staff pride and confidence in their work. Surveying for skills David Singer, DC, advises first asking your staff if they want to do marketing;don't force them to do it. If they respond positively, gauge their ability to market by having them survey a dozen familymembers or friends. By this, he refers to a \"stress survey\" he invented. It requires asking someone' s name and seeing if they have any stress- related symptoms such as fatigue, sleep problems, or digestive issues. Then this information is recorded on a form. \"Most staff will not complete this task, \" Singer says. \"This shows thatthey don't have the propensity or personality to confront people and getthem to discuss their health issues. \" If no one on staff is appropriate to engage in marketing, then hire a part- time chiropractic assistant who can goout into the community to meetpeople and survey them. \"The goal is to let people know that your practice exists, what you can doto help them and why they shouldcome and see you, \" Singer says. A goodplace to do this is in a mall setting. A person who works in multilevel marketing may make a great chiro-practic assistant. \"This person knowshow to make contact, talk to people,and make stuff happen, \" Singer says.\"Or, walk around the mall andapproach salespeople at kiosks. Askthem about the product they're sellingto gauge their sales capabilities. \" Before hiring an assistant, first see if he or she has the ability to survey people. \"If she can't do this, she won'tbe good at marketing, \" Singer says. \"She needs to have the ability to talk to people, as marketing involves setting up lectures in the community andgetting the practice to exhibit at healthfairs. \" When surveying, the assistantshould mention that the chiropractoroffers free health seminars and ask respondents which topics would be of interest. If enough people sign up, you're ready to call on them. Proceed cautiously by retaining someone on a part-time basis initially to work on weekends. \"That way, if they don't work out, they will still have theirfull-time job to fall back on, \" Singersays. \"Y ou should be able to tell in a week or two if they have what it takes. \" Use caution when giving bonuses, Dr. Singer warns. It is not legal in most states to compensate marketing stafffor recruiting new patients. Instead,compensate the assistant for each person surveyed. The bottom line is that there are many proven ways to engage staff in your marketing efforts. Getting staffbuy-in and choosing the right personfor the job is key. If current staff aren't a good fit for your market efforts, hirea marketing assistant. KAREN APPOLD , an editorial consultant in royersford, Pennsylvania, is dedicated to regular chiropractic care.

G0439: Annual wellness visit: includes a personalized prevention plan of service (PPS); subsequent visit. A common diagnosis for wellness examinations, preventive medicine services, IPPEs, and A WVs is Z00.00.This ICD-10 code is used for an encounter for a general adult medical examination without abnormal findings. For wellness and maintenance chiro- practic adjustments (non-Medicare), consider using HCPCS code S8990. This HCPCS code is used for a manipulative therapy performed formaintenance rather than restoration. As a reminder, the only Medicare- covered service when performed by a chiropractor is spinal manipulation(CPT codes 98940, 98941, and 98942).

Successfullybalancing your duties as a healthcare provider with your responsibilities as abusiness owner can be daunting attimes. The right insurance strategiescan go a long way toward helpingaddress both personal and businessrisks. Business defense To protect your business, consider business protection and employee practice liability insurance. Business protection needs differ based on the structure of the practice. For example: An independent contractor' s insuranceneeds will vary from that of a multi-doctor practice, and similarly with atraveling chiropractor to one with abrick-and-mortar shop. Regardless of your business model, there is a business insurance strategy that canmeet your needs. The options for business protection insurance are broad and can be tailored to best suit your specific risk. The policy may cover the business' s equipment and property, general liability such asslip-and-fall accidents, business income, non-owned auto, and even employeedishonesty. Let' s say, for example, that you asked your office manager to stop by the bank to make a deposit on his or her wayhome from work. While turning into the bank parking lot, she is involved ina rear-end collision. Several insurancepolicies and carriers will respond,including the employee' s auto insurer,your business insurer, workers' compen- sation, and the other vehicle' s insurer. Because both you and your practice are exposed to potential risk, makingsure your insurance policies are properly structured to respond to such a complex claim is vital to the continued success of your practice. Business protection insurance is necessary for practices of all sizes; however, for doctors with staffmembers, employee practice liability coverage plays an important role in risk management. Any time a business brings on more staff, the concern foryou as the owner increases. Employee practice liability protects against accusations of wrongdoing with staff,including wrongful termination orharassment claims. This type of coverage may be written as part ofyour business owners' policy or as a standalone policy. And you don't have to worry about just your employees, but also anyvendors you are using. For example: Y ou have a friendly office-supplydelivery person. Y ou have worked with this supply company for the last five JIRSAK/THINKSTOCKCover your bases use the right insurance strategy to protect your most valuable assets.

One day, one of your staff members advises you that they feel threatened and harassed by the person due to continuous unwanted advances and inappropriate jokes. Employees have a right to work in an environment freefrom such harassment. At any time, an employee can make an accusation\u2014whether justified ornot\u2014filing complaints with the EEOC or bringing a lawsuit against the employer. Even if vindicated, anemployer can incur thousands of dollars in legal fees to defend such claims. Employment Practices LiabilityInsurance protects the employer forthese types of claims, as well as fromthird parties if structured properly. To protect yourself, consider professional liability, malpractice, and disability insurance. Similar to insuring the business, holding professional liability coverage goes a long way towarddefending you from potential uncertainties\u2014and there are plenty to consider, from audits and boardcomplaints to patients allegingprofessional wrongdoing. Malpractice insurance varies greatly and should be tailored for yourpractice' s unique needs and varyingexposures. Key to knowing that yourcoverage needs are being met iscommunication with your broker. For example: Y ou have just completed laser therapy certification and plan onimplementing it in your practice. Haveyou advised your malpractice carrier?If the answer is no, you may have agap in your coverage. On a more personal note, as you think about the professional-levelprotection you can put in place, payspecial attention to disability insurance.Y our livelihood depends on yourcapacity to treat patients, and practiceis physically demanding. Should something happen that physically limits your ability to practice, yourbusiness and your livelihood are bothin jeopardy. Disability insurance can help ensure your business and protect your family in the occurrence of suchan event. To protect your patients, consider cyber liability insurance. Finally, in looking at necessary insurances for your practice, there are options to safeguard your clients' personal information as well. Most practices have transitioned tocomputer-based recordkeeping,appointment booking, general officeadministration, and many have adoptedelectronic health records. But the convenience and efficiency technology affords also puts the businessin harm' s way. Oftentimes, technologyisn't a problem until it becomes a bigproblem, and your practice must safe- guard your patients' private information. Cyber liability insurance is relatively new but goes a long way toward protecting your business and yourpatients' information from hackers. When designing your practice' s insurance strategy, assess all areas of potential concern. Proper insurance coverage can make the difference in your business and as a healthcare provider.

It' s a practice where you can use all your skill and knowledge to solve difficult clinical problems thatother doctors have failed to correct.And one where your patients are truly grateful for the efforts you make ontheir behalf. Interested? It gets better because much of the income from this practice is generatedby physician extenders who can perform their work even if you aren't present atthe office. What' s more, your averagepatient will spend perhaps five to 10times what a typical family practice orchiropractic patient spends in youroffice now. If you create a Functional Medicine (FM) specialty practice, you will reapall of the benefits mentioned aboveand more. If you are ready to get rid ofyour billing staff and software, alongwith your accounts receivable reviews,read on. What exactly is FM? There isn't one commonly accepted definition amongpractitioners, but what you will findare multiple descriptions of how FM doctors view health and disease andhow they treat it. FM sees disease as a problem that involves the whole body, and treatmentis aimed at correcting any imbalancesand problems that exist\u2014not justattacking the specific symptoms of the patient' s chief complaint. Thus, apatient with fibromyalgia may requirean endocrine workup and allergytesting in addition to trigger-pointinjections. Common conditions FM views most medical problems asbeing strongly correlated to inflam-mation. Doctors who practice in thisspecialty believe that if chronicinflammation is not treated, the patientwill never be truly healthy. Traditionalallopathic physicians agree that chronicinflammation is deadly, directly causing autoimmune disease, heart disease,stroke, and many other conditions.Where they differ is on the emphasisthey place on treating chronic inflam-mation and the methods they employ. Another cornerstone of FM is the concept of a disordered immune systemcausing or contributing to poor health. This could be due to an overactiveimmune system (which itself can lead to chronic inflammation) as seen inconditions such as autoimmunethyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, or anunderactive immune system as seen in many cancers and chronic infections.There are markers of chronic andacute inflammation that can be tested, such as C-reactive protein. Treatment aims at correcting such imbalances. FM also focuses on the endocrine The big picture Strategies for adding Functional Medicine to your practice. BY MARC SENCER, MD DAJ/THINKSTOCK56 C H I R O P R AC T I C E CO N O M I C S f e B r u A r y 5 , 2 0 1 6 C H I R O E CO.CO MCHIRO BIzQuIz system. Most important are the male and female sex hormones testosteroneand estrogen, DHEA, progesterone,thyroid hormones, and adrenalhormones. The levels of these differenthormones may be too high or too low. Correcting hormonal imbalances can be complicated as they can havemultiple effects on one another. Simplyput, it is not always enough to correcta deficiency in one hormone withoutmaking changes to several others. In FM it is always important to balance hormones using bioidenticalhormones rather than standardcommercial preparations like synthroid;these bioidentical hormones areprepared by a compounding pharma-cist and are tailored to each patient. Lastly, many doctors of functional medicine subscribe to the \"leaky gut\"hypothesis of illness. The idea is that for any number of reasons (e.g.,autoimmune disorder, infection, ortrauma) the permeability of thegastrointestinal (GI) wall becomesaltered, allowing small amounts oftoxic material to leak into generalcirculation, where it can travel andaffect all the organs of the body. Food allergies such as gluten intolerance are suggestive of thissyndrome. Diagnosis may involvetesting the stool. Treatment is aimed atreducing toxins in the GI tract andtreating the causes of increased membrane permeability. Getting started with FM FM is a demonstrably complex field.The first thing you need to do is learnthe clinical basics of FM. Fortunately,there are several courses available thatcan get you up to speed. Moreover, a practice management consultant knowledgeable in this areacan be a priceless resource in settingup the practice, monitoring itsperformance, and dealing with theday-to-day issues that arise. Aconsultant can also help with essentialissues such as determining whetheryou have enough space, where you will treat these patients, and how you will schedule them. Y ou won't be able, for example, to do IV vitamin therapy if you don't have enough space. Adding FM to an existing chiro- practic practice will generally add little to your overhead, but you should still analyze what getting set up will entailand formulate a business plan. Y ou must also decide who will be performing therapies and directly interacting with patients, and what their roles will be. Will you need to have a medical doctor on board? While it is true that you can perform many FM procedures, anFM practice usually works better from a patient-satisfaction standpoint if youhave an MD involved. Also, there are some highly profitable proceduresthat can only be done with an MDordering or performing the therapy,such as IV nutritional therapy andchelation. There is a definite tie-in between FM, anti-aging medicine, and aesthetics, and you may want to branch out intothese fields some day. T o perform these modalities, some level of MD supervision is necessary. For thesereasons, it' s generally best to offer FM through an integrated practice model. FM billing basics Naturally, you will have to set prices for your services. Try to find out whatthe competition (if you have any) isdoing. Some patients will want \u00e0 lacarte, pay-as-you-go pricing, but it isrecommend to use discounted pay-in-advance pricing whenever possible. For example: Y ou can get patients to pay in advance for implantabletestosterone pellets for four months to a year, where you package in tests anddoctor visits. Obviously this doeswonders for your cash flow and isgood for patient compliance. Even though insurance will not be a factor with your FM practice, youshould still keep proper records anddocument just as you would if you had a third-party payer looking over your shoulder. Y ou can still be sued and are subject to the same board discipline ifyou break any of their rules. Good documentation is your best defense. Functional Medicine allows you to use your skills as a physician creatively and serve patients who have not beenhelped by traditional medicine. At the same time, it provides you with a lucrative practice that rewards you foryour help and avoids the headaches of third-party reimbursement. MARC H.

Testyourself t est your knowledge of a functional Medicine (fM) practice with this true and false quiz. 1. in an fM practice, there is no need for billing staff or follow-up collections. 2. An fM approach to a patient with low-back pain would not include a hormone workup. 3. immune deficiency or dysfunction may be the cause of some cancers. 4. An \u00e0 la carte fee schedule can maximize your profit and cash flow. Answers:Nos.1and3aretrue.Nos.2 and4arefalse. An fM approach to illness assumes that if imbalances of the endocrine system and all the functional systems of the body arenot corrected, the patient will not have an optimal result. An \u00e0 la carte fee schedule is not as likely tomaximize profit and cash flow as well as a pay-in-advance plan will. even though you may offer a discount, this is offset by guaranteed compliance.58 C H I R O P R AC T I C E CO N O M I C S f e B r u A r y 5 , 2 0 1 6 C H I R O E CO.CO MYES,YOU WANT A PRACTICE ,BUT YOU'RE GOING TO END UP running a small business. Calling it a practice rather than a business, and calling those you help patients rather than customers can obscure the fact that it' s a business first and a practice second. Far too many chiropractors are of the mind that the business of chiro-practic is somehow distasteful oruninteresting. That' s too bad, becausethese chiropractors could be helpingmore people if they were willing toembrace the business aspects ofprofessional practice. Instead, chiro-practors with amazing adjusting skillscan find themselves in an under-performing practice. Newly minted chiropractors rarely fail because of their clinical skills. Rather, iftheir practices go bust it' s almost alwaysdue to some oversight or shortcoming in running their small businesses. A practice encompasses all the clinical elements of caring for a patient: The consultation, the examination, theadjusting\u2014the things you love doing.The business part is doing all of theabove at a profit while also taking careof the marketing, banking, taxes,hiring, and staff training. Falling in love Become a student again and learn thefundamentals. Pick up a copy of Fast Company magazine. Pick up just about any book written by marketing savantSeth Godin.When you fall in love with the business of chiropractic you'll be able to help more people. Don't forget thatthe chiropractic legends who becamemillionaires did so at a time when adjustments cost less than 5 dollars. First-hand experience Back in the day, I consulted with a chiropractor who owned and operatedseven associate-run clinics. Initially, we focused on improving his daily live call-in TV talk show about chiropractic.Many of the chiropractic purists in town were jealous of his domination of theairwaves and his particular style of chiropractic. By mastering the business aspect of chiropractic and actively marketing hisservices, however, he not only filled his seven clinics but also created a liveli- hood for his practitioners and supportteam of almost 50 people. When chiropractors struggle When I consult with chiropractors who are feeling stuck, the problem rarelyinvolves their clinical skills. Often, infact, they report delighted patients,steady referrals, and even a goodnumber of customers who stay beyondsymptomatic relief and pay cash forwellness visits. Rather, the problem is almost always some aspect of the business of chiro- practic that' s standing in the way ofreal success. And this is a shame because the marketing advice, human resourcesadvice, cash flow planning, mental outlook, and all the rest are readily available and largely for free. All you need is a willingness to learn. Few struggling chiropractors wake up one morning with an excited,\"Eureka\u2014I need to work on mybusiness!\" epiphany. More often, theyimagine that some new service, technique, or gadget holds the key to the professional income they seek. Build it and they will come If you're still clinging to the belief that delivering great clinical results is all that' s needed to have a profitable enterprise, snap out of it. The key is to tell as many strangers as possible about how the body works,how it heals, and why lifetime chiro-practic care makes sense. There are many ways to do that. Some involve spending money (a highly ranked website) or emotional effort (public speaking). But you must get out of your office and into action. Marketyour business, because if it fails, so will your practice. WILLIAM ESTEB is the creative director of Patient Media, a patient communication resource for chiropractors.
