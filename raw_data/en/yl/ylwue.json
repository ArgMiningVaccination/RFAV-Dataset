The art of curing the disease; not masking your symptoms Homeopathy is a safe, gentle and natural framework of healing that performs in tune with your body.

All remedies are made from natural sources (eg: plants and minerals) and are FDA regulated. Homeopathy is environmentally and cruelty free and completely safe for everyone to use including babies, the elderly, pregnant and nursing women. Wonders of Homeopathy The Law of Similars (the basis of homeopathy) has been well documented since the time of Hippocrates in 400B.C. Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1845) a German doctor and Chemist was the founder of homeopathy. He discovered the truth to the law of Similar by testing small doses of medicine on himself. The World health Organisation has documented around 500 million people worldwide as practicing homeopathy. It is a wonderful way to support well being and heal the body. HEAL YOURSELF The concept of homeopathy is to help the body to heal itself, by choosing remedies that support the symptoms rather than opposing or suppressing as in more conventional medicine. With current homeopathy there are no side effects and a person can be restored to health naturally. PERSONALIZED REMEDIES Homeopathic remedies are tailored to the individual and their exact symptoms. The effectiveness of a remedy depends upon how accurately it matches the illness totality. The homeopath must be systematic and accurate.
