Feeling a bit of a dip in your energy, or is your fitness routine feeling lacklustre?

Bloodstone Bloodstone, or heliotrope, is a dark-green jasper stone flecked with red, which resembles blood. It's been used since ancient times for protection and to stimulate energy. \"Bloodstone is a powerful healing stone that promotes motivation, courage and confidence,\" says Chan. \"It was often carried in armour by ancient warriors who went off in battle.\" If it's good enough for warriors, it can probably get you through a session in the gym.
