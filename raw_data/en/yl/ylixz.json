CALENDAR SUBJECT TO CHANGE. 6 WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE GENERAL INFORMATION The Campus Wayne Community College's 175 acre main campus is located in Goldsboro, NC at 3000 Wayne Memorial Drive. Eleven modern buildings contain more than 360,000 square feet of state-of-the art classrooms, laboratories, offices, and a model childcare center. An aviation classroom and hanger are located at the Wayne Executive Jetport. In addition, curriculum and continuing education courses are offered at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base and various locations throughout Wayne County. The History A member of North Carolina's system of 58 community and technical colleges, Wayne Community College was established as Goldsboro Industrial Education Center on June 15, 1957. The original on-campus building was completed in November 1960, and until fall 1962 all courses were taught in the evening, and all students were part time. In the 1962-63 school year, the first full-time courses were offered leading to diplomas in automotive mechanics, electronics, drafting, and practical nursing. During the 1962-63 school year, Goldsboro I.E.C. had 47 students enrolled with eight faculty members; 1963 through 1965 three extension units of Goldsboro I.E.C. were established in Morehead City, Kenansville, and Clinton; later to become Carteret, James Sprunt, and Sampson community colleges. In January 1964, Goldsboro I.E.C. became Wayne Technical Institute. By fall 1966, the enrollment had increased to approximately 550 curriculum students and more than 1,500 extension students. During the late sixties, several additional classroom buildings were added to the campus. In November 1967, a community vote approved the necessary financial support, and Wayne Technical Institute became Wayne Community College. By the fall of 1968, the enrollment had risen to nearly 700 curriculum students. The student population's rapid growth overwhelmed the facilities. In January 1974, the Board of Trustees commissioned a master plan for campus relocation to Wayne Memorial Drive. The first building on the new campus, constructed in 1978, housed auto-diesel technology, welding, watchmaking, drafting and electronics programs. A local bond referendum in 1986 provided $9.9 million in construction funds, which were matched by state funds during the years to follow. By the fall of 1992, five buildings were completed. A 1993 statewide bond referendum provided the $6.3 million necessary to add two more buildings on campus and an aviation building at the local airport. All were in use by the winter of 1996. Enrollment and program offerings continued to grow, and so has the campus. In the fall of 2000, voters overwhelmingly approved a statewide Higher Education Bond that provided Wayne Community College nearly $13 million for construction, renovation and repair. Three buildings were built and several functional areas were reconfigured and renovated, with the last of the new facilities opening in spring 2007. Through the decades, Wayne Community College has established a reputation for quality in certificate, diploma, and associate degree programs which prepare students for promising careers. The College also takes pride in its Associate in Arts and Associate in Science college transfer programs and its graduates who have a high success rate at four-year institutions. Use of technology in the classroom, modern computer labs, and options for Saturday, evening, and distance learning courses have made instruction at Wayne Community College more effective and convenient for students. As the instruction options have increased, so has Wayne Community College's enrollment, which now stands at more than 15,000 curriculum and non-credit students. Wayne Community College will strive to maintain its long-standing reputation for quality training and education of our community's citizens.Wayne Community College was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges in 1970, and was reaffirmed in 1974, 1986, 1995, and 2006. The Community Located in the east-west corridor between Raleigh to the west and the Outer Banks coastal region to the east, Wayne County is one of the leading agricultural areas of the coastal plains of North Carolina. The City of Goldsboro, the county seat, is the center of population, serving a major economic function as the trade and service center for Wayne County. The population of Goldsboro and Wayne County is more than 123,000. Wayne County, formed in 1770, was named for the great Continental Army General, Anthony Wayne. Almost a century later, in 1865, the last battle of the American Civil War was fought at Bentonville, 18 miles west of Goldsboro. Since the mid-1960s, industrial growth led Wayne County to a more balanced industrial-agricultural economy. Agriculture continues to be the major source of income for Wayne County residents. Principal crops include tobacco, corn, cotton, grains, and soybeans. Livestock and poultry are major sources of income for Wayne County farmers. Numerous manufacturing companies are located throughout the area. Manufacturing is diversified in Wayne County, including cabinets, metal fabricating, electrical components, transformers, replacement automotive parts, aviation-related cargo systems, mass transit power systems, packaging, and food stuffs such as tortillas, bread, pickles, and pork products. Five local newspapers, four radio stations, and a modern 316-bed hospital serve Wayne County. There are more than 170 churches which represent various religious faiths. Varied recreational facilities include swimming pools, parks, public and private golf courses, a Family YMCA and a state park. The county is home to several historic sites, museums, and arts and cultural organizations. Numerous festivals provide year-round activities and entertainment. Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, one of the most important and modern bases in the United States, is located at Goldsboro. It is the home of the Air Combat Command's 4th Fighter Wing, the 916th Air Refueling Wing, an Air Force Reserve Command Unit, and several other squadrons and detachments.

In 1998, the General Assembly directed the State Board to review past performance measures and define standards to ensure programs and services offered by community colleges in North Carolina were of sufficient quality. The State Board of Community Colleges and the General Assembly approved twelve performance measures for accountability in 1999. Later in 2007, the General Assembly approved the reduction of performance measures to eight. In 2010, President Scott Ralls established a Performance Measures Committee to develop new performance-based student success measures to go into effect in 2013. In November 2011, the State Board formally approved the Performance Measures. These measures were then submitted to the General Assembly in March 2012 and later adopted in June 2012 through Section 8.5 of S.L. 2012-142. As the revised performance measures were being finalized, attention was turned to developing recommendations for incorporating performance into colleges' regular formula budget allocations. In May 2012, President Ralls appointed a team of college presidents to a Performance Funding Committee to develop a performance funding model. One of the outcomes of this committee was the establishment of system-wide \"baselines\" and \"goals\" for each measure. The committee recommended using consistent, statistically-defined baselines and goals to promote transparency, simplicity, and objectivity. This utilization of baselines and goals is a departure from the System's historical use of \"standards.\" Based on three years of historical data for each measure, baselines were set two standard deviations below the system mean, and the goals were set one standard deviation above the system mean. These baselines and goals remain static for three years and will be reset in the 2016 report. This 2015 edition is the second report utilizing the new measures, goals, and baselines. Each performance measure begins with a purpose and description, goal and baseline, and the College's performance for that measure. Additional information on the eight performance measures is available from the Wayne Community College Office of Planning and Research. 1. Basic Skills Student Progress. To ensure adults with low literacy skills are progressing academically toward basic skill attainment necessary for employment and self-sufficiency.

WCC awards federal and state grants, scholarships, and federal work-study.

All students who have completed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) are considered for all types of financial assistance without regard to the student's race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, or disability. Applying for Financial Aid 1. Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) online at www.fafsa.gov. Students can apply beginning January 1st. All students must re-apply for financial aid every year. 2. After the student applies he/she will receive a Student Aid Report (SAR). The SAR contains the information reported on the FAFSA including the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The EFC is used to determine eligibility for federal student aid. The Financial Aid Office uses this information to award federal financial aid. Dependency Status A student will need to determine whose information to report on the FAFSA. An independent student will report income and asset information for self and spouse. A dependent student will report income and asset information for self and parents. Not living with parents or not being claimed by them on tax forms does not determine dependency status for federal student aid.

To ensure prompt processing of the financial aid application, students must complete the FAFSA early and turn in all requested paperwork to the WCC Financial Aid Office by the stated priority deadline for each semester. Financial Aid Available Federal Pell Grant - A Federal Pell Grant normally does not have to be repaid. Federal Pell Grants are considered the foundation of federal student financial aid.

A student may not receive Federal Pell Grant funds at more than one school at a time.

On average, students work approximately 10-15 hours per week and may earn up to $3,000 per year. If a student is interested in the federal work-study program, they should indicate this interest when completing the FAFSA. A student should consider whether his or her academic responsibilities will permit him or her to assume the obligations of part-time employment. Vocational Rehabilitation - Many states offer educational assistance to students who have a significant disability. A North Carolina student should contact the Vocational Rehabilitation Division of the Department of Health and Human Services, Raleigh, NC, or in the student's local community.

Students With Disabilities Wayne Community College is committed to seeing that students with disabilities have equal access to all programs of study. In accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, students will receive reasonable accommodations to assure equal access to all services, programs and activities. Students with disabilities should contact the Disability Services Counselor in Counseling Services and present documentation of the disability. Students needing accommodations should make arrangements with the Disability Services Counselor as soon as the need becomes known in order to provide ample time for arrangements to be made. Call (919) 739-6729 or TTY (919) 583-8544. Wayne Community College has adopted an internal grievance procedure providing for prompt and equitable resolution of complaints that arise from any action prohibited by the Americans with Disabilities Act. Students with complaints should contact the Disability Service Counselor. Academic Regulations Semester System Wayne Community College operates on the semester system. The Fall and Spring Semesters are each sixteen weeks in length, and the Summer Semester is approximately 10 weeks in length. Classes normally meet hourly for fifty minutes with a ten-minute break between classes. The amount of time that a class meets each week is determined by the number of semester hours credit and the lab or clinic hours required by a course. Semester hours credit is awarded as follows: one semester credit hour for each 16 hours of class lecture, one semester credit hour for each 32 hours of laboratory work, one semester credit hour for each 48 hours of clinical, and one semester credit hour for each 160 hours of work experience. Registration All students are required to register at the beginning of each semester of attendance. No credit can be granted for courses in which the student is not properly registered. Students attending class for which they are not officially registered will receive neither grade nor semester hour credit for the course. Classes missed due to late registration will be counted as absences. Registration instructions are published prior to each registration period. Change of Schedule The last day that courses may be added each semester is stated on the College calendar. Any student wishing to drop a course must complete the drop procedure on or before the 51st day of the semester or the 29th day for the SUMMER SEMESTER. For eight week courses, WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 17 refer to the appropriate semester Registration Information or contact the Office of Admissions and Records. If additional tuition and fees are owed, all schedule changes must be officially processed the Business Office. Student Course Load A typical full-time student course load is 15-17 semester hours. A student must register for 12 semester hours Fall and Spring Semester, and 9 semester hours Summer Semester to be considered a full-time student. The maximum course load is 20 semester hours. The permission of the advisor must be obtained in those cases where more than 20 semester hours are scheduled, unless specified by the curriculum. It is strongly recommended that full-time students who have part- time employment not work more than 10-15 hours per week. Students who are working more than 20 hours per week should consider attending the College on a part-time basis. Classification A student is classified as a freshman from initial enrollment until 32 semester hours credit have been earned. Students who have earned 32 semester hours or more are classified as sophomores. Student Attendance Policy Wayne Community College expects students to gain skills, competencies and an awareness of a workplace ethic which emphasizes responsibility and commitment. The College believes that when students attend class regularly they are demonstrating responsibility and commitment to their education. Students must attend 80 percent of the total class hours to receive a passing grade. Students must attend the class during the first 10 percent of the class to be considered enrolled in the class. Pre-curriculum students must attend 90 percent of the total class hours and must attend during the first 10 percent of the class. Instructors will not excuse absences under this policy. Absences due to late registration are counted as regular absences. If a student is in excellent academic standing, instructors may adjust the attendance procedures. Instructors expect students to make up missed work, but students cannot make up absences. If a student drops, withdraws, or stops attending a class, he or she will receive a grade of \"OW\", \"W\",\"WP\", or \"WF\". Programs in Allied Health, Aviation, BLET, Cosmetology, High School Dual Enrollment, and courses leading to credentials have stricter attendance procedures than that stated here. Each department has the right to set a reasonable policy regarding tardiness to class with the approval of the Vice President of Academic and Student Services. Students may completely withdraw from the College at any time prior to exams and all grades will become \"OW\"'s. Students withdrawing from the College should contact the Office of Admissions and Records for the appropriate forms and procedure for official withdrawal. Excused Absence Procedure Wayne Community College students are allowed two (2) excused class days per academic year for religious observances required by the faith of the student. For the purposes of this procedure, an academic year begins on the first day of fall term classes and ends on the last day of spring term classes each year. Student shall be given the opportunity to make up any tests or other work missed due to an excused absence. 1. Students requesting absence from class must complete a Request for Excused Absence Form. 2. Have it signed by the Instructor(s). 3. Submit it to the Admissions and Records Office for approval within the first seven school days of the term. Failure to submit the completed form by the deadline will result in the request being denied. The Admissions and Records Office will provide the student with a copy of the approved/denied form. Students should keep the copy for their records. Closure of the College Due to Adverse Weather and Other Conditions When inclement weather threatens, the President of the College or her designee will make any necessary decisions to cancel classes, delay classes, or totally close the College and all its operations. The decision will be announced on the WayneCC Alert system (text, e-mail, phone, website) and on area radio and television stations. Every attempt will be made to have the announcement published by 6:00 a.m. on the day of the closing or delay. If the College is already operating when inclement weather forces such a decision, WayneCC Alerts will be used, as well as other campus communications and public media, to announce the decision. Decisions regarding closings and delays will be made on a day- to-day basis, taking into consideration local conditions, as well as weather forecasts. Often, decisions about evening classes are made independently. In those cases, every attempt is made to announce decisions by 3:30 p.m. If the main campus is closed, all on-campus and off-campus activities are canceled. If classes are delayed, the announcement will state the time the College will open. In times of inclement weather, radio and television stations will normally only make announcements about delays or cancellations. Therefore, the absence of an announcement means that the College is operating on an normal schedule. The fastest, most reliable means for getting these announcements is via the WayneCC Alerts. Course content missed due to the College closing will be made up through outside assignments or rescheduled classes and will be communicated to students electronically or when classes resume. Make-up assignments must be equivalent to the material that would have been covered during the missed class(es) and must be approved by the appropriate instructional supervisor. For classes where contact hours are critical (such as BLET, nursing clinical, etc.), make-up classes will be scheduled. Class make-up plans must be documented on the Inclement Weather Make-up Plan Form and turned in to the Office of Admissions and Records with a copy attached to the final class roster, which is retained in the departmental offices. Grading System and Grade Point Average The 4.00 grade point system is used to calculate student grade point average. The letter grades used are as follows: A - Outstanding-4 grade points per semester hour. AH - Outstanding-4 grade points per semester hour. (Honors) B - Above average-3 grade points per semester hour. BH - Above average-3 grade points per semester hour. (Honors) C - Average-2 grade points per semester hour. D - Poor-1 grade point per semester hour. F - Failing-no grade points earned. I - Incomplete-no grade or grade points because of incomplete work. An \"I\" will be removed from the transcript when departmental requirements as listed within the contract are completed. Any grade of \"I\" will be changed to \"F\" if not removed by the maximum time limit of two semesters. P - Passing.18 WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AU - Audit-no grade or grade points. * X - Credit by examination * OW - Denotes official withdrawal from all courses during the school term. \"OW\" indicates that the student will receive no grade and no credit for all courses. The student must officially withdraw from all courses prior to the start of the exam period to receive an \"OW\". * R - Reenroll * W - Denotes withdrawal from the course during the school term prior to the last day to withdraw. \"W\" indicates that the student will receive no grade and no credit for the course. * WP - Withdrawal passing - Withdrawal (passing) before the end of the withdrawal period (effective Fall Semester 2010) - no grade or grade points. WF - Withdrawal failing - withdrawal (failing) after the end of the withdrawal period. (effective Fall Semester 2010) Prior to Fall Semester 2010 - unofficial withdrawal after the end of the withdrawal period - no grade or grade points. \"WF\" is calculated in GPA as an \"F\". * NA - Never attended - no grade or grade points * ND - Academic Forgiveness for \"D\" * NF - Academic Forgiveness for \"F\" * NG - No grade * NWF- Academic Forgiveness for \"WF\". * Not included in computing grade point average. The grade point average is calculated by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of semester hours attempted, including both courses passed and failed. Effective Fall Semester 2002, when a course is taken more than once, only the highest grade will be included in calculating the GPA. Prior to Fall Semester 2002, all grades were included in calculating the GPA. All courses attempted will be shown on the official transcript. A \"C\" average in the major is required for graduation. A \"C\" average on the 4.0 grade point system is a 2.0 grade point average. Grade Reports Final semester grades are posted on WebAdvisor as soon as they are processed at the end of each semester. Grade Appeal Process A student has the right to appeal a course grade when he/she believes that his/her performance in a course has been incorrectly evaluated by the instructor. Any such appeal should be initiated no later than two business weeks following the completion of the course. The first level of appeal, in all cases, should be to the instructor involved. Only if the issue cannot be resolved between the instructor and student should further appeals be made. In that case, a student should make his/her appeal in writing to the appropriate Department Chair and should clearly set forth the basis for the student's belief that the evaluation is incorrect. The Department Chair will work with the instructor and, where appropriate, with the Division Chair to review the student's appeal. The Department Chair, with the Division Chair's input, will make a response to the student within one business week of the date of appeal. If the student is not satisfied with the Department and Division Chairs' decision, the student has the right to appeal that decision in writing for review by the Vice President of Academic and Student Services. The Vice President may communicate with the student, instructor, Department Chair and appropriate Division Chair, in order to understand the basis for appeal. If deemed necessary, the Vice President may appoint a peer review committee of curriculum faculty to act in an advisory capacity. At the completion of this review and within one business week of the student's appeal (to the Vice President), the Vice President for Academic and Student Services will make a decision and convey that decision to the student, instructor, Department Chair, and Division Chair involved. The decision of the Vice President for Academic and Student Services is final. Academic Progress Academic Early Alert - When student performance is deemed unsatisfactory by the instructor prior to midterm (by the fourth week), that instructor may issue an early alert. The intent of the early alert is to notify students of poor academic performance and to jointly develop a plan of action for improvement. Early alert decisions may be made based on attendance, class work, homework, test grades, etc. Academic Progress for Financial Aid Purposes - For students receiving financial aid, academic records are reviewed at the end of each semester. A student is expected to maintain the required cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 in order to receive and/or maintain eligibility for financial aid. A student must pass a minimum of 67 percent of all credit hours attempted at the end of each semester and may not exceed the 150 percent maximum time frame required to complete the eligible degree, diploma or certificate program. A student receiving financial assistance may be granted a one semester or term warning period in order to make and/or maintain satisfactory progress. During the warning period, the student may continue to receive financial aid based on eligibility. If, at the end of the warning period, the student re-establishes satisfactory progress for financial aid purposes, then the warning status is lifted and the student is making satisfactory progress. A student who fails to meet satisfactory requirements following the one warning semester may be ineligible for financial aid at WCC. A student whose financial aid has been suspended may attend the following semester(s) or terms without the benefit of financial aid in order to make up the grade point average (GPA) and/or hours deficiencies. Appeal for Financial Aid Purposes - Federal regulations requires schools to monitor academic progress for financial aid purposes. For students receiving financial aid, academic records are reviewed at the end of each semester. Academic progress is measured in three areas. A student is expected to maintain the required cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 at the end of each semester. A student must have a minimum 67 percent pass rate, including grades of \"OW\", \"W\", \"WP\", \"WF\", \"I\", \"F\", \"AU\", and \"X\" at the end of each semester. In addition, a student may not exceed the 150 percent maximum time frame of their published program (major) for financial aid eligibility. It is the student's responsibility to stay informed of the College's Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) standards for financial aid and to monitor his or her own progress. NOTE: An approved appeal will be based on the student's academic history, explanation of the mitigating circumstances, the strength of supporting documentation, the plan of improvement, and whether or not the minimum requirements of a cumulative 67% completion rate and cumulative 2.0 GPA can be achieved within two (2) semesters. Tips for Achieving and Maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress 1. Do not take on more classes than you can handle. The classes in which you are registered on the first day of classes are your attempted hours. Any withdrawals from this point on count as hours attempted but not completed. WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 19 2. Follow your curriculum carefully. Taking classes outside of your major will count against your maximum time frame to complete your degree program. 3. Be cautious about changing majors. The time frame to complete your program is cumulative and may not start over with a new program. 4. Be aware that any pre-requisites you have taken prior to being accepted into a new program will count towards the maximum time frame to complete the program enrolled in. 5. Be aware that classes that are dropped after the \"last day to drop\" will count as both an \"F\" and as hours attempted but not completed. Appeal for Financial Aid Purposes - A student who has become ineligible for financial aid has the right to appeal. The appeal must be submitted in writing along with supporting documentation to the Financial Aid Appeals Committee. An appeal may be considered based on circumstances involving but not limited to an extended illness or hospitalization of the student, an accident that incapacitates the student for an extended period of time, or death or extended illness of an immediate family member resulting in significant responsibilities for the student. A student cannot appeal a term that has been approved previously. Submission of an appeal does not guarantee approval. The student will be notified in writing of the committee's decision regarding approval or denial of the appeal. During the time in which the appeal is being reviewed, the student is responsible for all semester tuition expenses.A student whose appeal is approved may continue to receive financial aid for the term. The student is notified in writing of the probationary status. At the end of the term in which the student is on probation, he or she is expected to be making satisfactory progress or be successfully following an academic plan designed to make sure the student will be able to meet satisfactory standards by a specific term or period of enrollment. If a student fails to meet the conditions of the probationary period, all federal and state financial aid (grants, scholarships, loans, and work-study) will be terminated. A student whose aid has been terminated may continue enrollment at the College without the benefit of federal or state financial aid. Grade Forgiveness Policy Students may submit a written request to the Vice President of Academic and Student Services to have grades earned at Wayne Community College, which are at least five years old, forgiven. Under this procedure, the student may request that previous grades of \"D\", \"WF\", or \"F\" not be used in calculating the grade point average. A record of all past work will remain in the student's permanent file; however, the course grades that are forgiven will be prefixed with an \"N\", and the grade and credit hours will not be calculated in the student's grade point average. To be eligible for grade forgiveness, students must be currently enrolled and have completed a minimum of 12 semester hours of required courses in the chosen program of study within the past year, while maintaining an overall grade-point average of 2.0 or above, with no grade lower than a \"C\". The written request must include the following information: 1. The course grades for which forgiven is being requested 2. The reason(s) the request is being made 3. Name, address, and student identification number of the person making the request 4. Copy of the current student transcript If the request for grade forgiveness is approved by the Vice President, a new transcript will be mailed to the student by the Director of Admissions and Records. If the student transfers to another institution, the grade forgiveness will be voided, and his/her transcript will list all records of courses, including those that were excluded by grade forgiveness. Recipients of federal financial aid or veteran's benefits are not eligible for this forgiveness policy under federal guidelines and regulations. The student should contact the Financial Aid Office or the Office of Veterans Affairs for information. Credit by Examination Credit by examination may be allowed for a given course if a regularly enrolled student can demonstrate the required level of proficiency (\"C\" or better) as a result of independent study and experience. This credit will be based on a departmental examination under the direction of the department chair in which the course is offered. Credit hours will count toward graduation; they will not be computed in grade point average as grades and grade points will not be recorded. Application for credit by examination must be processed in the Office of Admissions and Records. Course tuition at the current in-state or out-of-state rate must be paid except in case of full-time students taking 16 or more hours for whom there would be no additional charge. Exams may be scheduled at the discretion of the Department Chair involved. Credit by exam excludes a student from Academic honors such as the President's List or Dean's List. Change of Program Students wishing to change their program of study should contact Counseling Services. To change programs, students must be currently enrolled (excluding summer), and students can make only one change per semester. The program change will become effective the next semester the student is enrolled. Auditing Policy Classes may be audited with permission of the instructor if space is available. Priority will be given to regular credit students. Participation in class discussions and examinations is at the option of the instructor. Attendance is required as if the course is taken for credit. No credit by examination can be allowed for courses that have been audited. A grade of \"AU\" will be recorded with no hours credit or grade points. Course tuition at the current in-state or out-of-state rate must be paid except in case of full-time students taking 16 or more hours who may audit with no additional charge. Graduation Requirements The following requirements apply to all programs; however, some departments may have additional requirements. 1. All required and elective courses must be completed as prescribed in the catalog of record of the candidate for graduation. 2. A major 2.0 grade point average must be maintained. 3. Minimum reading requirements must be completed for each program. A minimum of DRE 097/RED 080 or equivalent is required for certificate and diploma programs. DRE 098/ RED 090 or equivalent is required for all degree programs. 4. All financial obligations to the College must be cleared. 5. A minimum of 25 percent of semester hours, with a minimum of nine semester hours in the major area, must be earned at Wayne Community College.20 WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 6. Completed applications for graduation must be received by the posted deadline. NOTE: The application cannot be processed during registration periods. Request for duplicate diplomas should be made to the Office of Admissions and Records. Applicants for graduation who are walking must purchase their caps and gowns. Back-dated diplomas will be prepared at a cost of $20.00. Two weeks should be allowed for processing. Upon recommendation of the Department Chair and approval of the Vice President of Academic and Student Services, specific graduation requirements may be waived. Students graduating from diploma or associate degree programs with a 3.5 cumulative grade point average will graduate with Honors. Grade point averages will not be rounded. For more information, contact the Office of Admissions and Records Withdrawals Students withdrawing from the College should contact the Office of Admissions and Records for the appropriate forms and procedures for official withdrawal. A student who fails to officially withdraw will receive a \"WF\" or \"WP\" in each course for which he or she was registered unless the unexcused absence policy is exceeded prior to the last day of the withdrawal period. Students' Rights and Privacy Wayne Community College supports the rights and privacies afforded each student by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and is in compliance with its provisions. The statute governs access to records maintained by certain educational institutions and the release of such records. In brief, the statute provides to students: the right to inspect and review his/her education records within 45 days after receipt of the request for access. the right to request the amendment of education records that the student believes is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of his/her privacy rights under FERPA the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures to comply with requirements of the right to provide written consent before the school releases personally identifiable information from student's education records with the exception of: A. directory information (directory information is defined as the student's name, major field of study, full-time/part-time enrollment, dates of attendance, and degrees and awards received.) Note: Any student who does not wish the College to release any or all information designated as directory information without the student's written consent must notify the Office of Admissions and Records (Wayne Learning Center, Room 109) immediately. Requests for non-disclosure must be filed annually. The College assumes that the student's failure to file a request for non-disclosure indicates approval for disclosure B. school officials, including teachers within the educational institution or local educational agency who have been determined to have legitimate educational interests; C. officials of other schools or school systems in which the student seeks or intends to enroll, upon condition that the student be notified of the transfer, receive a copy of the record if record is desired, and have an opportunity to challenge the content of the record; D. authorized representatives of U. S. Comptroller General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or State and local educational authorities; E. in connection with a student's application for, or receipt of, financial aid; F. state and local officials or authorities to which such information is specifically allowed to be reported or disclosed by a state statute that concerns the juvenile justice system and the system's ability to effectively serve, prior to adjudication, the student whose records were released; G. organizations conducting studies for, or on behalf of, educational agencies or institutions for the purpose of developing, validating, or administering predictive tests, administering student aid programs, and improving instruction, if such studies are conducted in such a manner as will not permit the personal identification of students and their parents by persons other than representatives of such organizations and such information will be destroyed when no longer needed for the purpose for which it is conducted; H. accrediting organizations in order to carry out their accrediting functions; I. parents of an eligible student if the student is a dependent for IRS tax purposes; J. in compliance with judicial order, or pursuant to any lawfully issued subpoena, upon condition that students are notified of all such orders or subpoenas in advance of the compliance therewith by the educational institution. K. appropriate officials in connection with a health or safety emergency; L. information designated as \"directory information\" Student records, academic transcripts of the College, post- secondary transcripts, high school transcripts, and other documents maintained as part of the student's permanent file are maintained in the Office of Admissions and Records. Any student wishing to challenge the content of his educational records that are maintained in this office should notify the Director of Admissions and Records in writing. An Authorization to Release Information is required to release records from the Office of Admissions and Records or the Financial Aid Office. Course Repetition Policy Any course may be repeated. No course may be counted more than once in calculating the total number of semester hours credit towards graduation. Any required course in which an \"F\" or other unacceptable grade is received must be repeated. In those cases where a course in which the student receives an \"F\" is not offered during the remainder of that student's residence, an equivalent course may be substituted for purposes of meeting program requirements upon recommendation of the appropriate department chair and the Vice President of Academic and Student Services. A student who has passed a curriculum course three times must receive permission from the Vice President of Academic and Student Services before the student is allowed to register for the class another time. WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 21 Course Substitution Students are expected to follow the curriculum as shown in the catalog of record for their chosen program. Substitutions may be made when it is educationally sound and is determined to be in the best interest of the student's educational and career objectives. Course substitutions must meet the following criteria: No non-college transfer course, either individually or in combination with another course, may be substituted for a college transfer course and in order for one course to be substituted for another, there must be a clear relationship between the two courses. Substitutions must be recommended by the Department Chair and approved by the Division Chair. Minimum Class Size Policy The decision to offer a class and to establish minimum class size will be made by the Department Chair and the Division Chair with the approval of the Vice President of Academic and Student Services. Criteria for determining minimum class size will be on a class-by-class basis and based on the subject matter of the course, the need for the course, the impact on the institution including resources and the students enrolled. Independent Study Policy Independent study is a class offered without any regularly scheduled conventional classroom or lab sessions. Independent study is to be used only under extenuating circumstances. All classes scheduled as independent study will be approved by the program Division Chair. All independent study classes must be required or elective courses in the student's program of study. The classes will be scheduled with the faculty member for the course. During the term, the faculty member will meet with the student either by mail, telephone, e-mail or personally to discuss/assess the student's progress towards meeting the course competencies and objectives and for conducting the course evaluation processes. Course content, standards of progress, tuition and fee charges, and all other provisions heretofore presented will apply to independent study courses. In addition to the above, the following requirements apply to students receiving Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) benefits and/or financial aid: Student must meet with the Wayne Community College DVA Coordinator/Financial Aid Officer. Student must have completed 15 semester hours of course work at Wayne Community College in the current major with a grade point average of 2.0 or better. Student must have completed pre-curriculum work as determined by the courses required in the current major. Prerequisites Prerequisites are requirements that must be met before students can enroll in a specific course. This prerequisite may be a class that is required before registering for the next level or it may refer to placement test scores that are required before registering. Students must comply with catalog requirements. Courses may not be taken until all prerequisites have been met. There are occasions in which exceptions to this regulation may be deemed desirable and necessary. The appropriate Department/Division Chair of the division in which the course is offered must approve such exceptions in writing. Exceptions to the course prerequisite are the following: Developmental prerequisites may be fulfilled by an appropriate placement test score or appropriate high school GPA; Visiting students who have written documentation from their college/university to enroll in a specified course that has a prerequisite; Students with an associate or higher level degree who enroll in beginning college level courses (e.g. ENG 111; PSY 150); Students who have life experiences that are deemed equivalent to or supersede the prerequisite; a reserved review of course level outcomes would occur and be maintained in the student's records; Students who successfully complete a course that has a prerequisite would not have to take the prerequisite (example, a student who completed PSY 150 with the local prerequisite of RED 090/DRE 098 would not have to take RED 090/DRE 098). Credit by exam may be used to meet prerequisite requirements. Co-requisites Co-requisite courses are courses that must be taken at the same time. An example of co-requisite includes lecture and lab courses such as BIO 140 Environmental Biology and BIO 140A Environmental Biology Lab. All lecture and lab courses must be taken together during the same term. Transcript Request and Fees An official transcript of work at Wayne Community College will be sent to the appropriate institution upon written request by the student. Wayne Community College requires a written request 24 hours prior to release of a transcript. Transcripts will be prepared at a cost of $2 per copy (no checks accepted). No transcript will be released until the student's account is cleared with the Business Office. Work-Based Learning Program Work-Based Learning (WBL) is an educational plan that integrates classroom learning with supervised work experience in an employment situation directly related to the education program of a student. WBL enhances the educational process by bringing the worlds of theory and application together. Students learn the important link between academic learning and what is expected in the workplace. Depending on the curriculum program, WBL students work from one to three semesters in a part or full time job. This can either be a paid or a volunteer position with employers approved by the WBL Instructor Coordinator. Academic credit is given for the learning gained during the WBL work experience. Work experience involves the development of job skills directly related to the educational program of the student. Eligibility Students must meet certain criteria before the College may award credit for WBL work experience. Students who are enrolled in approved WBL programs of study and who have completed a minimum of nine semester hours credit (9SHC), which must come from the core curriculum, are eligible for WBL if they meet the following conditions: 1. Academic standing of 2.00+ GPA 2. Approval from WBL office 3. Approval of WBL Instructor Coordinator Certain curriculum programs may specify additional conditions.22 WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE Application and Registration Procedures Interested students should see their advisor to register for WBL. The student must attend a mandatory WBL orientation at the beginning of each semester. WBL workbooks will be distributed, an explanation of how to complete the workbook will be given, and an overview of WBL regulations and criteria will be outlined during orientation. Open enrollment for WBL allows students to enter WBL after the initial 10 percent period of the semester, allowing flexibility in the program. Students need to register for open enrollment in the WBL office. Academic Credit Credit hours for Work-Based Learning are determined by the total number of hours a student works during the semester. The breakdown of credit hours to hours worked on the WBL job is as follows: 1 Semester Credit Hour = 160 Hours Worked 2 Semester Credit Hours = 320 Hours Worked Programs of Study with WBL The following programs of study have either mandatory or elective WBL: Accounting Agribusiness Technology Applied Animal Science Technology Automotive Systems Technology (GM-ASEP) Automotive Systems Technology (ATEP) Business Administration Collision Repair and Refinishing Computer Information Technology Computer-Integrated Machining Health Business Information Healthcare Management Technology Human Services Technology Medical Office Networking Technology Office Administration School Age Education Simulation and Game Development Sustainable Agriculture Turfgrass Management Technology Cooperative Programs/Careerand College Promise(Jump Start/Dual Enrollment) Career and College Promise provides seamless educational opportunities for eligible North Carolina high school students to dually enroll in community college courses in order to accelerate completion of college certificates, diplomas, or associate degrees. The dual enrollment program is designed for high school juniors and seniors who attend public, private, or non-public schoolsTo be eligible for enrollment, a high school student must meet state-wide mandated criteria. Qualifying students may select the College Transfer Pathway or the Career Technical Education Pathway depending on set criteria. Students who are enrolled in the Wayne Early Middle College High School or Wayne School of Engineering have different eligibility requirements. Dual enrolled students earn college credit by attending college level classes, and the transfer of college credit for high school credit is determined by the individual high schools. Depending on the high school schedule, students must be enrolled in at least one high school course, excluding the summer term. The cost of tuition is waived for dual enrolled students who enroll in curriculum courses.

Four (4) units of mathematics in any of the following combinations. - Algebra I and II, Geometry, and one unit beyond Algebra II, - Algebra I and II, and two units beyond Algebra II, or - Integrated Math I, II and III, and one unit beyond integrated Math III. Two (2) units of social studies (including one unit of U.S. history). Three (3) units of science (including a unit of life or biological science, a unit of physical science, and at least one laboratory course). Two (2) units of the same foreign language. Removal of High School Deficiencies Transfer students that did not meet the University of North Carolina minimum course requirements at the high school level must do one of the following before transferring:1. A student who completes the Associate in Arts or the Associate in Science degree will satisfy UNC's minimum admission requirements (MAR) and minimum course requirements (MCR). 2. A transfer student will also be considered to have satisfied (MAR) and (MCR) if he or she has: received the Associate in Arts, the Associate in Science, the baccalaureate, or any higher degree, or completed at least six (6) semester hours in degree-credit in each of the following subjects: English, mathematics, the natural sciences, and social/behavioral sciences, and (for students who graduate from high school in 2003-04 and beyond) a second language. The North Carolina Comprehensive Articulation Agreement The North Carolina Comprehensive Articulation Agreement (CAA) is a statewide agreement governing the transfer of credits between North Carolina Community Colleges and North Carolina Public Universities and has as its objective, the smooth transfer of students. The CAA includes two degrees at the community college level: the Associate in Arts and the Associate in Science. Both degrees consist of a general education core and electives. The general education transfer core reflects the distribution of discipline areas commonly included in institution-wide, lower division, general education requirements for the baccalaureate degree. The general education core includes study in the following areas: English composition, humanities/fine arts, social/behavioral sciences, and natural sciences/mathematics. Community colleges and universities have identified community college courses appropriate to a general education transfer core. These courses are listed in this section of the catalog. Transfer Assured Admissions Policy (TAAP) The CAA addresses the admission of community college graduates to UNC institutions and the transfer of credits between institutions within the North Carolina Community College System and institutions within The University of North Carolina. The TAAP assures admission to one of the 16 UNC institutions under the following conditions: Admission is not assured to a specific campus or specific program or major. Students must have graduated from a North Carolina community college with an Associate in Arts or Associate in Science degree. Students must meet all requirements of the CAA. Students must have an overall GPA of at least 2.0 on a 4.0 scale, as calculated by the college from which they graduated, and a grade of \"C\" or better in all CAA courses. Students must be academically eligible for re-admission to the last institution attended. Students must meet judicial requirements of the institution to which they apply. Students must meet all application requirements at the receiving institution including the submission of all required documentation by stated deadlines. The major components of the CAA are described below: The CAA enables North Carolina Community College graduates of two-year Associate in Arts(AA) and Associate in Science(AS) degree programs who are admitted to constituent institutions of the University of North Carolina to transfer with junior status. Universities cannot place requirements on students transferring under the CAA that are not required of their native students. A student who completes the Associate in Arts or Associate in Science degree prior to transfer to a UNC institution will have fulfilled the UNC institution's lower-division general education requirements. Due to degree requirements in some majors, additional courses at the UNC institution may be required beyond the general education courses and pre-major courses taken at the community college. Community college graduates of the Associate in Arts or AssociateWAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 79 in Science degree programs who have earned 60 semester hours in approved transfer courses with a grade of \"C\" or better and an overall GPA of at least 2.0 on a 4.0 scale will receive at least 60 semester hours of academic credit upon admission to a UNC institution. Requirements for admission to some major programs may require additional pre-specialty courses beyond the pre-major taken at the community college. Students entering such programs may need more than two academic years of course work to complete the baccalaureate degree, depending on requirements of the program. All courses approved for transfer in the CAA are designated as fulfi lling general education or pre-major or elective requirements. While general education and pre-major courses may also be used as electives, elective courses may not be used to fulfi ll general education requirements. CAA courses taken beyond the 60-61 SHC of credit in which the student received less than a \"C\" will not negate the provisions of the CAA. Students not completing the Associate in Arts or Associate in Science degrees Students not completing the Associate in Arts or Associate in Science degrees: A North Carolina community college student who satisfactorily completes, with a grade of \"C\" or better, courses identifi ed In the Universal General Education Transfer Component will receive credit applied toward the university's lower-division general education course requirements, subject to the following distribution limit: maximum of 6 hours in English Composition, 9 hours in Humanities/Fine Arts/Communication, 9 hours in Social/Behavioral Sciences, 8 hours In Mathematics, and 8 hours in the Natural Sciences. A North Carolina community college student who satisfactorily completes a transfer course that is not designated as a Universal General Education Transfer Component course will receive transfer credit for the course. The receiving institution will determine whether the course will count as general education, pre-major, or elective credit.

Reprimand: A written communication which gives official notice to the student that any subsequent offense against the Student Code of Conduct will carry heavier penalties because of this prior infraction. B. General Probation: An individual may be placed on General Probation when involved in a minor disciplinary offense. General Probation has two important implications: the individual is given a chance to show capability and willingness to observe the Student Code of Conduct without further penalty; secondly, if the individual errs again, further action will be taken. This probation will be in effect for no more than two (2) semesters. Specific stipulations may be included in the terms of probation. C. Restrictive Probation: Restrictive Probation becomes a matter of record and results in limitations being placed on the student and/or loss of good standing.

Restitution: Paying for damaging, misusing, destroying, or losing property belonging to the College, College personnel, or students. E. Withholding transcript, diploma, registration, or participation in graduation ceremonies: Imposed when financial obligations are not met. (Student will not be allowed to register until all financial obligations are met.) F. Loss of Academic Credit or Grade: Imposed as a result of academic dishonesty. G.

Expulsion: Dismissing a student from campus for an indefinite period losing student status. The student may be readmitted to the College only with the approval of the President. J. Group Probation: This is given to a College club or organized group for a specified period of time. If group violations are repeated during the term of the sentence, the charter may be revoked or activities restricted. Specific stipulations may be included in the terms of probation. K. Group Restriction: Removing College recognition for a group, club, society, or other organization during the semester in which the offense occurred or for a longer period (usually not more than one (1) other semester). While under restriction, one or more of the following will apply: the group may not seek or add members, hold or sponsor events in the College community, or engage in other activities as specified. L. Group Charter Revocation: Removal of College recognition for a group, club, society, or other organization for a minimum of two (2) years. Re-charter after that time must be approved by the President. NOTE: Failure to Comply: Failure to comply with the rules of the College may result in criminal charges filed against the student(s).

Purpose - The purpose of the Student Grievance Procedure is to assure students that grievances will be considered fairly, rapidly, and in a non-threatening atmosphere. It is not intended to initiate disciplinary action against a member of the faculty or staff or to alter College policy. Students have the right to file a grievance when they have reason to believe that a condition, situation, or action affecting them is unjust, inequitable, a hindrance to effective performance, is in violation of written campus policies or procedures, or constitutes arbitrary, capricious, or unequal application of written campus policies or procedures. This includes alleged discrimination on the basis of age, sex, race, handicap or other conditions, preferences or behaviors (excluding sexual harassment complaints, which, due to their sensitive nature, would first be directed to the grievance officer appointed by the President, and only if not resolved by meeting with the grievance officer would then follow the remainder of the Grievance Procedure). This also includes academic matters (excluding individual grades except where the above conditions apply - see Grade Appeal Process). B. Procedures 1. First Step - The student must go to the instructor orWAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 151 staff member where the alleged problem originated. An attempt will be made to resolve the matter equitably and informally at this level. The conference must take place within five (5) business days after the incident which generated the complaint. 2. Second Step - If the grievance is not resolved at the informal conference, the student must talk with the faculty staff member's immediate supervisor (e.g. department chair) who will attempt to resolve the issue. This discussion must take place within five (5) business days after completion of step one. 3. Third Step - If the grievance is not resolved within the department, the student may file a written grievance. The student would obtain the Grievance Form from the Director of Counseling Services who will explain the grievance process to the student. The completed Grievance Form must be returned to the Director within five (5) business days after completion of step two. The Director will then refer the grievance to the appropriate administrator (e.g. division chair) involved. Within ten (10) business days after receipt of the Grievance Form, the administrator shall send a certified letter to the student's last known address on file in the Office of Admissions and Records providing the student with the administrator's decision. Failure to accept receipt of the letter within six (6) business days of letter postmark ends the appeal procedure and the student/complainant forfeits his or her right to further appeal. 4. Fourth Step - If the written statement of the administrator does not satisfy the grievant, the student may request to appear before the Student Grievance Committee. The student must submit a written request to the Director and the request must be received within three (3) business days after receipt of the administrator's response. The request shall include a copy of the original Grievance Form, a copy of the administrator's written response, and the reason why the administrator's response is unsatisfactory. The Director shall immediately notify the President who shall insure that the Committee is organized in a manner consistent with Section C of this procedure (Student Grievance Committee). The Director will send copies of the appeal to the members of the Committee, the employee, and the employee's supervisor. The employee against whom the grievance was filed shall be given an opportunity to respond in writing to the Chair of the Committee. The Student Grievance Committee shall meet between five (5) and fifteen (15) business days after receipt of the request (excluding school breaks). A postponement may be granted by the Chair upon written request of either party, if the Chair deems appropriate. The Committee shall function by the guidelines outlined for the Disciplinary Review Committee. The Chair shall forward a copy of the Student Grievance Committee's decision to all parties involved and to the President within two (2) business days after the Committee's decision. Failure of any party to accept receipt of the letter within six (6) business days of letter postmark ends the appeal procedure and the party forfeits his/her right to further appeal. 5. Fifth Step - The Committee's decision may be appealed by either party involved to the President within three (3) business days after receipt of the Student Grievance Committee's decision. This written request must include the reason why the Student Grievance Committee's decision is unsatisfactory and must be received by the President within the time frame or the appeal process ends and the party forfeits his or her right to further appeal. The President shall review the Student Grievance Committee's findings, conduct any additional inquiries, and render a decision within ten (10) business days after receipt of the appeal. The President will notify the grievant by certified mail of the decision with a copy to the other party. Failure to accept receipt of the letter within six (6) business days of letter postmark ends the appeal procedure and the party forfeits his/her right to further appeal. 6. Sixth Step - The President's decision may be appealed by either party to the Board of Trustees' Personnel, Student Services and Policy Committee within three (3) business days after receipt of the President's decision. If the written appeal is not received by this Committee within the time frame, the appeal process ends and the party forfeits his or her right to further appeal. The Personnel, Student Services, and Policy Committee shall review any information to date, conduct any additional inquiries, and render a decision within twenty (20) business days after receipt of the appeal. The decision of the Board of Trustees' Personnel, Student Services and Policy Committee is final. C. The Student Grievance Committee - The Disciplinary Review Committee may serve as the Student Grievance Committee or, at the direction of the President, a new committee may be formed for each grievance. Committee makeup and method of appointment will be the same as for the Disciplinary Review Committee. D. Rights of Parties Involved in a Grievance - When a grievance committee meeting is scheduled, the parties involved are entitled to: 1. A written notice of the complaint. 2. A written notice of the time and place of the meeting. This notice shall be forwarded to all parties at least five (5) business days prior to the meeting unless they waive this requirement. 3. Review all available evidence, documents, or exhibits that each party may present at the meeting. 4. Have access to the names of witnesses. 5. Appear in person and present information on his or her behalf, call witnesses, and ask questions of any person present at the meeting. 6. The right to counsel. The role of the person acting as counsel is solely to advise the client. The counsel shall not address the Committee. 7. Each party will provide the Director of Counseling Services the name of the counsel and witnesses at least two (2) business days prior to the scheduled meeting. 8. If the grievant fails to attend the meeting (the Committee will wait ten (10) minutes from the scheduled meeting time), the grievance procedure ends and the student forfeits his or her right to further appeal. E. Prohibitions - Neither party, nor their representatives (counsel, family, friends, etc.), shall contact a Student Grievance Committee member, the College witnesses, the President, members of the Board of Trustees, or other community constituents prior to the student grievance proceedings. Such contact constitutes a breach in the grievance process and may adversely affect the hearing. IX. STUDENT COMPLAINTS Currently-enrolled students may wish to complain about an issue related to the College outside of formal, established grievance152 WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE or appeals processes, including but not limited to curriculum, class scheduling, registration, financial aid, facilities, or faculty. In accordance with federal consumer information and accreditation requirements, all areas that receive and resolve such complaints will maintain a log of the complaints and their resolution. In such cases, the student initiates the following process: 1. The student submits a Student Complaint Form. 2. The complaint form is routed to the Associate Vice President of Academic and Student Services and assigned to the appropriate administrator based on the nature of the complaint. 3. The assigned administrator follows up with resolution to the complaint within five (5) business days. 4. The administrator's response is final and is added to the official record of student complaints. GRADE APPEAL PROCESS Purpose The purpose of this section is to describe the process by which a student may appeal the final grade given by an instructor for completion of a curriculum course. A student who wishes to appeal a grade given for assignments, rather than for the completion of a course, should see the appropriate instructor and/or department chair. Procedure A student has the right to appeal a course grade when he/she believes that his/her performance in a course has been incorrectly evaluated by the instructor. Any such appeal must be initiated no later than two business weeks following the completion of the course. The first level of appeal, in all cases, should be to the instructor involved. Only if the issue cannot be resolved between the instructor and student should further appeals be made. In that case, a student should make his/her appeal, in writing, to the appropriate department chair and should clearly set forth the basis for the student's belief that the evaluation is incorrect. The department chair will work with the instructor and, where appropriate, with the division chair, to review the student's appeal. The department chair, with the division chair's input, will make a response to the student within one business week of the date of appeal. If the student is not satisfied with the department and division chairs' decisions, the student has the right to appeal that decision, in writing, to the Vice President of Academic and Student Services. The Vice President of Academic and Student Services may communicate with the instructor, department chair, and appropriate division chair in order to fully understand the basis for appeal. The Vice President of Academic and Student Services may appoint a peer review committee of curriculum faculty to act in an advisory capacity. At the completion of this review and within one business week of the student's appeal, the Vice President of Academic and Student Services will make a decision and convey that decision to the student, the instructor, department chair and division chairs involved. The decision of the Vice President of Academic and Student Services is final.

This encompasses all buildings, vehicles, walkways, campus grounds, parking lots and instructional areas, including instructional areas of off-campus college programs and courses. Criminal Activity Off Campus Wayne Community College operates no off-campus student organization facilities. The Student Activities Coordinator oversees recognized clubs and club activities. Campus Police and Security members do not provide law enforcement service to activities off-campus as they are not within the jurisdiction of Campus Police authority. All students participating in club activities are subject to the student code of conduct, regardless of venue. Campus Police and Security members enjoy a close working relationship with the local law enforcement agencies when violations of federal, state, or local laws surface. This cooperative team approach addresses situations as they arise as well as future concerns. Controlled Substances and Alcoholic Beverages Promoting a drug and alcohol-free environment is everyone's responsibility. WCC supports and is committed to maintaining such an environment for the benefit of all on campus. The WCC campus has been designated \"drug free.\" Therefore, in compliance with the Federal Drug-Free Workplace and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1988 (Public Law 101-690), it is the policy of this college that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance or alcohol is prohibited while in the workplace, on college premises, or as part of any college-sponsored activities. Any employee or student violating this policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination or expulsion and referral for prosecution. The specifics of this policy as it relates to students are as follows: 1. The term \"controlled substance\" means any drug listed in 21 CFR Part 1308 and other federal regulations, as well as those listed in Article V, Chapter 90 of North Carolina General Statutes. Generally, these are drugs, which have a high potential for abuse. Such drugs include, but are not limited to, Heroin, Marijuana, Cocaine, PCP, and \"Crack.\" They also include \"legal drugs\" which are not prescribed by a licensed physician. The term alcoholic beverage includes beer, wine, whiskey and any other beverage listed in Chapter 18B of the General Statutes of North Carolina. Controlled substance laws are strictly enforced by Campus Police and Security Officers. 2. Wayne Community College does not differentiate between unlawful users, pushers, or sellers of drugs or alcohol. Any student who possesses, uses, sells, gives, or in any way transfers a controlled substance or alcoholic beverage to another person, or manufactures a controlled substance while on college premises or as part of any college sponsored activity, will be subject to disciplinary action under the student code of conduct up to and including expulsion and referral for prosecution, fines and imprisonment. Alternatively, the College may require the student to successfully finish a drug abuse program sponsored by an approved private or governmental institution as a precondition for continued enrollment at the College. 3. Organizations or groups violating alcohol/substance policies or laws also may be subject to sanctions by the College. 4. Each student is required to inform the College in writing within five (5) days after he or she is convicted for violation of any federal, state, or local criminal drug or alcoholic beverage control statute where such violation occurred on college premises or as part of any college-sponsored activity. A conviction means a finding of guilt (including a plea of nolo contendere) or the imposition of a sentence by a judge or jury in any federal or state court. 5. Convictions of employees working under federal grants, for violating drug laws in the workplace, on college premises, or as part of any college sponsored activity, shall be reported to the appropriate federal agency. The Office of Human Resources must notify the U. S. Government agency, with which the grant was made, within ten (10) days after receiving notice from the employee or otherwise receives actual notice of a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace. The College shall take appropriate disciplinary action within 30 calendar days from receipt of notice. As a condition of further employment on any federal government grant, the law requires all employees to abide by this policy. this would include any work-study or student employed part-time under a federal grant. 6. Information on applicable state sanctions associated within the use of both illicit drugs and alcohol is available from the Campus Police and Security Office. Violations of North Carolina Controlled Substance Laws under General Statutes 90-95 carry a maximum of up to 35 years in prison and/or fines. A description of health risks associated with the use of illicit drugs and alcohol is presented on page 157.WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 157 DRUGS AND THEIR RISKS TYPES OF DRUGS: Schedule and opium extracts and narcotics Schedule III: Certain barbiturates such as amobarbitol contain very limited amounts of codeine, dihydrocodeine, ethylmorphine, opium, and atropine, such Oil, TetrahydrocannabinolHEALTH RISKS:Psychologically and physically addictive; depression, withdrawal symptoms, convulsions, death, unpredictable behavior with hallicuinogens; possible damage to unborn fetus Psychologically and physically addictive; withdrawal symptoms, convulsions, respiratory failure, frequent accidents; possible damage to unborn fetus; death; cocaine and amphetamines increase blood pressure which can lead to irregular heartbeat and death; amphetamines can cause agitation, increase in body temperature, hallucinations, convulsions, possible death Psychologically and physically addictive; potential liver damage, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, disorientation, shallow breathing, cold and clammy skin, coma, possible death; withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, tremors, insomnia, convulsions, possible damage to unborn fetus Psychologically and physically addictive; drowsiness; withdrawal symptoms include tremors, abdominal and muscle cramps, insomnia, anxiety, convulsions, possible death; possible damage to unborn fetus Psychologically and physically addictive; nausea, gastrointestinal symptoms, drowsiness; withdrawal symptoms include runny nose, watery eyes, panic, chills, cramps, irritability, nausea; possible damage to unborn fetus Psychologically addictive; increased risk of lung cancer, bronchitis, and emphysema; contributes to heart disease, fatigue, paranoia, possible psychosis; withdrawal symptoms including insomnia, hyperactivity and decreased appetite; depression of the immune system; decreased sperm count in men and irregular ovulation in women NOTE: Wayne Community College property includes both a child care center and a secondary school.

The Clery Act requires WCC to include statements of policy in our annual security report that address sex offenses and access to information on registered sex offenders in the campus community. Statement of policy regarding campus sexual assault program to prevent sex offenses and procedures to follow when a sex offense occurs are referenced in 34 CFR 668.46(b)(11). Preventing and Responding to Sex Offenses The College educates the student community about sexual assaults and date rape through orientations and ACA \"College Success\" classes. The Office of Campus Police and Security offers sexual assault education and information programs to College students and employees upon request. Information and referrals concerning date rape education, risk reduction, and College response is available through the Counseling Services Department. If you are a victim of a sexual assault at this institution, your first priority should be to get to a place of safety. You should then obtain necessary medical treatment. Campus Police and Security strongly advocates that a victim of sexual assault report the incident in a timely manner. Time is a critical factor for evidence collection and preservation. An assault should be reported directly to a Campus Police and Security Officer and/or to a College Counselor. Filing a police report with a Campus Police Officer will not obligate the victim to prosecute, nor will it subject the victim to scrutiny or judgmental opinions from officers. Filing a police report will: ensure that a victim of sexual assault receives the necessary medical treatment and tests, at no expense to the victim; provide the opportunity for collection of evidence helpful in prosecution, which cannot be obtained later (ideally a victim of sexual assault should not wash, douche, use the toilet, or change clothing prior to a medical/legal exam); assure the victim has access to free confidential counseling from counselors specifically trained in the area of sexual assault crisis intervention. When a sexual assault victim contacts the Office of Campus Police and Security, the Goldsboro Police Department or the Wayne County Sheriff's Office will be notified as well. A representative from the Counseling Services Department will also be notified. The victim of a sexual assault may choose to make a Student Code of Conduct charge to the Director of Counseling Services, however, without an official law enforcement investigation, proving the charge may be difficult. A College representative from the Office of Campus Police and Security Department or the Counseling Services Department will guide the victim through the available options and support the victim in his or her decision. Counseling options are available from the College Counseling Services Department. Counseling and support services outside the College system can be obtained through the Wayne Uplift Resource Center. College disciplinary proceedings are detailed earlier in this Student Handbook. A student found guilty of sexual misconduct in a criminal proceeding in the State courts could also face College disciplinary actions and may be suspended or expelled from the College. Student victims may request to change their academic situation after an alleged sexual assault, if such changes are reasonably available. Disclosures to Alleged Victims of Crimes of Violence or Non-forcible Sex Offenses Wayne Community College's Director of Counseling shall send a letter to the complainant in a disciplinary proceeding resulting from alleged crimes of violence or non-forcible sex offenses. Sex Offender Registration The Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act of 2000, which amends the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, the Jeanne Clery Act and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, requires institutions of higher education to issue a statement advising the campus community where law enforcement information provided by a state concerning registered sex offenders may be obtained. It also requires sex offenders already required to register in state to provide notice of each institution of higher education in that state at which the person is employed, carries a vocation, or is a student. In the State of North Carolina, convicted sex offenders must register with the Sex Offender Registry maintained by the Department of Justice. Searchable registries are found at: N.C. Department of Justice's Sex Offender Registry Web site - http://sexoffender.ncdoj.gov U.S. Department of Justice's National Sex Offender Public Web site - http://www.nsopr.gov Title IX Wayne Community College receives federal funding from the U.S. Department of Education and thus must comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities. WCC has designated a \"Title IX Coordinator\" for students who is responsible for coordinating the school's compliance with Title IX. The coordinator's responsibilities include overseeing all complaints of sex discrimination and identifying and addressing any patterns or systemic problems that arise during the review of such complaints.Alcoholics Anonymous - 919-735-4221 Goldsboro Police Department - 919-705-6572 Narcotics Anonymous - 919-734-2965 East Point of Goldsboro - 919-587-0301 Wayne County Health Department - 919-731-1000 Wayne County Sheriff's Office - 919-731-1481Drug-Free Workplace Help Line 1-800-967-5752 www.drugfreeworkplace.gov Cocaine Hotline - 1-800-688-4232 Al-Anon - 1-800-356-9996 National Institute on Drug Abuse Hotline 1-800-662-HELP American Council on Alcoholism - 1-800-527-5344 ORGANIZATIONS AND AGENCIES - NATIONALORGANIZATIONS AND AGENCIES - LOCALFor Additional Information, Contact Your Local Law Enforcement Agency or District Attorney's Office.WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 159 Title IX Coordinator for Students Director of Counseling Wayne Learning Center, Room 183mseverett@waynecc.edu919-739-6710 TRAFFIC AND PARKING POLICY All of the provisions of Chapter 20 of North Carolina General Statues relating to the use of the highways of the State of North Carolina and the operation of motor vehicles thereon shall apply to the streets, roads, alleys, and driveways on the campus of the College along with other rules and regulations approved by the Board of Trustees as specified under North Carolina General Statue 115D-21. 1.

This publication focuses on Campus Police and Security because it patrols the main campus and the Wayne Executive Jetport non-campus site. However, SJAFB Security Forces should be contacted when incidents, emergencies, or crimes occur at SJAFB Education Center. To report a crime or an emergency from a college phone, call 9-1-1, call Campus Police and Security at extension 7050 or, from outside the College phone system, 919-739-7050. To report a non-emergency security or public safety related matter, call extension 7050 or, from outside the College phone system, 919-739-7050. To report a crime at the Wayne Executive Jetport, call 9-1-1 or 919-739-7050. To report a crime or emergency at SJAFB, call 919-722-1211. To report a non-emergency security or public safety related matter call at SJAFB, call 919-722-1211. To report sexual assault on the base, call the Sexual Assault Response Coordinator at 919-722-7272 or the Department of Defense Safe Helpline at 877-995-5247. To report a crime at all other off-campus events, activities, or classes, call 9-1-1. Dispatchers are available at these respective telephone numbers 24 hours a day to answer your call. In response to a call, Campus Police and Security and/or SJAFB Security Forces will take the required action, dispatching an officer or asking the victim to report to the Office of Campus Police or the SJAFB Security Forces to file an incident report. If assistance is required from the local law enforcement agencies or fire department, Campus Police and Security will contact the appropriate unit. If a sexual assault or rape should occur, staff on the scene, including Campus Police and Security, will offer the victim a wide variety of services. Referrals for confidential assistance may be made to Wayne Uplift Resource Association. Wayne Uplift's crisis line number is 919-736-1313. The National Sexual Assault Hotline is 1-800-656-HOPE (4673). Crimes should be reported to the Campus Police and Security Department to ensure inclusion in the annual crime statistics and to aid in providing timely warning notices to the community, when appropriate. For example, a crime that was reported only to Wayne Uplift Resource Association would not be included in the WCC crime statistics. Voluntary Confidential Reporting The WCC Office of Campus Police and Security encourages anyone who is the victim of or witness to any crime to promptly report the incident to the police. Because police reports are public records under State law, the Office of Campus Police and Security cannot hold reports of crime in confidence. Confidential reports for purposes of inclusion in the annual disclosure of crime statistics can generally be made to other Campus Security Authorities as identified above. Confidential reports of crime may also be made to Crime Stoppers at 919-735-2255. Counselors and Confidential Crime Reporting Campus \"Professional Counselors,\" when acting as such, are not considered to be a campus security authority and are not required to report crimes for inclusion into the annual disclosure of crime statistics. As a matter of policy, they are encouraged, if and when they deem it appropriate, to inform persons being counseled of the procedures to report crimes on a voluntary basis to any of the Campus Security Authorities listed above, for inclusion into the annual crime statistics. Staff of the Counseling Services Department inform students of the procedures to report crime to the Office of Campus Police and Security on a voluntary basis, should they feel it is in the best interest of the student. Professional counselors are defined as: \"An employee of an institution whose official responsibilities include providing psychological counseling to members of the institution's community and who is functioning within the scope of his or her license or certification.\"WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 161 PERSONAL SAFETY Safety Tips You are the key to your personal safety and the safety of others. By following the precautions listed below, you can substantially decrease your chances of becoming a crime statistic. BE AWARE - Recognize your vulnerability. REPORT all suspicious persons, vehicles, and activities to the Office of Campus Police and Security immediately at 919-739-7050 or call the switchboard by dialing ext. 0 on campus phones. PROTECT your personal property. Keep your car locked at all times. Never leave valuables where they can be seen in your vehicle; lock them in your trunk. Do not leave any personal property lying around such as books, book bags, purses, or electronic devices. KNOW the location of emergency call boxes, which are in most parking lots. PARTICIPATE fully in the \"WCC Alert\" warning system by maintaining current e-mail, text, and phone contact numbers (all college e-mail accounts are automatically enrolled). The alert system is capable of delivering messages to web, e-mail, voice, and text messaging. Emergency Call Boxes Emergency call boxes are located in most parking lots and near the tennis courts. They are located on light poles and each has a blue light indicator. If you need a Campus Police and Security Officer, push the red button on the emergency call box, and it will automatically notify the Office of Campus Police and Security about where you are and let you communicate directly with the Campus Police and Security Officer who is responding to your call. Escort Services The Office of Campus Police and Security can be contacted for assistance at any time. Officers are available to escort students, staff, faculty, and visitors to and from any building and parking lot on campus. If assistance is not requested, we suggest walking with a friend rather than alone. PREVENTION AND EDUCATION Safety/Security Awareness Programs Campus Police and Security Officers discuss safety and security procedures throughout the year at employee orientation sessions and college student success classes, referencing important safety reminders and procedures. College officials and guest speakers discuss safety and security issues during special programs and meetings throughout the school year, such as the annual safety fair. The Chief of Campus Police and Security publishes, when appropriate, serious incident reports through notification messages which are disseminated using bulletin boards, flyers, Web site, e-mail, text, voice, Magic-Net, and other announcement forms. The purpose of this notification is to aid in the prevention of similar occurrences. During ACA orientation classes, students are informed of services offered by the Campus Police and Security. Presentations outline ways to maintain personal safety. The Annual Safety and Security Report is made available to students. Crime Prevention Programs and Sexual Assault Prevention Programs are offered. In addition to orientations and ACA classes, information is disseminated to students and employees through crime prevention awareness notices, security alerts, displays, e-mails, text messages, social media and in College publications, as appropriate. Periodically, the WCC Campus Police and Security Department, in cooperation with other College organizations and departments, present crime prevention awareness sessions on sexual assault (rape and acquaintance rape), Rohypnol abuse, theft, and vandalism, as well as educational sessions on personal safety. Domestic Violence Contact Counseling Services and/or Campus Police and Security to report domestic violence concerns that could impact personal or campus safety. Submit copies of any restraining orders to Campus Police and Security. For local assistance, contact Wayne Uplift at 919-736-1313. Suicide Prevention Crisis counseling and referrals are available through the Counseling Services Department. For community assistance, contact Eastpointe at 1-800-913-6109 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK. Substance Abuse Education The Substance Abuse Education Program provides services related to drug use and abuse including dissemination of informational materials, educational programs, counseling services, referrals and college disciplinary actions. WCC's Counseling Services Department provides an overall coordination of the Drug-Free Campus Program. However, some services are the responsibility of other areas of the institution. These include: Alcohol and Drug Education: Student Activities Counseling Services: Counseling Services Department Referral Services: Counseling Services Department College Disciplinary Actions: Curriculum/Continuing Education and Basic Skills Disciplinary Review Committees. Drug Counseling and Rehabilitation If anyone needs assistance for any reason related to the use/abuse of drugs or alcohol, a member of the WCC counseling staff will act as a referral source to the following services in Goldsboro and Wayne County: Narcotics Anonymous 1-866-321-1631 Eastpointe 1-800-913-6109 Alcoholics Anonymous 919-735-4221 Wayne Community College Drug andAlcohol Prevention Program The abuse and use of drugs and alcohol are subjects of immediate concerns in our society. These problems are extremely complex and ones for which there are no easy solutions. The College strives to encourage prevention of drug and alcohol abuse to the extent possible. The College's prevention program includes an educational program aimed at preventing drug abuse and illegal drug use, therapeutic support through short-term clinical counseling and appropriate referrals, and deterrence through an active Campus Police and Security Department. From a safety perspective, the users of drugs or alcohol may impair the well-being of all persons on campus; drug and alcohol use may also result in damage to college property. EMERGENCY PLANS Emergency Information Placards Emergency information cards are located across campus in most corridors, classrooms, labs and other public venues. They are mounted to the walls in clear acrylic frames and consist of red and white cards, printed front and back with the following information: Emergency Evacuation Plan (by building/floor), Emergency Evacuation Procedures, Emergency Evacuation Plan Designated Evacuation Areas, Emergency Response Checklist, Emergency Levels, Emergency Medical Protocols. Please familiarize yourselves with the information on these cards and the evacuation routes for the locations on campus that you visit.162 WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE Emergency Evacuation A building should be evacuated immediately whenever the building fire alarm sounds or when instructed to do so over the public address system. When notified to evacuate the building, walk quickly to the nearest marked exit and alert others to do the same. Be sure to close office and classroom doors before you leave. Faculty and staff are to notify students and visitors in their respective areas to assemble in the areas designated. Once outside the building, report to the designated meeting area for your building. At the beginning of each semester, each instructor should encourage individuals who will need assistance in exiting the building in case of an emergency to self-identify with the instructor or the Office of Campus Police and Security. This will include wheelchair-bound individuals, those with any condition limiting mobility, visually or hearing-impaired individuals, and anyone else who might have difficulty following directions in an emergency situation. The names and locations of these individuals must be given to the Chief of Campus Police and Security. An Evacuation Assistance Team member will be available to assist those individuals in exiting the building in case of an emergency and may consult with students as to the best methods to assist them in exiting the building. Generally, building elevators are not available for use and those individuals with limited mobility may require assistance from WCC staff in using the stairs. If assistance is required by any individual who has not self-identified, please notify the Office of Campus Police and Security at 919-739-7050 or ext. 7050 from an internal phone, or the switchboard at ext. 0, and someone will be dispatched to assist in the evacuation. Accident and Medical Emergencies Procedure If you have a medical emergency, call 911 for EMS and ext. 0, or 919-739-7050 to notify the Office of Campus Police and Security and give the location and nature of the situation. Wayne Community College maintains basic first aid boxes in every building. Anything beyond basic first aid will require outside attention by a medical provider. Under college policy, no medicines will be dispensed by college staff. A limited supply of basic pain relievers, allergy medicines and other over-the-counter items may be found in the Bookstore during normal operating hours for personal purchase. In general, accidents occurring during WCC-sponsored activities will be covered by student and/or college insurance. The College generally will not be responsible for medical transport or any hospital or medical provider fees for personal illnesses. Should a medical emergency requiring more than basic first aid arise, the procedures posted on the red Emergency Medical Cards located throughout the campus, should be followed. 1. Call EMS immediately at 9-1-1 and then call Campus Police and Security at 919-739-7050 to notify them of the situation, location, and nature of the accident or illness. Campus Police and Security will escort the ambulance to the scene. 2. Do not move injured persons unless: a. you are absolutely certain about their condition; or b. the person is in more danger if they remain where they are. 3. In the event of a seizure, do not restrain the victim. Clear the area around the victim of everything that could be a hazard. If possible, put the victim on their side. Never force the victim's mouth open. All accidents involving students must be reported to the Student Activities Coordinator or to the Evening Coordinator after hours. Accidents involving guests must also be reported to the Business Office. It is important that these notifications be made prior to transport if possible so that appropriate insurance documents may be prepared and related agencies notified. Failure to follow procedure could result in claims not being covered.Campus \"Lock Down\" If ever a dangerous situation develops that poses a serious threat to the College and jeopardizes the safety of students or employees, a campus \"Lock Down\" will be initiated. \"Lock Down\" will be announced either by college personnel in a building, over the public address system, and/or by WCC Alert message, and will remain in effect until terminated by law enforcement. If you are in a classroom when you hear the \"Lock Down\" announcement, close the classroom door, move away from the door and close the window blinds. Keep low to the floor and out of line of sight with the door. Stay there until instructed to do otherwise by law enforcement or until the \"ALL CLEAR\" is sounded. If you are in a hallway or outside when \"LOCK DOWN\" is announced, please take cover immediately by getting into a building and into a room. If you can't do either, take cover behind any object you can find. Stay there until instructed otherwise by law enforcement. Campus Evacuation When a \"campus state of emergency\" is declared, all nonessential personnel, students, and visitors must immediately begin an orderly evacuation of the campus. The Office of Campus Police and Security and Traffic Control Team will assist in directing traffic to ensure the safest and quickest evacuation. Severe Weather Alert In the event that a severe weather warning indicates an immediate threat to individuals on the WCC campus, the campus will be alerted by way of the public address system, the Office of Campus Police and Security, and/or WCC Alert message, and the plan below will be activated. Please close all windows and doors before you leave your area. If time permits, disconnect all electrical and computer equipment before you leave your area. Everyone is to remain in the designated safe area(s) until notified by the Office of Campus Police and Security that all is clear. 1. Azalea, Dogwood, and Wayne Learning Center Buildings: Everyone on the 1st and 2nd floors should immediately proceed to the first floor of their respective buildings and assemble in the safe shelter areas away from outside doors and windows. People on the 3rd and 4th floors should shelter on the 2nd floor away from outside doors and windows. In the WLC building, people in the dining hall, atrium, student lounge and other open areas should proceed to Moffatt Auditorium if safe to do so, move to the front row and fill in from the middle of the center section out to the aisles and from the walls back to the aisles on the right and left wing seating areas. This will facilitate getting everyone to safety as quickly as possible. 2. Aviation and Hangar Buildings: All individuals should immediately proceed quickly to the Aviation classroom building away from outside doors and windows for safe shelter if time permits. 3. Hocutt Building: Everyone on the first floor should assemble in the automotive area away from doors and windows. Individuals on the second floor should proceed to the interior hallway or other interior rooms with no outside doors or windows. 4. Maple Building: All individuals should immediately proceed to the Prep Booth, Room 102, or to the Storage Room 101 and stay away from outside doors and windows. 5. Cedar, Holly, Oak, Pine, Spruce, and Walnut Buildings: All individuals should remain on the floor they are on and seek safe shelter away from outside doors and windows. 6. Individuals in service buildings or elsewhere on the grounds should seek immediate shelter in the nearest brick building or lay flat in a ditch or low-lying area if time does not permit getting inside a building.WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 163 Communicable Disease Policy for Students Wayne Community College is committed to assuring that all necessary training and precautions are taken with regard to communicable diseases. The Biohazard Exposure Control Plan and the Pandemic Preparedness Plan of Wayne Community College reflect our efforts to ensure the good health and safety of all employees and students. The College adopts this communicable disease policy for students in an effort to control communicable diseases and the threat of pandemics on campus based upon established rules and regulations of the N.C. Division of Health Services. Employees and employees of contractors or contracted services infected with a communicable disease have the responsibility of reporting this fact to the Director of Human Resources. Students infected with a communicable disease have the responsibility of reporting this fact to the Associate Vice President of Academic and Student Services or the Vice President of Continuing Education, as appropriate. Communicable disease is an illness resulting from an infectious agent or its toxic products being transmitted directly or indirectly to a person from an infected person or animal through the agency of an intermediate animal, host, or vector, or through the inanimate environment. [N.C.G.S. 130A-2(1c)] Communicable Disease shall include, but is not limited to: Chickenpox, influenza, Infectious Mononucleosis, Conjunctivitis, Hepatitis A, B and D, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), Aids-related complex (ARC), positive HIV antibody status, Influenza, Measles, Meningitis, Tuberculosis, Whooping Cough, and sexually transmitted diseases.(N.C.G.S. 130A) Persons who are infected with a communicable disease are expected to seek expert medical advice and are encouraged to advise local health authorities. Local health authorities should offer counseling to these persons about measures that can be taken to prevent the spread of infection and to protect their own health. Persons who know, or have a reasonable basis for believing, that they are infected with a communicable disease have an ethical and legal obligation to behave in accordance with such knowledge to protect themselves and others. Medical information relating to the communicable disease of a student or employee will be disclosed to responsible college officials only on a strictly limited need-to-know basis. No person, group, agency, insurer, employer, or institution should be provided any medical information without the prior specific written consent of a student unless required by state and/or federal law. Furthermore, all medical information relating to the communicable diseases of students and employees will be kept confidential, according to state and federal law, including the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act. If a student reports a communicable disease condition, the student may be excluded from the institution until an appropriate evaluation of the student's medical condition can be made. The evaluation may be made by a physician or a health department official and testing may be required if appropriate. Students in any Allied Health program may have additional requirements, as specified in each program's student handbook; therefore, these students should report all suspected communicable diseases. The final determination of a student's ability to remain in school will be made by the Vice President or Associate Vice President based upon professional medical evaluation results and recommendations. If a student is found to have a communicable disease, then the attendance of the student on campus or at any College activity will be prohibited until a satisfactory letter or certificate is obtained from one or more licensed physicians or public health officials stating that the student is not a health risk to employees and other students at the College. The College's Biohazard Control Plan defines guidelines that will be followed in the event of an accidental exposure to bodily fluids or biohazards. Any such exposure should be reported immediately to the responsible faculty or staff person associated with the WCC activity involving such exposure and to the Student Activities Coordinator and an incident report must be completed.
