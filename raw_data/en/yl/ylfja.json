Methods: The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey of 307 practicing family physicians, full-time faculty physicians, and resident physicians in Kansas from December 14, 2020, to December 31, 2020. The study participants completed an anonymous, 20-item survey assessing family physicians' concerns about exposure to COVID-19 and their perceptions of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to control SARS-CoV-2. A mixed-method approach was used to collect, analyze, and interpret the data. Results: There was a 51.1% response rate. The proportion of family physicians who reported their intentions to be vaccinated for COVID-19 was significantly higher than those who were hesitant to receive the mRNA vaccines (90.6% vs 9.4%; 2 [1, n = 307] = 201.9.1; P < .0001). Among those who were willing to be vaccinated with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, the main reasons were to prevent COVID-19 infection; protect self, family, and community; contribute to herd immunity; inspire confidence that the vaccines are safe and end the pandemic and bring life back to normal. Conclusion: Our findings suggest a significantly positive association between a physician's concerns and their willingness to be vaccinated with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. With the authorization of 2 new mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, future studies should investigate the number of physicians in our study who received the vaccine.", "sitename": "American Board of Family Medicine", "date": "2021-09-01", "cleaned_text": "Family Physicians' Perception of the New mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Samuel Ofei-Dodoo, Rick Kellerman and Taylor Russell The Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine September 2021, 34 (5) 898-906; DOI: https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.05.210052 Samuel Ofei-Dodoo From the Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita, Wichita, KS (SO-D); Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita (RK); Family Medicine Residency at Via Christi Hospitals, University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita (TR).
