(2) R educed bone mass due to a decrease in the rate of osteogenesis to the extent that there is insufficient compensation for normal bone lysis. P, QRS, T, U Heart waves as recorded in the ECG. The P wave is the initial deflection of the cardiac cycle, representing excitation of the atria. QRS is the portion of the ECG comprising the Q, R, and S waves, together representing ventricular depolarization. T wave is the deflection of the normal ECG following the QR S complex; it represents repolarization, or recovery, of the ventricles. U wave in the ECG is a small positive deflection usually immediately following the T wave but often poorly separated from it and so concealed; it is postulated to represent repolarization of the Purkinje fibers or a mechanical event such as ventricular relaxation. It is not invariably present and is most often seen in tachyarrhythmias and electrolyte disturbanc es.
