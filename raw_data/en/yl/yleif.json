N orthShore als o includes a 900 physician multispecialty group practice, N orthShore Medical Group, with 1 30 locations in the Chicagoland area. NorthShore desires to continue pr oviding clinical programs and services to meet community health needs, while also pursuing contin uous improvement in existing a nd future programs to improve the overall health of individuals in the communities it serves. As such, NorthShore has conducted a Community Health Needs Assessmen t (CHNA), using primary and sec ondary data, to ens ure community benefit programs and resources ar e focused on significant healt h needs as perceived by the community at large, as well as alignment wit h NorthShore's mission, servi ces and strategic priorities. NorthShore has defined its \"comm unity\" to include 51 zip codes within Lake and Cook Counties in Illinois. These zip codes represent the co mmunities primarily served by N orthShore's four hospitals. As an integrated health care system, t he four hospitals collectively serve the same communities and are jointly conducting this CHNA. Defining the CHNA community similarly to its primary service area will allow NorthShore to more effectively fo cus its resources to address i dentified significant health needs, targeting areas of greatest need and health disparities. NorthShore obtained input from 44 leaders representing public h ealth, major employers, public schools, social services, NorthShore l eaders and the community at-large through two focus groups and one-on- one interviews. Primary input was also obtained by conducting an online communi ty health survey distributed to members of the community. Additionally, health needs asse ssments prepa red by four local health departments serving the NorthShore community were also reviewed and conside red. Secondary data was assessed including: Demographics (population, age, sex, race) Socioeconomic indicators (household income, poverty, unemployme nt, educational attainment) Health access indicators Community health status indicators (causes of death, chronic co nditions, health behaviors, etc.) Availability of health care facilities and resources Information gathered in the abov e steps was reviewed and analyz ed to identify health issues in the community. NorthShore University HealthSystem 2 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 Based on the review and analys is by NorthShor e's leadership, th e following health issues were determined as priority health needs, divided into \"External Fac tors Impacting Community Health\" and \"Disease Conditions\", which Nor thShore will address over the ne xt three years. External Factors Impacting Co mmunity Health (rank order) Access to Behavioral Health Health Literacy and Navigating the Health Care Environment Access and Coordination of Car e (affordability, education, tra nsportation, specialty care, cultural competency) Substance Abuse Disease Conditions (rank order) Behavioral Health (mental health and substance abuse, psychiat ry and community based services) Chronic Risk Factors (prevent ion and management of obesity, to bacco use, hypertension) Alzheimer's/Dementia (prevent ion, management, caregiver suppor t, long-term care) Oral Health D i a b e t e s Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke C a n c e r Lung Health Maternal and Child Health (infant mortality, low birth weight) Populations of Focus (in alphabetical order) Caregivers Immigrants and refugees Medicaid recipients Older adults People who are uninsured or underinsured People with mental health issues Opportunities for health improve ment exist in each area. North Shore will work to identify areas where NorthShore can most effectively fo cus its resources to have sig nificant impact and develop an Implementation Strategy for 2020-2022. NorthShore University HealthSystem 3 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 How the Assessment was Conducted NorthShore conducted a community health needs assessment (CHNA) to support its mission responding to the needs in the community it serves and to comply with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and federal tax-exempti on requirements. Identified hea lth needs were prioritized in order to facilitate the effective allocati on of hospital re sources to re spond to the identified health needs. Based on current literature and other gui dance from the United States De partment of the Treasury, the following steps were c onducted as part of NorthShore's CHNA: Community benefit initiatives i mplemented over the course of t he last three year s and progress on the prior implementation strategy were evaluated. The \"community\" was defined as t he 51-zip code area primarily served by NorthShore. The CHNA community was determined by geography and is inclusive of medically underserved, low-income, minority populations and people with limited Englis h proficiency. Population demographics and socioeconomic characteristics of t he community were gathered and assessed utilizing various third party data. The health status of the community was assessed by reviewing c ommunity health status indicators from multiple source s. Health indicators with signi ficant opportunity for improvement were noted. Information on the leading causes of death and mor bidity information was also analyzed. Community input was obtained through two focus groups and seve n interviews with key stakeholders. The first focus group was conducted with members of NorthShore's community advisory committees representin g twenty-eight organizations. P articipants provided input on behalf of public health, medically underserved and minority pop ulations and the community as a whole. A second focus group was conducted with leaders from No rthShore's staff representing a wide range of departments. Community input was also obtai ned through an electronic survey distributed to the community. Findings are described in P rimary Data Assessment. Findings from community health needs assessments recently comp leted by the four public health departments that serve the NorthS hore communities were reviewed . An inventory of health care fa cilities and other community res ources potentially available to address the significant health needs identified through the CHN A was prepared. Identified health needs were then prioritized taking into acco unt community perception regarding the significance of each identif ied need as well as the ability for NorthShore to impact overall health based on alignment with No rthShore's mission and service s provided. NorthShore's leadership participated in ident ifying and prioritizing signifi cant health needs. NorthShore University HealthSystem 4 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 Limitations and Information Gaps As with all data collection effo rts, there are several limitati ons related to the assessment's research methods that should be acknowle dged. Years of the most current data available differ by data source. In some instances, 2018 may be the most current year available for data, while 2010 may be the most current year for other sources . Likewise, survey data based on self-reports, such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRF SS), should be interpreted with particular caution. In some instances, respondents may over or under r eport behaviors and illnesses ba sed on fear of social stigma or misunderstanding the question being asked. In addition, respondents may be prone to recall bias - that is, they may attempt to answer accurately, but they remember incorrectly. In s ome surveys, r eporting and reca ll bias may differ accord ing to a risk factor or health outcome of interest. D espite these limitations, most of the self-report surve ys analyzed in this CHNA, such as Behavioral Risk Fac tor Surveillance System, benef it from large sample sizes and repeated administrations, enabling comparison over time. Simila rly, while the qualit ative data collected through focus groups and the comm unity survey for this assessme nt provide valuable insights, results are not statistically representative of a larger population due to nonrandom recruiting techniques and a small sample size. Data was collected at one point in time and among a limited number of individuals. Therefore, findings, while dir ectional and descriptive, should not be interpreted as definitive.

The CHNA s ervice area was defined based on the primary geographic area served by NorthSho re which includes 51 zip codes in Lake County, northern Cook County and the north side of Chicago. Th e table below summarizes the cities, villages and communities included in the CHNA service area. Pa ge 17 of this report p rovides a summary of the communities of highest nee d in the CHNA service area. A s an integrated health care system, the organization continuously monitors health care activities in th e CHNA service area.

Table 2 below shows the total population of the communi ty. In 2017, the largest age gr oup of the CHNA community population was between the ages o f 35 and 54 at 27.6%. In general, healthcare needs in crease as age in creases. The el derly (Age 65+) popul ation represented the CHNA community. Table 2 NorthShore University HealthSystem Population by Age and Gender While the relative age of the popul ation can impact community h ealth needs, so can the ethnicity and race of a population. The followi ng table shows the population by ethnicity and race illustrating the Hispanic versus non-Hispanic re sidents. The white non-Hispanic population make s up 58.1% of the population, with Hispanic populat ion accounting for 20.1%, Asia n non-Hispanic acc ounting for 11.9%, black non-Hispanic 7. 2%, and all others at less than 3%.

This indicator is relevant because disabled individuals compris e a vulnerable population that requires targeted services and outreach b y providers. Nearly 50% of the population with a disability are age 65+. Table 4 NorthShore University HealthSystem Population with a Disability Population in Limited English Households The percentage of the populati on aged 5 and older living in Lim ited English speaking households is reported in Table 5 below. There are over 130,000 persons livi ng in Limited English households in the NorthShore community.

Source geography: TractNorthShore University HealthSystem 11 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 Socioeconomic Characteristics of the Community The socioeconomic characteristics of a geographic area influenc e the way residents access health care services and perceive the need for health care services within society. The economic status of an area may be assessed by examining mult iple variables within the comm unity. Those variables also have an impact on community health, including household income and pove rty, employment, uninsured population and educational attainment for t he community. These standard m easures will be use d to compare the socioeconomic status of the co mmunity to the state of Illinois as well as the United States. Household Income and Poverty Table 6 presents household income stati stics for the CHNA community. A verage household income for the CHNA community e xceeds state and nati onal rates. Average h ousehold income for the NorthShore CHNA Community is slightly o ver $106,000. The percentage of th e NorthShore CHNA c ommunity below 100% Federal Poverty Level (\"FPL \") is 11.0% which is favorable to state and national averages. However, there are large disparit ies in income among the segmen ts of the CHNA community. Sectors in North Chicago, Waukegan and Chicago North communities have the highest poverty levels. Within the NorthShore community , 143,489 public school students , or 36.1%, are eligible for Free/Reduced Price lunches ou t of 397,741 total students enroll ed. This indicator is relevant because it assesses populations which are m ore likely to have multiple hea lth access, health status, and social support needs. Additionally, when co mbined with poverty data, providers can use this measure to identify gaps in eligibility and enrollment Table 6 NorthShore University HealthSystem Household Income and Poverty Poverty is a key driver of health status and is relevant becaus e poverty creates barriers to access, including health services, healthy food choices and other facto rs that contribute to poor health. Poverty rates are higher for children in almost all ethnicities and rac es and the highest rates are among Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, Afr ican Americans and Hispanics.

NorthShore University HealthSystem 13 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 Uninsured Population Table 8 reports the percentage of the to tal civilian noninstitutionaliz ed population without health insurance. The uninsured populati on is relevant because lack o f insurance is a primary barrier to health care access, including regular pr imary care, specialty care and other health services that contribute to poor health status.

Education often plays a key role in career success and economic self-su fficiency. Nearly 48% of the CHNA community, over 25 years old, have bachelor's degrees or higher. How ever, within the CHNA communi ty there are 117,767 persons aged 25 and older without a high school diploma (or equivalency) or hig her. This represents 10.7% of the total population aged 25 and older and affects household income level s, insured population and levels of insurance coverage of the community. Table 9 NorthShore University HealthSystem Educational Attainment The inability to read English we ll is linked to poverty, unempl oyment, and barriers to healthcare access, communication with providers and healthy literacy. Within Nort hShore's CHNA community, the percentage of students in fourth g rade whose reading skills tes ted below the \"proficient\" level for the English Language Arts portion of the Illinoi s standardized test was 69.9% or rou ghly 4,400 students.

The CNI is strongly lin ked to variations in communi ty health care needs and is a strong indicator of a community's deman d for various health care servi ces. The CNI score is an average of five different barrier scores that measure socioeconomic indicators of each community: Income Barrier Percentage of households below poverty line, with head of hous ehold age 65 or older Percentage of families with ch ildren age 0-17 below poverty li ne Percentage of single female-he aded families with children age 0-17 below poverty line Cultural Barrier Percentage of population that i s minority (including Hispanic ethnicity) Percentage of population over age 5 that speaks English poorly or not at all Education Barrier Percentage of population over age 25 without a high school dip loma Insurance Barrier Percentage of population in the labor force, age 16 or older, without employment Percentage of population without health insurance Housing Barrier Percentage of households renting their home Based on the demographic and ec onomic statistics listed above, the CNI provides a score for every populated zip code in the United St ates on a scale of 1.0 to 5. 0. A score of 1.0 indicates a zip code with the least need, while a score of 5 .0 represents a zip code with the most need. Table 11 summarizes the CNI for zi p codes within CHNA Community . Within the CHNA community for NorthShore, CNI scores indicate needs are greatest in the zip c odes below where nearly 605,000 persons reside.

NorthShore University HealthSystem 37 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 Primary Data Assessment Primary data was obtained thr ough two focus groups, stakeholder interviews, and an online community survey described on the following pages. Two focus group s were conduct ed on December 5 and 6, 2018. One focus group was comprised of members of the Community Advis ory Committees serving each of th e hospitals of NorthShore. One-on- one interviews, via telephone, were conducted with each of the hospitals of NorthShore representing public health who were unable to attend the scheduled focus gro up. A second focu s group was conducted with 11 staff members representing a range of departm ents throughout NorthShore. In addition, one-on-one interviews w ere conducted with five NorthS hore physicians who were unable to attend the scheduled focus group. Focus groups explored five areas to identify significant health needs of the community as well as potential ways to address identified needs . The areas included 1.) healt h and quality of life; 2.) barriers to improving community health; 3.) health disparities; 4.) commun ity assets; and 5.) significant health needs. Key themes regarding significan t health issues in the community surfaced in the focus groups and interviews which are summarized below. The key themes below ar e listed in random order and is not intended to prioritize the key themes in any manner. The community has high mental health needs and mental health i s a big issue in the community. Steps need to be taken to provi de supportive services to those in need and the community needs increased training and education regarding mental health issues. When participants were asked what issues NorthShore should focus on over the next thre e years, mental health was the highest recommended priority. Challenges with navigating insurance and the healthcare system are increasing. Insurance is complicated and individuals o ften do not underst and what type o f insurance and/or which insurance network would best s uit their needs from a cost persp ective as well as location of providers. Patients also have many questions about follow-up c are, scheduling, billing and how to access supportive services . Resources to assist with these matters are scarce which leads to patients not securing appropri ate follow-up care or needed reso urces from fear of cost and frustration. Continued efforts are needed to increase access to health care , particularly for persons who are uninsured and/or have low incomes. NorthS hore has responded to this need through its support of Erie Family Health Center and expansion of urgent care sites . Access may further be expanded through additional financial assistance, mobile medici ne and referral assistance. Many different cultures are re presented in the NorthShore comm unity. Increased efforts are needed to develop relationships with immigrant and refugee popu lations and provide culturally competent care. There are many resources available to assist people with needs in the community. However, social services are somewhat dis connected and there is a genera l lack of awareness of the available resources. Centralized centers are needed in the com munity to provide information and assistance with accessing social support services. The community has a need for incr eased education on preventive care, insurance and available medical services for low-income and uninsured.

General Opinions Regardi ng Health in the Community Mental Health Mental health was consistently reported as a big issue in the c ommunity. Participants noted overall health, for many, is declining due to mental health issues. In recent years, there ha ve been increasing levels of stress in da ily lives, which has r esulted in a signif icant increase in anx iety and depression among community members. Var ious factors contribut ing to the rising problems with mental health include substance abuse and addiction, complicated family dynamics, hom elessness, and isolation. A recent program in the community known a s \"Resilient Families\" identifi ed two thirds of the population have mental health issues that are not being addressed. Participants also noted the growi ng understanding of how advers e childhood experience s, (\"A.C.E.'s\"), impact individuals throughout t heir adult life. In order to ad dress current behaviors and conditions, there is a need to put an increasing emphasis on understanding the un derlying causes behind the current behaviors and conditions. Participants noted mental health resources were scarce. One of the biggest unmet health needs in the community is the lack of mental health providers . The number o f mental health providers who accept patients with Medicaid is also extremely limited. In addition, education surrounding mental health and well-being as well as outreach regarding available mental health services within t he community are needed. Partic ipants expressed tha t programs such as Mental Health First Aid could be very valuable for the communit y and recommended that steps should be taken to offer this training for schools, employers, churches, social services and medical providers. Access to Care Participants noted the high cos t of care prohibits them from se eking care. High-deductible plans are shifting more of the cost of heal thcare to the patient. In man y cases, patients ar e unable to quantify and budget for medical treatment. Fear of the unknown and potentia lly high cost of care results in individuals delaying medical care. Participants acknowledged that N orthShore has been instrumental in helping establish Erie Family Health Center in the community, which i s providing much needed access for families and children who are uninsured or who have low incomes and are unable to afford heal thcare. Within the community, there is a large percentage of persons w ho are eligible to utilize the s ervices of Erie Family Health Center and with support from organizations, s uch as NorthShore, Erie Famil y Health Center plans to double its capacity in 2019. Participant s expressed a need for additional providers and resources serving low- income and uninsured populat ions. They suggested expanding Eri e Family Health Center into Lake County as a potential strategy to provide resources to low-inco me and uninsured populations. Focus group participants noted an increased need to deliver ser vices outside the hospital setting through mobile outreach efforts and telemedicine to create access where people need it. Navigation and Coordination of Care Focus group participants also discussed the challenges with nav igating the healthcare system. The healthcare and insurance systems are confusing and many individ uals need assistance to understand what healthcare services are available. Individuals also need education on what insurance benefits will or will not cover and how to best access needed services. Coordination of care and appropriate referrals to specialists w ere also noted a s challenges. The availability of urgent care serv ices was noted as a positive fa ctor relating to acc ess. However, once treated at an urgent care site, patients often have a difficult time securing follow-up or routine medical appointments. Increased resour ces are needed to facilitate app ropriate continuity of care for patients. NorthShore University HealthSystem 40 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 Information and Support Services NorthShore serves a large geogra phic area that is highly popula ted. Often persons in the community simply do not know where to go to obtain education or needed se rvices. The impact from budget cuts has resulted in public health no t being able to provide certain services. Educating the public on where to go for help is challenging. Focus group participants recommend ed the need for centralized hubs or resource centers throughout the community to provide consistent and non-threatening information on the available support services. Participants noted that government centers and libraries provide a natural setting for a physical location of such hubs, but there is a ne ed to provide trained and knowledgeable staff for such resource centers. In addition, there are opportuniti es for community organization s, local government, schools and employers to collaborate with N orthShore. Participants acknowl edged NorthShore is actively involved in committees throughout the community working on community health plans. Participants recommended such collaborations and partnerships be expanded. Substance Abuse Participants noted increasing ra tes of substance abuse and deat hs related to drug ov erdoses. Unhealthy habits such as binge drinking and vaping are also negatively im pacting the health of the community and contributing to increased mental health issues. S ubstance abus e affects many individuals and families and is a big concern in the community. Adult Dental Services Participants noted an increasing need for affordable adult dent istry services. 2. Underserved Populations and Communities of Need Focus group participants were asked to provide their opinions r egarding specific populations or groups of people whose health or quality of life may not be as good as ot hers. They were also asked identify underlying causes for the health disparities. Uninsured and Persons with Low-Incomes Virtually, all of the key stakehol ders identified persons livin g with low-incomes or in poverty, particularly children, as most likely to be underserved due to lack of acces s to services. Lack o f financial resources prevents persons with low-income from seeking medical care and receiving the resources they need. This population may lack the nece ssary resources or education t o recognize health problems and seek help in a timely manner. Stakehold ers acknowledged NorthShore' s expansion into the community and their efforts to establish care facilities in underserved commu nities. Continual efforts are needed to get the word out about the many resources available at NorthShore and other community resources available to the uninsured population and low-income populations. Another suggested response was for employ ers to become stewards of help ing employees access adult care. Low-Income Elderly Stakeholders also identified the low-income elderly as an under served population within the community. This population may be strugglin g financially and socially due to the high cost of living and isolation. It was also mentioned that senior s sometimes lack the ability t o carry out activities of daily living. Many seniors do not have family membe rs living nearby who can provid e needed support. Wit hout additional support, they are often not equip ped to take care of themselves when they are released from an inpatient stay at the hospital. NorthShore University HealthSystem 41 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 Additionally, older adults with cognitive impairments such as A lzheimer's or Dementia were identified as an underserved population as many are not getting the care they need. For many elderly, the cost of housing with assisted living and memory care units is more than they can afford and many remain in their homes which is unsafe and allows medical conditions to remain u ntreated. Persons with Mental Health Needs Persons with mental health issu es and drug addiction have unmet health needs because there are not a lot of services to treat and s upport them. In addition, the st igma surrounding mental health and drug addiction can limit one's abilit y to seek treatment. Drug addi cts have unmet health c are needs because often there are mental health i ssues which are not being addres sed for persons dealing with drug addiction. Immigrants and Refugees The last group of underserved perso ns noted was immigrants and refugees who live in the community. The language barrier and lack o f legal status for many of these undocumented immigrants limits the health care and social service s they are able to access. Participants noted that there ar e over 100 different languages spoken in the community. Communication and outreach needs to be culturally diverse and customized for the many different cultures and languages present in the community. Some participants suggested NorthSho re should rethink messaging in marketing materials to include more diverse faces on billboards and print materials to communicate NorthShore's commitment to serving persons with differing cultu ral backgrounds. Another suggestion was to identify leaders among the various immigrant and refugee groups to help develop relationships and trust with NorthShore and othe r available sources of suppor t in the community. 3. Barriers Key stakeholders were asked wha t barriers or problems keep comm unity residents from obtaining necessary health services and im proving health in their communi ty. Financial/Lack of Insurance The majority of the key stakeholders indicated that managing th e cost of healthcare with other needs is the biggest barrier to improvi ng health in the community. Many families are forced to choose between basic needs such as food and housi ng versus insurance. Many em ployers do not provide insurance and there is a growing number of persons who are unable to afford s uitable plans for t he coverage needed. In addition, the increase in hi gh-deductible health plans incre ases fear of unexpected costs as a result of seeking medical treatment leading many to forego going to the d octor on a regular basis or to address medical concerns. The number of providers who accept low-income patients is decre asing. For persons who are uninsured or have Medicaid, finding a provi der or certain specialists, ca n be challenging and individuals often are not able to make an appointmen t in a reasonable time. Often ho urs of operation for medical offices, diagnostic centers a nd labs prohibit these patients' ability to timely schedule appointments. Access to Care Navigating the health system is c hallenging and there is a lack of coordination with social services to assist with accessing healthcare, transporta tion issues and oth er needed suppo rt. People of all ages are overwhelmed with understanding health insurance and do not unde rstand how to access health care in the appropriate setting. Convenien t hours and locations also c ontribute to individuals seeking care from NorthShore University HealthSystem 42 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 multiple providers and not establis hing routine preventive care plans with a consistent primary care provider. Language As noted above, over 100 language s are spoken in the community. Language barriers prevent certain populations from accessing health care they need. Education an d outreach needs to be specifically designed for the multiple langua ges and cultures represented in the NorthShore community. Lack of Affordable Healthy Food Focus group participants noted the high cost of healthy food be ing a barrier to improved health in the community. Often, seniors are foregoing healthy food to pay fo r high cost of prescriptions. Children are particularly impacted by food dese rts and high cost of nutritio us food. For many children, lunch provided at school may be the only access to healthy food they have. Pa rticipants expressed challenges with providing healthy food for childre n in low-income families when school is not in session. 4. Community Assets When asked about the most signifi cant assets supporting communi ty health, focus group members mentioned the following: Erie Community Health Center The opening of Erie Community Health Center, a federally qualif ied health center has provided increased access for individuals who are uni nsured or have low-incomes in the community. Libraries and Government Centers Participants reported libraries a nd government centers as impor tant community resources that provide gathering spaces and access for community members of all ages a nd socioeconomic status. Both are valuable partners to provide information on health issues and s ocial services to the public. Collaboration and Partnerships Many organizations throughout the community are willing to prov ide assistance and collaborate to make positive changes in the community . NorthShore's Community Advi sory Committees provide a forum for organizations to work together to address community concerns. Partnerships can be expanded and increasingly utilized to distribute health information and educ ation to the community. In addition, NorthShore may want to consider promoting the many non-profit o rganizations serving the community by educating its employees on the av ailable services these nonprof its provide. 5. Significant Health Issues After the four areas a bove were discussed, participants were as ked to identify the most serious health issues facing the community. The following issues were identif ied and are not intended to indicate any ranking or priority. Access to health services fo r low-income/uninsured Need for navigation and referral assistance through the health system Lack of awareness and need for communication on what agencies/ resources are already available High mental health needs NorthShore University HealthSystem 43 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 Substance abuse Need for increased ed ucation on preventive care, insurance an d available medical services for low-income and uninsured Chronic diseases such as diabetes Issues with aging popul ation such as Alzhei mer's and Dementia Need for increased outreach to v arious immigrant and refugee p opulation, including culturally competent care Each participant was also asked to provide his/her opinion as t o the top three issues that NorthShore should focus its community benef it investments over the next 3- 5 years. The chart below summarizes their recommendations. NorthShore University HealthSystem 44 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 Focus Group and Interviews with NorthShore Staff Leaders and Physicians Table 13 NorthShore University HealthSystem NorthShore Staff Leaders - Focus Group Participants Name Title and Hospital Department Kathy Ashlevitz Director of Cardiology, Nor thShore Medical Group Tyler Bauer Vice President, North Shore Medical Group Dr. Woody Denham NorthShore Medical Group Cindy Geaslin Director, Patient Registration Linda Green Director, Kellogg Cancer Center Jeannine Herbst Assistant Vice President, Psych iatry & Behavioral Health Kevin Katz Assistant Vice President of Neurol ogy, NorthShore Medical Group Dr. Morris Kharasch NorthShore Medical Group Maria Knecht Vice President of Nursing, Glenbrook Hospital Dr. Frederick Miller NorthShore Medical Group Dolores Perez Director of Managed Care Dr. John Revis NorthShore Medical Group Mike Vernon Director of Infection Control Dr. Gregory Wallman NorthShore Medical Group Gwen Wilson Supervisor, Patient Registration, Outpatient Services Heather Woodhouse Ellis Clinical Manager, Emergency Dep artment, Highland Park Hospital 1. General Opinions Regardi ng Health in the Community Access to Specialists Focus group participants indicat ed challenges with access to sp ecialists, particularly for mental health professionals and providers who treat conditions such as diabet es. Access to Care Participants noted certain popul ations have challenges with acc essing care. Many young adults are underinsured or uninsured and do not seek care due to the poten tial costs and lack of resources to pay for services. In addition, persons with low inco mes or who are uninsured are unaware of the financial assistance that may be avail able to them. Cost of care prohibi ts individuals in the community from seeking needed medical services and more outreach is needed to educate the public on resources available in the community. Mental Health Health behaviors and outcomes for many individuals are directly linked to mental health issues that are not being addressed. Participant s expressed many in the commun ity are not addressing mental health issues because they do not under stand the linkages and there ar e not enough mental health providers in the community. High stress and limited personal resources are leading to increased rates of mental health issues within the community. NorthShore University HealthSystem 45 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 Chronic Diseases and Support Services The community is aging and NorthS hore is treating chronic disea ses at higher rates. The most prevalent health issues include chronic disease risk factors such as hype rtension and obesity. Over recent years, contact with primary care physi cians has declined and individua ls are not receiving basic screenings and check-ups which is negatively impacting health in the community . Diseases such as cancer and diabetes are going undetected and untreat ed leading to poorer outcomes a nd additional health issues for individuals. Increased communica tion and promotion of the avai lable screenings and resources are needed throughout the community. In addition, staff would bene fit from training and education on the abundant community resources that are available to provide supp ortive services in the community as they have opportunities to provide nee ded outreach to patients on a regular basis. Navigation of Care Navigating today's healthcare system is challenging and patient s have questions related to a wide range of topics including insurance, scheduling and how to access sup port services. Newly insured individuals often struggle to understand how t heir insurance plan works and individuals often do not understand what type of insurance and/or which insurance network would best sui t their needs from a cost perspective as well as location of providers . For many, the inability to obta in assistance with these issues prohibits them from taking the necessary ste ps to secure medical care. Expansion of NorthShore's urgen t care services was noted as a p ositive step in providing increased access to care. However, partici pants reported t hat once a con dition is diagnosed, through an urgent care or emergency room visit, pat ients might encounter challeng es with securing appropriate follow-up care with primary care physicians or specialists due to long wa it times for appointments or specialists who may not be accepting new patients. Today's insurance and health syste m model is complicated and mo re and more individuals are seeking assistance, but assistance is hard to find. Patients seek answ ers from multiple avenues within the healthcare system which is an inefficient and ineffective alloc ation of healthcare s ystem resources. In addition, many people are unaware o f the available resources an d assistance that is available to them. Without knowledge regarding the available resources and an unde rstanding of how to access needed services, patients are forgoing care. A centralized resource center to address the many questions pat ients have and to provide assistance with accessing resources may be a solution to this issue. 2. Underserved Populations and Communities of Need Focus group participants were asked to provide their opinions r egarding specific populations or groups of people whose health or quality of life may not be as good as ot hers. They were also asked identify underlying causes for the health disparities. Uninsured and Persons with Low-Incomes Focus group participants identif ied uninsured persons as most l ikely to be underserved due to lack of access to services. Uninsured pe rsons are often unaware of th e many available resources that are available to them throughout the community. More outreach is n eeded to provide awareness of services available for those who are uninsured. NorthShore University HealthSystem 46 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 Immigrants and Refugees Participants expressed that undo cumented persons seem terrified to seek assistance for fear of deportation. Fear of deportation also prohibits them from seek ing healthcare. In addition, there is a need for increased education and outreach, which is tailored for spe cific cultures and available in appropriate languages. Chronically Mentally Ill Persons who are chronically m entally ill often have many health issues. There are lim ited mental health providers serving the community and a lack of funding to provid e mental health services to low-income and uninsured individuals. Unvaccinated Children Unvaccinated children were also identified as a population with unmet health needs due to their risk for serious illnesses. 3. Barriers The focus group participants were asked what barriers or proble ms keep community residents from accessing necessary health service s and improving health in the ir community. The following barriers were identified in no particular order. Stigma surrounding mental health Lack of financial resources lim its access to m edical and suppo rt services Complexity of the health care sy stem impacts coordination of c are General lack of knowledge on pr eventive care, health issues an d insurance Transportation is an issue fo r persons with limited financial resources and elderly population 4. Community Assets When asked about the most signifi cant assets supporting communi ty health, focus group members mentioned the following: Strong Public Health Departments Participants reported that the local health departments are mod el health departm ents. The health departments were described as v ery engaged and active in the co mmunity and are collaboratively working with the community in health improvement efforts. Colleges and Universities Participants felt the number and qu ality of colleges and univer sity in the community provide opportunities to train and educate medical providers. Large Employers Large employers provide access to insurance for employees. In addition, large employers are important partners in providing health education and wellness programs to employees. NorthShore University HealthSystem 47 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 Strong Community Partners Participants noted that community cultural centers, senior cent ers and religious organizations provide gathering spaces and venues for community events. These and ot her community partners can be leveraged to provide health information and services to the com munity. 5. Significant Health Issues After the four areas a bove were discussed, participants were as ked to identify those issues that were the most serious health issues fa cing the community. The following issues were identified. The following list of issues is not intended to indicate any ranking or priority. C a n c e r D i a b e t e s Cardiac Disease Challenges with navigation of c are and addressing questions High mental health needs Lack of awareness o f community resources Each participant was also asked to provide his/her opinion as t o the top three issues that NorthShore should focus its community benef it investments over the next 3- 5 years.

A link to the survey was dis tributed via e-mail, social media and word of mouth to the community-at-lar ge. A total of 372 surveys wer e completed. Of the majority of respondents, 82% identified White/Caucasian, 7% identified as Black or African American, 4% identified as Hispa nic and 3% identified as Asian. The remaining 3% of respondents either identified with other racial or e thnic identities, or indicated they preferred not to answer. Respondents by Age Group: Age Group Percent of epresented 80% o f the responden ts while persons who identify as male represented 20%. The other demographics of survey respondents varied with a vari ety of household income levels, education and household size. Given the reported demographics a bove, care should be taken wit h interpreting the survey results. The ethnicities, ages and gender of s urvey respondents do not match demographics for the CHNA Community. Specifically, the surv ey reached more white/Caucasi ans and more females compared to demographic informatio n reported earlier in this report. Addit ionally fewer older adults, aged 65+, completed the survey compared to the demographics for the CHNA Community. When asked \"How much do these h ealth issues affect YOU?\" cost o f health care, awareness of healthy food choices, obesity, mental health, and access to oral health were the issues that affected respondents most. Responses to this question are summarized on the followi ng page. NorthShore University HealthSystem 49 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 When asked to rate how the same issues impacted the community, respondents identified cost of health care, mental health, substance abu se and addiction, and obesity as the issues that affected the community most. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400Smoking (Tobacco Use)Cost of Health CareObesity/OverweightChildhood ObesityHigh Blood Pressure/StrokeSubstance Healthy Food ChoicesAssistance with Navigating Healthcare SystemHow much do these health issues affect YOU?

For respondents who were unable to visit a doctor wh en needed, the primary reasons for not visiting a doctor included: challenges with getting off wo rk; difficulty in finding doctors who accept new patient s, and cost. Results from the survey questi on surrounding ability to visit a doctor when needed are shown in the charts below. NorthShore University HealthSystem 51 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 The survey asked the following two questions: \"What do you believe are the cu rrent STRENGTHS of your communi ty?\" \"What do you believe are the WEAKNESSES in your community?\" The survey provided predetermined responses that could be selec ted from the list. R espondents were instructed to mark up to five s elections. It is interesting to note that over 2,100 responses were provided for strengths of the community bu t only 1,100 weaknesses were p rovided - signaling a general feeling of optimism among survey r espondents. Below is a summary of stren gths and weaknesses identified. Strengths of the Community Weaknesses of the Community NorthShore University HealthSystem 52 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 A series of survey questions were focused on gathering informat ion regarding the community's health behaviors related to preventive vaccinations and screenings. T he following three charts summarize information for these questions. As reflected in the first cha rt below, a high percentage of respondents do not know if they are up-to-date on vaccinations, particularly f or Meningitis, Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.

H owever, opportunities exist to i nform and educate families on recommended vaccinations and their schedules. When respondents were asked to provide their opinion as to the availability of services in their community for specific populations, they i ndicated the community has fewe st resources for immigrants and refugees, people who are underinsured and p eople with mental health issue s. NorthShore University HealthSystem 54 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 Below is summary of the survey r esults regarding specific state ments regarding community health resources and health behaviors. Additional survey results: The majority of respondents, o ver 71%, have had a routine phys ical in the last year. When asked to provide their opi nion regarding the need for mor e services, respondents generally agreed that additional services ar e needed for 1) addiction and alcohol abuse, 2) home health care services, and 3) assistance with daily activities for seni ors. However, the most common answer for these questions was \"Don't know\" indicating responde nts are unaware of available services in the community. When asked where you get infor mation about health resources av ailable in your community, participants indicated they go t health information most frequen tly from the following sources: o Health professional o The internet o Family and friends o Hospital/medical center NorthShore University HealthSystem 55 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 Community Input - Summary o f Health Needs Assessments Conducted by Public Health Departments Findings from community health nee ds assessments recently compl eted by the four public health departments that serve the NorthS hore community are summarized below.

NorthShore University HealthSystem 69 Community Health Ne eds Assessment 2019 Evaluation of the Impact of Actions Taken Since the Last CHNA NorthShore implements a three-f old strategy to address the iden tified health needs of the communities that it serves as follows. 1. Community benefits programs and partnerships will address a need identified in the community health needs assessment (CHNA) conducted by NorthShore. If an i dentified health need is not to be addressed by NorthShore, rationa le will be provided. 2. Community benefits programs, i nitiatives and partnerships wi ll address a need requested by the community. 3. Community benefits programs, i nitiatives and partnerships wi ll be aligned with the guiding principles outlined in Advancing the State of the Art of Commun ity Benefits for Nonprofit Hospitals. The guiding principle s are: Disproportionate Unmet Health-Related Needs; Primary Prevention; Seamless Continuum of Care; and, Build Community Ca pacity and Community Collaboration. NorthShore places priority on pr oviding community benefits and services in the communities located nearest to our hospitals, where we believe we have the greatest capacity and responsibility to serve. Community health needs data is used in NorthShore's annual plan ning processes. Stakeholder participation is critical and in fluences NorthShore's prioritiz ation and execution o f its community benefits programs. In addition, collaborati on with local leadership all ows NorthShore to det ect urgent and growing needs that may be under-represen ted or absent from aggregate da ta, in a timely and effective manner. Lastly, collaboration with local leaders has fa cilitated the de velopment of programs and partnerships to provide real time solutions to critical health challenges.
