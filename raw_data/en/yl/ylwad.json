She is internationally renowned for her pioneering research in frontier science and energy medicine. Her main focus is research on the subtle energetics of living systems, including the human energy field, energy medicine devices, and whole-person health and healing. She has published over 100 papers and two books. Dr. Rubik presently serves on the editorial boards of Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine; Evidence-Based Integrative Medicine; and Integrative Medicine Insights. Dr. Rubik was a member of the Program Advisory Board to the Office of Alternative Medicine at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) from 1992-1997, and chaired the NIH panels on bioelectromagnetic medicine and energy healing. This was a precursor to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). In 1996, Dr. Rubik founded the Institute for Frontier Science (IFS), a non-profit corporation for research and education. She has received NIH grants and foundation funding to support her research on energy healing, diet and nutrition, and water. She teaches in Integrative Health Studies at the California Institute of Integral Studies and in the School of Mind-Body Medicine at Saybrook University, both of which are in San Francisco, and also at Energy Medicine University, in Sausalito, CA. Beverly Rubik has won several awards for her pioneering research, including the Integrity in Science award from the Weston A. Price Foundation. She serves as a consultant in the health care industry on maverick health and wellness products and as an integrative health advisor to clients. Dr. Beverly Rubik is also a practicing Integrative Health Practitioner. Dr. Rubik has carried out a number of studies on human blood using dark-field microscopy to investigate the effects of diet and also lifestyle. In her presentation at Surrey, Dr. Rubik showed compelling evidence in micro-photographs of freshly drawn live blood that revealed major differences in red blood cell aggregates and clotting factors in those consuming a natural whole foods diet compared to those consuming the standard modern diet. This presentation also showed some individual cases of how blood is altered at the microscopic level by what we consume. For example, the blood of a female subject who consumed mostly carbonated sugary sodas as her main beverage for over 30 years showed numerous microbial forms and irregularly shaped red blood cells. Dr. Rubik conducted a study with funding from the Weston A. Price Foundation to investigate how the blood of subjects looked, consuming either the Weston A. Price Foundation diet or the modern conventional Western diet. The Weston A. Price Foundation diet emphasizes no processed foods and a nutrient-rich diet of whole natural foods without preservatives, pasture-raised meat, wild fish, free-range eggs, plenty of traditional saturated fats, fresh fruits and vegetables, fermented foods and beverages, raw and cultured raw milk and cheeses, and filtered water for cooking and drinking. There were 16 participants in the study in two groups matched by age. Eight participants consumed the Weston A. Price diet, and eight consumed a conventional organic diet (that included processed foods) for two years prior to testing. There was also an allowance given for persons in the Price group to consume up to 10% of their diet in restaurants. Dr. Rubik showed, through blood micro-photography, that the consumption of the Weston A. Price Foundation diet was better than a mainstream organic diet, as their blood showed reduced clotting factors indicating reduced systemic inflammation. Those on the Weston A. Price Foundation diet had far healthier blood with well-formed, free-floating red blood cells, white blood cells that were motile, and a cleaner plasma, indicating a better \"biological terrain.\" The biological terrain is the \"soil\" of the body in which all of the cells live, which is one holistic indicator of overall wellness. Dr. Rubik also talked about an additional study she conducted in which she found that consumption of un-marinated fresh pork caused a high amount of early clotting in the blood, although cured pork products such as bacon and ham did not. She concluded there may be a sound nutritional basis for certain religious proscriptions against pork. In the second part of her talk, Dr Rubik discussed the effects of lifestyle on the blood including chronic stress, which also produces the same systemic inflammation implicated in chronic disease. She also showed how long-term antibiotic usage affects the blood. She discussed how to deal with lifestyle choices on a daily basis to improve one's health. Rubik also talked about the benefits of drinking \"good water\" \u2014 water that is filtered, alkaline, and ionized. On testing, alkaline ionized water has substantially better effects on the blood than water drawn straight from the tap or bottled. She described bottled water as \"dead,\" having low vitality, and potentially containing plasticizers, chemicals implicated in causing cancer. As we get older we tend to feel less thirsty so we may not be drinking enough water. It is important to keep up our daily intake of water, she said, especially early in the morning, between meals, and after exercise. There was a large audience in the main room for Dr. Rubik's presentation, which was received with interest and enthusiasm. The program went into overtime with numerous questions from the audience, and Dr. Rubik stayed on to talk further with those who remained. "}
