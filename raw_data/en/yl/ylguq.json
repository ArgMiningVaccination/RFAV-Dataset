On April 14th Governor Brown announced a [public health framework](/gov/admin/Pages/eo_20-22.aspx) for restarting public life and business in Oregon. This plan outlines the necessary tasks, discrete steps and guidelines for step-by-step reopening. Among those important tasks is a look at how and when to resume non-emergent and elective procedures requiring personal protective equipment (PPE) . Several of you have reached out to the Board asking for guidance for reopening your clinic and asking what is required of you under the Governor's Order. The Governor, through the Oregon Health Authority, provide guidance on the Governor's Executive Orders. On April 23, 2020 OHA released a [framework for restarting non-emergent and elective procedures](https://sharedsystems.dhsoha.state.or.us/DHSForms/Served/le2322P.pdf) in medical and dental offices that require PPE, including priorities, required steps and specific criteria. I hope you all find this is helpful. Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Board staff will primarily work remotely for the duration of the order, therefore, email is the most efficient mode of communication at this time. We appreciate your patience. In Health; Mary-Beth Baptista - Executive Director Oregon Board of Naturopathic Medicine 800 NE Oregon Street, Suite 407 Portland OR 97232 971/673-0193 main 971/673-0226 (fax) *********************************************************************************************************************************************** Email sent 4/14/2020: Hello All, Licensees and other stakeholders are sending me valuable feedback and further questions regarding out of state licensure requirements and telemedicine. I am sharing some of these questions, and my answers, in hopes of clarifying and to further advise on the intent / operation of state statutes, rules and regulations. I understand you are receiving a lot of emails from the Board. I appreciate your patience as we get through this together! I hope you find the guidance helpful. Q1: If the doctor is located in Oregon and has an Oregon license, why does it matter where the patient it located? The doctor's work is assessing and creating the treatment plan, and if the doctor is in Oregon while they are doing that work, then why doesn't the Oregon license cover that work? Oregon licensure regulations establish standards for competency to ensure and enhance public safety by protecting patients / individuals treated in the State of Oregon. Per the OBNM Mission Statement: The mission of the Oregon Board of Naturopathic Medicine is to regulate, through the Oregon Revised Statutes and Administrative Rules, the practices of naturopathic medicine in order to ensure protection of the public. We promote excellence in the practice of naturopathic medicine by assuring quality education, regulating naturopathic practices, and fostering ongoing public outreach. In this manner, the Board cultivates public trust and safety by ensuring the State of Oregon is served by naturopathic professionals providing the highest standards of care. Q2: How does getting an additional license in the state the patient is physically located actually improve the care the patient is receiving? How does this rule actually help make an out-of-state patient safer or get better care or make doctors better practitioners? Licensure requirements (rules) vary by state. It is the responsibility of each state government / regulatory agency to impose licensure regulations that protects patients and enhances safety for the members of the public in their state. Every regulated state has sole jurisdiction to determine their respective licensure regulations. Each state also determines what level of regulation is necessary to maintain their competency standards for licensure during this state of emergency. [Oregon, Hawaii, California, and Montana](/obnm/Pages/Emergency%20Licensure%20by%20State%20States-Emergency-Plan.aspx), have a statute or rule that allows emergency licensure if an applicant is licensed in a state that has equivalent licensure regulations. However, if the applicant is from a state that does not have equivalent licensure regulations, or their respective state does not have licensure at all, the applicants may not qualify for an emergency license in those states. Q3: Why is the location of the patient at the time of care determine \"jurisdiction\" when it is the Oregon licensee \"practicing medicine\"? The purpose of licensure regulations is protection of the public. Oregon does not have the jurisdiction / authority to determine what licensure requirements will protect members of the public physically located in another state. No other state regulatory agency may impose (or relax) Oregon licensure requirements to treat patients physically located in Oregon. It is the sole decision and responsibility of each state government / regulatory agency to determine what regulations will adequately protect the members of the public in their state. Q4: The \"physical location\" rule creates a huge restriction to the expansion of telemedicine and medical care, is there a way Oregon licensees can practice in another state with only an Oregon license, but with restrictions or caveats to providing that telemedicine that recognize the limitations that are inherent to telemedicine? Practice of medicine being defined by the physical location of the patient is NOT AN OREGON RULE. All state regulations begin and end at their respective state borders. Governor Brown, the Oregon Legislature and OBNM are doing our best to break down regulatory barriers IN OREGON. OBNM has a widely publicized streamlined emergency licensure application process for out of state licensees so that they may continue to provide care for their patients physically located in the State of Oregon during this emergency. Unfortunately, not all states are able or willing to do the same. Any regulatory limitations or restrictions (that are understandably frustrating) in another state, is solely due to the statutes, rules and regulations in THAT STATE. For example, at this time, AZ does not have any form of emergency licensure and WA limits out of state licensees to an emergency volunteer registry. Neither Governor Brown, the Oregon Legislature or OBNM has the authority or jurisdiction to impose or revise regulations in Arizona, Washington, or any other state. I hear and empathize with your frustration and concerns for your patients not physically located in Oregon. Again, and unfortunately, the only solution I can offer is to direct you to our website for emergency licensure regulations by state, and advise you to contact the state agency in which your patient is physically located with your questions regarding any regulatory questions / restrictions. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any further questions regarding Oregon regulations and treating patients physically located in Oregon. Per Governor Kate Brown's [Executive Order 20-12](https://oregon.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=41b11f32beefba0380ee8ecb5&id=28a82637e2&e=daa9dae63d), the Oregon Board of Naturopathic Medicine is closed to the public.

All state regulations end at the border of each state. That is true for every state. At this time, every regulated state views the physical location of the patient (whether in person or telemedicine) as the location of care for the purposes of licensure. OBNM/Oregon statutes and rules DO NOT keep Oregon licensees from practicing in another state. OBNM/Oregon statues and rules only apply to practice IN OREGON. To determine whether you can practice in another state - you have to check the licensure regulations / restrictions in state you want to practice. When Or. Governor Brown declared the state of emergency - it triggered Oregon Administrative Rule [850-030-0055](https://secure.sos.state.or.us/oard/viewSingleRule.action?ruleVrsnRsn=215584) Practice in Oregon by Out-of-State Naturopathic Physicians In the Event of an Emergency - which allows out of state licensees to apply to OBNM for an emergency OR license with full privileges to practice in Oregon for the duration of the emergency. Other states have similar emergency licensure provisions. Please see our website for the [Emergency Licensure Provisions by State](/obnm/Pages/Emergency-Licensure-by-State.aspx) - As you will see, California, Hawaii, Montana have similar emergency licensure provisions as Oregon. Washington does not, they have An Emergency Volunteer Registry. On Wed. April 8, I spoke with the ED for the WA Board of Naturopathic Medicine, she is checking with her AG's office to determine whether or not WASHINGTON REGULATIONS allow Oregon, or other out of state licensees, to engage in telemedicine to established patients in Washington. [LICENSEES WHO WANT TO PRACTICE IN WA - MUST CONTACT WASHINGTON BOARD FOR UPDATES TO THEIR REGULATIONS.](https://www.doh.wa.gov/LicensesPermitsandCertificates/ProfessionsNewReneworUpdate/NaturopathicPhysician) The OBNM and Governor Brown do not have jurisdiction in Washington or any other state to determine what is required to practice in that state.

Naturopathic Physicians licensed in the State of Oregon do not have to establish care through an in-person appointment prior to engaging in telemedicine. Oregon licensees may engage in telemedicine with a new patient that they have not previously seen in person. Oregon licensees may only treat patients who are physically in the State of Oregon at the time of treatment through telemedicine.

As I noted in my message earlier this week, the Board is fielding multiple inquiries from licensees regarding how to handle their practice in light of the rapidly changing situation. Many of you have also contacted our office with specific concerns regarding how your colleagues are messaging and advertising during this pandemic. As it should come as no surprise to you, this concern is not limited to Oregon, but is being heard by regulatory agencies across the country. On / about March 24, 2020, I sent to all Oregon Licensees a \"Template Language Guidelines for Naturopathic Providers During the COVID-19 Pandemic\" created by the Federation of Naturopathic Regulatory Authorities [https://fnmra.org/](https://fnmra.org/). FNMRA is reputable organization, a trusted resource and their information and insight is valuable to all licensees. The function of FNMRA, established in 2011, is to facilitate communication between regulatory authorities, share best practices, and support licensure. Since this crisis began, licensees have repeatedly asked for guidance and support, which is exactly why this document was distributed, in the same manner I have shared messages from the Governor, Oregon Health Authority, CDC and other state regulatory agencies. [https://www.oregon.gov/obnm/Pages/COVID-19.aspx](/obnm/Pages/COVID-19.aspx) TO BE CLEAR: Oregon Licensees are bound by Oregon Revised Statutes and Administrative Rules regarding advertising. The US Constitution also guarantees the right to freedom of speech. These are ONLY GUIDELINES, not regulations, statutes or administrative rules, and have NO disciplinary authority. This same document was sent to regulatory agencies across the country, for the sole purpose of equipping and supporting ND's with best practices in communicating with peers, patients and the public during this pandemic. This document was developed by and in conjunction with the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) and the Institute for Natural Medicine along with input from the World Naturopathic Federation.
