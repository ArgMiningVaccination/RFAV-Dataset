How can you boost your immune system naturally? Read this!", "sitename": "Meet Dr. Lauryn", "date": "2019-03-07", "cleaned_text": "Approximately 80% of our immune system is produced in the gut. The Bottom Line: Our immune health is a direct reflection of what is going on in the inside (our gut health and foods we eat). Immune Health=Inflammation Immune conditions (from allergies, to autoimmune conditions, acne, breakouts, eczema, psoriasis, colds and flu's etc.) are a sign of \"inflammation\" in the body. What causes chronic inflammation? It starts in the gut. The Gut is the Root of Your Immune System Eighty percent of our body's health and immunity is produced in your gut, making our gut health a crucial component to maintaining a low level of inflammation in the body. When our gut is not healthy our body has a difficult time eradicating inflammation, allowing greater room for an \"immune response\" to occur\u2014from skin breakouts, to allergies, colds, the flu, autoimmune disease and more. What to do about it? Boost your immune system...in your gut! Love Your Gut to Boost Your Immune System It all starts with anti-inflammatory gut-loving foods, supplements and lifestyle choices that help create less internal stress for a chronic \"immune response\" to occur. After all, inflammation is not a bad thing, but when inflammation persists (chronic inflammation) without the ability to recover or your immune cells go into \"hyperactive\" (overdrive) mode is when \"immune issues\" (like skin breakouts, autoimmune conditions, allergies, and more occur. Want a stronger immune system? Here are more than 50+ nutrition, supplement and lifestyle essentials that go beyond expensive face washes, allergy shots, steroids, and Benadryl. 50+ Ways to Boost Your Immune System Naturally Natural Immune Boosting Foods Eat These Superfoods Incorporate these foods on a regular basis in your diet: - Wild-caught fatty fish (1 lb./week) &/or extra virgin cod liver oil - Fermented Foods - low-sugar kombucha - kefir (coconut, water) - Kvass - fermented yogurt & coconut yogurt - sauerkraut - kimchi - Fermented veggies - Prebiotic fiber - cooked & cooled potatoes/sweet potatoes; - cassava; - coconut flour; - green artichoke; - asparagus; - & fibers turnips, beets, squash, roasted carrots) - garlic/onion (as tolerated); - Apples, green-tipped bananas & berries - Meat Stock or Bone Broth. 1 cup/day - Dark Leafy Greens (raw and cooked. Mix it up) - Pastured egg yolks - Organic organ meats - Grass-fed, pastured meats/poultry - Fermented dairy (only if tolerated) Remove Foods That Trigger an Immune Response (\"AIP\") For at least 30-60 days, take a break from rice, pasta, bread, ancient grains) - Legumes (peanuts, black beans, chickpeas, lentils, pinto beans, etc.) - Coffee - Soy - Alcohol - Chocolate - Nightshades (white potatoes, eggplants, tomatoes, bell peppers, spices derived from peppers like paprika & chili powder, sweet and white corn, hemp, millet, barley, amaranth, rye, sesame, sorghum, spelt) - Refined sugars and oils - Nuts and seeds (almond, walnuts, cashews, quinoa, pumpkin seeds, flax, chia, etc.) - Food additives and chemicals - NSAIDS (asprin, ibuprofen) - Sugar Boosting Gut Health Not to sound like a broken record, but your gut holds the key to good skin health: Probiotics Probiotics help regulate and balance the immune system as well as promote the function of T regulatory cells. Think of probiotics as \"immune regulators,\" not increasing the number of beneficial bacteria in the gut, but instead fine-tuning and regulating the immune system. (Prebiotics help increase the number of probiotics. Find In: Supplements: Soil based formulas are often best tolerated by most people until you've assessed whether or not you have bacterial overgrowth through gut testing (stool, SIBO, urine organic acids testing); Foods: Fermented foods, Prebiotic foods (see list above) Pre-biotics Feed healthy bacteria that's already in the gut and will increase those levels over time.

Biofilms are often overlooked when working on gut healing. Most bacteria are present in biofilms, not as single-acting cells. Biofilm is like the \"steel armor\" of some gut bacteria. When individual yeast, pathogens and parasites attach to a surface, such as the GI tract, they clump together into a matrix and create a colony. Larger colonies can contain different species, creating very complex structures.This matrix forms a type of shield (biofilm) around the clump making the microorganisms hiding inside hard to detect in testing, and difficult to address. If unaddressed, biofilm can prevent your \"gut healing\" herbs and protocol from working. Find In: Supplements (some of these are found in antimicrobial herbs as well).

Natural Immune Boosting Lifestyle Hacks Eliminate Stressors. Stress may worsen or provoke many skin conditions, especially autoimmune-related skin issues Commit to regular (daily/weekly) stress management practice such as [meditation](https://drlauryn.com/hormones-metabolism/heal-insomnia-in-adrenal-fatigue/), deep breathing, yoga, prayer, time in nature, acupuncture, journaling, etc. Get Enough Sleep. Lack of sleep activates the stress response, in turn activating how we experience stress most. (For some of us, that is sleep). Exercise Regularly...But Don't Overdo It. Both overdoing it or under-doing it can create stress for your body. Aim for a mix of cardio and resistance exercises (e.g., walking/jogging and weight lifting) three to five days per week. Regular exercise can increase glutathione levels (antioxidant boosting chemical) Exercise also releases endorphins (\"feel good\" chemicals that cause the \"runner's high\" and also regulate the immune system). Use Toxin Free Products. Not all \"natural\" skin care options are created equal. We need to update the 1938 law that gives the FDA almost no authority to regulate cosmetics. Today, companies are allowed to put nearly any chemical into personal care products sold in the US\u2014even known carcinogens\u2014without any safety testing, and without disclosing all the chemicals on labels. Each day, the average American woman uses about a dozen personal care products containing more than 100 chemicals that we ingest, inhale, and absorb through our skin, so they end up inside us. Use resources like the [Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep Database](http://www.ewg.org) and Think Dirty phone app to choose truly green products, and when in doubt, good ol' food-based sources (like apple cider vinegar, honey, coconut oil, olive oil, castle soap and water go a long way). Filter Your Shower Water. Similar to how tap water is not so great for our gut, the same thing goes for the water in which we bathe. Sun Exposure. Vitamin D is a natural immune system booster. Ideally our Vitamin D levels should be between 35-60 ng/mL. Supplementation can also be helpful if you fall below that level. Do you have any favorite immune system boosting secrets?
