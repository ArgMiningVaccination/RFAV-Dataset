Naturopathy : Naturopathy is an art and science of healthy living and a drugless system of healing. The morbid matter theory, concept of vital force and other concepts upon which Naturopathy is based are already available in old texts. The revival of Naturopathy started in India by translation of Germany's Louis Kuhne's book \"New Science of Healing\" . Naturopathy is a system of man building harmony with the constructive principles and forces of Nature. It has great health promotive, disease preventive and curative as well as restorative potential and effect. Types of Naturopathy 1. Diet Therapy 2. Fasting Therapy 3. Mud Th erapy Unani System of Medicine Unani : Unani system originated in Greece. The foundation of Unani system was laid by Hippocrates. In India, Unani System of Medicine was introduced by Arabs and Persians sometime around the eleventh century. Four humors balance theory.(Dam (blood), Balgham (phlegm), Safra (yellow bile) and Sauda (black process in Unani system is dependent on observation and physical examination. Any illness of a person is to be regarded as a product of: 1.The kind of temperament, and strength of faculties he has; 2.The type of factors operating on him from outside. Unani medicine has the following main types of treatment. 1.Regimental therapy 2. Diet therapy 3.Pharmacotherapy 4.Surgery Siddha System of Medicine Siddha: Siddha system is one of the oldest systems of medicine in India. The term Siddha means achievements and Siddhars were saintly XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 1.indd 17 1/11/2020 1:59:14 PM18 1 | Home Nursingpersons who achieved results in medicine. The Siddha System is largely therapeutic in nature. According to its tradition it was Lord Shiva who unfolded the knowledge of Siddha system of medicine to his concert Parvati who handed it down to Nandi Deva and he then to Siddhas. This principles and doctrines of this system, have a close similarity to Ayurveda, with specialization in Iatro- chemistry. According to this system the human body is the replica of the universe and so are the food and drugs irrespective of their origin. This system considers the human body as a conglomeration of three humors, seven basic tissues, waste products of the body (feces, urine and sweat). The Siddha system is capable to treating all types of disease other than emergency cases specially skin and venereal diseases. Homoeopathy Homoeopathy is the youngest of all these medicinal system, yet rapidly growing and is being practiced almost all over the world. The word 'Homoeopathy' is derived from two Greek words, Homois meaning similar and pathos meaning suffering. It is based on the natural law of healing- \"Similia Similibus Curantur\" which means \"likes are cured by likes\" . It was given a scientific basis by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843) in the early 19th century. During illness the whole person is in a state of imbalance. Homoeopathic remedies are potentized substances carrying information/ energy force that acts on vital force. Once that vital force is balanced, the person heals himself. Homoeopathic medicines are bio-energetic substances with similar resonance or vibration, matched to the person's state of imbalance. Homoeopathic remedies are diluted beyond Avogadro's number so there are no chemical side-effects. Potentization= Highly diluting a substance in alcohol or distilled water, stirring it in fixed number of times in precise directions and striking a pestle against a mortar certain times. Two type of treatments 1. Acute, 2. Chronic CONCLUSION The term \"Community Health\" has replaced the term \"Public Health\" in many countries. It is because of the changing nature of Public Health that focuses on individual responsibility and community participation. Environment consists of two main components viz., internal and external environment. Purification of water: Impure water may be purified by two main methods, viz., natural methods and artificial methods. Air pollution in a community may be due to industrial process,Combustion, Motor vehicles & Miscellaneous. Ventilation is the modern concept implies not only the removal of vitiated air and replacement of fresh air but also control of the quality of incoming air in relation to its temperature, humidity and purity with a view to provide a thermal environment that is comfortable. The common and very vital problems due to improper disposal of excreta are Soil pollution, Water pollution ,Contamination of foods ,Rapid fly breeding. Housing is defined as 'physical structure that man uses for shelter and the environs of that structure including all necessary services, facilities equipment and devices needed or desired for the physical and mental health and the social well-being of the family and the XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 1.indd 18 1/11/2020 1:59:14 PM1 | H ome Nursing19individual. Insecticides are defined as chemical substances, which are used to destroy the arthropods in the form of powder, liquid, gas, spray and painting with residual action.

Classification of disease Communicable Non communicable The condition or disease not caused by infections agents. Eg: Heart attacks, strokes, Diabetes.The causative organism Spreading from one person to another or from animals toPeople. Eg : Typhoid , Malaria , Dengue. Communicable Diseases A communicable disease is an illness that is transmitted from a person , animal , or inanimate source of another person either directly , with the assistance of an intermediate host or by a vector . communicable disease present in an epidemic, endemic and pandemic . Construct epidemiologic cycle for any three communicable disease.STUDENT'S ACTIVITYAgent HostVector Environment Epidemic cycleIs the introduction of a new Infection or the presence of illness in excess of normal expectancy. this can be seasonal Eg: In/f_luenzaAn endemic disease is constantly present in a geographical area or population group. Eg :Malaria Pandemic is an epidemic of infectious diseases that has spread across a large region, or even worldwide.EPIDEMICENDEMIC PANDEMIC XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 1. Incubation period The time taken to show the first clinical symptoms to appear after infection. 2. Vector Any living carrier that carries and transfers an infectious agent into another living organism is known as vector. E.g: Flies, Mosquito. 3. Isolation Separation of an infected organism, after the development of infection, from other organism, for a period of communicability. 4. Host A person or an animal harbours the infectious agent. Definitive Host Intermediate Host Host in which the parasite achieves the sexual maturityThe host develops the parasite. But does not attains sexual maturity 5. Infectious A communicable disease which is caused by an infection. 6. Infection Is the invasion and multiplication of disease-causing agents, which leads the tissue damage. 7. Infectious agent All infection causing agents are known as infectious agents. E.g : Virus, Bacteria, Nematodes, Arthropods etc.8.

It's a method they use for seeking attention from humans. 2.6.1 Anthrax Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by the spore forming bacterium Bacil- lus anthracis. Primarily a disease of herbivorous animals, but it can infect all mammals including humans. The B. Anthracis spores can be found in animal products such as wool, hair, hides, skins, bones, meal and the carcasses of infected animals. The spores can survive in the soil for many years. Causative organism Bacillus anthracis Incubation period 1 to 7 days Up to 60 days post exposure Modes of transmission There are three main modes of transmission: Dire ct contact XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 2.indd 41 Airborne Gastrointestinal infection Signs and symptoms Cutaneous infection Malaise Fever Headache Respiratory infection Cyanosis Shock Death Nausea Loss of Appetite Vomiting Abdominal pain Toxemia Risk factors Workers who come into contact with animal hides Workers involved in the handling of dead animals Diagnosis Identification of the typical Gram positive bacilli of Bacillus anthracis from skin lesions Respiratory secretions Management Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. Mild cases of cutaneous anthrax may be effectively treated with oral Penicillin or tetracycline Treatment of inhalation or gastrointestinal anthrax requires high dose intravenous Penicillin Preventive Measures Controlling anthrax in livestock Preventing gastrointestinal anthrax by forbidding the sale of meat from sick animals or animals that have died of the disease Regu lar cleaning and disinfection of the workplace Disinf ecting animal products Processing hides, wool, and bone by tanning, dyeing, carbonizing or using acid treatment Admini stering vaccines Good hygiene practice (hand washing avoiding hand to eye/mouth contact) and need to cover cuts and abrasions. 2.6.2 Tetanus Tetanus is caused by the infection of wounds by bacterium Clostridium tetani, which produces toxin that damages the ner - vous system and muscles Causative organism: Bacterium Clostridium Tetani 1/11/2020 2:25:26 PM2 | Communicable Diseases 42 Lockjaw an inability to open the mouth wide Firmn ess of the Abdominal muscles Painful muscle spasm Cardiac arrhythmia High blood pressure Diagnosis Diagnosis is entirely clinical Clos tridium tetani is recovered from the wound in only 30% of patients Management Careful wound cleaning is essential when treating any wound. Protection against tetanus with vaccine Analgesic should be administered to prevent pain. Antibiotic therapy (Metronidazole or Penicillin) Patients with mild muscular spasms may be treated with infusions of diazepam Preventive methods: Tetanus can never be eradicated because the spores are always present in the soil Good personal hygiene Cleanin g wound properlyPeople of all ages need Tetanus Vaccines DTaP for young children /lozenge6 2,4 and 6 months /lozenge6 15 through 18 months /lozenge6 4 through 6 yearsTdap for preteens /lozenge6 11 through 12 yearsTd for adults /lozenge6 Ever y 10 years Opisthotonos Bridge or Arch like position, spasm of the muscles causing backward arching of the head, neck and spine in severe tetanus.2.7 DISEASE TRANSMITTED THRO UGH CONTACT Disease which are transmitted from person to person through intimate control is called sexually transmitted disease ( STD) STD'S are dangers because they are easily spread.

Preventive measures Safe sex practice Having sex with mutually monogamous, unaffected partner XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 2.indd 45 1/11/2020 Diseases 46Common Control measures of communicable disease Wash your hands before and after contact with an infected person. All bodily fluids from the infected person are considered contagious. Hand washing is one of the most standard ways to avoid infection.Wash your hands throughly. Wash for the appropriate amount of time, or use hand sanitizer. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer can kill microorganism. Take precautions against diseases that are transmitted through direct contact. Gloves create a barrier between your hands and any infected surface. Wear Goggles, Wear Gown. Take precautions against diseases that are spread through droplets. Wear a face mask in case the person sneezes or coughs. When a person sneezes or coughs, microorganisms can be projected into the air. Face masks can still help to protect. Protect yourself from airborne diseases.N95 face mask that can protect you against these tiny airborne dis- eases. Keep the person special room at the hospital. Get vaccinated against communicable diseases when possible. Vaccin ation process involves exposing you to a controlled amount of the virus Immune system gains the ability to fight the virus. Talk to your doctor about what vaccines may be available for the diseases in your specific area. Vaccine yourself, if you are planning on traveling to areas that have communicable disease. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 2.indd 46 1/11/2020 2:25:31 47 Clean your house throughly. Mops and buckets are considered one of the dirtiest tools at home Use two buckets when mopping. One for the detergent and one for rinsing. Ensure proper waste management. Spoiled foods must be properly disposed of and trash cans should be kept sealed at all times to avoid attracting pests like rodents and cock-roaches. Garbage also can be a place for microorganisms to thrive in. Remove any stagnant water from around your home. Stagnant water can be a place for mosquitoes and other intermediate carriers of communicable diseases. Avoid drinking contaminated water. Water should be brought to a boiling point for at least 15 minutes before removing it from the fire. This ensures that microorganisms in the water are killed. Avoid eating street foods. It is hard to know how street foods have been prepared, so try to avoid them as much as possible. If food is undercooked, or prepared in dirty environments, there is a good chance that it could cause you to get sick. Practice safe sex. Ther e are communicable diseases that can be transmitted through unprotected sexual intercourse. If you are sexually active, use a condom because it can serve as a physical barrier between your genitals and bodily fluids. Avoid sharing personal items. This in cludes eating utensils, toothbrush, razor, handkerchiefs and nail clippers. These items are potential sources of harmful microorganisms. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 2.indd 47 1/11/2020 2:25:31 PM2 | Communicable Diseases 48 Increase your self-awareness. Watch the news and keep track of any outbreaks of communicable diseases in your area. Maintain a good understanding of how those diseases are transmitted. Understand that there must be a causative agent . Know that there must be a reservoir of infection. Be aware that there must be a portal of exit Recognize the different modes of transmission. Dire ct contact - the infection is transferred from person to person. Indirect contact - the infection is transferred when a person comes in contact with a contaminated object. Droplet spread - the infection is transferred through respiratory secretions. Understand that there must be a portal of entry Be aware that the microorganism must have a susceptible host Know that avoiding communicable diseases is best done by breaking the chain of infection XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 2.indd 48 1/11/2020 2:25:32 PM2 | Communicable Diseases 49Role of Nurse in the Communicable Disease Management Health promotion using the T ALK approach T - TELL a bout healthy life style to practice all the hygienic practices.

L - LEAD co llective community action to reduce the risk factor by working with community based organisation. K - KNO W more about health promotion and healthy life style to reduce risk. Hands of health staff and visitors should be washed after contact with the patient. Precautions should be put in palace immediately. Put t he patient in a single room. Place a sign board on the entrance to alert all stuff and visitors. Hands of health staff and visitors should be washed after contact with the patient. Clinic al waste should be disposed carefully. Minim al equipment and supplies should be taken. Appropriate treatment of the patient is essential. Clos e and regular observation of vital signs of patient. Watch for any complications. Health education must be given according to the infection. CONCLUSION Communicable diseases are transmittable from one person to another person, with the help of the agent like water, air, parasites, Animals and through human. These are the carriers of disease and spread in epidemically, endemically and pandemically communicable disease are preventable with proper management and by acquiring knowledge on the disease condition, what is the disease, and what are symptoms, causes and preventive measures and treatment regimen. In order to control the communicable disease, all should know the common control measures and how to practice the measure in day today life.Demonstrate an understanding of how non-curable infections, including HIV and Hepatitis C infections, are transmitted and how these infections influence the health and identities of self, family, and community.STUDENT'S ACTIVITY XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 2.indd () -The substances or chemicals that can kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria.

Non communicable diseases are usually caused by genetic or lifestyle factors. Four types of NCDs Cardio vascular diseases Cancer Diabetes and Chronic respiratory diseases. Physical activity, low fruit and vegetable intake, high fast food consumption and cholesterol, smoking and alcohol are predominant causes of non communicable disease. NCDs NON COMMUNICABLE DISEASES Metabolic and behavioural risk factors are most common causes of non communicable diseases. NCDs can refer to chronic diseases which last for long periods of time and progress slowly. The life styles and behaviour patterns of people are changing rapidly these are being favourable to the onset of chronic disease. 3.2 a protrusion of an organ, tissue or structure through the wall of the cavity in which it is normally contained. Causes 1. Congenital weakness of the abdominal wall. 2. Acquired causes (traumatic injury, aging). 3. Increased intra-abdominal pressure due to heavy lifting, obesity, pregnancy, straining and chronic coughing. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 3.indd 55 1/11/2020 2:36:17 of hernia 1. Reducible: The protruding mass can be placed back into the abdominal cavity. 2. Irreducible: the protruding mass cannot be moved back into the abdomen. 3. Incarcerated: An irreducible hernia in which the intestinal flow is completely obstructed. 4. Strangulated: An irreducible hernia in which the blood and intestinal flow are completely obstructed. Develops when the loop of intestine in the sac becomes twisted or swollen and a constriction is produced at the neck of the sac. Classification of hernia by site 1. Inguinal hernia Hernia into the inguinal canal (more common in males.) Indirect inguinal hernia: Due to weakness of the abdominal wall at the point through which the spermatic cord emerges in the male and the round ligament of uterus in the female. Through this opening the hernia extends down, the inguinal canal and often into the scrotum or the labia. Dire ct inguinal Hernia into two femoral canals appearing below the inguinal ligament that is below the groin. 3. Umbilical hernia Protrusion of part of the intestine at the umbilicus due to failure of umbilical orifice will close. It occurs most often in obese women, in children and in patients with increased intra abdominal pressure from cirrhosis and ascites. 4. Ventral (or) incisional 2:36:17 PM3 | Non Communicable Diseases 57may occur after impaired healing of incision due to infection. 5. Diaphragmatic (or) hiatus hernia (or) oesophageal hernia It is the protrusion of a part of the stomach that slides or follows the normal path of the esophagus and enters into the thoracic cavity through an enlarged hiatal opening. Signs and Symptoms 1. Bulging over herniated area when patient stands or strains, and disappears when supine. 2. Hernia tends to increase in size and recurs with intra abdominal pressure. 3. Strangulated hernia presents with pain, vomiting, swelling of hernia sac, peritoneal irritation and fever. 4. In hi atus hernia the patient complaints of heart burn after large meals and during the night, food may be regurgitated. Diagnosis 1. Based on signs and symptoms. 2. Abdominal X-rays: Reveals abnormally high level of gas. 3. Laboratory studies: Complete blood count and electrolytes may show haeconcentration (increased hematocrit), dehydration (increased or decreased sodium) and leucocytosis.Management Mechanical A truss is an appliance with a pad and belt that is holding snugly over a hernia to prevent abdominal contents entering the hernial sac. Surgical management 1. Recommended to correct hernia before strangulation. 2. Strangulation of hernia is an emergency condition that necessitates emergency laparotomy. Herniorrhaphy Rem oval of hernial sac, contents replaced into the abdomen, layers of muscle and fascia sutured. Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy is a possibility is often performed on outpatient basis. Hernioplasty Involves reinforcement of surturing (often with mesh) for extensive hernia repair. Strangulated Strangulated hernia requires resection of ischemic bowel in addition to repair of hern ia. Nursing management 1. Achieving comfort of the patient: Fit p atient with truss or belt when hernia is reduced, if ordered Trendelenburg's position may reduce pressure on hernia, when appropriate Emp hasize patient to wear truss under clothing and to apply before getting out of the bed when hernia is reduced XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 3.indd 57 1/11/2020 2:36:17 PM3 Communicable Diseases Post operative care Enco urage the patient to splint the incision site with hand or pillow when coughing to lessen pain and protect the site from increased intra-abdominal pressure and wound dehiscence Admini ster analgesics as ordered Enco urage ambulation as soon as permitted Advise patient that difficulty in urinating is common after surgery; promote elimination to avoid discomfort, and catheterise if necessary 3. Prevention of infection Monitor the vital signs Check dressings for drainage and incision for redness and swelling Monitor for other signs and symptoms of infections; fever, chills, malaise, diaphoresis Admini ster prescribed antibiotics 4. Patient education on discharge Advise that pain and scrotal swelling may be present for 24 to 48 hours after repair of an inguinal hernia Apply ice intermittently Elevate scrotum by using scrotal support Take prescribed medication to relieve discomfort Inform that heavy lifting should be avoided for 4-6 weeks Athletics and extremes of extension are to be avoided for 8 to 12 weeks postoperativelyComplications Bowel obstruction Gangrene formation Wound dehiscence 3.2.2 Cholecystitis Inflammation of the gall bladder Causes Exact cxauses is not known Gall stones and kinking or twisting of bile duct Risk factor Sedentary life style Obesity Signs & Symptoms Pain on right upper quadrant/epigastric or both Nausea Vom iting Ultrasonography Abdominal X-ray Blood cell count Test (TC, DC) Management Medical Management Hospitalization Admini stration of antibiotics Admini stration of parenteral analgesic Insertion of nasogastric tube if patient has vomiting Maintain of fluid and electrolyte balance with IV fluids Surgical Management Cholecystecotmy (Removal of Gall bladder by surgery) Nursing management History collection Clien t symptoms should be carefully monitored Check vital signs Admini ster pain medication Admini ster IV fluids Mon itor intake output chart Watch for signs for dehydration Complications an inflammation of the vermiform appendix caused by obstruction of the intestinal lumen from infection, stricture, fecal mass, foreign body or tumour. Causes 1. Obstruction of the appendix causes accumulation of mucus and swelling leading to appendicitis. 2. Obstruction occurs due to the accumulation of faecal matter, enlargement of lymphoid follicles, intestinal worms, and tumours. The appendix is a finger - like pouch present at the end of the colon on the lower side of the right abdomen. Pathophysiology Obstruction of the intestinal lumen is followed by edema, and ischemia As intraluminal tension develops, necrosis and perforation usually occur. Signs and Symptoms The typical symptoms of acute appendicitis are 1. Severe pain in the right side of the lower abdomen. 2. Rebound tenderness at McBurney's point. 3. Anoxia. 4. Low-grade fever. 5. Nausea and vomiting. 6. Constipation or diarrhoea occurs. Diagnosis 1. Physical examination. Rebound tenderness at Mc Burney's point. 2. Laboratory test: complete blood count will show Leuco cytosis Urinalysis 3. Abdominal X-ray to visualize shadow consistent with fecalith in appendix. 4. U.S.G. A bdomenManagement Surgery: The standard Management for appendicitis is surgery that involeves removal of the appendix. The procedure is called appendectomy that can be done in two methods: Laparotomy - a single incision is made to remove the appendix Laparoscopic appendectomy - several small incisions are made using special surgical tools to remove the appendix. The advantage of this surgery is fast recovery Complication Peritonitis Perforation Abscess formation 3.3 CARDIO 613.3.1 Hypertension A normal blood pressure reads as 120/80 where 120 denotes the systolic pressure and 80 denotes the diastolic pressure. When the value of blood pressure is 140/90 and above, then it is called as high blood pressure or hypertension. Blood pressure is the force of blood pressing against the walls of the blood vessels (arteries) that deliver oxygen-rich blood from the heart to all parts of the body.

Causes 1. Blood loss related to trauma 2. Decreased production of platelets. 3. Increased destruction of platelets 4. Decreased number of clotting factor. 5. Impairment of RBC production due to nutritional deficiency, (e.g Iron deficiency, folic deficiency, Vitamin B12 deficiency, Vitamin B6 deficiency). 6. Decreased erythrocyte production, bone narrow depression. 7. Increased erythrocyte destruction due to A thallium stress test is a nuclear imaging test that shows how well blood flows into your heart while you're exercising or at rest. This test is also called cardiac or nuclear stress test. During the procedure, a liquid with a small amount of radioactivity called a radioisotope is administered into one of your veins .The radioisotope will flow through your bloodstream and end up your heart .once the radiation is in your heart ,a special camera called gamma camera can detect the radiation and reveal any issues your heart muscles is having.

Haem oglobin electrophoresis Types of Anaemia 1. Anaemia from blood loss: Haemorrhage or continued slow bleeding will cause anaemia. 2. Iron deficiency Anaemia: It may result from faulty eating habits (Poor diets or hurrying meals). 3. Pernicious Anaemia: A patient with pernicious Anaemia lacks substances in the gastric juice called instrinsic factor, which is necessary to enable the body to absorb vitamin B 12 from food. 4. Sickle cell anaemia: It is genetic disease in which the red blood cells become sickle in shape due to the presence of abnormal haemoglobin. 5. Aplastic anaemia: It results from disease of the bone marrow (where most blood cells are produced.) whereby the marrow is destroyed. 6. Megaloblastic anaemia: It is caused by deficiency of the vitamin B12 and folic acid. This shows identical bone marrow and peripheral blood changes, because both vitamins are essential for normal DNA synthesis. 7. Hae molytic anaemia: The erythrocyte has a shortened life span. Management 1. Anaemia from blood loss: Replace the blood cells by transfusion and at times administering iron supplements. 2. Iron-Deficiency Anaemia: Take extra iron containing food. 3. Pernicious Anaemia: Take vitamin B12 containing foods and injection every 2 or 3 weeks will allow the person to live normally. 4. Sickle cell Anaemia: Citadels citrate, evaluated as adjunctive therapy for sickle cell anaemia. Blood transfusion and folic acid therapy is administered. 5. Aplastic anaemia: Two methods of managements are currently employed. Bone marrow transplantation and Administration of immunosuppressive therapy with entity. 6. Megaloblastic anaemia: Injection B12 is administered, provide nutritious diet and folic acid 1 mg per day.

Kidneys are a pair of organs located toward lower back. One kidney is on each side of spine. They filter blood and remove toxins from body. Kidneys send toxins to your bladder. Later body removes toxins during urination. Kidney failure occurs when kidneys abruptly lose their function of filtering waste products from the blood. Causes Pre-renal causes: It results from the condition that decreases renal blood flow (e.g. Hypovolemia, shock, hemorrhage, burns, diuretic therapy) Post-renal causes: It comes from obstruction or distruption of urine flow anywhere along the urinary tract Intra - renal causes: It results from injury in the renal tissue and is usually associated with intra renal ischemia, toxins immunologic process, systematic and vascular disorders Signs and Symptoms Decreased tissue turger, dryness of mucous membrane, weight loss, hypotension, oliguria Difficu lty in voiding and changes in urine flow Fever and skin rashes, edema Changes in urine volume, increases blood urea, creatinine, uric acid, potassium levels etc Investigations Urine analysis: Reveals protenuria, haematuria Raise of Serum creatinine in blood Urine culture Renal ultrasonography Renal biopsy Management Correct any reversible cause of acute renal failure E.g: Improve renal perfusion maximize cardiac output, surgical release of obstruction Be a lert for fluid excess or deficit Monitor the signs of hypovolemia or hypervolemia Mon itor Intake and output chart Weig the patient daily XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 3.indd 71 1/11/2020 2:36:30 PM3 | Non Communicable Diseases 72 Monitor vital signs Correct and control biochemical imbalances Restore and maintain B/P Maintain nutrition Initiate haemodialysis Renal replacement therapy Prevention Maintaining healthy lifestyle - performing regular physical activity, limiting alcohol intake, and refraining from smoke can keep you away from illness Be a ttentive while taking over the counter (OTC) medications, especially NSAIDs as they can be nephrotoxic Undergo urine test and blood test at least once in 6 months to monitor kidney disease Consult a doctor immediately if you find any changes in your urine output Complication Infection Arrhythmias due to hyperkalemia Electrolyte abnormalities Gastrointestinal bleeding Multiple organ system failure 3.6 NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS Epilepsy Uncouncious Status 3.6.1 Epilepsy Epilepsy is a tendency to have recurrent seizures, which results from disturbances in the normal electrical activity of the brain.The human brain is a unique computer, which works for all 24 hours. It is built up of billions of nerve cells called neuron. The neuron has electrical activity and this is transmitted through the axons and dendrites. These electrical impulses are transmitted from one neuron to another through the chemical messengers called neurotransmitters, which are present in the synapse If a group of nerve cells start sending these impulses excessively, it results into epileptic attacks. Causes Epilepsy is a symptom of many diseases. Just as headache, it is a symptom, which has a number of causes. Epilepsy can be caused by a number of illness in the brain. Idiopathic No demonstrable cause Symptomatic Prenatal injuries Low sugar, sodium or calcium Developmental defect of the brain Cerebral infections like meningitis, encephalitis Cerebral injuries Cerebral tumors Cerebro vascular attack Cysticercus and tuberculomas Signs & Symptoms Unconsciousness Rigid body Jerking movements of arms and legs Clen ching of teeth XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 3.indd 72 1/11/2020 2:36:30 PM3 | Non Communicable Diseases 73 Grunting noises Confusion (one or two minutes) Partial seizures In partial seizures the abnormal electrical discharges occur in a localized area in the brain. Hence the symptoms depend upon the area of brain involved, motor or sensory. Simple partial seizures Simple partial seizures do not affect consciousness. Symptoms may include rhythmic movements of the contralateral face, arm or leg and possibly hallucinations involving smell, sight or hearing or feelings of fear and panic or euphoria. Complex partial seizures Complex partial seizures are the most common type of seizure in adults, commonly lasting less than three minutes and associated with impairment in the consciousness they become complex partial seizures. Generalised seizures Generalized seizures affect the whole cortex with the patient's level of consciousness usually being impaired; there is often no aura or warning. Generalized seizures have varying characteristics. Typical absence seizures are distinguished by a transient loss of consciousness and awareness of the environment with a vacant appearance, which lasts just a few seconds Atypical absence seizures resemble typical absence seizures but last longer and are often associated with minor automatism Myoclonic seizures are classified by sudden muscle contractions of specific muscle groups with no loss of consciousness Tonic-clonic seizures involve bilateral extension of limbs followed by synchronous jerking movements. There is often a cry before the seizure, a fall to the ground followed by incontinence, tongue biting, foaming at the mouth and loss of consciousness. There is a post-ictal phase and when patients wake they have muscle tenderness, transient confusion and exhaustion Atonic seizures cause loss of muscle tone and a fall to the ground, often resulting in injury; it may be so brief that the patient is unaware of the loss of consciousness Signs & Symptoms Headache, fainting attack Muscle spasmsClassification of epilepsy Partial seizure Generalised 1.

Stay with a patient who is ambulating or who is in a confused state during seizure Provide a helmet to the patient who falls during seizure Consult with social worker for community resources for vocational rehabilitation, counsellors and support groups Teach stress reduction techniques that will fit into a patient lifestyle Answer questions related to use of computerized video EEG monitoring and surgery for epilepsy management Postictal Stupor Tonic Phase Straightening of body & limbsClonic jerks of body, limbs & headClonic Phase XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 1/11/2020 2:36:31 PM3 | Non Communicable Diseases 75Complication Status epileptics Injuries due to falls National Epilepsy day November 17 International Epilepsy day February 11 3.6.2 Unconscious Status Unconsciousness is a condition in which there is depression of cerebral function ranging from stupor to coma. Coma may be defined as no eye opening on stimulation, absence of comprehensible speech, a failure to obey commands. Unconsciousness is a lack of awareness of one's environment and the inability to respond to external stimuli. Therefore, observe the patient's condition and prevent any complications. Causes Head injuries Menin gitis, encephalitis Diabetes mellitus Renal failure Poisonous drugs (stomach wash, refer practicals) Asphaxia Epilepsy Diagnosis Assess the patient's level of consciousness by Glasgow coma scale.

It must be necessary to hold the patients jaw forward or place the patient in the lateral position to prevent the tongue obstructing airway by falling back. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 3.indd 75 1/11/2020 2:36:34 PM3 | Non Communicable Diseases 76 Loosen the garments to allow free movements of the chest and abdomen. Frequent suction is required to prevent the pooling of secretion in the patients pharynx. If necessary insert oral airway for easy breathing. Maintenance of fluid & electrolyte balance and nutrition: The diet m ust contain an adequate supply of all nutrients required for life. Nutrition may be supplied by intravenous fluids or gastric tube feeding. (refer practicals) Admini ster prescribed intravenous fluids with electrolytes and vitamins (refer practicals). Maintain Intake and output chart accurately. Monitor vital signs and record. Maintenance of personal hygiene and care of pressure areas including prevention of foot drop: Sponging is performed as frequently as necessary Keep the skin dry, clean and free of moisture to prevent bed sore. Apply back care every 4th hourly and 2nd hourly position changing to relieve pressure on pressure areas. Clip the nails Range of motion exercises atleast 4 times a day. Cleanse the mouth with the prescribed solution every two hours and apply emollients to prevent parotitis. Irrigate the eye with sterile prescribed solution to remove discharge and debris. Clean the ear with swab and dry carefully, especially behind the ears. The b ed linen must be kept wrinkle free and dry. Side ra iling on both sides are helpful to protect the patient. The f eet should be kept at right angles to the legs with help of pillow or sand bags to prevent foot drop. Promoting elimination: If the patient is observed for any sign of urinary incontinency, retention and constipation, report to the physician. If the patient has incontinence of urine - provide bedpan or catheterization can be done according to Doctor's order to record the accurate output. (refer practicals). If the patient has retention of urine, apply gentle pressure over the bladder region. It will help in partially emptying the bladder. If the patient is constipated, a glycerine suppository or enema is advised according to Doctor's prescription. Perineal care, vaginal douch, catheter care to be provided (refer practicals). Palpate for 77 Auscultate bowel sounds. Family education: Develop an interpersonal relationship with the family. Provide frequent update information on patient condition. Involve the relatives in routine care. Provide comfortable physical environment. Teach family to report any unusual symptoms. 3.7 MUSCULO S KELETAL Osteoarthritis Osteoporosis3.7.1 Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis is a very common chronic disorder involving the joints. It is a degenerative change in the joints. The degenerative changes take place because the rubbing of the joint surfaces causes a wearing away and disintegration of the tissues. Causes and Risk factors Age: people above the age of 45 have the risk for developing osteoarthritis. It is, however, most commonly found in people over age of 65. Gender: This disease of osteoarthritis is more common in women, particularly after the age of 55 Obesity: This can be one of the causes for osteoarthritis as every kilogram puts three extra kilogram of pressure on kneesInjury : Joint injuries are an increased risk of developing osteoarthritis Weakness of muscles: Weak thigh muscles lead to osteoarthritis knee joint pain. Signs & Symptoms Knee pain Swelling Joint stiffness Loss of movement Investigation X-ray of affected joints Serum CRP Serum ESR, RA factor Management Medical Diseases 78 TKR (Total Knee Replacement) Arthiodesis, an operation to fuse the joint in one position can be done to prevent further pain (practiced earlier) Do's Use knee cap supports Use hot water formentation to relieve pain Wear comfortable, fitting shoes to reduce stress on joints Walk regularly to keep yourself active, it helps to avoid stiffness Maintain a healthy weight to reduce strain and pain in your knee Dont's Don't lift heavy weights, it puts stress on the knees Don't sit cross- legged Avoid prolonged activities that put strain on the knee like gardening Avoid jerky movements Don't smoke. Research shows that smoking leads to joint pain along with other damaging effects R I C E Rest Ice Compression Elevate Rest your knee.

This allows the student to stay focused Parent and teacher handling of dyslexia child Parent: Manage his or her time To p ut things in its place Help him with his or her homework Help him with his or her reading To focus his or her attention To take right book to school By g iving precise clear instruction By not punishing him or her for his or her childishness delay in completing his work By giving him or her constant positive inputs By in structing him or her with more do's than don'ts By im parting social skills, like interaction communication giving respect to elders etc Teachers: The teachers can try to meet the special needs of the children by identifying the areas of special interest and talents and help the child to build on strengths. They can be helped. Giving less written class work and home work Testing them orally Giving marks for content without reducing marks for grammatical and spelling errors Marking less red lines in the note book Introducing abstract ideas through pictures and objects Giving precise, clear and short instructions Giving extended time to finish tests Reading the question paper during the class Maintaining eye contact during the class Not punishing the child for messy work and poor handwriting Emp hasising on quality work rather than quantity Avoiding punishments for minor misbehaviours in the class Management Remedial education Medical approach Psychological approach XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 3.indd education: Remedial education is the most effective therapy. Various types of cognitive perceptual skills training, For example, sensory integration training, perceptual motor training, occupational therapy, auditory memory training, vestibular stimulation, hemisptieric stimulation and optometric training. Medical approach: Medical approaches to treating dyslexia include stimulant medication, anti - anxiety medication, motion sickness medication, vitamins and special diets. Psychological approach: Psychological approaches to dyslexia include supportive psychotherapy, parent guidance and training, social skill training, relaxation training and behaviour modification approaches. 3.10.2 Alcoholism Alcoholism is a disease characterised by the habitual intake of alcohol and it interferes with physical or mental health or with normal social or work behaviour. Signs & Symptoms Confusion Mem ory loss Slow or irregular breathing Cold or clammy hand due to hypothermia Falling unconscious and not waking up Cyanosis Seizur es Causes Environmental factors Pathophysiology Alcohol affects almost all cells of the body. It changes levels of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (CNS), affecting all areas and functions of the CNS. These include centers that control our impulses, mood and behaviour, coordinate motor activity and promote respiratory and cardiac function. The immediate effects of alcohol depend on a person's susceptibility to alcohol and their BAC (Blood Alcohol concentration). Management Complete abstinence from alcohol Punis hment such as heavy fine, imprisonment Usin g medicines Destroying craving for use of stimulating alcohol Meeting of alcoholic anonym Psychotherapy include Advice and Suggestion Moral encouragement Hypnotism XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 91 1/11/2020 2:36:45 alcoholism of liver Hypertension Myocardial Infarctions Angina Vitamin deficiency Acciden and of cancer 3.11 DISORDERS Silicosis Computer Vision Syndrome 3.11.1 Silicosis Silicosis, also known as Pottor's rot is a form of occupational lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica dust and is marked by inflammation and scarlingin forms of nodular lesions in the upper lobes of the lungs. Causes Silicosis is caused by exposure to crystalline silica and breathing in tiny bits of silica, which comes from chipping ,cutting , drilling ,or grinding soil ,sand , granite ,or other minerals. Signs and Symptoms Normal Lung Silicosis Lung Dyspnea exacerbated by exertion Cough, often persistent and sometime severe Fatigue Tachypnea Loss of appetite and weight loss Chest Fever Grad ual dark shallow rifts in nails eventually leading to crack as protein fibre with in nails beds are destroyed In advance cases: Cyanosis Corpulmonale Respiratory 2:36:45 PM3 | Non Communicable Diseases 93 Physical examination Chest X-ray reveals findings consistent with silicosis Pulm onary function testing: may reveal airflow limitation, restrictive defects, reduced diffusion capacity, mixed defects or may be normal (in uncomplicated) Management Silicosis is an irreversible condition with no cure. Management options currently focus on alleviating the symptoms and preventing complications. These include: Stopping further exposure to silica and other lung irritants, including tobacco. Cough suppressants Antibiotics for bacterial lung infection TB pr ophylaxis for those with positive tuberculosis skin test Chest physiotherapy to help the bronchial drainage of mucus Oxyg en administration to treat hypoxemia, if present Bronchodilators to facilitate breathing Lung Transplantation Nursing Management Providing nursing care in the acute and chronic stages Health education regarding the prevention of the diseasePrevention Rigorous dust control measures like wearing mask improving the ventilation of work place Water spray is often used where dust is present Dust can also be controlled by dry air filtering 3.11.2 Computer Vision Syndrome About two hundred years before, the word \"computer\" started to appear in the dictionary. Some people even didn't know what is a computer? However, most of the people today not just knowing what is a computer, but understand how to use a computer. Therefore, computer becomes more and more popular and important to our society. We can use computer everywhere and they are very useful and helpful to our life. But still we are facing a problems like computer vision syndrome. Let us learn in detail. Computer vision syndrome (CVS) is strain on the eyes that happens when you use a computer or digital device (Smart phone, Tablets, Laptop) for prolonged periods of time.

To identify patients at high risk of developing an NCD through risk assessment procedures for chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension. 2. To p rovide advice, and help those with an already diagnosed condition to manage their disease which ranged from health advice to social issues that concerned participants. 3. To p rovide direct services to their clients who included facilitation of support groups, health education, distribution of medication as well as rehabilitation exercises. 4. As faci litators of support groups consisting of clients with diabetes and/or hypertension. 5. To provide education pertaining to nutrition in the management of NCDs as well as explaining about risk factors, symptoms and preventive measures for diabetes and hypertension. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 3.indd 94 1/11/2020 2:36:47 PM3 | Non Communicable Diseases 956. To distribute medications for selected clients assigned in their households and at the desig nated support groups. 7. For rehabilitation services in assisting clients with rehabilitation exercises including other support groups enabling them to better manage their conditions. 8. To lin k clients with the health system where the high risk cases are identified and then referred the clients to the nearest health facilities. Referred clients were given a referral letter by the nurse to present to the health facility. 9. Capacity building through peer educator where NCD nurses learn skills required to fulfil daily tasks 'on-the-job' . 10. Admini strative role includes completing forms with information relating to the clients on a daily basis. In addition, completing daily statistic sheets of clients and submitting to the coordinators on the next day. NCD nurses are also responsible for collecting the signatures of clients when they receive medication, so as to keep a record of the clients who have collected their medication. Prevention is better than cure. When it comes to our health, prevention is much better than cure. Several diseases and injuries are preventable and can be managed much better if identified earlier on. A regular check up with your doctor helps them to identify your risk factors for disease. Healthy choices to reduce your risk for diseases Be a n on smoker and avoid second hand smoke. If you smoke, get help to quit. Be p hysically active every day. Eat healthy food. Achieve a healthy weight Control your blood pressure. Limi t your intake alcohol Reduce your stress Be s creened and tested regularly. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 3.indd 95 1/11/2020 2:36:47 PM3 | Non Communicable Diseases 96 SKIN BANK What is skin banking? Skin banking is a facility where the skin is collected from eligible deceased donor and processed as per international protocols. Skin can be stored in the skin bank at 4-8 o Celsius up to 5 years. The stored skin can be used for Burns patient who have Deep Burns, Chemical Burns, Electrical Burns, and Radiation Burns. Right hospital started this facility in 2014 - first of its kind in Tamilnadu. In a patient with major burns the dead skin from their body should be removed as early as possible to avoid life threatening infection and death. The only way to save the burn victims life is to remove the dead skin and replace it with skin graft. There is paucity of skin available and due to this many victims are severely affected. Skin banking will help these victims to recover fast. Why skin banking? The estimated annual burn incidence in India is approximately 6-7 million per year. Nearly to 1.5 lacs people get crippled and require multiple surgeries and prolonged rehabilitation. 70% of the burn victims are in most productive age group of 15 to 40 years. Most of the patients belongs to poor socioeconomic strata. What are the criteria for donating skin? Above 18 years Free of AIDS, hepatitis and STDs Free of skin cancer and other skin ailments Suffering from diabetes, hypertension and cardiac ailments can also donate What are the points to remember while donating skin? Call within 6 hours of death Skin can be harvested from brain dead patients. A sk in donation procedure takes about 45 mins. Patient need not to be brought to hospitals premises. Skin can be harvested from deceased person's home similar to eye donation. What is the procedure adopted for skin harvesting? Once call is made for skin donation. A team from the hospital skin bank will visit the donar's home and the following procedure will be carried out. Consent from the next of kin will be obtained Blood sample will be collected to check for HIV & Hepatitis Skin will be harvested from both lower limbs using battery operated dermatome After skin harvest both the lower limb will be covered with dressing The entire procedure will take 45 minutes. The harvested skin will be brought to the skin bank for processing and storage. This stored skin is used to save major burn victims. How to maintain healthy skin? 1. Hydrate your skin by drinking adequate water 2. Avoid using skin drying agents like neem, turmeric, and high irritant soap 3. Apply moisturiser regularly after bath to prevent the dryness of skin ,specially for kids and elderly persons e. g. Alovera, milk cream, coconut oil 4. During sun exposure time,use SPF(Sun Productive Foundation) 5. Nourish your skin with Beta Carotine rich food (colourfull vegetables and fruits) orange,carrot,banana,beans,broccoli Diseases 97CONCLUSION Non communicable disease is a medical condition or disease that is not caused by infectious agent. Non communicable diseases are usually caused by genetic or life style factors. Four types of NCDs are - Cardiovascular diseases, Cancers, Diabetes and Chronic respiratory diseases. Hernia, Hypertension, Asthma, Diabetes mellitus, Acute myocardial infarction, Acute & chronic renal failure, Renal calculi, COPD, Cancer, PCOD, Alcoholism, and Occupational disorders like Computer vision syndrome and Silicosis are the examples of non communicable diseases. Management of NCDs are medical or surgical management based on signs & symptoms. NCDs can be prevented by proper food, exercise and good life activities.

XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 4.indd 103 1/11/2020 2:40:00 PM4 | Nutrition104 4.1 INTRODUCTION Food is the prime necessary of life and mankind eats to satisfy the feeling of hunger. From the earlier times man remained busy in finding out the ways of consumption of food. The science of nutrition is mainly concerned with defining the nutritional requirements for the promotion, protection and maintenance of health in all groups of the population. The knowledge of nutrition has a direct bearing on the maintenance of sound health of an individual. The concern of today's health is the maintenance and restoration of health. Nurses as an important member of health care team has a key role in maintaining the nutritional needs of their client. Antoine Lavoisier (18th century) is considered as the Father of nutrition. 4.2 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NUTRITION AND HEALTH Food is a basic and foundational part of our lives. Food plays a vital role for human existence just as the air we breathe and the water we drink. The food we eat is utilized in the body and assimilated substances are used for growth and maintenance of the tissue. People who eat right foods rich in nutrients enjoy their lives more, live longer, and are at a reduced risk of disease. Good nutrition is critical in preventing not only deficiency diseases, but also chronic diseases. Nutrition is vital to our bodies as water is to plants. An unhealthy diet increases the risk of many diet related diseases.Human beings require more than 45 different nutrients for their well being. Nutrition as a promoter of good Health Health is much more than the absence of disease. It is a positive quality, emphasizing physical, social, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual well being. Optimum nutrition, providing all nutrients in both kind and amount, is the cornerstone of good health. The foods we eat, and the nutrients they provide, are the most important continuing factors influencing our growth, development, functional abilities, and health. A proper diet helps in preventing and recovery from certain illnesses. Hippocrates (Greek physician) - Father of medicine said 'Let thy food be thy medicine and thy medicine be thy food' Role of nurses Patients nutritional status is closely related to the overall level of health. Nutrition is considered as one of the important factors affecting the human health. Nurses should give more attention XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 4.indd 104 1/11/2020 2:40:01 PM4 | Nutrition 105to the nutrition of their patients. A modification in the diet can cure certain diseases. Numerous factors and conditions have the potential to impair patients' nutritional status. Relationship of nutrition to health Good nutrition leads to healthy living 4.3 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BALANCED DIET AND MALNUTRITION Balanced Diet The term \"Balanced Diet\" refers to a diet that provides all of the nutrients body needs, without too much of any one component. A Balanced diet contains all types of food in a right proportion. It means a balanced diet contains the right amount of carbohydrate, protein, fat or oil, vitamins, mineral salts and water depending on the desired needs of the body. A Balanced diet offers the full range of nutrients body needs to function at its peak performance level while an unbalanced diet is generally lacking in nutrients and too full of harmful ingredients. Malnutrition Malnutrition is the eventual result of an imbalanced diet. Consuming too much or too little of any one nutrient, can cause malnutrition. Malnutrition can be so mild that a person suffers no ill effects. It can also be so severe that it causes serious illness or death. Malnutrition symptoms vary depending on the specific nutrient imbalance. Some possible symptoms include edema, chronic diarrhoea, anemia, goiter, weight loss and decreased muscle mass. \"The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, 2017\" report suggested that 14.5% of the population is undernourished in India. 4.4 CLASSIFICATION OF FOOD Carbohydrate s, Protien, Fats, vitamins, Minera ls, Dietary fiber, WaterBy chem ical nature Energy Giving Body Buidling ProtectiveBy func tions in the body Organic By mass By Orig inMacro Nutrie nts Micro Nutrie nts Plant Foods Animal Foods By nutiritv evalue 12 CategoriesClassi fication of Foods Food can be classified in accordance to their chemical property, to their function, to their essentiality, to their concentration and to their nutritive value. a) According to the chemical nature carbohydrates proteins fats minerals vitamins dietary fiber water b) According to their function in the body Energy giving foods The carbohydrates, fats and the protein are considered as calorie nutrients, so that the body can perform the necessary functions. Rice, chapatti, bread, potato, sugar, oil, butter and ghee are examples of energy giving foods. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 4.indd 105 1/11/2020 2:40:01 PM4 | Nutrition106The oldest evidence for soup is from 6,000 BC (BCE) and it was made from hippopotamus and sparrow meat. Body building foods Foods such as proteins, fats and carbohydrates are also called as body-building food. They are the nutrients that form body tissues. Fish, meat, chicken, eggs, pulses, nuts and milk are some body building foods. Protective foods Vitamins and minerals are the nutrients that function to regulate body processes. They protect us from various diseases. Fruits and vegetables are some examples. Therefore we must eat these regularly. Eating bananas can help to fight depression. c) According to chemical properties Organic: Nutrients that contain the element of carbon are called as organic nutrients. Inorganic: Nutrients that do not contain carbon element are called as inorganic nutrients.The organic nutrients include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and vitamins. Water and minerals are inorganic. d) According to its mass depending on the q uantity necessary for cells and organisms are classified as Macronutrients: Macronutrients are required in large quantities daily. Proteins, carbohydrates and fats are macronutrients. They are the basis of any diet. Macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins and fats) are needed in large amounts whereas micronutrients (Vitamins and minerals) are only required in small amounts Micronutrients: Micronutrients are needed in small quantities (usually in amounts less than milligrams). These nutrients are involved in regulating metabolism and energy processes. They are vitamins and minerals. e) According to its origin Depending upon the origin of food it has been classified as animal food sources and plant food sources. f) According to its nutritive value 1.

While in adults and the elderly people most growth has stopped and nutrients are required in maintaining healthy state. Provision of Energy As a car needs fuel for work, our body needs food to carry out daily tasks and regulate body's physiologic processes. When the body runs low on energy, humans feel fatigued and tired. In severe circumstances, a lack of energy may even lead to certain body processes shutting down. On the other hand, excess energy causes fat build up and can lead to obesity! Repair and Maintenance of Cells Good food is essential to maintain adequate health. E.g, Skin is often cut or grazed, hair falls out constantly and body's red and white blood cells die on a regular basis. By consuming the right nutrients, body will repair itself and stay healthy. A healthy individual who eats well and exercise regularly is less likely to suffer from a cold or flu than a person who eats poorly and does not exercise. b) Social Functions Food is a symbol of hospitality and friendship throughout the world. Food creates a relaxed atmosphere XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 4.indd 107 1/11/2020 2:40:02 PM4 | Nutrition108Food is used as an expression of love, friendship and social acceptance. c) Psychological Functions Consumption of food not only satisfies hunger, also gives happiness. Food is an outlet of emotion. People often eat more when they are tensed or happy. Food is a source of security- people feel reasonably secure when they have enough food stored up. Nutrients performing physiological functions Protein is the building block for every body tissue cell Carbohydrates and Lipids help to fuel the bodyBelow mentioned are some of the food items. Mark the food items according to the functions they perform (Energy giv-ing/ body building/ protective): Rice Banana Papaya Apple Chapatti Bread Butter Fish Eggs OilSTUDENT'S ACTIVITY The Food Pyramid The Food Pyramid is designed to make healthy eating easier. Healthy eating is about getting the correct amount of nutrients - protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals needed to maintain good health. Foods that contain the same type of nutrients are grouped together on each of the shelves of the Food Pyramid. This gives a choice of different foods from which to choose a healthy diet. Following the Food Pyramid XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 4.indd 108 1/11/2020 2:40:03 PM4 | Nutrition 109as a guide will help to get the right balance of nutritious foods within the calorie range. A food pyramid or diet pyramid is a triangular diagram representing the optimal number of servings to be eaten each day from each of the basic food groups. The first pyramid was published in Sweden in 1974. 4.6 NUTRIENTS The substances which are present in the food and consumed in our body for its vital functions are called nutrients. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), these nutrients must come from food, and they are vital for disease prevention, growth, and good health. There are several constituents such as: Classification of nutrients I. Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are the chief sources of energy (Providing 4 Kcals/gm). Carbohydrates are cheap and readily available from food. There are three different kinds of carbohydrates. They include starch, sugar, and fibre. We do not get calories from fibre because our bodies do not break down fibre during digestion. The chemical composition of carbohydrates includes carbon, hydrogen and oxygen (CH 2O). Classification of Carbohydrates 1. Monosaccharides: These are the simplest form of carbohydrates containing simple sugar molecule. Example: Glucose, Fructose and Galactose. 2. Disaccharides: These carbohydrates composed two of Monosaccharides. Example: Sucrose, Lactose and Maltose. 3. Polysaccharides: These are the complex sugars containing numerous units of monosaccharide molecules. Example: Glycogen, Cellulose and Pectins. Daily requirements Carbohydrate intake should be in the range of 300-500gm (50%- 70%) out of the total energy intake for adults and 40-60% for children. Sources: All sugars, jaggery, honey, pulses, whole grains, cereals, grains, rice, fruits, milk, yogurt, beans, roots and tubers such as potatoes, beet root etc. Functions of Carbohydrates 1. Supplies energy 2. Protein sparing function 3. Oxid ation of fats 4. Regu lating blood glucose movements XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 4.indd 109 1/11/2020 2:40:03 PM4 | Nutrition110 Carbohydrate provides more than half of the calories in the diet. The brain cells contain little glycogen and depend on a continuous supply of glucose for their high metabolic activity. Digestion and absorption of Carbohydrates Salivary amylase aids digestion of starch in the mouth. Most of the digestion of carbohydrates takes place in the small intestine. Carbohydrates are absorbed into the blood stream as glucose, Galactose and fructose. By way of the capillaries of the villi, the simple sugars enter the portal circulation and transported to the liver. Dietary Fibre The carbohydrates (E.g, pectin, cellulose, hemicellulose) and some non carbohydrates substances (e.g. lignin) are collectively called as dietary fibre. Fibre is found in vegetables, fruits and grains. It resists digestion. The most practical ways of including sufficient fibre in diet are: Whole cereals should be preferred to refined cereals Whole pulses should be preferred to those from which the husk has been removed Fruits and vegetables can be eaten with the skin intact. Significance of Fibre High fibre diet plays an important role in prevention and management of constipation (Inability to pass motion/ lack of bowel movement) Fibre also helps to reduce blood cholesterol Helps to prevent blood glucose level after food (Post prandial blood glucose) II. Proteins Proteins are the indispensible constituents of the diet. Proteins are made up of amino acids. Amino acids are needed for replacement and growth of the body parts. Amino acids are classified as essential and non essential amino acids. Essential amino acids cannot be synthesized by the body and must be taken through foods whereas non essential amino acids can be synthesized by the body. Amino acids contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen in their chemical composition. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 4.indd 110 1/11/2020 2:40:05 PM4 ICMR recommends 1gm of protein/ Kg of body weight for adults. The amount of protein should be increased for children, pregnant and lactating mothers by 1.5- 2 g/kg body weight. Sources of Protein Animal sources: eggs, milk and milk products, fish, meat. Plant sources: pulses, cereals, dry fruits, beans nuts etc. Functions of Proteins Protein helps in synthesis of enzymes, imm unoglobulin, plasma proteins and hormones in the body Protein helps in growth and repair of body tissues Proteins are secondary sources of energy during deficiency of carbohydrates and fats. (Provides 4 Kcals/gm) Proteins help in forming haemoglobin Proteins help in antibody formation Digestion and absorption: The hydrolysis of proteins in the gastro intestinal tract is accomplished by proteases secreted in gastric juice and pancreatic juice and also by proteases present in the intestinal mucosa. Severe protein deficiency along with food energy causes Protein Calorie Malnutrition (PCM). The serious forms of PCM are Kwashiorkor and Marasmus. Hair loss Old person 's face Wrinkled skin Severe muscle wastingScaly sk in Distended abdomen(ascites) Swollen ank les (oedema) A Kw ashior korB Mar asmus III. Fats Fat is deposited as adipose tissue in the body and perform essential functions in the body. Fats are composed of fatty acids and contain oxygen, carbon and hydrogen. Classification: Fats are classified in to two types: saturated fat and unsaturated fat.a) Saturated Fat: These have full number of hydrogen atoms. These are from animal sources. Example: butter, Ghee and vanaspati oil. b) Unsaturated Fat: These contain one, two or more double bonds of fatty acids. These are extracted from vegetable sources. Example: Groundnut oil, soyabean oil, sunflower oil. Saturated fats changes in to solid from at low temperature and melts at high temperature. Unsaturated fats never solidify at any temperature. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 4.indd 111 1/11/2020 2:40:07 PM4 | Nutrition112Daily Requirements 15-20% of total calorie requirements should be from fat Sources Animal sources: Fish, egg, meat, milk and milk products. Plant sources: oil seeds (Groundnut, mustard, cotton seed and coconut oil), nuts. Functions Supplies energy (9 kcals/ gm) Improve the palatability of food (flavor and taste) Supports body organs like liver and kidneys Provides insulation and thermoregulation against cold Provides essential fatty acids which helps in growth, promotion and maintenance of skin integrity Helps in formation of hormones in the body Helps in transportation of fat soluble vitamins Digestion and absorption There is no digestion of fats in mouth and very little in stomach. In the small intestine, presence of fat stimulates cholecystokinin and secretin which further stimulates pancreatic lipase hydrolyses and yields fatty acids and monoglycerides. These pass to small intestine and combined with intestinal lumen and absorbed in to blood stream. Excessive accumulation of fat causes obesity in all age groups. Obesity increases the risk of following diseases: Diabetes mellitus High blood pressure Stroke Gall stones Coronary artery diseases Low back pain and osteoarthritis For the following nutrients, can you say why they are important and name one source? Carbohydrates Proteins Fats and oils STUDENT'S ACTIVITY IV . Vitamins vitamins are complex chemical substances required by body in very small amounts. Vitamins in food are for the protection and regulation of body functions. \u00beVitamins are divided in to two major groups \u00beFat soluble vitamins- Vitamin-A, D, E and K \u00beWater soluble vitamins- Vitamins of B group and vitamin C XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 4.indd 112 1/11/2020 2:40:08 PM4 | Nutrition 113Fat Soluble Vitamins Vitamin-A The chemical name is Retinol. Found in foods of both plant and animal origin. Daily requirements: 0.4-1 mg Sources Green leafy vegetables and yellow orange fruits and vegetables like mango, papaya, pumpkins and carrots are good sources of -carotene. Butter, whole milk, egg, liver and fish are richest sources. Functions Necessary for the health of the eyes. Maintenance of the normal epithelial tissues of the body. Necessary for growth and proper utilization of protein Vitamin A deficiency is one of the major causes of blindness in India. Deficiency Syndrome \u00beDecreased resistance to infection \u00beDry s caly skin \u00beNight blindness (Inability to see in dim light) \u00beXerophthalmia- dry eye \u00beBitot's spots- Greyish, rough and raised patches on conjunctiva \u00beKera of the cornea. \u00beStunted Growth Bitot's spot Kera tomalacia The states badly affected by Vitamin A deficiency are the southern and eastern states of INDIA are Andhra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Bihar and West Bengal. These are predominantly rice eating states which is devoid of carotene. Vitamin-D Vitamin D is synthesized by sunlight. Vitamin D is essential for bone growth. Vitamin D is otherwise known as 'sunshine vitamin' as it can be synthesized from sunlight by our body. Daily requirements: 400 IU Sources Generated in the skin by action of ultra violet rays of sunlight XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 4.indd 113 1/11/2020 2:40:09 PM4 | Nutrition114Food sources are milk, butter, cheese, egg, fish and fish liver oils, and foods which have been fortified by addition of vitamin D. Functions Increases intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphates Mineralization of bones Deficiency Syndrome Rickets in children- Bony deformities in growing children due to defective mineralization of the growing bones. Bones become soft and bend under pressure. Osteomalacia- Generalized bone pain in adults especially in women. Vitamin E Vitamin E is an antioxidant and formed up of chemical substance called tocopherols. Vitamin E is called as anti sterility (Reproduction) vitamin. Daily requirements: ICMR recommends 0.8 mg/ g of essential fatty acids. Sources Milk, oils, eggs, leafy vegetables, papaya, grains, nuts. Plant foods are rich sources of Vitamin E than animal foods. Functions Antioxidant (Prevents the formation of oxidative free radical) Co fac tor in electron transport Prevents or delays the ageing Deficiency syndrome: Sterility, muscle wasting with weakness Vitamin K It is otherwise called as antihemorrhagic vitamin.

Protein, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, vitamins, etc. are important ingredients of food and lack of these in our diet has a negative effect on our body. \"Balanced diet is the one which consists of all the required nutrients in adequate amount for proper maintenance and regulation of body functions. \" Principles of Constructing a Balanced Diet A sufficient number of calories The d aily requirement of protein should be met and it amounts to 15-20% of the daily energy intake Fat requirement should be limited to 20- 30% of daily energy intake Carbohydrates rich in natural fibers should constitute the remaining food energy Elements of Balanced Diet Every person needs (i) Energy giving food (ii) Body Building food (iii) Protective food from his daily diet. A balanced diet means a diet, which contains all the above constituents in needed quantity. For different age groups, the composition and proportion of the nutrients varies. The proportion and percentage of the various constituents of diet depend upon the occupation, physical condition, sex, age and climate, generally a person requires about 3200 calories of heat energy in order to maintain the proper function of the body. These 3200 calories Drink atleast 8 cups of fluid a day - water is best.should be given by a proper combination of food elements. Children, heavy workers, tall and fat persons require more food. Similarly, people living in cold countries consume larger quantity of food than people living in warm countries. Diet of man and boys is more than the diet of woman and girls. Persons, who do a lot of mental work, should take less carbohydrate but more proteins. Ex: A rickshaw puller requires extra calories than a sedentary working man. 4.8 TYPES OF DIET Modification of diet means changing the constituents of the diet as per the metabolic rate of the person. In disease condition, the body's metabolic rate keeps on changing hence the diet of a normal person cannot fulfill the basic needs of providing enough calories. To know if the diet is balanced and to plan a balanced diet you have to think about two things: the mixture of foods and the amount of food a person eats. List the activities that require more energy and less energySTUDENT'S ACTIVITY XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 4.indd 124 1/11/2020 2:40:35 PM4 | Nutrition 125Diet can be classified I. Based on the consistency Liquid Diet 1. Clear liquid diet: clear liquid diet is free from any solid particles. Ex: Clear soups, tea or coffee without cream etc. This is given for the patient who cannot chew or swallow the food. 2. Full liquid diet: Full liquid diet is composed of solids which are easily digestible, mixed in liquid. This diet is prescribed for patients who are severely ill, not able to chew or swallow but need good calories. This diet is given in between a clear liquid diet and soft diet. Ex: eggs, vegetable soup, kheer, milk etc. Soft Diet Soft diet is easy for chewing and easily digestible. This diet contains all the required nutrients especially proteins and carbohydrates. It is soft in consistency, easy to chew, made up of simple, easily digested foods, containing limited fibre and does not contain rich or highly flavoured foods. Bland Diet Bland diet is free from all spices and condiments and is basically used to prevent peptic ulcers. Normal Diet A Normal diet is defined as one which consists of any and all foods eaten by a person in health. As there is no restriction of any kind of food, this diet is well balanced and nutritionally adequate. On the basis of Consistency and Constituents Low fibre diet High fibre diet High calorie and low calorie diet High fat and low fat diet High protein and low protein diet Low sodium diet Modification in diet is done for various diseases in different pattern. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 4.indd 125 1/11/2020 2:40:35 PM4 | Nutrition126Special Feeding Techniques Food consumption in the clients with different diseases is altered. Different techniques used in hospitals for such patients are: Tube feeding Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) Tube Feeding Tube feeding is commonly done by using nasogastric tubes of different sizes. Nasogastric tube is inserted from nose to stomach. The tube is inserted gently upto the marking roughly estimated. Then it is strapped at the forehead. Then placement of tube is assessed either using stethoscope or aspiration of gastric juice from stomach. Feed is given through the tube until the patient is able to eat by mouth. This method is easier, simple method for helpless patients who are not able to take the food orally. Full fluid diets or commercial formulas may be administered through this route. The tube may be passed through the nose into the stomach (nasogastric), duodenum (nasoduodenal) or jejunum (nasojejunal). When there is an obstruction in the esophagus, enteral feeding is done by passing a tube surgically through an incision in the abdominal wall into the stomach (gastrostomy), duodenum (duodenostomy) or jejunum (jejunostomy).Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) The delivery of nutrients directly into the circulation through the peripheral or central vein is termed as parenteral nutrition. This technique is used for long term purpose. In this method, a cannula is inserted in large veins to reach superior vena cava in the heart. 4.9 THERAPEUTIC DIETS Diet in Fever The nutritional requirements depend on the nature, severity and duration of the fever. During fever the caloric requirements increases. Frequent feeding must be and fats must be restricted. Fluid intake must be from 3000-5000 ml in various forms. Readily digestible foods must be given. Foods to be given Plenty of fluids like juices, soups Milk, and milk based beverages Low fibre foods High protein foods such as eggs, milk, fish etc. Plain gelatin based desserts, sugars, honey and jams XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 4.indd 126 1/11/2020 2:40:38 PM4 | Nutrition 127Foods to be restricted High fibre foods like whole grain cereals, whole wheat flour and pulses All raw vegetables and fruits except papaya and banana Fried fatty foods such as samosa, pakodas, halwa etc Chemical irritants such as condiments, spices, pickles, chutneys etc should be avoided Diet in Constipation Constipation is decreased frequency of passing stools or complete retention of faeces. The diet should include foods rich in fibre content like whole cereals, legumes and vegetables. Other foods such as fruits rich in fibre e.g. banana, apple, guava etc. more of fluids should be consumed in any form. Diet in Diarrhoea Diarrhoea is increased frequency of loose or watery stools. It occurs in infectious condition A man complaints of constipation. What foods should you tell him to include in his diet?STUDENT'S ACTIVITY Plenty of water Drink more water and other liquids, such as natural fruit and vegetable juices and clear soups, to help the fibre work better. This makes your stools softer and easier to pass. Drinking enough water and other liquids is also a good way to avoid dehydration. Staying hydrated is good for your overall health and can help you avoid getting constipated.of colon. Diet must include mainly fluids like oral boiled water containing electrolyte salts, i.e glucose and sodium chloride. Fluids should be given frequently. Gradually fruit juices, butter milk, diluted milk must be introduced. During treatment phase soft bland diet like milk pudding, rice dhal gruel etc. can be started. Oral rehydration solution must be given which fulfills the nutritional and electrolyte balance. Oral Rehydration Solution Home Made ORS recipe - The \"simple solution\" Preparing.

Most of the vegetables are cooked by this method. Boiling in excess water may result in loss of vitamins and minerals. Specific time and minimum water must be kept for boiling these items. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 4.indd 129 1/11/2020 2:40:39 PM4 | Nutrition130To get good results from boiling Use the right amount of water Select correct size of pan Lid s hould be tightly closed Cook the food with skin to preserve nutrients Uncover the pan in case of green leafy vegetables Simmering: This method includes cooking below the boiling point i.e 85 oC. Meat and fish are best cooked by simmering because cooking at high temperature hardens the fibres of meat. It helps in preserving the essential vitamins and minerals. Methods to avoid loss of nutrients during cooking Cut the vegetable into bigger pieces Cut the vegetables and use it immediately Soaking or washing time should be reduced. Wash the vegetable with the skin and later should be peeled and cut Vegetables should be cooked in minimum amount of water. Any liquid remaining after cooking the vegetable should be used in a gravy or soup Cook the vegetables by steaming and pressure cooking Steaming: Cooking in this method involves direct heat steaming. Temperature is high and pressure is maintained. Pressure cooker is used to cook things by steam under pressure. This method is effective as it preserves nutrients, fuel and time. Stewing: This method included boiling in smaller amount of liquid for a prolonged, low degree of heat about 80 0C. Here a pan is used which has well fitted lid to prevent evaporation. Roasting: food is smeared with a little fat and exposed directly to heat or flame. This List the foods that you eat by steamingSTUDENT'S ACTIVITY XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 4.indd 130 1/11/2020 2:40:40 PM4 | Nutrition 131makes the food tender. Chicken and tender mutton may cooked by this method. Frying: Frying is cooking in oil. It may be of two types- deep fry and shallow fry. In deep frying foods are completely immersed in large amount of oil. E.g; puri, cutlets, samosa etc. Shallow frying includes using less quantity of cooking oil. This method is suitable for cooking dosa, omlet, etc. Baking: Baking is cooking food by dry heat. It is done in a hot air oven. Temperature required for baking is 250-500 0C. Baking is expensive form and slow process of cooking. Foods cooked by this method are bread, pastry, cakes etc. Grilling: This is direct heat cooking method. Here direct heat flame, grill or pans are used to cook. It is quick method of cooking for tender foods like cheese, brinjals and tomatoes. Solar Cooking: Here solar energy is used to cook foods. It takes a longer time for cooking by this method. It is simplest and traditional form of cooking. Solar cooker and closed containers are used which absorb maximum solar energy. Given below are different methods of cooking. Write the names of two things that can be cooked by each of these methods:STUDENT'S ACTIVITY Method of cooking Name of things ATION Foods after preparation should be stored at proper conditions to prevent spoilage and loss of nutritive value in it. There are various methods of storing numerous food items at suitable conditions. Food preservation is known \"as the science which deals with the process of prevention of decay or spoilage of food thus allowing it to be stored in a fit condition for future use\" . Preservation ensures that the quality, edibility and the nutritive value of the food remains intact. Techniques of Food Preservation Different methods are used to preserve the foods. A single method or combination of methods can be used. Drying is the oldest method of food preservation. This method reduces water content which prevents bacterial growth. Sun and wind are both used for drying. Freezing is keeping prepared food stuffs in cold storages. Freezing at low temperature prevents microbial growth, slowing of oxidation reactions. Smoking is the process that cooks, food exposing it to the smoke from burning wood. Various methods of smoking are used like hot smoking, cold smoking, smoke roasting and smoke baking. Vacuum packing creates a vacuum by making bags and bottles airtight. Since there is no oxygen in the created vacuum bacteria die. Usually used for dry fruit. Salting and Pickling Salting removes moisture from foods like meat. Pickling means preserving food either in salt solution or vinegar. Salt kills and inhibits growth of microorganisms at 20% of concentration. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 4.indd 132 1/11/2020 2:40:41 PM4 | Nutrition 133Sugar is used in syrup form to preserve fruits in crystallized form. Example: Candied peel and ginger. Canning and bottling means sealing cooked food in sterile bottle and canes. The container is boiled and this kills or weakens bacteria. Once the cane or bottle is opened the food is again at risk of spoilage. Jellying is preserving food by cooking in a material that solidifies to form a gel. Fruits are generally preserved as jelly. Sugar is also added. Pasteurization is a process that kills bacteria in liquid food. In this method moderately high (62\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C) temperatures are used (for about 15 to 30 minutes) to inactivate certain enzymes and kill certain other microorganisms especially in milk. Pasteurized products need refrigeration after exposure to air. Pulsed Electric Field Processing is a new method of preservation that uses brief pulses as strong electric field to process cells. Pasteurization was invented by French scientist Louis Pasteur during the nineteenth century. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 4.indd 133 1/11/2020 2:40:42 PM4 | Nutrition134High pressure food preservation is a method that presses foods inside a vessel by exerting 70,000 pounds per square inch or more of pressure. CONCLUSION In order to have a healthy life and good nutritional status, a person needs to eat a balanced diet. Although most foods are mixtures of nutrients, many of them contain a lot of one nutrient and a little of the other nutrients. Foods are often grouped according to the nutrient that they contain in abundance. Nutrients are classified into macronutrients and micronutrients. Carbohydrates, proteins, fats and water are macronutrients, and vitamins and minerals are micronutrients. Carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, water and fibre are the main food groups which together, but in variable amounts, make up a balanced diet. Vitamins are substances present in small amounts in foods and are vital for the body to function normally. Vitamins are also called protective foods. Minerals have a number of functions in the body including developing body tissues and supporting metabolic processes. The minerals that are of most importance are calcium, iron, iodine, zinc and fluorine.

Women are the God of giving life to new one in this word. If women are healthy, the life which comes from them will be healthy. If children are healthy the family, society, nation then the whole world will be healthy. When the child is born as a female the care starts from there to have a healthy child in future. So the essential and preventable maternal care is needed for all the women. In this chapter we are going to see how the women are to be protected in terms of maternal health. It includes care of women during pregnancy, and the postpartum period. It also encompasses the health care dimensions of family planning, to ensure a positive and fulfilling experience to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. Before entering into this chapter look at the picture and reflect the Anatomy and physiology of female Reproductive system. (Refer Chapter 2 std XI vocational book)Fallopian Tubes OvariesUterus Cervix Vagina 5.2 MENSTRUAL Definition: Menstruation is a visible manifestation of cyclic, physiologic uterine bleeding due to shedding of the endometrial wall following invisible interplay of hormones mainly through ml Physiology of Menstruation: The menstrual cycle is the scientific term for the Structure of Uterus Hypothalamus- Pituitary- Ovary hormone process in menstruation Negative Feedback | Maternal Health Nursing 143physiological changes that occur in fertile women for the purpose of sexual reproduction. The menstrual cycle is controlled by the endocrine system. The hormones involved in the menstrual cycle The mechanism is controlled by the hypothalamus. 1. Gonodotrophin releasing hormone. 2. FSH-Folicular Stimulating Hormone. 3. LH - Lu teinizing Hormone. 4. Progesterone and 5. Estrogen. Menstrual cycle can be explained in two cycles which occur concurrently 1. The ovarian cycle and 2. The u terine cycle \u00beThe O varian Cycle consists of a. The f ollicular phase , ovulation and b. The l uteal phase \u00beThe U terine Cycle consists of a. men strual phase b. The p roliferative phase and c. The s ecretory phase 1. Ovarian cycle a. Follicular phase: The hypothalamus released gonadotrophin releasing hormone, which gland and secrets follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).All the follicles degenerated except one to mature into a large graffian follicle. The follicle ruptures and releases an ovum into the peritoneal cavity. b. Th e luteal phase: Begins with ovulation. The body temperature drops of then rises by 0.5 to 1 around the time of ovulation. Corpus luteum is formed from follicle cells that remain in the ovary following ovulation. Corpus luteum secretes oestrogen and progesterone during the remaining 14 days of cycle. Corpus luteum degenerates, if the ovum is not fertilized. 2. Uterine or Menstrual cycle a. Menstrual phase: It is characterized by vaginal bleeding and lasts for 4-6 days. Physiologically this is the terminal phase of the menstrual cycle. The endometrium sheds up to the basal layer along with the blood from capillaries and the unfertilized ovum. Bleeding occurs when the coiled arteries return to a state of construction. b. Proliferative phase: This phase follows menstruation and lasts until ovulation. The \u00be Female literacy is only 54%, and women lack the empowerment to take decisions, including decision to use reproductive health services. \u00beThe W orld Health Organization (WHO) estimates that, of 536,000 maternal deaths occurring globally each year, 136,000 take place in India, despite the safe motherhood policies and programmatic initiatives at the national level. \u00be In 2015, i t is estimated that about 800 girls and women died every day as a result of pregnancy and child birth-related complications though there is a decline in worldwide mortality rates. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 5.indd 143 1/11/2020 2:46:07 PM5 | Maternal Health Nursing 144first few days the endometrium is reforming and it is termed as \"Regenerative phase. \" . Estrogen stimulates proliferation and growth of endometrium. Under the control of oestrogen re-growth and thickening of endometrium begins. Ovulation occurs between day 12 and day 16. c. Secretary phase: It lasts about 12 days. This phase is initiated response to increase in luteinizing hormone. Progesterone prepares the endometrium for pregnancy. The functional layer thickens to 3.5 mm and become spongy in appearance. The endometrium is vascular and rich in glycogen, spiral or coiled arteries develop. On day 27 and 28 oestrogen and progesterone levels fall because the corpus luteum is no longer producing them. Without these hormones, FEMALE REPRODUC TIVE CY CLEthe uterine lining becomes ischemic. The lining starts to slough, the women has come to full cycle and it is once again at day first of the menstrual cycle. Abnormalities in Menstruation Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS). PMS i s any unpleasant or uncomfortable symptom during menstrual cycle that may temporarily disturb normal functioning. These symptoms may last from a few hours to many days. Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) is a much more severe form of PMS which affects approximately 3%-8% of women of reproductive age. PMDD requires treatment by a physician. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 5.indd 144 1/11/2020 2:46:07 PM5 | Maternal Health absence of menstruation. Prima ry amenorrhea: Menstruation does not begin at puberty. Secondary amenorrhea: Normal and regular menstrual periods which become increasingly abnormal and irregular or absent. Dysmenorrhea: It is characterized by severe and frequent menstrual cramps and pain associated with menstruation. Prima ry Dysmenorrhea: Women experience abnormal uterine contractions resulting from a chemical imbalance in the body. Mostly in adolescents Secondary Dysmenorrhea: It is caused by other medical conditions, most often endometriosis. Menorrhagia: It is the medical term for excessive menstrual bleeding. In a normal menstrual cycle, women on average lose about 30 ml of blood for about 7 days of menstruation. If bleeding exceeds 7 days or too heavy (over 80 ml), then it is called as menorrhagia. The main cause of menorrhagia is an imbalance of estrogen and progesterone in the body. Abnormal Bleeding: Abnormal vaginal bleeding (excluding menses) - Bleeding between menstrual periods - Bleeding after sex - Bleeding after menopause Metrorrhagia: It refers to menstrual bleeding that is normal in amount but occurs of irregular intervals, between the menstrual periods hemorrhage from the uterus, independent of menstruation. Menopause: It is the process through which a woman ceases to be fertile. 5.3 FERTILIZATION AND FETAL DEVELOPMENT Definition: It is the process during which a haploid male gamete (sperm) unites with a haploid female gamete (oocyte) to form a single cell (ZYGOTE). Is called fertilization. The development of fetus divided in to 3 periods. 1. Pre-embryonic period (0 to 2 weeks) 2. Emb ryonic period (3-8 weeks ) 3. Fetal period (9th week to birth of the baby) 1. Pre- embryonic period (0-2 Weeks) During coitus, sperm is released by male partner into the vagina of the female partner is called as insemination. The m otile sperms swim and pass the cervix to enter into the uterus and finally to reach the ovum released by the ovary in the ampullary isthmic junction. Fertilization takes place in the ampulla-isthmic junction. Chemical signals from oocyte attract the sperms. The s perm after reaching the ovary in the ampullary isthmic junction comes in contact with the zona-pellucida layer of the ovum and block the entry of the additional sperms thus only one sperm fertilizes the ovum. The s ecretions of acrosome help the sperm to enter into the ovum through zonapellucida and the plasma membrane and thus secondary oocyte completes meiosis II and results in the formation of a second polar body and haploid ovum. The h aploid nucleus of the sperm and ovum fuse together to form a zygote which develops into new individual. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 5.indd 145 1/11/2020 2:46:07 PM5 | Fusi on of Gam etes Definition: The process of union of sperm and ovum is called as fertilisation. Process of Fe rtilization to Implantation \u00beZygote is genetically unique, a diploid cell (46 chromosomes) resulting from the fusion of two haploid gametes; a fertilized ovum. \u00beMale has two sex chromosomes X and Y hence male produces 50% of sperms carrying X and 50% carrying Y , while female has two X chromosomes. \u00beAfter fusion of the male and female gametes the zygote would carry either XX or XY depending on whether the sperm carrying X or Y fertilized the ovum. \u00beThe zyg ote carrying XX would develop into a female baby and XY would form a male. \u00beSo, it is the father whose gamete decides the sex. FETAL DEVELOPMENT FR OM | Maternal Health Nursing 147Sex determination Female Male Female Male XX Girl Boy XYFemale Male \u00be The cells which have the potency to give rise to any types of cells in the body are called stem cells. \u00beEmbryo cells act as stem cells upto the age of 6 days and have the ability to form any part of the body. Stages of Clevation Structure of Blastocyst After fertilization cleavage of zygote takes place. It consists of repeated mitotic divisions of the zygot which results in rapid increase in the number of the cells. These smaller embryonic cells are called blastomeres. This normally occurs in the uterine tube. The em bryo with 8 to 16 blastomeres is called a morula. The Morula reaches the uterine cavity at this stage. Spherical Morula is formed about 3 days after fertilization. The m orula divides further as it moves further into the uterus and transforms into blastocyst. The b lastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called trophoblast and inner mass of cells attached to trophoblast is called as inner cell mass. By 7t h day, Trophoblast is differentiated into 2 layers: Cytotrophoblast, inner layer, mononucleated mitotically active cells. Syncytiotrophoblast (outer multinucleated mass, with indistinct cell boundary). By 8t h day the blastocyst is superficially embedded in the compact layer of the endometrium. By the 10th day the blastocyst is completely buried in the uterine lining, known as or \"embedding\" \"some XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit Nursing 148women have small amount of bleeding\" during the time of implantation which is known as \"Implantation Bleeding\" . The im plantation of the fertilized ovum of embedding is known as \"Nidation or Nesting\". Uteroplacental circulation is established by 11th or 12th day. implantation is completed by the 11th or 12th day. Implantation it can be detected by: \u00beUltrasonography. \u00beHCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin which is secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast) at about the end of 2nd week By t he 13th day Proliferation of Cytotrophoblast cells produce extension inside the Syncytiotrophoblast to form primary chorionic villi. The chorionic villi and uterine tissue together form a structural and functional organic structure between developing embryo and tissues of the mother called as placenta. Formations of Chorionic Villi Implantation of XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 5.indd 148 1/11/2020 2:46:10 PM5 | Maternal Health Nursing 149 After implantation, the inner cell mass is differentiated into outer layer called ectoderm and an inner layer called endoderm with a middlelayer is mesoderm Thre e layers give rise to all organs in adults. As shown in the picture above the cells are responsible for those organs. If the implantation occur outside it is called as Ectopic pregnancy. 95 to 97% of ectopic pregnancies occurs in the uterine tube. Most are in the ampulla & isthmus. ( see the figure for types of ectopic pregnancy) Ectopic Pregnanc y Site s Placenta previa: placenta attach to the lower uterine segment. 2 .Embryonic period (3-8 weeks ) 3rd week Heart Tube fuses Cardiac muscle contraction begins Eye & ear cells are present Neura l tube starts closing Blastocyst Inner cell mass Vascular Haematopoie/g415c Cardiac Muscle 1/11/2020 2:46:11 PM5 | Maternal Health Nursing 1504th week Optic vesicle appears, two pharyngeal arches appear.

XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 5.indd 152 1/11/2020 PLACENTA AND MEMBRANES This is a feto maternal organ. It has two components: \u00beFetal part - develops from the chorionic sac \u00beMaternal part - derived from the endometrium The placenta and the umbilical cord are a transport system for substances between the mother and the fetus.Structure of placenta: It is a flat, round mass, about 15 to 20 cm in diameter, 2.5-3 cm thickness, 15-20 lobes, weighs 1/6th of baby's weight or 500 - 600gms at birth. It has two surfaces maternal surface and fetal Surface Maternal surface It is irregular, and divided into convex areas (cotyledons) \u00beCotyledons -about 15 to 20 slightly bulging villous areas. Their surface is covered by shreds of decidua basalis from the uterine wall. \u00beAfter birth, the placenta is always carefully inspected for missing cotyledons. Cotyledons remaining attached to the uterine wall after birth may cause severe bleeding. Maternal surface of placentaFetal surface: This side i s smooth and shiny. It is covered by amnion. The um bilical cord is attached close to the center of the placenta. The um bilical vessels radiate from the umbilical cord. They branch on the fetal surface to form chorionic vessels. They enter the chorionic villi to form arteriocapillary-venous system. Fetal surface of placenta Placental Membranes The placental membrane separates maternal blood from fetal blood. The fetal part of the placenta is known as the chorion. The maternal component of the placenta is known as the decidua basalis. Fetal membran es: It consists of two layers. \u00beCho rion: It is the outer layer of fetal membranes. it is thick friable and shaggy. \u00beAmni on: It is the inner layer of fetal membrane. It is smooth, shiny , and transparent Placental Circulation Fetal - from Umbilical Arteries to chorionic plate to branches to stem villi to capillaries in terminal villi and return via umbilical vein. Placental circulation Maternal - Free-flowing with Spiral arteries open into intervillous space and bath the villi with 150 ml of maternal XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 5.indd 153 1/11/2020 2:46:13 PM5 | Maternal Health Nursing Exchanged - 3-4 times/minute Reduced blood pressure in intervillous space helps the Oxygenated blood to the chorionic plate, return back to the villi. Functions of Pl acenta 1. Respiratory: Placenta act as lungs to the fetus taking in oxygen from the mother's haemoglobin and giving of CO 2 into the maternal blood. 2. Nutritive: The fetus selects from the mother blood protein for tissue building, glucose for energy and growth. Calcium and phosphorus for bones and teeth, vitamins, iron and other minerals for blood formation. 3. Storage: The liver is not sufficiently developed. Placenta stores glucose is the form of glycogen and reconverts it into glucose as required by the fetus. 4. Excretory: The waste products are given off and taken away by the ovarian and uterine veins. 5. Protective: To protect the fetus, the placenta prevents a number of organisms from passing through into the fetal blood. 6. Endocrine: The placenta also has an endocrine action producing hormones like follicular stimulating and leutinizing hormones of the gonadotrophic hormone and oestrogen and progestetone. 5.6 UMBILICAL CORD (FUNIS) Usually it is attached near the center of the fetal surface of placenta. The cord extends from the umbilicus of the fetus to the fetal surface of the placenta. Length: About 40- 50 cm and 20 cm wide. Contains two arteries and one vein, surrounded by clear gelatinous substances and gives support to the cord and prevent compression of the cord is called (Wharton jelly). Two arteries that bring waste products and deoxygenated blood from the fetus to the placenta and the vein carries oxygenated and nourished blood from the placenta to the fetus. The blood flow through the cord is around 400 ml/mt. At birth when the lungs start to work the function of the placenta ceases. The v essels are longer than the cord and may have loops (false knots). 5.7 AMINIOTIC FLUID It is a fluid in the uterus surrounding the fetus. It co nsists of fetus urine, maternal serum fetal cells , near birth - amnionic volume will be 500-1000 ml. If the fluid is excess (>2000 ml) it is called as Hydraminos. If less it is called as Oligohydramnios . Functions of Amniotic Fluid It allows for growth and free movement of fetus. It protects the fetus, acting as shock absorber. It maintains an even temperature for fetus. It prevents pressure on the cord. It acts as cushion around the fetus, because it protects the fetus from injury, if mother is bumped or falls. It is a fluid source that the fetus drinks and then urinates. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 5.indd 154 1/11/2020 2:46:13 PM5 | Maternal FETAL CIRCULATION Definition: The circulation of oxygenated blood, de-oxygenated blood, nutritive material etc, in the foetus is termed as foetal circulation.The blood vessels responsible for foetal circulation are1. One Um blical Vein: It carries the oxygenated blood from the placenta to the growing fetus. 2. Two Umblical Arteries: Both arteries carries all the de-oxygenated blood out of the fetus and carries de-oxygenated blood from the fetus to the placenta. The shunts involved in foetal circulation There are three shunts present in a fetus, they are: 1. Ductus Venosus: The Ductus Venosus shunts the portion of left umblical vein blood flow directly to the inferior vena cava 2. Ductus Arteriosus: It allows most of the blood from the right-ventricle to bypass the fetus' fluid-filled non-functioning lungs. Connects the pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta. 3. Foramen Ovale: It allows the blood to enter the left atrium from the right atrium It is an opening in the intra-atrial septum. Step 1: The placenta accepts the blood without oxygen from the fetus through blood vessels that leave the fetus through the Umbilical Cord (Umblical Arteries). Step 2: When blood goes through the placenta it picks up oxygen Step 3: The oxygenated blood then returns to the fetus via the umbilical cord (umbilical vein). Step 4: The oxygenated blood that enters the fetus passes through the fetal liver and enters the right atrium of the heart. Step 5: Foramen Ovale allows the oxygenated blood to go from the right atrium to left atrium and then to the left ventricle and out the aorta. As a result the blood with the more oxygen gets in to the brain. Step 6: Blood coming back from the fetus's body also enters the right atrium, but the fetus is able to send this deoxygenated blood from the right atrium to the right ventricle (the chamber that normally pumps blood to the lungs). Most of the blood that leaves the right ventricle in the fetus bypasses the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. Step 7: The ductus arteriosus sends the deoxygenated blood to the organs in the lower half of the fetal body. This also allows for the deoxygenated blood to leave the fetus through the umbilical arteries and get back to the placenta to pick up oxygen. Foetal circulation XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 5.indd 155 1/11/2020 2:46:13 PM5 | Nursing 156The Circulatory Changes After Birth: The Placenta is replaced by the Lungs as the organ of respiratory exchange. The l ungs and pulmonary vessels expand thereby significantly lowering the resistance to blood flow. Subsequently the pressure in the pulmonary artery and the right side of the heart is decreased. The p ressure of the left side of the heart increases. The in creasing pressure of blood in the left side of the heart decreases the vascular resistance of the lungs, therefore, the blood now enters the lungs for a respiratory exchange. Closure of the Ductus Venosus - functional closure occurs within few minutes of birth and becomes as ligamentum venosum. Closure of ductus arteriosus - is by smooth muscle contraction and it is further replaced by fibrous tissue, called ligamentum arteriosum. Closure of the Foramen Ovale - closes at birth due to decreased flow from placenta and Inferior Vena Cava to hold open foramen. It become as fossa ovalis 5.9 ANTENA TAL CARE Every pregnancy needs special care. All pregnant women should be registered and encouraged for institutional delivery. Causes of maternal mortality are preventable by the good antenatal care Causes of Maternal Mortality in India On first antenatal visit 1- Confirm Pregnancy Confirm pregnancy by pregnancy test or Ultra Sound. 2-History collection Ask Personal history which includes Name, Age, husband name, marital status, family income, Address etcMenstrual history includes ; \u00be- 1-La st menstrual period (LMP). used . \u00be- 4-Ca lculate expected date of delivery (EDD) as = first day of LMP + 9 months +7 days Student activity:Calculate EDD for following LMP 1.Oct 12th 7th 20183.Dec 20th 2018Example of calculation of EDDMrs. Radha 22 yrs pregnant with 16 weeks ( 4 months).

Early detection and if possible, prevention of complications of pregnancy. 2. Educate women on danger and emergency signs & symptoms. 3. Prepare the woman and her family for childbirth. 4. Give education & counseling on family planning. Schedule of Antenatal Ca re Medical checkup every four weeks up to 28 weeks gestation Every 2 weeks until 36 weeks of gestation. Every week until delivery An a verage 7-12 antenatal visits/pregnancy More frequent visits may be required if complications arise Importance of Abdominal Examination Monitor progress of pregnancy and fetal growth FOETAL HEART SOUND WEIGHT GAIN URINE ANALYSIS XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 5.indd 159 1/11/2020 2:46:14 PM5 | Maternal Health Nursing 160 Check for fetal lie and presentation Auscultate fetal heart sounds What does it include? Measurement of fundal height Assessment of fetal lie and presentation Assessment of fetal movement Auscultation of fetal heart sounds Inspection for scars Methods of Abdominal Examination Inspection Palpation Auscultation Preparation for Abdominal Examination Ensure privacy Examination room should be well lighted and airy Woman is asked to empty her bladder Explain the women about the procedure/ process To m ake her comfortable, keep talking to her She lies supine with legs partially flexed Stand on her right side First start with Inspection Shape - Check whether the uterine shape is ovoid or longitudinal or transverse or oblique Size - Appropriate to the weeks of pregnancy or not? Skin Changes - look for Striae Gravidarum - (The brown and silvery lines all over the abdomen and) Linea Niagra - (the pigmented line from Cullen's Sign - Bruishing discoloration around the umblicus Scars - Any incision scars present or not Contour of the abdomen- The general contour of the entire abdominal wall is observed. The contour should be checked carefully for distention and note must be made as to whether any distention is generalized or localized to a portion of the abdomen. Similarly, the flanks should be checked for any bulging Che ck for visible foetal movements if not visible, confirm with the mother about the foetal 1612. Palpation: Palpate the Uterus with warm hands Step 1: Measure the fundal height keep the ulnar border of curved left hand on woman's abdomen parallel to symphysis pubis Start from xiphisternum and gradually proceed towards symphysis pubis lifting the hand between each step till a bulge / resistance of uterine fundus is felt Mark the level of fundus Measurement of fundal height Measure the fundal height by finger or inch tape it is measured by the inch tape each cm is week. If it is 35 cms then it is considered as 35 weeks up to umbilicus it is 24 weeks. Then each finger is 1 cm measure from the umbilicus till the fundus of the uterus. Step 2: Leopold's maneuvers -It includes four grips Fundal grip Lateral grip Pelvic Grip I /Superficial pelvic grip and Pelvic Grip II / Deep Pelvic Grip 1. Fund al Palpation / Fundal Grip - Helps to determine lie and presentation of fetus XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 5.indd 161 1/11/2020 2:46:15 PM5 | Maternal Health Nursing 1622. Lateral Palpation / Lateral Grip (both Right and left lateral) - Helps to locate fetal back and limbs 3. Pelvic Grip I / Superficial Pelvic Grip -Helps to determine whether head or breech is presenting at pelvic brim. Whether the presenting part is engaged / fixed / free. 4. Pelvic Grip II / Deep Pelvic Grip - Helps to know the degree of flexion of head. Check or as k for Foetal Movements Fetal movement are reliable sign of foetal well - being. Thes e are felt around 18-22 wks of pregnancy (felt earlier in multigravida than primigravida). Normally 10-12 foetal movements should be felt by the pregnant woman in a day. Decreased foetal movements may be an indication of foetal distress. Pattern of foetal movement may change prior to labour due to reduced space. If Foetal Movements are absent or not felt, consult ANM or doctor. 3. Auscultation Use a fetoscope or stethoscope. Best heard on the side of the back of the fetus. In vertex presentation FHS is best heard midway between the line joining the umbilicus and the anterior superior iliac spine on the side of the back. In breech presentation FHS is heard above the umbilicus (Fetal Heart Sound). Count the FHS for one full minute FHR (Fetal Heart Rate). FHS is heard over the abdomen by stethoscope / fetoscope after 24 weeks of pregnancy. Normal FHR is 120 - 160 beats per min. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 5.indd 162 1/11/2020 2:46:17 PM5 | Maternal Health Nursing 163 FHR < 120 be ats per min or > 160 beats per minute, indicates fetal distress. Confirm that you are listening to the FHS and not maternal pulse. DIET in Pregnancy Total caloric intake should be increased to 300 k cal /day due to 15% increase in BMR. Diet sh ould contain 20% Protein (better from animal source), 30% fat, and 50% carbohydrates. Sufficien t fluids should be taken. (10 glasses for a day). Absorption of iron is interfered if taken with tea, coffee or foods rich in fluoride. Enhanced if taken with lemon water or orange juice. Enco urage mother to take plenty of fruits and vegetables like mango, guava, orange, amla etc containing vitamin C. Emp hasize the importance of high protein diet like black gram, ground nuts, whole grains, milk, eggs etc. Supplementatio n - Iron, folic acid and calcium as prescribed WEIGHT gain in Pregnancy Total weight gain approximately 12 Kgs. Weig ht gain of 2 kgs in first trimester. 5 kgs in second and 5 kgs in third trimester. Monitoring of weight gain should be done in conjunction with close monitoring of BP . Overweight or sudden increase of weight is to be notified immediately. Oral Care It is easy to have an increase in dental decay cavities due to pregnancy. Heartburn, increased snacking, morning sickness can all increase chances of developing tooth decay or gum disease. Good oral care is an important during pregnancy as it is the most important time of life. CARE OF BREAST Breast engorgement may cause discomfort during late pregnancy. A well-fitting brassiere can give relief. Travelling during pregnancy is not prohibited but some precautions must be taken. Avoid long trips if possible. Always check with care provider before travelling. Wear seatbelt, the shoulder belt shouldd go between the breasts and the lap belt should go under the tummy. Plan for frequent stops. Get out and walk as much as possible. This will prevent swelling of the foot. When travelling by air, need to drink extra fluids. Walk around whenever possible. Do isometric exercises of legs and foot to help prevent swelling and blood clots. Do not plan to travel after 34 weeks of pregnancy. 5.10 ANTENA TAL EXERCISES Uses of Antenatal Exercise 1. Good muscle tone is maintained during labour and postnatal period. 2. Helps to reduce the backache. 3. Assist in effective pushing during labour. Types of Antenatal Exercise \u00beDeep breathing exercise. Ask the students to demonstrate the Antenatal exercises to each other. STUDENT'S ACTIVITY XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 5.indd 163 1/11/2020 2:46:18 PM5 | Maternal Health Nursing 164Breathing techniques is for pain relief during labour. Exhale before inhale is suggested. \u00beAbdominal breathing \u00beLower coastal breathing \u00beApical breathing Back and Abdominal Exercise Sit on a chair with your back against the seat back. Breathe normally, tightens the abdomen and then press the pelvis downwards to flattens your low back against the seat back. Hold for 5 seconds and relax. This exercise helps mother by correcting the low back and pelvic posture. It strengthens your abdominal muscles and prevents back pain. Pelvic floor exercises Kegels exercise is a special exercise squeeze the pubococcygeal muscle or 3 seconds relax for 3 seconds and squeeze again. It can be done 100 times twice daily for keeping the vagina toned and increase the strength of perineum to avoid birth injuries. Sit on chair with your back against seat back. Tightens the vaginal, urethral and anal muscles as if trying to withhold urination or defecation. Should do this exercise in a standing position. Pelvic floor exercise enhances the pelvic floor muscles. It helps in preparation for child birth and prevents uterine prolapsed, urinary incontinence and hemorrhoids. Lower Limb Relaxation Exercises This exercise enhance the flexibility and strength of inner thighs and pelvic muscles. It helps to accustoms to the delivery position and prevent thigh spasm during delivery. Sit on table, low chair against a wall and spread your thighs sideways. Hold for 5 seconds and relax. Lower limb relaxation exercise is suitable for pregnant women with tight thighs and not suitable for those with the pain over the pubic bones. Foot and Ankle Exercises Sit on chair with your back against your seatback with one ankle and turn foot upwards and downwards. Each up and down is as one time, repeat 10 times. Repeat the ankle to draw inward and outward circle circular movement counted as one time. Repeat the same step at the other ankle. Ankle exercise helps to reduce leg swelling and varicose vein thus alleviating the problems of leg cramps. Exercises and Activities to be avoided during Pregnancy Activities that require extensive jumping, hopping, skipping, bouncing. Double leg raises, deep knee bends. Trunk rotation while standing. Exercises in hot and humid weather. Bouncing while stretching.

They can cause birth defects in the unborn child. Hazards include physical factors, germs, tobacco, alcohol, health conditions of the mother, chemicals, and drugs.Warning signs of Pregnancy Vaginal bleeding Persistent vomiting Chills and fever Sudden es cape of clear fluid from vagina Abdominal or chest pain Increase or decrease in fetal movement The nurse must educate the women that if above symptoms are present they must come to the hospital immediately. Prepare health education plan for Primi Antenatal mother STUDENT'S ACTIVITY Minor disorders in pregnancy Morning sickness Heartburns Varicose veins Backache Breathlessness Palpitations Vaginal discharge Con stipation Nearly 4 million newborns die {40% of under 5 deaths} within 28 days of birth Thre e quarters of neonatal deaths occur during first 7 days For every newborn death, 20% from birth injury, complications of preterm birth or other neonatal conditions A child born in a least developed country is 14 times more likely to die within first 28 days of life as compared to industrialized country XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 5.indd 165 1/11/2020 2:46:18 PM5 | Maternal Health Nursing 166These symptoms are common during pregnancy. There is no need for any special treatment, it will subside. But any of the above symptoms interferes in normal routine life then they need to contact the care provider. Advice the antenatal mother in the above components to follow up till the next visit to the hospital. Preparation for Birth During the last few months of pregnancy the mother will be taught about the following Recognizing signs of true versus false labor When to go to the hospital Approaches to pain control Things t o bring for labor and after Planning for children at home Care of the newborn 5.11 POST NATAL CARE Introduction More than 60% of maternal deaths take place during postpartum period. The first 48 hours are most crucial because Most maternal and neonatal complications are occur during this period. The puerperium is the period beginning after delivery and ending when the woman's body has returned as closely as possible to its prepregnant state. The p eriod lasts approximately 6 weeks. The postnatal care starts after the childbirth to 6 weeks Aims of Postnatal Care Prevention of sepsis at placental site New born care Initiation of breast feeding Nursing Assessment Immediate Postpartum Assessment. The first 1 hour after delivery of the placenta (fourth stage of labor) is the critical period; post partum hemorrhage is most likely to occur at this time. Components of Postnatal Care 1. Postnatal check up includes Pulse, BP , RR. Temp and Pallor. Monitor vital signs every 4 hours during the first 24 hours, then every 8 to 12 hours 2. BUB BLE-HE is a acronym used to denote the components of the postpartum maternal nursing status B- Breast: Assess for breast engorgement and condition of nipples if breast-feeding. Size, Shape, Firmness, Redness, Symmetry Check the Breasts for - nodules, lumps Check the Nipples - assess for eversion, flat, inverted, cracking, bleeding, pain, blisters XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 5.indd 166 1/11/2020 2:46:18 PM5 | Maternal Health Nursing 167 Individualize teaching for breasts for breastfeeding Check the breasts for signs of engorgement (swollen, tender, tense, shiny breast tissue). If breasts are engorged and the woman is breast-feeding: \u00beAllow warm to hot wet towel to cover the breasts and massage to improve comfort. \u00beExpress some milk manually or by breast pump to improve comport and make nipple more available for infant feeding. \u00beFeeding the infant. \u00beA mild a nalgesic may be used to enhance comfort U: Uterine Assessment Abdomen : Monitoring of involution process Check firmness of the fundus at regular intervals. Palpating the uterine fundus Firm or \"Boggy\" - not palpable by 10 days. Ask for \"afterpains\" (the pain occurs due to uterine contraction towards involution after delivery). B: Bladder Observe for the woman's first void within 6 to 8 hours after delivery. Palpate the abdomen for bladder distention if the woman is unable to void or complains of fullness after voiding. a. Uterine displacement from the midline suggests bladder distention Instruct the woman to void every several hours and after meals to keep her bladder empty. B: Bowels Bowels in shock just moved into some strange positions. So plenty of fiber , fluids and Take a stool softener- to avoid harm to the episiotomy or trauma to the C-section incision L: Lochia Inspect the perineum regularly for frank bleeding. Note color, amount, and odor of the lochia. Count the number of perineal pads that are saturated in each 8 hour period. Calculate the amount of bleeding Check for lochia (vaginal discharge after delivery) The Characteristics of Lochia LOCHIA TYPE COLOR DURATION COMPOSITION Lochia Rubra Red fragments of Perineum Assess perineal incisions (episiotomy wound) for signs of infection and healing by REEDA \u00beR: Redness PM5 | Health Nursing 168 Assess for lacerations/edema/hemorrhoids Assess for complications/hematoma Nursing Intervention Sitz Bath: A rotating fluid that moves the water, may fit over the commode or one can be performed with no special equipment using the bathtub other than a bathing ring. Turn tub on and allow drain to open and use a ring for circulating water. It's very shallow and only bathes the perineal area. H: Homan's Sign Assess for Signs of DVT by the Homan's Sign (Deep Vein Thrombosis) Inspect legs for signs of thromboembolism, and assess Homan's sign A Positive Homan's sign is indicative of DVT, although it's not the most reliable indicator Performing the Homan's Test Most commonly performed with the supine position while laying in bed The c alf is flexed at a 90\u00b0 angle The n urse manipulates the foot in a dorsiflexion movement If pain is felt in the calf, the Homan's Sign is said to be positive E: Emotional Status Fluctuations in estrogen levels are blamed for the emotional roller-coaster that many moms experience after birth High levels of stress, increased responsibility, and sleep deprivation exacerbate the emotion Bonding refers to the interactions between the mother and baby Caregiving of self and baby is an indicator of emotional status. Preventing Infection Observe for elevated temperature above 38\u00b0C. Evaluate episiotomy/perineum for redness, ecchymosis, edema, discharge (colour, amount, odour) and approximation of the skin. Assess for pain, burning sensation, and frequency of urination. Admini ster antibiotics as ordered. Reducing Fatigue 1. Provide a quiet and minimally disturbed environment. 2. Orga nize nursing care to keep interruptions to a minimum. 3. Enco urage the woman to minimize visitors and phone calls. 4. Enco urage the woman sleep while the baby is sleeping. (8-10 hours sleep). 5. Early ambulation. 6. Avoid strenuous activities for 6 weeks. Minimizing Pain Instruct the woman to apply ice packs to the perineal area for the first 24 hours for perineal trauma or edema. Initiate the Sitz bath for perineal discomfort after the first 24 hours. Educate to do three times a day for 15 to 20 minutes. Instruct the woman to contract her buttocks before sitting to reduce perineal discomfort. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 5.indd 168 1/11/2020 2:46:18 PM5 | Maternal Health Nursing 169 Assist the woman in the use of positioning cushions and pillows while sitting or lying. Admini ster pain medication as indicated. Minor Ailments in Postnatal Period After pains Retention of urine Pain at site of perineum Engorgement of breast Treatment of Anaemia Postnatal Exercise Pelvic floor exercise Abdominal tightening Pelvic tilting or rocking Hip hitching Foot and Leg Exercise Immediate postpartum exercises can be performed in bed. Toe Stretch (tightens calf muscles)- While lying on your back, keep your legs straight and point your toes away from you, then pull your legs toward you and point your toes toward your chest. Repeat 10 times. Pelvic floor exercise (tightens perineal muscles)-Contract your buttocks for the count of 5 and relax. Contract your buttocks and press thighs together for the count of 7 and relax. Contract buttocks, press thighs together, and draw in anus for the count of 10 and relax. Care of New Born Keeping baby warm Maintain Hygiene Cord care Breast feeding Imm unization Average lifetime risk of maternal death for a woman in least developed country is >300 times than in industrialized country In de veloping world a woman has 1 in 76 lifetime risk of maternal death as compared to 1 in 8000 in industrialized countries Global MMR stood at 430/lakh live births in 1990, and at 400/lakh in 2005 Health Education Postpartum Care and Hygiene Advise the mother to wash perineum daily and after passing urine and stools. Change perineal pads every 4 - 6 hours. Wash hands frequently and take bath daily. Nutritional Advice Increase intake of fluid and food especially iron and protein rich foods like green leafy vegetables, jaggery, lentils, eggs and meat. Increase intake of milk and milk products like curd, cheese etc. Calorie need per day 2200+700 =2900 Kcal Advise adequate rest. IFA Supplementation Women with normal Hb are advised to take 1 IFA tablet daily for 3 months. If Hb below 11 gm/dl, advise her to take 2 IFA tabs daily and repeat Hb after 1 month.

Breastfeeding Advise the mother for exclusive breast feeding on demand, atleast 6 to 8 times during day & 2-3 times during night. Educate that breast feeding is best and Pre-Lacteal feeds must be avoided. Breast feeding Problems Cracked /sore nipples -Advise the mother to apply hind milk for soothing effect, ensure correct positioning and attachment of baby. Engorged breasts - Advise the mother to continue breast feeding and to put warm compresses. Registration of Birth Emphasize the importance of registration of birth with local panchayat. It is a legal document and it is required for many purposes. Warning Signs of Puerperium Advise the mother to report if following symptoms occur \u00beFever, Convulsions \u00beExcessive bleeding \u00beSevere abdominal pain \u00beDifficu lty in breathing \u00beFoul smelling lochia Educate about the Immunization for the child Advise about the importance of postnatal exercises At 6 weeks following delivery - Ask the mother for the following Has vaginal bleeding stopped? Has menstrual cycle returned? Is there any foul smelling vaginal discharge? Any problems regarding breast feeding? Any other complaints? Give relevant advice & refer to doctor if needed. 5.12 FAMILY PLANNING METH ODS \"DELAY THE FIRST, POSTPONE THE SECOND AND PREVENT THE THIRD\" Definition An Expert committee (1971) of the WHO defined family planning as: \" A way of thinking and living that is adopted voluntarily upon the basic of knowledge, attitudes and responsible decision by individuals and couples, in-order to promote the health and welfare of the family and thus contributes effectively to the social development of the country\" .

Intrauterine device COPPER T: Copper T is a small T-shaped, barium- sulphate incorporated, polythene device that is placed inside uterus to obtain birth control. The placement is done with a plastic syringe called the IUD inserter.A fine copper wire weighing 120 mg, with a surface area of 208 mm2, is wound round the upright limb of T. Two fine filaments are attached to the lower tip of the vertical limb. Copper T along with its inserter is supplied in a pre-sterilized packet. Copper T is inserted on the 6th day following the menstrual period. The ideal time for postpartum insertion of Copper T is immediately after delivery .Copper T is introduced 12 weeks after abortion, a doctor or a trained paramedical person carries out the insertion . Use of copper-T may lead to irregular bleeding, more cramps and pain during menstrual cycle. It is a widely preferred method of contraception. Complication may lead to miscarriage, preterm or infection rarely.

XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 6.indd 180 1/11/2020 2:50:41 PM6 | Child Health Nursing 1816.1 INTRODUCTION Child Health Nursing is aimed to provide the highest possible state of health to each child. It includes preventing diseases or injuries, helping children to meet their health needs, to achieve and maintain adequate health and development. The role of the paediatric nurse depends on her education, experience, job structure and professional demands. The child care depends on the understanding of the parent about the growth and development of the child. The goal of the paediatric nursing is to faster the growth and development of the children and promote an optimum state of health physically, mentally and socially, so that they may function at the peak of their capacity. 6.2 GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT Growth is an increase in the size of the whole body or any of its part. It can be measured in inches, centimetres, pounds or kilograms. Development is functional maturation. It is a progressive increase in skills and capacity of function. Each child has its own rate of physical, social, emotional and spiritual growth and development. All children grow through the normal sequence of development. 6.2.1 F ac tors influencing Growth and Development 1. Heredity: The characteristics are transmitted through genes that are responsible for size, shape of the body and also the family illness. 2. Race: Similar physical characteristics are seen in people belonging to the same race. 3. Sex: A male baby is larger than female 4. Intra uterine development: Maternal and nutritional deficiencies, drugs and infections during pregnancy can have effect on the growing foetus. 5. Illness and injury: Illness may reduce the weight and minimise the child's process. 6. Nutr ition: Quality and quantity of food consumed by the child have effect on his/her body building and resistance. 7. Environment: Sunshine, air, socio economic factors also affect children's development. 8. Ordina l position in the family: Y ounger children learn from older, which may be lacked by the first child. 9. Emo tions: Lack of love, security, and parent child attachment can affect the personality. The disturbed children are always slow in development. 10. Intelligence: It influences motor development, Psycho social development and learning ability. 11. Exercise: Stimulates physical and muscular activity. 12. Hormones: Plays an important role in growth and development. E.g. deficiency of growth hormone causes dwarfism and over production leads to gigantism. 6.2.2 Growth Periods 1. New born - From birth to four weeks. 2. Infant - from birth to one year. 3. Toddler - from one year to three years. 4. Preschooler - from three years to six years. 5. Schoolage - from six to twelve years. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 6.indd 181 1/11/2020 2:50:41 PM6 | Child Health Nursing 1826. Adolescent - from thirteen to nineteen years.

Holding a spoon) Fine Motor Skills:- Takes more learning to get the correct movement. (Eg. Head control) 6.2.3 Infant (1-12 months) : The infancy period is one of the rapid motor cognitive and social development period Physical growth:- During infant period the birth weight doubles at 6 months and triples at 1 year. Total height increases by 50% at 1 year. Head and chest circumference are equal at 1 year. Pulse rate is 130 - 140/mt. Respiration is 36-40 /mt.Blood months.

Weight: The normal full term infant weighs between 2700 gms and 3850 gms. Among teens 44% girls are attempting to loose weight and 40% of boys regularly exercise with the goal of increasing muscle mass.3. Head circumference : Usually 33cms - 37cm s 4. Ches t circumference : The chest circumference is about 30-33cms 5. Skin : The skin is pink or red. In the black newborn reddish black. The s kin may be covered with vernix caseosa, a cheese like greasy yellowish white substance. Lanugos is a very thin, soft distribution of fine hair over the body. Most evident on the shoulders, extremities, forehead and temporal. 6. Ear: New born's ear cartilages are well formed. 7. Female genitalia: Labio majora are fully formed and the clitoris is not prominent. Male genitalia: Scrotum is well developed pendulous and testes are well down in the scrotal sac. 8. Apgar Score:- The APGAR score was formulated by Dr. VIRGINIA APGAR in the 1950 as a way of assessing the baby's condition at birth and the need for resuscitation. Five inter related variables assessed at 1,5 and 10 minutes. Baby Valentine in California was the largest newborn baby in the world weighing more than 13 pounds (5.9 kg) XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 6.indd 185 1/11/2020 2:50:43 PM6 | Child Health Nursing 186Total score - 10 No depression - 7-10Mild 4-7 Severe 1-4 The scores are added and the total score is documented. Babies scoring above seven rarely need resuscitation. The APGAR score which is undertaken to determine how well the baby is adjusting from intrauterine to extra uterine life. 9. Vital Signs: Axiliary temperature 36.5o C - 37.6o C Heart rate 120 - 140/minute Respiration 40-60 /minute 10. Grasp reflex : Mature newborn's grasp is strong.Sign 0 1 2 Appearance Blue, pale Body pink Limbs blue All pink Pulse (heart rate) Absent <100 >100 Grimace (response to stimuli) None Grimace cry Activity (muscle tone) Limp Some flexion of limbs Active movements Respiratory effort None Slow irregular Good strong cry What reflexes should be present in an infant? 1. Rooting reflex - The reflex begins when the corner of the baby's mouth is touched. 2. Sucking reflex - Helps the baby become ready to suck. 3. Moro reflex - It is often called as startle reflex. 4. Tonic neck reflex - Also known as fencing reflex. 5. Grasp reflex - When an object is placed in an infant's hand and the palm of the child is stroked. The fingers will close reflexively. 6. Stepping reflex - when the soles of their feet touch a flat surface, they will attempt to walk by placing one foot infront of another. 6.4 NURSING CARE OF HEALTHY NEO NATES The first week of life is the most critical period in the life of an infant. The expert obstetric care is scarce and the home environment conditions in which baby is born are usually unsatisfactory. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 6.indd 186 1/11/2020 2:50:44 PM6 | Child Health Nursing 187 Objectives 1. To establish and maintain cardiopulmonary functions. 2. To m aintain body temperature. 3. To avoid infections. 4. For satisfactory feeding regime. 5. For early detection and treatment of congenital and acquired disorders. 6.4.1 Nursing care of healthy new born baby includes I Immediate care II Routine care I. Immediate Care Immediate basic care of neonates at birth includes maintenance of temperature, establishment of airway, initiation of breathing and maintenance of circulation. 1. Clearing the Airway As majority babies cry at birth and take spontaneous respiration. No resuscitation is required at birth for about 95 to 98% neonates. Establishment and maintenance of cardio respiratory function (ex. breathing) is the most important thing. The chest movement of the baby is primary and everything else is secondary. Airways should be cleaned of mucus and other secretions by gentle suction Resuscitation may require more active measures such as suction, application of oxygen mask, integration and assisted respiration. 2. Apgar Score It is an useful quantitative assessment of neonates condition at birth, especially for the respiratory, circulatory and neurological status.II. Daily routine Care of Neonates \u0099Warmth \u0099Care of umbilical cord \u0099Care of the eyes of the skin \u0099Breast \u0099Weig ht Recording \u0099Imm unization The major goal of nursing care of the new born, infant is to establish and maintain homeostasis. 1. Warmth Warmth is provided by keeping the body dry and wrapping with adequate clothing. It can be placed in skin to skin contact with mother to maintain temperature. (Auxillary temp 36.5 0 C - 37.60C) 2. Care of Umbilical Cord The umbilical cord is cut about 2-3 inches from the naval with aseptic precautions during delivery and tied with sterile cotton thread or disposable plastic clip. The cord must be inspected for infection. 3. Care of the Eyes Eyes should be cleaned with sterile cotton swabs soaked is sterile water or normal saline. Observe the eyes for redness, sticky discharge or excessive tearing for early detection of problems and for prompt management. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 6.indd 187 1/11/2020 2:50:44 PM6 | Child Health Nursing 1884. Care of the Skin The b aby must be cleaned off blood, mucous and meconium by gently wiping before he or she is presented to the mother. During hospital stay 'no bath' reduces the incidence of neonatal infections. No vigorous attempt should be made to remove the vernix caseosa. 5. Breast Feeding The b aby should be put to the mother's breast within half an hour of birth or as soon as possible. No p relactal feeds to be given and colostrums feedings must be offered. Educate the mother about breast feeding techniques. Initially the feeding should be given in short interval of 1-2 hours and then every 2-3 hours. Most babies regularize their feeding pattern by the end of first week. 6. Baby Bath During hospital \"No bath\" Baby bath should be given with warm water in warm room Baby should be dried immediately from head to toe and wrapped in a dry warm towel. Use of olive oil or coconut oil can be allowed after 3-4 weeks of age. Exposure to sunlight is an important source of vitamin D and warmth.7. Clothing The b aby should be dressed with loose soft and cotton clothes. The c lothes should not be too tight around the neck or abdomen. Clothes should be cleaned with light detergent and washed properly and sun dried. 8. General Care Baby should be handled with gentle approach after proper hand washing. No inf ected person should handle. Baby should be allowed to sleep in supine position. 9. Weight Recording Average daily weight gain in healthy, new born baby increases about 30g/day in the first month of life. It is about 20g/ day in second month and 10g/day afterwards during the first year of life. Mos t infants double their birth weight by 4-5 months. 10. Immunization All neonates should be immunized with BCG, 'O' dose OPV and 'hepatitis B' vaccine at birth. Mother should be informed about the recommended National Immunization Scheme. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 6.indd 188 1/11/2020 2:50:44 PM6 | Child Health Nursing 1896.4.2 Harmful Traditional Practices Harmful traditional practices are forms of actions in certain communities. A large number of customs and cultural practices are found for mother and child. Harmful practices should be avoided. The examples are Use of cow dung or mud on umbilical cord Discarding colostrums and delayed breast feeding. Prelactal feeds like gold rubbed in water, honey, sugar water, distilled water and donkey's milk Neglecting female new born emotionally and nutritionally Instillation of oil into eye and ears before bath Usin g grape water or bonnison Giving opium and brandy Usin g feeding bottles Application of kajal in the new born eyes 6.4.3 Identification of Risk Infants It means that a new born has great chances of complication because of the mother during labour or birth. In Zambia people use the following in umblical cord as: Drying agents: charcoal & dust. Lubricating agents: Vaseline, cooking oil and used motor oil.Protective agents: breast milk, cow dung and chicken faecesThe basic criteria for identifying these babies include Birth weight less than 2.5 kg - preterm or small for date. Weight below 70% expected weight failure to gain weight during 3 successive months Twins, Birth order 5 and more Artificial feeding , Children with diarrhoea Congenital disorders like down's syndrome Apnoea or asphyxia Dimo rphism 6.5 FEEDING The growth of the infants during the first 6 months of the life is greater and faster than any other period of life. Feeding plays an important role in it. Principles 1. To provide sufficient fluid 2. To g et adequate food 3. To p rovide balanced composition 4. To p rovide easily digestible food Stem cell therapy:- Stem cell therapy is the use of stem cells to treat or prevent a disease or condition. Bone marrow transplant is the most widely used stem - cell therapy. But some therapies derived from umbilical cord blood are also in use. It is more applicable to treat neurodegenerative diseases and conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 6.indd 189 1/11/2020 2:50:44 PM6 | Child Health Nursing 190 6.5.1 Types of Feeding Feeding Breast Feeding Artificial Feeding Breast feeding: The two important reasons for breast feeding is avoidance of infections and survival. Advantages of Breast Feeding 1. Ideal composition for easy digestion with low osmatic load. 2. Protection against infection and deficiency disorders. 3. Breast milk are readily available in body temperature and sterile. 4. Requiring no preparation and costs nothing. 5. It has laxative action. 6. No d anger of allergy. 7. Maintains healthy mother and child relationship. 8. Chance of conception is less during lactation.9. Helps in the involution of the uterus. 10. Reduces the risk of breast and ovarian cancer of mother. 11. Breast feeding protects the infant from allergy and bronchial asthma. It also protects against tetany, neonatal hypoglycemia and vitamin deficiencies. 12. It is essential for the brain growth of an infant. 6.5.2 Common Problems in Breast Feeding Even though breast milk is best to feed the baby as it offers a lot more than just nutrition. There are several challenges in breast feeding. They are 1. Due t o mother 2. Due t o infant Due to Mother 1. Reluctance 2. ov er anxiety 3. Fo llowing operative surgery 4. Ma ternal illness 5. In adequate secretion 6. Br east ailments Due to Infant 1. Low birth weight babies 2. Pr eterm babies 3. Tem porary illness 4. Ov er distension of the foetal PM6 | Child Health Nursing 1916.5.3 Techniques of Breast Feeding Mother should be comfortable and relaxed physically and mentally before giving feed. She should wash her hand and can have a glass of milk or water. Mother should have no due work while feeding the baby. Baby should be cleaned and dried before feeding because, baby may feel discomfort or may not co-operate during feeding. Positioning during Breast Feeding Sit or lie down comfortably with mother's back supported. Make sure the baby has one arm on either side of the breast as you pull the baby close. Use firm pillows or folded blankets under the baby to keep supported during the feeding. Support the baby's back and shoulder firmly. Once t he baby's mouth is open wide, pull the baby quickly on your back. Babies have a powerful sense of smell and can identify their mother's breast milk by scent. Common positions used during breast feeding a. Football position b. Cradlin g position c. Lying down position d. Across the lap position e. Latching on position 6.5.4 Burping All babies swallow air when they suck. They collect as a bubble in the babies stomach causing discomfort. So burping of the baby is essential to prevent aspiration of milk into trachea. Burping should be done each time after every feed. Put the baby over the mother's shoulder and give a gentle tap on the child's back, till the baby burps or for few seconds. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 6.indd 191 1/11/2020 2:50:45 PM6 | Child Health Nursing 1926.5.5 Weaning It is the process of gradually introducing an infant to what will be its adult diet and withdrawing the supply of its mother milk. Begin the Weaning by 6 Months Upto six months no other foods (including water) should be given except breast milk. Problems during Weaning 1. If breast feeding is stopped, suddenly, it can have psychological and nutritional effect on the young children.2. Solid foods can cause diarrhoea if not digested properly. 3. If w eaning foods are too poor to provide adequate nutrients, the children can develop malnutrition. 6.6. ARTIFICIAL FEEDING When the infant is feed by any preparation other than breast milk is called artificial feeding. Factors contributing to rising incidence of artificial feeding in India Artificia l FeedingLack of interest in Health workers Wrong belief and ignoranc e Availabilityalternative tomother 's mi lk Working mothers Urge to sophisticate d Aping the wes t Aggressive Publicityand advertisements Changing life s tyle Indication Contraindication of breast feeding either temporary or permanent reason. Mother reluctant in breast feeding. Inadequate of breast milk as evidenced by first feeding. Changing life style of women or pressurized under socio economic condition. Foods used There is no perfect substitute for breast milk. In general boiled liquid cow's milk various dried milk preparation and to a lessen World breast feeding week is an annual celebration which is being help every year from 1-7 August is more than 120 countries. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 6.indd 192 1/11/2020 2:50:46 PM6 | Child Health Nursing 193event unsweetened or sweetened condensed milk are commonly used as artificial feeds. In some countries goat's milk or buffalo milk are used. Composition Sugar Fat Protein Minerals Water Calories Human 7 3.5 1.2 0.4 89 67 Cow 4.5 3.5 3.4 0.8 88 67 6.6.1 Cup feeding Various types of utensils are used for artificial feeding of infant. In some communities metal cups or container with a spout are used for this purpose. But cup feeding is more advisable for newborn than bottle feeding. Advantages of Cup Feeding \u0099Promotes tongue action \u0099Heat confusion \u0099Enco urages the initial digestion of the milk in the mouth \u0099Easy to sterilize than bottle and heat Disadvantages \u0099Addiction to the cup feed \u0099Aspiration may occur with an incorrect technique \u0099The len gth of the feed is longerIndication As an interim measure for full term babies when breast feeding is not yet established e.g. maternal infant separation. For the preterm infant without sufficient suck / swallow coordination. Procedure Ensure the baby is alert and interested. Gather equipment. \u00beExpressed breast milk. \u00beSterilized cup (small, open, slightly shaped and made from polyethylene or similar) \u00beBib / napkin \u00beBaby's records Wash and dry hands Sit comfortably with the baby in an upright sitting position. Cuddled close to the parent's body. Consider swaddling the top half of the baby (to prevent hands knocking the cup) and using a suitably placed bib. Choose to feed in skin-to-skin contact. Place the cup (about half full, if possible) lightly on the baby's bottom lip, reaching the corners of his mouth, with the level of milk touching his lips. Begin slowly. Retain the cup in this position (throughout any pauses) allowing the baby to lap with tongue forwards. Avoid the temptation to pour the milk in. The b aby will determine the pace and cease feeding when no longer hungry. Ensure that the feed time has been relaxed and pleasurable with lots of comfort and social interaction for the baby. Return the baby to a safe environment once finished. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 6.indd 193 1/11/2020 2:50:47 PM6 | Child Health Nursing 194 Wash and sterilize the cup, wash and dry hands. Complete documentation, note the volume of liquid ingested, the time taken and the effect for the baby. When a baby is not being breast fed the midwife has an important role in facilitating safe and effective infant nutrition using formula milk. Powdered infant formula milk is suitable for newborn babies are modified cow's milk and are either whey or casein dominant whichever milk is chosen, it must be an age suitable formula. Equally where the manufacturers suggest preparation at a lower water temperature; this advice should be disregarded. 6.6.2 Storage of prepared Feeds Preparing a powdered feed and then storing it is strongly discouraged. It should be prepared as near to the time to leave as possible. If the feed is not used within 2 hours it should be discarded. If reheating a feed, warm water can be used for upto 15 minute either by placing the bottle in the water or by holding it under a running tap. Micr owaves should not be used due to the inconsistent action of reheating. 6.6.3 Complementary Feeding It's a gradual addition of solid foods to the infant's diet according to individual infant's capacity and gradual withdrawal of breast / artificial feeding in frequency and quality.Principles Start weaning when child is free from any Gastrointestinal trouble. One f ood item is introduced at interval of 4-7 days to allow for identification of food allergies and to allow the child to get used to it. New foods are fed in small amounts from one teaspoon to few tablespoons. Food should not be mixed in bottle and feed through nipple. 6.6.4 Methods of Complementary Feeding Sl. No.Age Food items to be given 16 months Dhal soup Oran ge soup / fruit soup Green leafy vegetable soup Ragi porridge Banana 27-9 months Idli Mashed rice with dhal Vegetable soup Egg yolk / fish Mashed carrot or potato Biscuits, kitchadi, kesari 310-12 months Chic ken, liver XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit PM6 | Child Health Nursing 1956.6.5 Dietary need Growth requirements combined with physical activity play a role in determining a child's nutritional needs. Nutritional needs change with different life stages. It is important to take into account the extra demands placed on the body by these changes.

XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 6.indd 196 1/11/2020 2:50:47 PM6 | Child Health Nursing 197 Definition The cold chain is a system of storage and transport of vaccines at low temperature from the manufacturer to the actual vaccination site. The Cold Chain Equipment The cold chain equipment consists of: Walk in cold rooms Deep freezers Ice lin ed refrigerator cold b oxes Vaccin e carriers Dry c arriers Ice p acks For successful cold chain system, cold chain equipment, transportation system and motivation and training of the workers for maintenance of cold chain link are essential. Vaccines stored Freezer - polio and measles. Cold compartment - DPT, DT, TT, diluents, typhoid and BCG. 1998 study of 12 U.K. children revealed that there is no link between vaccination and autism. 6.8 DISORDERS OF NEWBORN Neonatal disorders means disturbance of normal state of body organs and abnormal function of a new born.Transp ortation in refrigerated va ns or cool bo xesPrimar y vaccine st oreTransit storag e Cold ro Nursing 198Neonatal Disorders Minor Major 6.8.1 Minor Disorders of the Newborn a. Molding: The head may appear asymmetric in the new born of a vertex birth caused by the over riding of the cranial bones during labour and birth. Diminishes within few days after birth. b. Stuffy Nose: Stuffy nose leads to mouth breathing and excessive air swallowing which leads to abdominal distension and vomiting. Cleaning the nostrils with cotton swabs socked with normal saline will reduce the problem. c. Thrus h: Thrush may be oral or in the napkin area including buttocks and inner thighs. Treatment is 1% G.V paint or Nystatin suspension applied with cotton swabs. d. Phimos is: Pinpoint prepuce which makes the baby cry during micturition. It requires dilatation by mosquito forceps. e. Mangolian Spots: Bluish black areas of pigmentation more commonly noted on the back and buttocks. They fade gradually all over months or years. f. Nev i : Telengiectatic nevi are pink and easily planched. They may appear on the upper eyelids, nose, upper lip and nap of the neck. They have no clinical significance and fade my second year of life. g. Physiological Jaundice: 40% of physiological jaundice. Jaundice becomes visible on second and third day. Usually peaking between the second and fourth day and decreasing between 5th and 7th days of life. It is believed to be the result of increased bilirubin production from the break down of foetal RBCs. Treatment is not necessary, but some children may need phototherapy. h. Pseudo Menstruation: Pseudo menstruation or vaginal bleeding is caused by pregnancy hormones. It resolves when maternal hormones deplete from neonates body. Reassure the parents. i. Vomiting: Many newborns vomit, be alert indicate a bowel obstruction which needs attention. Vomi of blood vomit, vomiting green - bile can ting can be due to motion sickness or indigestion. j. Dehydration: The water content in the body reduces resulting in dehydration. When babies suffer from health problems like cold, cough or throat infection, the intake reduces and resulting in dehydration. k. Diarrhoea: The poop is normally much softer than an adult, if it suddenly gets much looser or more watery and happens more often and in large amounts it may be diarrhoea. An infection with a virus, bacteria or parasite. Babies can get dehydrated very quickly within a day or two after diarrhoea starts. Continue breast feeding or formula feeding. Small amounts of hydrating solutions should be given frequently. l. Cord infection : Infection of the umbilical cord stump is called as omphalitis. It can be caused by skin bacteria. Application of an antiseptic to umbilical cord is a best treatment. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 6.indd 198 1/11/2020 2:50:49 PM6 | Child Health Nursing 1996.8.2 Major New born Disorders It can be divided into congenital anomalies and acquired problems. 6.8.2.1 Congenital Anomalies It can be defined as structural or functional anomalies, for example metabolic disorders. That occur during intra uterine life and can be identified in prenatal period or birth, or some times may only be detected in infancy such as hearing defects. Birth defects Physical Developmental Most Common Types a. Congenital Heart Disease: An abnormality in the heart that develops before birth ex. Ventricular septal defect. b. Down Syndrome: A genetic chromosome 21 disorder causing developmental symptoms. c. Cleft L ip and Palate: Opening or splits in the roof of the mouth and lip. d. Spina Bifida: Failure in the development of spinal cord. e. Club Foot: Foot is twisted out of shape or position. f. Phenyl Ketonuria: A birth defect that causes amino acid called phenylalanine to build up in the body. g. Edward's Syndrome : A condition that causes severe developmental delays due to chromosome disorder. It also called as trisomy 18. 1983 the average life expectancy of a person with down's syndrome was a mere 25 years old today its 60.6.8.2.2 Acquired Disorders These are not inherited or present at birth, but developing after birth. Some of the disorders are 1. Low birth weight 2. Malnutrition 3. Infections and parasites 1. Low birth weight: A (LBW) low birth weight infant is an infant with a birth weight of less than 2.5 kg regardless of gestational age. a. Preterm babies: Babies born before 37 weeks of gestation. If given good neonatal care these babies can catch up growth by 2-3 years of age. b. Sma ll for date: (SFD) These babies may be born at term or preterm. They weigh less than 10% of the gestational age. SFD have a high risk of dying not only during the neonatal period, but during their infancy most of them become victims of protein energy malnutrition and infections. Risk factors 1. Malnutrition 2. Infection Treatment 1. Increase food intake 2. Control infections 3. Early detection and treatment of medical disorders. 2. Malnutrition: Scarcity of suitable food, lack of purchasing power of the family, traditional beliefs, taboos, leads to an insufficient balanced diet resulting in malnutrition.

Iron Anaemia 3. Infections and parasitic diseases Y oung children fall an easy prey to infectious diseases. They are diarrhoea, respiratory infections, measles, pertussis, polio, neonatal tetanus, tuberculosis and diptheria. Intestinal parasites such as ascariasis, hook worm, and giardiasis are common, because of poor environmental sanitation and paucity of portable drinking water. 6.9 MAJOR CHILDHOOD PROBLEMS A child's development is usually continuous, but temporary pauses may occur. Common disorders of the children are. 6.9.1 Behavioural problems Children abandoned by their families present severe social and health problems.Definition Behavioural problem is characterised by a significant deviation from the socially accepted normal behaviour. Etiology Faulty parental attitude.

A brief account of these programmes which are currently in operation and related to child health are discussed below. 6.10.1 Maternal and Child Health Programme (MCH) The term maternal and child health refers to the promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative health care for mothers and children. The main objective is reduction of maternal, perinatal infant and childhood mortality and morbidity. 6.10.2 Weekly Iron and Folic acid Supplementation (WIFS) Programme Iron folic acid supplementation of 100mg iron and 500mg folic acid to reduce the prevalence and severity of anaemia in school going adolescent girls and boys in 6th-12th government / government aided / municipal schools. 6.10.3 National Deworming Day National deworming day is a single fixed day approach to treating intestinal worm infection in all children aged 1-19 years and is held on 10th February and 10th August each year. 6.10.4 UIP Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) is a Vaccination Program launched by the Government of India in 1985. It became a part of child survival and safe motherhood programme in 1992. The aim of this programme is to give vaccination for 12 diseases. The twelve diseases are Tuberculosis, Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Poliomyelitis, Measles, Hepatitis B, Diarrhoea, Japanese 6.10.5 Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBS K) It is a new initiative aiming at early identification and early intervention for, children from birth to 18 years to cover '4D's Defects at birth Deficien cies Diseases Delayed developments / Disability 6.10.6 Pulse Polio Immunization: (PPI) This programme was launched in India in 1995. C hildren in the age group of 0-5 years administered Polio drops during national and sub national immunization rounds. World Immunization Day is celebrated every year on November 10. This day is celebrated to make people aware about the importance of getting timely vaccination against vaccine preventable diseases. 6.10.7 Intensified efforts to reduce child deaths due to diarrhoea The main aim is to reduce child deaths due XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 6.indd 202 1/11/2020 2:50:50 PM6 | Child Health Nursing 203to diarrhoea. All the deaths due to diarrhoea can be prevented by treating dehydration, with the use of ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution) and administration of zinc tablets along with adequate nutritional intake by the child. ASHA worker would undertake the distribution of ORS packets to households with the supervision of safe drinking water, breast feeding, sanitation, nutrition and hand washing. (ASHA - Accr edited Social Health Activist) 6.10.8 The Re productive and Child health Programme (RCH) This programme was launched in October 1997. The main aim of the programme is to reduce infant, child and maternal mortality rates and to reduce total fertility rate. The package include Prevention and management of unwanted pregnancy. Provision of services to promote child survival. Prevention and treatment of reproductive tractt infection and diseases. WHO on 24th February 2012 removed India from the list of countries with active endemic wild polio virus transmission. 6.10.9 Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) It was initiated by the Government of India in the Ministry of social and women's welfare in 1975. Which provides food, preschool education and primary health care to children under 6 years of age and their mothers.6.9.10 Balwadi Nutrition Programme This programme was started in the year 1970 under the Ministry of Social Welfare. The aim is to provide primary education to 3-6 years children. The food supplement provides 300Kcal and 10gms of protein per children. 6.10.11 Mid-day meal programme Mid-day meal programme is also known school lunch programme to noon meal programme. This Programme has been in operation since 1961 throughout the country under Ministry of Education. The object is to attract more children for admission to schools and return them so that literacy improvements of children could be brought about. Principles The meal should be a supplement and not a substitute to the home diet. The cos t of the meal should be reasonably low. The m enu should be frequently changed to avoid monotonous. 6.10.12 Pallisirar Kannoli Kappom Thittam: Refractive errors (need for glasses) are the second main cause for avoidable blind and the rate of optometrists in reducing this condition XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 6.indd 203 1/11/2020 2:50:51 PM6 | Child Health Nursing 204significantly. It involved many screening activities including cataract and diabetic retinopathy. School children vision screening occupies the major. Group Activity: Screen the school children for refractive errors. Refer affected children to the Government Hospital and encourage them to wear spectacles. CONCLUSION Growth is an increase in the size of the whole body parts, and the development in the functional maturation. The difference stages of growth and development are explained with the measures. First primary tooth is lost and permanent teeth begins to erupt at 6 - 7 years. Normal length of the newborn is 47.5cms to 53.75 cms and weight is 2.7 kgs to 3.8 kgs. APGAR score was formulated by Dr. Verginia Apgar in 1950. The baby should be put to the mother's breast with in half an hour of birth or as soon as possible. All neonates should be immunized with BCG, 'O' dose of OPV , and 'hepatitis B' vaccine at birth. When the infant is feed by any preparation other than human milk is called artificial feeding. Immunization is the process of protecting an individual from a disease through introductions of live/killed/attenuated organisms in the individuals systems. There are minor and major disorders in infants. Acquired disorders means they are not inherited or present at birth, but developing after birth. Several measures have been under takes by the central government to improve the health of the people. These are called national health programs.

Millions of senior citizen across the globe are not getting proper healthcare they need because government and the society are not aware enough of the problem by 2026, there will be about 1200 million people aged 65 years according to un estimates. 7% of the 1.1 million Indian population is today over the age of 60. The lifespan for both male (>65 years) and female ( 75 years) has raised significantly and it is estimated that by the turn of this century, numerically the highest number of old people will be in India. Nurses and health professionals therefore have to be aware of the complexity of the care of elder people. 7.2 DEFINITION Old age is a universal problem and is a community need. This is not a disease to be cured. It is a stage where people need to be protected from accidents, infections and disabilities. According to Sir Jamessterling.Greek: genu = old age Latera = treatment Geriatrics : A branch of medicine that deals with the problems and disease of old age and aging peoples. Gerontology: Comprehensive study of aging and the problems of the aged Old age : Period of life when impairment of physical and mental functions becomes increasingly manifested in comparison to the previous years of life. 7.3 AGEING PROCESS The ageing process is the gradual, decreased ability of the body to functions and to heal itself. As our body age, they naturally deteriorate in the late years, many essential functions begin operating at a suboptimal level. There are three main factors that influence the body's ageing process. First as we grow older, the number of mistake incurred by daily Cellular reproduction increases. The body actually create non-functional cells, leading to more rapid deteriorate of the body's functions with advantage age. A large percentage of our cells even through they were present are useless. These non-functional cells sometime interfere with normal cellular process. The second part of the ageing process related to Cellular damage that cause the shortening of DNA. As time passes increased damage to healthy DNA leeds to accelerated cell death and our old bodies simply cannot generate cells fast enough to compensate for the loss. This process is most visible and obvious in XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 7.indd 209 1/11/2020 3:01:43 PM7 | Geriatric Care 210our skin the older we get the thinner our skin becomes The third part of the ageing process involves the Cellular deconregulation of our national oxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase and glutathione perxoidase, making our antioxidant defence less efficient with age. 7.3.1 The Age ing Process Starts in Human Organ From the moment of birth human beings experience continuous aging, however before the age of 25 the body can recover from temporaryconsequencence by itself, after 40 years old the body begins its real journey of ageing. 7.3.2 Common Signs and Symptoms of Ageing Increase susceptibility to infection. Greater risk of heat, stroke of hypothermia. Slight decrease in height as the bones of our spine get spinner and the lost some height. Bones break more easily. Joint changes ranging some minor stiffness to severe arthritis. Stooped posture. 7.3.3 Mechanism of Ageing DNA DAMAGE OXIDATIVE STRESS METACHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTIONAGEINGPROTEIN DAMAGE DYSREGULATION OF CELLULAR SIGNALLING Refer to the process of growing old, the British spell the word ageing, while the Americans and the Australians spell it aging. The two words are pronounced the same way both words ageing and aging are correct. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 7.indd 210 1/11/2020 3:01:43 | Geriatric Care 211 7.3.4 Biological Process of Ageing The genes determine the lifespan, genes may have a role to play in the ageing process. Wear and Tear of important organs by continues functioning . Accumulation of toxic materials (E.g.. cholesterol) in the vital organ like heart, brain eye and thereby damaging them. Loss of important genetic material during DNA repair. Accumulate of stress over lifetime with its resultant effects. Exertion of production and deficiency of important hormones e.g. growth hormone and androgen, oestrogen and thyroid hormones. Evaluation of ageing helps to explain why survival, reproductive success, and functioning of almost all living organism decline at old age. 7.4 EVOLUATIONARY BASIS OF AGEING 7.4.1 Ageing theories which mainly has been categorise into two main categories Error Theory Ageing is a result of internal or external assaults that damage cells or organs so they can no longer function properly. Programmed Theory Ageing has a biological time table or internal biological clock Error Theory a) Waste accumulation theory b) Mitochondrial damage theorya) Waste Accumulation Theory The human lifespan simply reflects the level of free radical damage that accumulates in cells when enough damage accumulates, cells cannot survive properly any more and they just simply give up. Genetic mutations occur and accumulate with increasing age, causing cells to deteriorate and malfunction RNA molecule is highly susceptible to oxidative stress b) Mitochondrial Damage Theory It is well known that mitochondrial DNA is much more oxidized with age than nuclear DNA reactive oxygen species are continuously generated in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. 2. Programmed Theory a. Immunological Theory The immune system is programmed to decline over time which leads to an increased vulnerability to infections, disease and thus aging and death. It is well documented that the effectiveness of the immune system peaks at puberty and gradually declines there after with advance in age. eg. as one grows older antibodies lose their effectiveness. 7.4.2 Biological Aging Theories Biological Aging Theories Evolutionary Physiological E volutionary Once an organism has produced viable offspring its body is no longer needed. It then ages and dies. Certain genes may be useful in early life but detrimental in later life. Late acting genes have not been removed because they act after reproduction. b) P hysiological Programmed theories maintain that ageing occurs due to intrinsic timing mechanisms and signals. eg. Genetic timers. Stochastic theories maintain that ageing occurs as the result of chance or accidental events. eg. free radical damage. 7.5 MENTAL HEALTH Changes in cognitive ability, excessive forget fullness and moodswings are not a part of normal aging. Changes in mental status may be related to many factors such alteration in diet and fluid and electrolyte balance. Therefore health professionals must recognize, assess, refer, collaborate, treat and support older adults exhibit noticeable changes in intellect of affect.

Sleep and rest pattern Coping abilities 7.5.2 Dementia Dementia and acute confusional state usually are the result of organic diseases characterised by impairment of intellectual functions. E.g..aphasia, aphaxia Clinical Manifestations Language impairment Apraxia (difficulty in performing skilled tasks) Agnosia (inability to recognise objects) Impaired executive function (poor performance, poor judgement and planning) XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 7.indd 212 1/11/2020 3:01:43 PM7 | Geriatric Care 213Diagnosis History collection Clinic al examination including mental function CSF exa mination CT sc an Treatment Home health aid to assist in personal hygiene home cares to assist in house work transportation Support groups such as the alzhemeirs associations are often of value to the family Lega l council should be recommended to help the patient and family 7.5.3 Depression Depression occurs in 5 to 10% of community - dwelling elderly due to lack of social supports. Clinical Manifestations Sleep disturbance Lack of interest Feeling of guilty Suicid al ideation Treatment Medical and pharmacological Management Methylphenidate 5 to 10 mg at 8 a.m. and noon is often very effective. Treatment should be continued for up to a year because relapse rates are higher in the elderly. 7.5.4 Acute Confusional State (Delirium) Delirium called acute confusional disorientation. Delirium due to hyponatraemia, hyperosmolality, hypercapria Clinical Manifestations Disturbance in memory, Thought disorder Emo tional changes Disturbance of perception.

Nearly half of older man and one third of older women report difficulty hearing without aHearing Aid 16% of old men and 19% of older women report difficulty seeing even with the corrective lenses. 7.6.2 Vision Decrease peripheral vision. Decrease night vision. Decrease capacity to distinguish colour. Reduced lubrication resulting in dry, itchy eyes. Management Approach people directly not from the side. Proper lighting can make a big difference. Assist with choosing clothes if needed Use of natural tear products. 7.6.3 Hearing Auditory changes begin to be noticed at about 40 years of age. Environmental factors such as exposure to noise, medications and infections as well as genetics may contribute to hearing loss. Hearing loss may cause older people to respond inappropriately. Older p eople often cannot following conversation because tones of high frequency consonants (F, S, TH, CH, SH, B, T, P) all sound alike. Management Reduce extra noise when trying to have a conversation. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 7.indd 214 1/11/2020 3:01:48 PM7 | Geriatric Care 215 Place yourself so the person can see you and fairly close - increased volume not always helpful. Make sure you have the persons attention before speaking. Have doctor check for and remove wax if needed. Arrange for hearing assessment and provide support to use a hearing aid if needed. 7.6.4 Taste and Sweet Four basic taste ( Sweet, Sour, Salty and Bitter) are particularly dulled in older people. Changes in the sense of smell are related to cell loss in the nasal passage and in the olfactory bulb in the brain. Environmental factors such as long term exposure to toxins (Dust, Pollen and Smoke) contribute to the cellular damage. Management May enjoy smaller attractive meals help to smell food preparation. Serve the food in attractive ways. 7.6.5 Skin Age related changes the thickness of epidermis decreases along with loss of moisture making the skin dry and rough. The melanocyte number decline which reduces protection against Sun rays and leads to appearance of small hypopigmentedspots. In the dermis the fibroblast number and the production of extracellular matrix decreases causing wrinkling of the skin. Scalp are turns grey due to loss of melanin. Growth of nails slows down. Management Use of moisturizers are bath oils can make bath tub slippery. As a c are provider keep nails short Pat gently when helping to dry after bathing. Bottom of feet may be core pay attention to foot dear. May feel cooler than others but be more at risk of sun stroke. Use sun screen hats long sleeves.

Avoid excessive exposure to ionizing radiations. Regu lar physical activity and maintain a healthy body weight. 7.9.13 Drug Reactions Older patients are two of three times more vulnerable to drug reaction. Drug c learance is markedly reduced due to reaction in Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Distribution of the drug is also affected in old age due to reduction in total body weight content and their relative increases in body fat. Protein binding of the drug is decreased due to fall in serum albumin in old age. CONCLUSIO N The ageing process is a profound and life - changing experience. The body slowly begins to weaken, resistance to disease is decreased and recovery time in prolonged. Acute and chronic medical conditions become more common and life - disrupting condition such as incontinence and falls can severely affect independence and quality of life. Many people age 65 or older self - report some sort of disability. These may be minor or they may be significant requiring the older person to need skilled assistance. The ageing process is experienced differently by each of us. But age - related changes are inevitable. Apart from this the types of elderly care services and common disorders of elderly has been included.

Disaster occurs suddenly and unexpectedly, disrupting the normal life and infrastructure of social services including health care system. : . : , . EXPLANATION: A flood of troubles will be overcome by the (courageous) thought which the minds of the wise will entertain, even in sorrow. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 8.indd 228 1/11/2020 3:03:16 PM8 | Disaster Management 2298.1.1 Definition A disaster is a serious disruption of the function of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental loss and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources. Disaster Alphabetically means D- destruction I-incidentS-sufferingA-administrative and financial failureS-sentimentsT-tragediesE-eruption of communicable diseasesR-research programme and implementation. 8.1.2 Types of Transport accidents /g190 Stamped e /g190 Riot/g190 Terrorist attack/g190 8.2 PHASES OF DISASTER MANAGEMENT Phase 1 Preparedn ess Phase 2 Warning / Ala rming Phase 3 Impact Phase Phase 4 Rescue Operati ons Phase 5 RescuePhase 6 RehabilitationPhase 7 Reconstructi onPhase Long Disaster Management 2308.2.1 Natural Calamities Flood When excess of water overflows, it submerges land and destroys everything that get in its way. This is called flood. Flood usually caused when the volume of water with in a lake, river, or other body of water exceeds the total capacity of the body. Sometimes level rise and causes it overflow its channel. Floods are the most common natural disaster in India What to do before hand While town planning it is the government's responsibility, individuals should find about risks in the area where they are living e.g. people who live in areas down stream from a dam should know the special signals when a dam threatens to break. Forecasting of floods or tidal waves is very difficult, but hurricanes and cyclones often occur at the same time of the year when particular vigilance must be exercised. They are often announced several hours or days before they arrive. 8.2.2 During Flood \u00beTurn off the electricity to reduce the risk of electrocution. \u00beProtect people and property (as soon as the flood begins, take the vulnerable group, children, the old, sick and the disabled to an upper floor) \u00beWhenever possible, move personal belonging upstairs or go to raised shelters provided for use in floods. \u00beBeware of water contamination if the taste, colour or smell of the water is suspicious. It is vital to use some means of purification. \u00beEvac uate denser zones as ordered by the local authorities. After a flood When a flood is over, it is important, people do not return home until that told by local authorities, who will have ensured that buildings have not been undermined by water.From then on it is essential to; \u00beWait until the water is declared safe before drinking. \u00beClean and disinfect any room that has been flooded. \u00beSterilize or wash with boiling water all dishes and kitchen utensils. \u00beGet r id of any food that has been in or near the water including canned foods and any food kept in refrigerators and freezers. \u00beGet r id of all consumables (drinks, medicines, cosmetics, etc.,) 8.2.3 Earthquakes XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 8.indd 230 1/11/2020 3:03:19 PM8 | Disaster Management 231Earthquake is one of those type of natural disaster that strike without an early warning signal. An earthquake is the result of the sudden break within the uppercrest of the earth, which may also break the surface and lead to the vibration of the ground. The world's largest earthquake with an instrumentally documented magnitude occurred on May 22 nd 1960 near Valdivia in Southern Chile. It was assigned a magnitude of 9.5 What to do before hand \u00beBuild in accordance with urban planning the regulations for risk areas. \u00beEnsure that all electrical and gas appliance in the house together with all pipes connected to them are firmly fixed. \u00beAvoid storing heavy objects and materials in high altitude. \u00beHold family evacuation drills and ensure that the whole family knows what to do in case of an earthquake. \u00bePrepare a family emergency kit. During an Earthquake \u00beKeep people calm - do not get panic. \u00bePeople who are indoors should stay there but move to the central part of the building. \u00beKeep away from the stairs, which might collapse suddenly. \u00bePeople who are outside should be away from buildings and collapsing walls and away from electric cables. \u00beAnyone in a vehicle should park it, away from bridges and buildings.After an Earthquake \u00beCheck if you or anyone else is hurt. Use first-aid for cuts and bruises. \u00beKeep the streets clear for emergency services. \u00beSwitch off all appliances like the refrigerator, Television or Radio \u00beTurn off the gas ( LPG ). \u00beWear shoes to protect your feet from debris. \u00beA ba ttery-operated radio will help you to get important messages. \u00beBe p repared for more shocks. Earthquakes occur most frequently in plate boundaries. 8.2.4 Fire Accident A fire is defined as undesirable event which emits heat, smoke and or flame, which has the potential to cause damage either mechanical or manmade. Some of the causes are:1. Cooking equipment 2. Heating 3. Smoking in bedrooms 4. Candles 5. Curious Children 6. Faulty wiring 7. Flammable liquids 8. Ignorance, carelessness, faulty handling, indifference and recklessness of people XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 8.indd 231 1/11/2020 3:03:19 PM8 | Disaster Management 232Effects of Fire Accidents \u00beDestroying houses, wildlife habitat and timber \u00bePolluting the air \u00bePermanently damages the human or animal's respiratory system and cause death Precautions \u00beKeep all fires and heaters well guarded. Especially open fires. \u00beKeep open fires away from furniture's and curtains \u00beDo n ot smoke in the bedroom \u00beNever leave a pan unattended when deep frying because many fire starts in the kitchen \u00beIf there are children around keep matches and lighters out of reach \u00beFit a pproved smoke detectors and smoke alarm on each floor \u00bePlan an escape route \u00beIf you suspect a gas leak, open the windows and turn off the supply During \u00beReact as soon as you hear the smoke alarm \u00beSafely exit through doors \u00beProtect yourself from smoke inhalation \u00beStop, drop and roll if your clothes catch fire \u00beCall for help \u00beUse fire extinguishers to control the fire \u00beDon't stay and search for pets and belongings \u00beNever use an elevator to exit a building during the fireAfter \u00beCool off as soon as possible with water for first and second degree burns \u00beDon't break the blisters. Don't try to remove the adhere clothes from the burnt area \u00beVisit the nearby hospital 8.2.5 Clouds of To xic Flames What to do before hand People in risk area should \u00beFind o ut the evacuation plans and facilities \u00beFamiliarize themselves with the alarm signals used in case of an emergency \u00beEquip doors and windows with the tightest possible fastenings \u00bePrepare family emergency kit During an Emergency \u00beDo not use the telephone, leave lines free for rescue services \u00beListen to the messages given by radio and other media \u00beCarry out the instructions transmitted by radio or loudspeaker \u00beClos e doors and windows \u00beStop up air intakes \u00beSeal any cracks or gaps around windows and doors with adhesive tape \u00beOrga nize a reserve of water \u00beTurn off conditioners XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 8.indd 232 PM8 Disaster Management 233After an Emergency \u00beComply with the authorities' instructions and do not let go out until there is no longer any risk \u00beCarry out necessary decontamination The Bhopal disaster also referred to as Bhopal gas tragedy was a gas leak incident on early morning of 2 nd December 1984 at the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) pesticide plant in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India. It was the world's worst industrial disaster. Deaths - 3,787 Non fatal injuries - 5,58,125 8.3 DISASTER NURSING It is the adaptation of professional nursing knowledge, skills and attitude in recognising and meeting the nursing and medical needs of disaster victims. 8.3.1 Basic Principles in Planning for Disaster Nursing N - Nursing plan should be integrated and coordinated U - Update physical and psychological preparedness R - Responsible for organising, teaching and supervision S - Stimulate community participation E - Exercise competence 8.3.2 START- Simple Triage Rabid treatment \u00beThose who are beyond help \u00beThe in jured who can be helped by \u00beThe injured whose transport can be \u00beThos e with injuries who ned helps less urgently 8.3.3 Epidemiologic Surveillance and disease control \u00beImpl em ent as soon as possible all public health measures \u00beOrga nise a reliable disease reporting system \u00beTo iden tify out breaks and promptly initiate control measures \u00beInvestigate all reports of disease outbreak rapidly Vaccination - Health authorities are often under considerable public and political pressure to begin mass vaccination program usually against typhoid, cholera and tetanus. Nutrition \u00beAssessing the food supplies after the disaster \u00beAssessing the nutritional needs of the affected population \u00beCalculating daily food rations and need for the larger population group \u00beMaintaining the nutritional status of the affected population Protection Measures \u00beWater supply, priority of ensuring water availability in emergency situation, chlorination it is the best way of disinfecting water. \u00beRestrict access to people and animal if possible erect fence and appoint a guard \u00beEnsure adequate excreta disposal at a safer distance from water source \u00beProhibit bathing, washing and animal XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 8.indd 233 1/11/2020 3:03:19 PM8 | Disaster Management 234Priority Colour of the tag Condition First (Immediate)RedLife threatened. have a high probability of survival Second (Intermediate)Ye l l owSeriously injured Can delay treatment and transport for 2 hours Third (waiting)GreenWalking wounded Can delay transport 3 hours Low priority Black Expectant, died victims, severely injured 100% husbandry up-stream of intake points in rivers and streams \u00beUpgrade wells to ensure that they are protected from contamination \u00beEstimate the maximum yield of wells and if necessary ration the water supply \u00beAll water tankers should be cleaned and disinfected before transporting water Basic Sanitation and personnel hygiene Many communicable diseases are spread through faecal contamination of drinking water and food. Hence every effort should be made to ensure the sanitary disposal of excreta. Emergency latrines should be made available to the displaced, where toilet facility have been destroyed, washing, cleaning and bathing facility should be provided to the displaced persons. Vector Control Vector borne diseases should be intensified in the emergency and rehabilitation period, especially in areas where such disease are known to be endemic. Special concerns are Dengue fever and Malaria, Leptospirosis and rat bite fever, typhoid and plaque. Flood water provides chance for breeding opportunities for mosquitos. 8.3.4 Role in disaster preparedness \u00beFacilitate preparedness \u00beInitiate and update disaster plan \u00beProvide educational programme in specific area \u00beOrga nize disaster drills (mass drills) \u00beProvide updated record \u00beEducate the vulnerable population \u00beNurse should seek safe environment \u00beAssess the environmental hazard \u00beUnderstand the community resources \u00bePhysical readiness \u00beProfessional readiness \u00beCommunity readiness. 8.4 CORE EMERGENCY PREP AREDNESS The term emergency refers to any extraordinary event or situation that requires XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 8.indd 234 1/11/2020 3:03:19 PM8 | Disaster Management 235an intense, rapid response and that can be addressed with existing community. Effective emergency response refers well-orchestrated team work in which each member knows what the lines of authority and communication are. Required Elimination 1. Includes preparedness and response plans for relevant emergencies and threats (Natural, mechanical, biological and human) 2. Addr ess the needs of visitors, structures and staff. 3. How to protect, evacuate and recover collection is the event of a disaster. 4. Assign individual responsibilities for implementation during the emergencies. 5. Include flood plan. 8.5 REHABILITATION Rehabilitation, reconstruction and sustainable recovery refer to measures that help restore the livelihood assets and production levels of emergency-affected communities. These measures rebuild essential infrastructure, institutions, services and restore the means of production destroyed or made non-operational by a disaster. Post disaster response has been typically at three (now four) levels. Relief : Immediately after the calamity, lasting from the first 24 hours to about two to three months and catering to immediate shelter, food, water and medical assistance. Reconstruction: Following relief and extending to a period of approximately two years, aimed at rebuilding the basic physical infrastructure and shelter to enable people to begin fresh start.Rehabilitation: That looks at more long-term inputs of reinstating lost livelihoods, introducing new economic opportunities and improving land and water management processes so as to reduce people's vulnerability and enhance capacities to handle future calamities. Readiness: A response which should ideally have been a proactive measure, it should enhance preparedness in identified vulnerable regions by introducing mechanisms and methods of construction that mitigate impacts of future disasters. Reconstruction and rehabilitation need to be in a seamless continuum with restoration efforts. 8.6 LEGAL IMP LICATION Ethical and Legal Aspects of Disaster Response. Incorporation of ethical principles and legal standards into all phases of the disaster cycle is fundamental to effective and fair disaster response, but the complex information landscape makes meeting this goal challenging 8.6.1 Acts and Laws The Disaster Management Act, 2005, was passed by the Rajya Sabha on 28 November, and by the Lok Sabha on 12 December 2005. It received the assent of The President of India on 9 January 2006. The Disaster Management Act, 2005 has 79 sections in set of 11 chapters. The Act extends to the whole of India. The Act provides for the effective management of disasters and for matters related with it. The act provides formation of the following to combat disaster: \u00beNational Disaster Management Authority XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit Disaster Management Disaster Management Authority \u00beDistrict Disaster Management Authority 8.6.2 National Policy on Disaster Management (NPDM), 2009 Came into force October 22, 2009. The policy aims to have a safe and disaster resilient India. It provides for developing a proactive, holistic, multi-disaster facet and technology driven strategy through a culture of \u00bePreparedness \u00bePrevention \u00beMitigation \u00beResponse As in National Policy on Disaster Management (NPDM), 2009, Central response follows two types of reliefs to Disaster Management. They are: The primary relief functions of the Central Government are concerned with: \u00beForecasting and operation of warning system \u00beMaintenance of uninterrupted communi - cation \u00bewide p ublicity to warnings of impending calamity, disaster preparedness and measures through TV , AIR and Newspapers \u00beTransport with particular reference to evacuation and movement of essential commodities and petroleum products etc. The secondary relief functions of the Central Government would relate to: \u00beflood inflow forecasts from the Central water Commission \u00beRelief, rehabilitation and restoration through military aid to civil authorities \u00beContingency plans for crops, cattle preservation nutrition and health measures \u00beTechnical and technological inputs for provision, drinking water etc. 8.6.3 Disaster Emergency Kit When a natural disaster occurs, we can't always rely on police or government to provide help. The grocery stores might be so badly damaged that you can't go into it. The supplies in the store might be quickly depleted or you may not be able to get to the store. The six basic supplies you need in a disaster kit are: \u00beWater, Food, First aid supplies \u00beClothing, bedding and sanitation supplies, tools and special items Water \u00beY ou should have a three-day supply of water on hand, or about one gallon per day per person \u00beIf your water is not already treated with chlorine, add some household bleach to the bottles. It should be stored in a cool, dark place for no longer than six months Food \u00bePut aside atleast three-days worth of food in your disaster kit that is non-perishable and don't need refrigeration \u00beAlso, choose foods that don't need heating. Avoid foods with a high salt content as they will make you thirsty \u00beFoods that are recommended are Candy, chocolate, tea, coffee, Sugar, salt, pepper, XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 8.indd 236 1/11/2020 3:03:19 PM8 | Disaster Management 237STUDENT'S ACTIVITY Match the following: A B 1.

There are various natural calamities like flood, earthquake, fire accident, cloud of toxic flames and Disaster Management can be defined as the organization and management of resources and responsibilities for dealing with all humanitarian aspects of emergencies, in particular preparedness, response and recovery in order to lessen the impact of disasters. Disaster nursing is the professional knowledge, skill and attitude in meeting the nursing medical needs of disaster victims. Epidemiological surveillance comprised vaccination of disaster victim, nutrition supplies after disaster, provide basic sanitation and vector control. Rehabilitation measures included relief, reconstruction, readiness after the disaster devastation. Disaster management ensure disaster prevention, risk and vulnerability reduction, as a means of reducing the impact of disasters on society.canned juice, milk, soup, canned fruits, meat, vegetables, Peanutbutter, jelly, food for babies and food for pets.

Science in general changed completely as far back as 1925 with Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Drug administration is the major responsibility of the nurses. To handle the drugs, nurses should have the basic knowledge of action, adverse effects, indication and contraindication of commonly used drugs and nursing responsibilities while administering the drug. 9.2 DEFINITIONS Pharmacology is the study of the interaction of chemicals with living systems. The term pharmacology is obtained from the Greek word \"pharmakon\" which means as drug and \"logos\" means the study of science. Drugs are chemicals that act on living systems at the chemical (molecular) level. The term drug is derived from the French word \"drogue\" which means \"dry herb\" . Medical pharmacology is the study of drugs used for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of disease. Toxicology is the study of the untoward effects of chemical agents on living systems. It is usually considered an area of pharmacology.Pharmacodynamic properties of a drug describe the action of the drug on the body, including receptor interactions, dose-response phenomena, and mechanisms of therapeutic and toxic action. Pharmacokinetic properties describe the action of the body on the drug, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Elimination of a drug may be achieved by metabolism or by excretion Drug Dose BASIC KNOWLEDGE REGARD ING DRUG The Nature of a Drug The drug molecule interacts as an agonist (activator) or antagonist (inhibitor) with a specific molecule in the biologic system that plays a regulatory role. This molecule is called a receptor. Drugs may be synthesized within the body like hormones or may be chemicals not synthesized in the body like xenobiotics. Poisons are also drugs that have exclusively harmful effects. Toxins are usually defined as poisons of biologic origin, i.e., synthesized by plants or animals. A drug is XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 9.indd 242 1/11/2020 4:11:43 PM9 | Administration of Medicine 243often administered at a location distant from its intended site of action. Therefore, a useful drug must have necessary properties to be transported from its site of administration to its site of action. The Physical Nature of a Drug Drugs may be solid at room temperature (e.g, aspirin, atropine), liquid (e.g, nicotine, ethanol), or gaseous (e.g, nitrous oxide). These factors often determine the best route of administration. Drug Size The molecular size of the drug varies from very small to larger one. If the molecular size of the drug is very small it easily diffuses the cellular compartments, in case of larger, the drug is administered directly into the vascular compartment by intravenous or intra-arterial infusion. Drug reactivity and Drug-receptor bonds Drugs interact with receptors by means of chemical forces or bonds. There are three major types like Covalent, Electrostatic, and Hydrophobic. Drug Shape The Shape of a drug molecule must be such as to permit binding to its receptor site via the bonds. 9.4 SOURCES OF DRUGS Drugs are obtained from various sources like plants, animals, microbial, mineral, synthetic and semi synthetic after repeated extraction and purification. Plant Sources Most of the drugs are obtained from the plant sources. E.g. Morphine extracted from the plant OPIUM through the principle of ALKALOID. Opium Alkaloid Extraction Animal Sources Microbial Semi Synthetic Source: Example: Atropine Animals Animal Part Drug Use Cow Pancreas Insulin Antidiabetic hormaone Fish Sperms Protamine Antidote of sulphate 243 1/11/2020 4:11:44 PM9 | Administration of Medicine 2449.5 PICTORIAL REPRESENTATIONS OF ABSORPTION OF DRUGS Stomach Neuron Neuro Heart Aorta Gl tractPortal veinHepa/g415c vein Capillary beds of body and Live r Splanchnic circula/g415on 1st Pa ss Hepa/g415c Metabolis Liver Syst emic Cir cula/g415on Most drugs are absorbed primarily in the small intestine. In general takes approximately 30 minutes for most medication to dissolve. Special coated medicine may take longer time for the therapeutic to reach the bloodstream.

They come in lots of different forms and we take them in many different ways. Y ou may take a drug yourself, or a healthcare provider may give it to you. Drugs can be dangerous, though, even when they're meant to improve our health. Taking them correctly and understanding the right way to administer them can reduce the risks. A dosage form of a drug is a product designed for administration to the body in the diagnosis or treatment of disease. The most important dosage forms of drug are as follows: XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 9.indd 245 1/11/2020 4:11:46 PM9 | Administration of Medicine 246 9.7 PRESCRIPTION OF MED ICATION The prescription is a written order by a physician to the pharmacist to prepare, dispense specific medication for a specific patient. A specific pattern should be followed in writing prescriptions in order to safe guard the patient. The following points should be remembered in writing a prescription. 1. The writing should be legible. The name of the drugs to be in capital letters 2. Indelible ink should be used for writing 3. Abbreviations should be avoided. 4. Generic names of the drug should be written below the brand names 5. In writing quantities, decimals should be avoided 6. Less than 1gm should be written as milligrams. Eg. 200mg and not 0.2g7. Blank spaces should be avoided between direction and the signature of the doctor. 9.7.1 Parts of a Prescription Date, address of the prescriber- preferably, the orders should be in the letter pad., name, age ,sex of the patient, IP or OP number, superscription(Rx) drug name and strength, directions to the patient and signature of the prescriber.

Pharmacokinetics - It describes the movement of the drug in our body, about its absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Pharmacodynamics - It describes about the mechanism of action of a drug at cellular, sub-cellular, and at molecular levels. The important principles of mechanism of action are stimulation, depression, replacement, irritation and cytotoxic action. 16 Vasodilators Drugs which dilate the blood vessels. E.g. nitroglycerine 17 Vasoconstrictors Drugs that cause constriction of blood vessels. E.g. amphetamines 18 Hypoglycemic Drugs that lower the blood glucose level. E.g. insulin 19 Mydriatics Drugs that dilate the pupils of the eyes. E.g. cyclogyl 20 Myotics Drugs that contract the pupils of the eye. E.g. pilocarpine STUDENT'S ACTIVITY: UNSCRAMBLE THE FOLLOWING LETTERS FOR A WORD Drugs prescribed for allergy - tina histamnei Drugs to treat hypertension - tina perhysivesten Drugs to combact infections - tina ticsiob Drugs as analgesics - sadins Drugs to relieve constipation - xalaivest Drugs for mentally ill clients - tina sypohctics Drugs to dissolve the clot - ticslyromboth 9.9.1 Adverse Drug Effects Side effects: They are the unwanted but often unavoidable consequences of administered drug. E.g., aspirin produces gastric ulcer. Toxic effects: They are due to over dosage or prolonged use. e.g., paracetamol causes hepatotoxicity.. Teratogenicity: It refers to the capacity of a drug to cause foetal abnormalities when administered to a pregnant mother. E.g., Tetracycline Idiosyncrasy: It is a genetically determined abnormal reaction to a drug in an unusual manner. E.g., barbiturates. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 9.indd 248 1/11/2020 4:11:46 PM9 | Administration of Medicine 249Drug dependence: Drugs capable of altering mood and feelings on repeated use of such drugs. E.g., morphine Iatrogenic disease: This a physician induced or drug induced disease. E.g., peptic ulcer by salicylates. Drug allergy: It is an immunologically mediated unpredictable reactions which are not related to the therapeutic effects. Carcinogenicity and Mutagenicity: It is the capacity of a drug to cause cancer. e.g., anabolic steroids. 9.10 STORING OF MEDICINE AND SAFE TY MEASURES 1. Most medications should be stored in a dry place away from heat and humidity. 2. If the medication needs to be protected from light, it should be stored in a container that keeps out light. 3. If the medication needs to be refrigerated, and you do not have a fridge available, use a cooler with an ice pack. 4. Keep track of the expiry dates of the medications by asking the pharmacy team to put this information on your medication vial. 5. Don't store multiple medications in the same vial, as this makes it hard to keep tracing of which medications are which, which doses have been taken, and what are the expiry dates. The important life saving drug also has its own side effects. Asp irin Side E Reye' s syndrome Idiosyncracy Noise (/g415nnitus)AspirinAspirinAspirin N RI I TAB. PARACETAMOL is dangerous to take more than eight 500 mg or six 650 mg tablets in 24 hours as you may damage your liver, which may be irreversible and fatal.6. Put all medicine up and away, out of children's reach and sight. 7. Clos e your medicine caps tightly after every use. 8. Choose child-resistant caps for medicine bottles. If pill boxes or non-child resistant caps are the only option, it's even more important to store these containers up high and out of sight when caring for kids. 9.10.1 How to administer medicine Safely 1. Use the dosing device that comes with the medicine. Proper dosing is important, particularly for young children. 2. Kitchen spoons aren't all the same, and a teaspoon or tablespoon used for cooking won't measure the same amount as the dosing device. 3. Keep all medicine in their original packages and containers. 4. Take the time to read the label and follow the directions. Even if you have used the medicine before, sometimes the directions change about how much medicine to give. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 9.indd 249 1/11/2020 4:11:47 PM9 | Administration of Medicine 2505. Even if your child seems really sick, don't give more medicine than the label says. It won't help your child feel better faster, and it may cause harm. 6. Read the label and know what's in the medicine. Check the active ingredients listed on the label. 7. Make sure you don't give your child more than one medicine with the same active ingredient, because it puts your child at risk for an overdose. 9.10.2 Get Rid of Medicine Safely 1. Clean out your medicine cabinet. Reduce the risk of kids getting into medicine by getting rid of unused or expired medicine. 2. Many communities have a medicine take- back program. This is an easy way to get rid of your unused or expired medicine. 3. To dispose of it yourself, pour the medicine into a sealable plastic bag. If the medicine is a pill, add water to dissolve it. Then add kitty litter, sawdust or coffee grounds to the plastic bag. 4. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says that the drugs which are so dangerous , should be flushed down the toilet. 9.11 ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION A route of administration is the path by which a drug, fluid, poison or other substance is brought into contact with the body. For instance, some drugs are destroyed by stomach acid if they are taken by mouth. So, they may have to be given by injection. The principle method of giving drugs is by mouth, and the doses which are not otherwise specified are assumed to be oral doses. The route used to give a drug depends on three main factors: \u00beThe p art of the body being treated \u00be The wa y the drug works within the body \u00beThe f ormula of the drug Guidelines for administering medication Full name, address, license number, phone number of prescribing physician Name of medication Date of order Strength and dosage of drug Frequency Indication Stop dates if applicable Physician signature Verbal orders should be written correctly in a separate Paper and signed.

The government of most of the countries have established the drug standards which are published in the pharmacopoeia. In our country, the ministry of health and family welfare of Indian government, published third edition by the year 2000. The drug and cosmetic act provides for the establishment of three control agencies to regulate, manufacture, sale, distribute, import and export of drugs. 9.13.2 National Patient Safety Goals These safety goals are based upon needs that are identified in the healthcare through research, patient reports, and clinician input. 1.

Drugs may be prescribed to promote healing, cure disease control or slow progression of disease, prevent disease, decrease risk of complications, increase comfort level, reduce excessive activity in the body. Therefore it's the duty of the nurses to flourish with adequate knowledge, skill and attitude among the health care professionals to make our profession in flying colours.

Therapeutic practice involves the oral communication of public health officials and nurses on the one hand and the patient or his relatives on the other. It is a two way process. Communication is a vital element in Nursing in all areas of activity and in all its interventions such as prevention, treatment, therapy, rehabilitation, education and health promotion. Communication leads to community, that is, to understanding, intimacy and mutual valuing. - Ro llo May 10.2 DEFINITION Communication can be defined as a transaction and message creation. The entire process occurs in a context consisting of physical space, cultural and social values and psychological conditions A process by which information is exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols, signs, or behaviour also exchange of informationCommunication is a skill that you can learn. It's like riding a bicycle or typing. It you're willing to work at it, you can rapidly improve the quality of every part of your life. - Bri an Tracy Communication is the art of being understood. - Peter Ustinov 10.3 COMMUNICATION PROCESS Communication is a process of exchanging information, ideas, thoughts, and emotions through speech, signals, writing, and behaviour. Let's put all these components together to build a model of the communication process: 1. A sen der encodes information 2. The s ender selects a channel of communication by which to send the message 3. The r eceiver receives the message 4. The r eceiver decodes the message 5. The r eceiver may provide feedback to the sender 10.3.1 Elements of Communication- \u0099Source Skills 26410.4 WHY COMMUNICATION IS IMPO RTANT IN NURSING Communication in nursing is essential in patient safety, health and well-being, because nurses are at the centre of patient care, it is their responsibility to facilitate dialog. As nurses assume more complex roles and care for all age group and different culture people, they will need to strengthen their communication skills. 1. Helps to understand and to exchange ideas to the patient, relatives, doctors and other health care team members. 2. Generate trust between nurse and patients. 3 . Reduces the interpersonal tensions and improves interpersonal relationship. 4 . Helps to modify the nurses behaviourTHE COMMUNICATION PROCESS Encoding Message Message Channel Decoding Message Receiver Sender Feedback Message Channel Noise 5 . Helps to influence others behaviour 6 . Prevent disorder in the ward 7. Provides effective leadership 10.4.1 The fo llowing are Simple Guidelines Nurses can follow to improve their Communications Skills. Be Flexible Every person has a preferred method of communicating, whether in-person, by phone or via the internet. Learn to Listen Speaking and writing are only part of communicating \u2014 listening is equally essential. With improper listening properly, they will miss important information of the patient. Listening errors are often the results of multitasking. Do not make Assumptions Assuming a patient knows what you mean can result in costly errors. Nurses can ask patients to repeat instructions, which can reveal any misunderstandings or gaps in information.When you can present your own ideas dearly, specifically, visually, and most important, contextually - in the context of a deep understanding of another's paradigms and concerns - you significantly increase the credibility of your ideas. - Stephen R.Covey XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 10.indd 264 1/11/2020 3:22:07 PM10 | Communication Skills 265Read Body Language Y our behaviour , attitude and posture can affect a patient's perception. Strengthen Writing Skills Communication includes writing as well as speaking. Depending on the role or speciality, you may be responsible for a lot of writing. 10.5 TYPES OF COMMUNICATION People communicate with each other in a number of ways that depend upon the message and its context in which it is being sent. Choice of communication channel and your style of communicating also effects communication. So, there are variety of types of communication. Types of communi cation Based on communi cation channels Non-Verbal Verbal faceFormal InformalBased on style and pu rpose 10.5.1 Verbal Communication Verbal communication refers to the the form of communication in which message is transmitted verbally; communication is done by word of mouth and a piece of writing. Usually people bring their own attitude, perception, emotions and thoughts about the topic and hence creates barrier in delivering the right meaning.Verbal Communication is further divided into 1. Oral Communication 2. Written Communication 1. Oral Communication In oral communication, colloquial words are used. It includes face-to-face conversations, speech, telephonic conversation, video, radio, television, voice over internet. In oral communication, communication is influenced by pitch, volume, speed and clarity of speaking . Oral Communication A professional is expected to be clean, neat, well groomed, professionally dressed, and odour free. Professional behaviour reflects warmth, friendliness, confidence and competence. Professional speak in a clear, well modulated voice, listen to others, help and support colleagues, and communicate effectively. Being on time, well organized, well prepared, and equipped for the responsibilities of the nursing role also communicate professionals. Also the common elements of professional communication is \"Courtesy, Use of names, Trustworthiness, Autonomy and responsibility, Assertiveness\" . 10.indd 265 1/11/2020 3:22:08 PM10 | Communication Skills 266Advantages of Oral communication It brings quick feedback. In a face- to-face conversation, by reading facial expression and body language one can know it is understand. Disadvantage of oral communication In face-to-face co mmunication, user is unable to deeply think about the message delivered. 2. Written Communication In written communication, written signs or symbols are used to communicate. A written message may be printed or hand written. In written communication message can be transmitted via email, letter, report, memo etc. Written Communication Advantages of written communication Messages can be edited and revised many times before it is actually sent. A written message enables receiver to fully understand it and send appropriate feedback. Disadvantages of written communication Unlike oral communication, written communication doesn't bring instant feedback. 10.5.2 Non-Verbal Communication Non-verbal communication is the sending or receiving of wordless messages. We can say that communication other than oral and written, such as appearance of the speaker, clothing, hairstyle, use of cosmetics Surrounding: gestures, body language, posture, tone of voice or facial expressions, is called nonverbal communication. Non-verbal communication is all about the body language of the speaker. 10.6 LEVELS OF COMMUNICATION 1. Intra-personal communication 2. Inter-personal communication 3. Public communication 4. Mass communication 5. Small Group communication Now, let us learn about the types of communication in detail. 1. Intra-personal Communication Intra-personal communication means communicating to myself, hearing myself talk, feeling about myself more and thinking are examples of intra-personal communication. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 10.indd 266 2672. Inter-personal Communication Inter-personal communication happens when you communicate directly with other people in a one to one or in a small group. The words 'inter' and personal suggest that 'Inter-personal' means communication between to different individuals. 3. Public Communication Public communication takes place in a situation where many people receive messages largely from one source. For example, it can be a movie, television show, a speech, advertisement, political lecture, committee report etc. 4. Mass Communication Mass communication is public communication transmitted through electronically or mechanical means. Books, magazines are all examples of mass communication. 5. Small Group Communication Communication is within formal or informal groups or teams. It is group interaction that results in decision making, problem solving and discussion within an organization. Do a role play in a group, discussing in handling person/patient of different language not known to the group.STUDENT'S ACTIVITY 10.7 BARRIERS OF COMMUNICATION Barriers to effective communication can retard or distort the message or intention of the message being conveyed. This may result in failure of the communication process or cause an effect that is undesirable. Types of Barriers \u0099 P hysical Barriers: Physical Barriers are often due to the nature of the environment like noise, invisibility, etc. \u0099 Org anisational Barriers: It refers to the problem with the structures or systems in XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 10.indd 267 1/11/2020 3:22:13 PM10 | Communication Skills 268the place in an organization. E.g., a lack of supervision or training or policy. Personal Barriers: It is due to psychological problems of individuals. E.g., lack of motivation or dissatisfaction in work. Ambiguity of words/Phrases: Words sounding the same but having different meaning can convey a different meaning altogether. Hence the communicator must ensure that the receiver receives the same meaning. Individual linguistic ability: The use of jargon, difficult or inappropriate words in communication can prevent the recipients from understanding the message. Physiological Barriers: These may result from individual's personal discomfort, caused by ill health, poor eyesight or hearing difficulties. Bypassing: This happens when the comm unicators (sender and the receiver) do not attach the same symbolic meanings to their words. Cultural Barriers: Strong beliefs, customs, attitudes, religious, sentiments, illiteracy may influence communication. Fear of being criticized: This is a major factor that prevents good communication. Gender Barriers: Most communicators show a difference in thought, often have a set of agenda. This is noticeable among the different genders. How to Overcome the Barriers of Communicationbarriers to effective communica tion gender physical organisational personal ambiguity of words or phrasesindividual linguistic abilityphysiologicalby being criticized | Communication Skills 269 Achieves shared understanding Stimulates others to take actions to achieve goals/ideas. Directs the flow of information to help people overcome barriers to open up in discussion. Channels information to encourage people/patient to think in new ways and to act more effectively. Skills for Effective Communication Express your feelings Present yourself well Give and receive compliments Learn to say \"no\" when it's necessary To solve problems effectively Effective communication is a key to getting along with others. 10.8.1 Methods of Effective Communication The important strategies to enhance the communication are described in the following sections. Sender Receiver MESSAGE FEEDBACKSR Clarify the idea - Th e communicator must b e clear about what he wants to communicate. Completeness of the message: The message should be relevant to the nature and purpose of communication. Understand the receiver: The communicator should be aware of the total physical and human setting. Use appropriate channels: The channels should be appropriate to the message. Consistency in communication: The message should be consistent with objective. Feedback: It involves effective participation and improves mutual understanding. Simplified structure: The co mmunication can be strengthened by simple procedure and regulating the information flow. Improve listening: The sender and receiver must listen with attention, patience and empathy. Mutual trust and confidence: It i mproves the effectiveness of communication. Identify your communication barrier and what effort you are going to take to overcome from your communication barriers.STUDENT'S ACTIVITY 10.8 EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION When the nurse communicates well, patient/other people will understand what the nurse is trying to convey and will accept it. Let's begin with a clear understanding of what communication is, effective communication XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 10.indd 269 1/11/2020 3:22:14 PM10 | Communication Skills 270Attention Skills The sender needs to pay attention to what he or she is trying to communicate, and choose the best words and body language to communicate with. The receiver needs to pay attention to what is being communicated by listening and watching. Attention is primarily governed by the type of attitude sender or receiver has towards each other during communication. Effective communication helps us to:Anticipate problems, decisions, co-ordinate, work flow, supervise others, develop relationship and promote products a services. Rapport Building Rapport building is important in both our professional and personal lives \u0099Use nonthreatening and 'safe topics' for initial small talk. \u0099Listen to what the other person is saying and look for shared experiences or circumstances this will give you more to talk about in the initial stages of communication. \u0099Try to inject an element of humour. \u0099Be co nscious of your body language and other nonverbal signals you are sending. \u0099Show some empathy. Empathy Skills Empathy skills are very important in good communication. Empathy is the ability to see the world as another person, and to share and understand another person's feeling, need, concern, and/or emotional state. 10.8.2 Guidelines for Effective Communication 1. Clarity of purpose \u0099In the first place we must make a careful analysis of what exactly we wish to communicate. \u0099But any effort made in this direction proves to be fruitful. \u0099As G eorge Berneard shaw says, \"The major mistake in communication is to believe that it happens. \" 2. Shared activity \u0099Let us forget that effective communication is the responsibility of all persons in the organisations. \u0099They may be at any level managerial or non- managerial. They are all working towards a common goal. 3. Common set of Symbols \u0099The encoding and decoding of the message should be done with symbols that are familiar to the sender and the receiver. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 10.indd 270 1/11/2020 3:22:14 PM10 | Communication Skills 271 \u0099It is an immutable condition of communication that the code or set of symbols be mutually understood. 4. Focus the needs of the receiver \u0099Whenever we communicate we must keep in min d the needs of the receivers and the message / information. \u0099It should be our endeavour to see that whatever we communicate should be of value to the receiver, both in the short run and in the distant future. \u0099Our a wareness of the needs of the receiver will make him more receptive. 5. Use Feedback \u0099Use Feedback, exhorts Stephen Robbins, a renowned authority on organisational behaviour. As the model of the communication process given in the preceding chapter shows, communication is complete only when the message is understood by the receiver. \u0099We c an never know whether communication / message is understood unless the sender gets feedback. \u0099Many communication problems arise because of misunderstandings and inaccuracies. 6. Active Listening \u0099Active or 'participative' listening is as important as any other element in the process of communication. \u0099It shows, again, that communication is a joint responsibility of both the sender and the receiver. 7. Controlling Emotions \u0099Emotions play an important role in interpersonal relationships between superiors, subordinates and colleagues in an organisation. \u0099It should therefore, be an important aim of communication to create an environment in which people are motivated to work toward the desired goals of the enterprise while they achieve their personal goals. 8. Politeness \u0099This leads us to the tone of voice aspect of communication. \u0099Everybody knows that politeness pays and it is reflected so very 'loudly' both in words and actions. 9. Eliminate noise \u0099Every possible effort must be made to eliminate the element of noise that distorts communication at the transmission stage. \u0099It becomes especially important in the wake of modern technological advancement. \u0099Anything going wrong with the equipment or any disturbance in the transmission line is bound to defeat the very purpose of communication. 10. Clarify Assumptions \u0099No effective communication can be based on assumptions. \u0099The sender of the message must first clarify his assumptions and then go ahead with proper encoding of the message. XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 10.indd 271 1/11/2020 3:22:14 PM10 | Communication Skills 27211. Avoiding Connotations and Ambiguities \u0099Semantic problems can be solved by using simple language and avoiding connotations. \u0099Care must be taken to see that the receiver of the message does not have to go beyond the text of the message. \u0099A sen der should, therefore use denotative words and expressions in preference to connotative ones. \u0099It is also necessary to avoid all ambiguity that means using words with double meaning. 12. Socio-psychological aspect As communication is a two-way process involving both the sender and the receiver, both should make conscious efforts to understand each other's cultural and socio-psychological background. \u0099As a golden rule for effective communication one must remember, \"First understand, then be understood. \" \u0099An eff ective communication is an informed communicator. 13. Completeness \u0099One must also endeavour to send a complete message, furnishing all necessary facts and figures. \u0099Incomplete communication annoys the receiver, as a result they do not get proper feedback. \u0099The m essage should be so organised that the receiver is not left in doubt about any aspect of the message. 14. Conciseness \u0099Completeness does not mean inclusion of unnecessary details or diversions. \u0099An eff ective communication is concise and crisp. \u0099The s ender should be clear headed and properly focused in her/his vision. 15. Proper use of body language \u0099Proper use of body language is of paramount important, especially in oral communication. \u0099No o ral communication can be successful or effective if we do not take care of our body language. \u0099In the first place there must be good eye contact with the person to whom we are communicating. \u0099The m ovement or our hands and feet must be graceful. \u0099Every listener observes carefully how we walk and how we talk. \u0099Our ga it says a lot about us. \u0099A war m handshake can do wonders. \u0099Holding our head straight on our shoulders shows confidence. When we use speech to communicate ideas and opinions as well as our emotions and innermost feelings, We communicate each of these by using a variety of elements, which includes: The t one o f voice The em phasis used in speech The co ntent of the speech The u se of figurative language The u se of humour in speech The p ace of delivery The p ronunciation used The p itch of our voice The u se of inferred s peech XII_Nursing_Vocational_Unit 10.indd 272 1/11/2020 3:22:14 PM10 | Communication Skills 27310.8.3 Some tips for Effective Communication 1. Learn to express yourself Help others to get to know you better, so they will know what to expect from you. They will also help you to get knowledge because they will give information about themselves. 2. Learn good listening skills Careful listening avoids misunderstanding. Give your undivided attention to the patient/speaker. If you need more information ask questions. Be informative by trying to say something positive even if you don't like it. 3. Learn to be assertive Express what you have to say with frankness without being aggressive. To be assertive means not to say 'Y es' when you want to say 'No' . CONCLUSION Communication is a powerful therapeutic tool and an essential nursing skill that influences others and achieves positive health outcomes. Communication is an exchange of a facts, ideas, views, opinions, emotions, informations etc. The basic elements of communication are the referent the sender,the message, the channels, the receiver, the feedback and the environment Nurses use interpersonal, intrapersonal, public and mass interaction to achieve positive change and health goals. Effective communication helps us to anticipate problems, decisions, co-ordinate workflow, develop relationship and promote services. Barriers of communication may result in failure of the communication process or cause an effect that is undesirable. Communication refers to verbal and non verbal behaviour within a social context. It includes all symbols and clues to give and receive meaning.

Guidance is providing some help or assistance to an individual by another expert individual. Guidance is designed to assist a person to decide where he wants to go, what he wants to do, or how he can best accomplish his purpose; it assists him to solve problems that arise in his life. It does not solve his problems, but empowers him to solve them. The focus of guidance is the individual, not the problem; its purpose is to promote the growth of the individual in self-direction. This guidance can be given to groups or to individuals, but it is always designed to help each individual even though they may be in a group. Examples Guidance Ramesh completes his grade XII successfully with 92 %. He needs assistance in moving in the right direction. He needs somebody to tell him what course he can study to have a bright future. Ramesh needs help and assistance.

(Gordon et al, 2008) 1. Guidance involves holistic development of the individual. It should be given in the context of total development of the personality. 2. Guidance recognizes individual differences. Each individual is different with specific needs, interests, and values. Students come from diverse cultural background. Therefore, it is necessary for teachers to be sensitive to these differences. 3. Dignity, respect and freedom should remain integral to the guidance process. Accept individuals with respect, dignity and freedom. 4. The g uidance should be a continuous process. Continued interactions are helpful. 5. Guidance uses good communication skills. Communication is an important skill needed in guidance. It includes both verbal and nonverbal communication. 6. Guidance is a team activity. Besides giving personal tutoring time, incorporating more people, expertise and multiple perspectives is highly effective. 7. Every contact is a precious opportunity for meaningful interaction. Every individual is unique and have their own different style of interaction. 8. The f requency and quality of interaction with the advisor is critical in helping students adjust to college life.9. Students are expected to map out a path for success. 10. The c ore task is working with students to plot a course of action for their educational success. 11.1.3 Roles of the Advisor in Guidance Roles of the Adviso r Teache r Mentor Exemplar ManagerCounsellor 11.2 COUNSELLING Counselling is as old as society.

According to Carl Rogers, Counselling is a series of direct contact with the individual which aims to offer him assistance in changing the attitudes and behavior. Counselling involves two individuals one seeking help and other a professionally trained person helped solved problems to orient and direct him to words a goals. Define Counselling Counselling is a personal and dynamic relationship between two individuals-an older, more experienced and wiser (counselor) and a younger, less wise (counselee). The latter has a problem for which he seeks the help of the former. They two work together so that the problem may be more clearly defined and the counselee may be helped to a self-determined solution. (Wren) Counselling is an accepting, trusting and safe relationship in which clients learn to discuss openly what worries and upsets they have, to define precise behaviour goals, to acquire the essential social skills and to develop the courage and self confidence to implement desired new behavior. (Merle M. Ohlsen) Enumerate the Objectives of Counselling 1. Achievement of positive mental health. 2. Resolutions of problems. 3. Improving personal effectiveness.4. Maximizing change of behavior. 5. Decision making as a goal of nursing. 6. Modification of behavior as a goal.

Cotton or gauze pieces are used to clean the wound. The dressing of the wound with dressing materials is called wound dressing. Types of dressing: Dressings may vary by type of material and mode of application. They should be easy to apply comfortably and made up of materials that promote wound healing. \u0099Gauze dressing: are the commonest. Gauze is available in different textures and shapes e.g. square, rectangle and rolls of various lengths \u0099Non antiseptic dressings: are sterile unmedicated dressings applied to a fresh wound to protect it from infection \u0099Antiseptic dressings: are impregnated with some medication and is applied to wounds already infected to limit the septic process \u0099Wet dressings: are used in infected wounds to soften the discharge, promote drainage and also in wounds that require debridement. It is also used to supply heat to the tissues. Moist heat is more penetrating then dry heat. Therefore moist heat is more beneficial in localizing the infection in an area. For applying wet dressing the contact dressing layer is moistened to increase the gauze ability to collect exudates and wound debris and then apply a dry second layer XII_Nursing_Vocational_Practical.indd 309 1/11/2020 4:29:41 PM5 | Minor Wound Dressing 310of absorbent dressing. This method of application will effectively clean the infected and necrotic wounds \u0099Pressure dressings: When there is danger of bleeding or when there is oozing from the wound, a pressure dressing may be applied. It is a thick sterile pad made up of gauze or gauze cellulose applied with a firm bandage, Elasto plasts or binder can be used \u0099Non-adherent gauze dressing: Such as TELFA are used to cover clean wounds. Telfa gauze has a shiny, non adherent surface that does not stick on incisions or wound opening but allows drainage to pass through the softened gauze above \u0099Self adhesive transparent film: It acts as a temporary second skin. It is ideal for small superficial wounds which do not require debridement Purposes: 1. Protect the wounds from contamination with micro-organism 2. Promote healing by absorbing drainage and debriding a wound 3. Support the wound site as a splint 4. Prevents the client from visualizing the wound 5. Promotes thermal insulation to the wound surface 6. Maintenances of high humidity between the wound and dressing 7.

To maintain good health ingesting a diet containing the essential nutrients in correct amount is very important. Balanced diet is one, which contains the different types of foods in such quantities and proportion so that the need for calories, proteins, minerals, vitamins and other nutrients are adequately met in small proportion is made for extra nutrients to withstand duration of illness. Factors: 1. Age 2. Sex 3. Physical work 4. Physiological stress 5. Pregnancy 6. Lactation Five groups: \u0099Cereals, grains & products \u0099Pulses and legumes and milk products \u0099Fruits and vegetables \u0099Fats and sugarPoints to keep in the mind while planning menu: 1. Energy derived from cereals should not be more than 75% 2. Whole grain cereals, parboiled grains or malted grains give higher nutritive value. 3. It is better to include 2 cereals like rice and wheat 4. Flour s hould not be sieved for chapatti as it will reduce bran content 5. One s erving of cereal is 25g. A day's menu may require 2-4 servings 6. Minim um ratio of cereals, proteins should be 4% in terms of the grains it will be 8 parts of cereals and one part of pulses 7. One s erving of pulse is 25g. 2 to 3 servings should be taken 8. One serving of vegetables is 75g Green leafy vegetables can be taken more than one serving, if fruit is not included in the diet XII_Nursing_Vocational_Practical.indd 314 1/11/2020 4:29:43 PM7 | Nutrition - Therapeutic Diet 3159. It is better to serve the fruit raw without much cooking or taking juice out of it. Everyday diet should contain at least one medium size fruit 10. Ther e should be a minimum of milk 100ml/ day, one to 2 glasses of milk or curd should be included in balanced diet 11. Ener gy derived from oils or fats is 15-20% of total calories and 5% from sugar and jaggery 12. One eg g weighs around 40g of protein. This can be served along with cereal or pulses to improve the quality of protein. Instead of one serving of poultry/fish, one egg can also be included in the diet 13. Inclusion of salads not only help in meeting the vitamin requirements but the meals would be attractive and have high satiety value, due to the fiber content 14. Fried foods cannot be planned if oil allowance is less or in low caloric diets 15. One t hird of nutritional requirement atleast calories, protein should be met by lunch and dinner 16. If possible meals should be planned for seven days 17. Usually the number of meals would be four and for every young children and sick persons, the number of meals can be more 18. Ideally each meal should consist of all the 5 food groups 19. For quick calculations average value of calories and proteins from the same group can be takenPrinciples of planning a meal: \u0099Meeting nutritional requirement: A good menu is one which will not only provide adequate calories, fat and protein but also minerals, vitamins essential for the physical wellbeing of each member of a family \u0099Meal pattern must fulfill family needs: A family meal should cater to the needs of the different members \u0099Meal planning should save time and energy: Planning of meals should be done in such a way, that the recipes should be simple nutrition. By using pressure cooker, time and energy can be saved \u0099Economic consideration: Any meals that do not satisfy the budget of the family, cannot be put into practice. The cost may be reduced by using the 1. Seasonal foods 2. Bulk purchasing 3. Substituting greens for fruits 4. Combinations of foods \u0099Meal plan should give maximum nutrients: Loss of nutrients delivering, procuring, cooking should be minimized. Sprouted grains, malted cereals, fermented foods enhanced nutritive value \u0099Consideration for individual likes and dislikes: Meal should be planned according to the individual preferences likes vegetarian XII_Nursing_Vocational_Practical.indd 315 1/11/2020 4:29:43 PM7 | Nutrition - Therapeutic Diet 316or non-vegetarian. If a person does not like particular greens, it can be tried in a different form or substituted by equally nourishing food \u0099Planned meals should provide variety: If the meals are monotonous it is not consumed. Variety can be introduced in colour, texture and taste \u0099Meals should give satiety: Each meal should have some amount of fat, protein and fiber to get satiety. Meals should be planned in such a way that intervals between the meals is also consideredThe word 'nutrition' comes from the word 'nourish' and it includes all the ways in which the foodstuffs we eat are absorbed by the body for the growth and development, energy and good health. When a person does not eat the right nutrients in right quantity he or she is malnourished and we call this condition as malnutritions. Here is comparison of the effects on the people of good nutrition and malnutrition. Good nutrition Malnutrition 1. Correct weight for height and age 2. Strong muscles and straight limbs 3. Smooth, clear skin and mucous membranes 4. Healthy, bright eyes, clear sight 5. Hearing well 6. Breathing unobstructed 7. Teeth well formed and free from dental caries 8.

Abnormal gait, twisted spine, protruding abdomen 10. Nervous, anxious, irritable, slow to learn 11. Tired and restlessness 12. Poor resistance to infections Meal planning \u0099Meal planning can be defined as taking the time to plan nutritious meals for a specified time. To plan therapeutic meals, the groups and classes of foods must be put into consideration \u0099Meal planning is also the implementation of the principle of nutrition in one day diet in an appetizing manner XII_Nursing_Vocational_Practical.indd 316 1/11/2020 4:29:44 PM7 | Nutrition - Therapeutic Diet 317TIME FOOD ITEMS QUANTITY 6 am Milk or coffee or tea without sugar 50 ml 8 am Idli/idiyappam or Dosai/chappathi orWheat Bread or Uppuma/pongal 11 am Butter milk/vegetable soup/lime juice (or) Fruit (small) (or) Veg salad 200 ml (1 cup)\u00bd plate Lunch Rice Chappathi DhalRasam with vegetable a group Butter milk1cup21 cup2 cups\u00bd cup 4 pm Tea (or) coffee Fruit 100 ml \u00bc cup2 No2 slices(Small) -1 Dinner Lunch menu or breakfast menu Before bed Milk 100 ml Oil for 1 day Sunola/Suffola/Gingelly oil/refined oil 10-15 g (21/2 - 3 tsp) Non vegetarianEgg 1 or 2 (white)Chicken/fish/mutton50 g (without fat) Vegetable \u0099Group A: Vegetables - Beet root, drumstick leaves, beans, turnip, mango ginger, onion (small) Raddish (red) beans lady's finger etc. Fruits (1 day) \u0099Pooran banana - \u00bd small \u0099Oran ge / apple / guava - 1 small \u0099Grape - 10 -20 nos \u0099Lem on /sweet orange - 1-2 No \u0099Pappaya - 4.5 small pieces XII_Nursing_Vocational_Practical.indd 317 1/11/2020 4:29:44 PM7 | Nutrition - Therapeutic Diet 318Foods to be excluded from diet: \u0099Sugar, honey, jaggery, sweet syrup and fried foods \u0099All roots \u0099Cool drinks \u0099Horlicks, Bournvita etc \u0099Coconut, coconut oil, palm oil \u0099Ground nut and all nuts \u0099Tinn ed food \u0099Alcohol \u0099Butter, ghee, cheese Snacks to be eaten in between meals: \u0099Butter milk \u0099Vegetable soup \u0099Vegetable salad \u0099Lime/tomato juice without sugar Hypertension: (High blood pressure) This is a common condition in middle age.
