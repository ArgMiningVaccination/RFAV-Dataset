Three of the four major projects funded under t he GI SPORE focus on pancreatic cancer. Diane Simeone , MD, recipient of the 2010 The Randy Pausch Family - Pancreatic Cancer Action Network - AACR In novative Grant, is a co-Principal Investigator on t he SPORE. Congratulations, Dr. Simeone, and Go Blue! (Michigan is my graduate school alma mater.) Repression of the miR-143/145 cluster by Ras initia tes a tumor-promoting feed-forward pathway Johns includes video: http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/ missing_molecules_hold_promise_of_therapy_ for_pancreatic_cancer An all-star team of Johns Hopkins researchers deter mined that the microRNA cluster miR-143/145 is repressed in response to oncogenic KRAS activation. Down-regulation of miR-143/145 by element-binding protein (RREB1); both KRAS and RREB1 are themselves targets of repression by miR-143/145. Data suggest ed that restoration of miR143/145 could abrogate tumorigenesis in a mouse xenograft model. Characterization of alternative spliceoforms and th e RNA splicing machinery in pancreatic cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21178653 A team of researchers, including Teri Brentnall, MD (Scientific Advisory Board), sought to evaluate th e extent, pattern, and roles of alternative splicing in pancreatic cancer. Spliceoform-specific microar ray and PCR analyses of near-normal pancreatic cells an d two pancreatic cancer cell lines revealed that pancreatic cancer cells displayed fewer examples of alternatively spliced genes than normal cells. Th ese results were validated in primary pancreatic cancer specimens. Role for NQO1 and MnSOD inhi bition in pancreatic cancer cells Researchers at University of Colorado - Denver expl ored the role of the protein NQO1 in the metabolism and intercellular concentration of the H sp90 inhibitor 17AAG. In the presence of NQO1, 17AAG is converted to 17AAGH2, a more potent Hsp90 inhibitor. Additionally, levels of both 17AAG and 17AAGH2 are higher in pancreatic cancer cells when NQO1 is present. Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 1500 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 200 | Manhattan Bea ch, CA 90266 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan. org CpG hypermethylation-associated silencing of non-coding RNAs in human cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20802525 This study published in Oncogene represents collaboration among researchers in Barce lona, Spain, Ohio State University, and MD Anderson (including 2009 S eena Magowitz - Pancreatic Cancer Action Network - AACR Pilot Grant awardee, George Calin, MD, PhD). The authors focused on transcribed ultra- conserved regions (T-UCRs) and analyzed their epige netic regulation (specifically methylation). The study concludes that genetic changes leading to cel l transformation include both genetic and epigeneti c changes to both coding and non-coding RNA. Identification HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitopes ov er-expressed in pancreatic cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21179034 This study aimed to identify a novel tumor-associat ed antigen (TAA) of pancreatic cancer, for T lymph to be over-expressed in pancreatic cancer. The aut hors conclude that KIF20A is a novel promising candidate for anticancer immunotherapeutic target f or pancreatic cancers.

ETIOLOGY Prevalence of CDKN2A mutations in pancreatic cancer patients: implications for genetic counseling http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21150883 Dr. Gloria Petersen and colleagues at the Mayo Clin ic explored the prevalence of CDKN2A mutations among 1,537 pancreatic cancer patients. Mutations were detected in nine cases (0.6%), and mutation carriers were more likely to have a family history of pancreatic cancer or melanoma, compared to those who had wild-type CDKN2A. The risk of pancreatic c ancer among carriers of CDKN2A mutations was higher for smokers than nonsmokers, suggesting that individuals with CDKN2A mutations should be counseled to avoid smoking. The complexities of obesity, diabetes, and the deve lopment and progression of pancreatic cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21129444 This review article by scientists at the Karmanos C ancer Institute in Detroit addresses the interconnectedness between obesity, diabetes, and r isk of pancreatic cancer. Specifically, the author s discuss usage of diabetes medications as preventive or treatments for pancreatic cancer, as well as th e possible roles of microRNAs in the pathogenesis of obesity, diabetes, and pancreatic cancer. Salt, processed meat and the risk of cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21160428 Canadian and Italian researchers conducted a survey of nearly 20,000 cancer patients and about 5,000 normal controls, inquiring about food habits. Thei r results suggested that salt consumption was associated with increased risk of certain cancers, and eating processed meats was also significantly associated with increased risk of several cancer ty pes, including pancreatic. Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 1500 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 200 | Manhattan Bea ch, CA 90266 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan. org PALB2 germline mutations in familial breast cancer cases with history of pancreatic cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21184274 The authors were unable to show that PALB2 mutation s were preferentially associated with breast cancer families with cases of pancreatic cancer. H owever, this study was limited by small sample size s. The authors conclude that screening for PALB2 mutat ions may be warranted in individuals or families affected by both breast and pancreatic cancer. PREVENTION Resveratrol suppresses pancreatic cancer by A hydrolase http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20952510 Resveratrol is a polyphenol found in red wine, and thought to be involved in cancer prevention and hav e other health-promoting benefits. Here, authors at the University of Minnesota determine that resveratrol's effects are mediated by leukotriene A 4 hydrolase to suppress anchorage-independent growth of pancreatic cancer cells, as well as delay or suppress pancreatic tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Effect of daily aspirin on long-term risk of death due to cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21144578 Published in The Lancet , this report analyzes individual data from randomi zed clinical trials, exploring the relationship between daily aspirin and risk of cancer. Data suggest that daily aspirin reduces th e risk of developing and dying from multiple types of canc er, including pancreatic. EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND PROGNOSIS Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer: what have we learned and where do we go from here? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21136179 Medical Advisory Board member Jason Fleming, MD and colleagues at MD Anderson prepared this editorial to discuss pancreatic cancer cases that a re deemed borderline resectable. The editorial str ives to define this categorization of tumors, recommend surgical and other treatment protocols, and discusses the potential of a multi-institutional tr ial to standardize this particular diagnosis. CA 19-9 level as indicator of early distant metasta sis and therapeutic selection http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21129857 CA19-9 levels may be a useful predictor of whether patients will experience distant metastases within six months of diagnosis. Knowledge of this probabi lity can inform the decision on whether to attempt surgery on certain pancreatic cancer patients.

Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 1500 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 200 | Manhattan Bea ch, CA 90266 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan. org 3D collagen I gemcitabine resistance throu gh MT1-MMP-mediated expression of HMGA2 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21148071 Researchers at Northwestern University, including P aul Grippo, PhD (2007 Nancy Daly Riordan - Pancreatic Cancer Action Network - AACR Career Deve lopment Award), explore the role of the dense fibrotic reaction in chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer. They show that membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) over-expression in the collagen microenvironment contributes to gemcitabine resistance in vitro and in a mouse pancreatic cancer xenograft model. Tolerability and pharmacokinetics of adjuvant erlot inib and capecitabine with concurrent radiation http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21151476 Joe Herman, MD (2008 Blum-Kovler - Pancreatic Cance r Action Network - AACR Career Development Award) and colleagues at Johns Hopkins conducted a prospective trial to determine a safety profile an d recommended phase 2 dosage of erlotinib and capecit abine administered concurrently resected panc reatic cancer patients. Personalizing cancer treatment in the age of global genomic analyses http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21135251 Prominent pancreatic cancer researchers at Johns Ho pkins report on PALB2 gene mutations and the response to DNA damaging agents in pancreatic cance r. A personalized xenograft model was established from a patient's tumor sample with gemc itabine-resistant, advanced pancreatic cancer. Data from the mouse xenograft suggested responsiven ess to mitomycin C, which then led to a long- lasting (36+ months) response in the patient. Sequ encing revealed that the patient's tumor carried a PALB2 mutation, perhaps suggesting a predictor for response to DNA damaging agents. Network and systems biology approaches aid in the d iscovery of potent anticancer drug combinations http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21041384 This review article out of the Karmanos Cancer Inst itute in Detroit explores network and systems biolo gy approaches to aid in selection of targeted therapeu tics. In the last few years, novel and high throug hput data acquisition technologies coupled with integrat ed network modeling and systems biology have emerged as key components of targeted-therapy resea rch. The authors highlight an example of combining oxaliplatin and MDM2 inhibitor MI-219 in pancreatic of principle. TRAIL-induced apoptosis is preferentially mediated via TRAIL receptor 1, enhanced by XIAP inhibitors http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20940278 Pancreatic cancer cell lines, primary specimens, an d a xenotransplant model in mice were analyzed for expression of TRAIL receptors 1 and 2 and response to inhibition of each. These authors' studies showed that pancreatic cancer samples were more sus ceptible to inhibition of TRAIL-R1 (via mapatumumab) than inhibitors of TRAIL-R2 (via lexat umumab). Further, the activity of mapatumumab was significantly enhanced in the presence of XIAP inhibitors, observed both in vitro and in vivo . Noninvasive radiofrequency field destruction with t argeted gold nanoparticles http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21138869 Glazer, et al describe a xenograft model of mice injected with ei ther Panc-1 or Capan-1 pancreatic cancer cell lines, and targeted gold n anoparticles (AuNP) and nonionizing radiofrequency Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 1500 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 200 | Manhattan Bea ch, CA 90266 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan. org The mice had AuNP targeted via cetuximab and the Capan-1 mice were targeted with PAM4 antibody. Results suggested that the hea t generated by AuNP and RF induced apoptosis specifically in the pancreatic tumor cells, and not in normal cells throughout the mouse's body. Agents targeting the Hedgehog pathway for pancreati c cancer treatment http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21154121 This review provides a concise overview of translat ional studies assessing the use of Hedgehog inhibit ors as novel therapeutic strategy for cancer, particula rly pancreatic cancer. Hedgehog signalling and therapeutics in pancreatic cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21186299 This is also a review of hedgehog signaling in panc reatic cancer, conducted utilizing PubMed (2000-201 0) and other literature-based references. A CALGB phase II study of patie nts with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21148613 Eileen O'Reilly, MD (Medical Advisory Board) and co lleagues at Memorial Sloane-Kettering describe a Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) phase II study of sunitinib in previously gemcitabine-treated patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Although the study met its endpoint, sunitinib displayed minimal activity and marginal toxicity. For future studies, it's recommended to enroll pati ents with ECOG performance scores of 0-1. SUTENT\u00ae SUTENT \u00ae approved for pancreatic neur oendocrine tumors in Europe. A phase III trial demonstrated that patients treated with SUTENT show ed double time-to-progression and overall survival, compared to placebo. SUTENT is an oral m ulti-kinase inhibitor. Phase II study nimotuzumab, t epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), was tested in patients with locally advanced or metasta tic pancreatic cancer. The compound proved safe and well-tolerated, and the investigators are there fore initiating a randomized, placebo-controlled tr ial combining nimotuzumab with gemcitabine to improve e fficacy. A phase I/II study of Src inhibitor saracatinib (AZD0530) in combination with gemcitabine http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21170669 This Canadian study aimed to define the recommended phase II dose saracatinib when combined with gemcitabine, and assess the efficacy of this combin ation in advanced, previously untreated, pancreatic cancer patients. Objective criteria for continuing were not met and the trial was closed. Saracatini b in combination with gemcitabine is well tolerated, but the combination did not improve efficacy over gemcitabine alone. Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 1500 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 200 | Manhattan Bea ch, CA 90266 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan. org trial Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) peptide vaccin e and gemcitabine combination therapy http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21150717 An open-labeled, dose-escalation phase 1 trial of W ilms tumor 1 (WT1) vaccine and gemcitabine (GEM) combination therapy for patients with advanced panc reatic cancer or biliary tract cancer was performed. Although objective clinical efficacy wa s not apparent, the safety of WT1 vaccine and GEM combination therapy was confirmed in this study. Novel postoperative adjuvant strategy prevents earl y hepatic recurrence after resection of PC http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21165654 The authors evaluated the efficacy of postoperative combination therapy of high-dose 5-fluorouracil (5 - FU) arterial infusion with systemic gemcitabine. T his novel adjuvant strategy had a significant benef icial effect on early hepatic recurrence, and may have th e potential to prolong the overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Drug cocktails for cancer get streamlined U.S. revi ew http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-14/drug-cockt ails-for-cancer-heart-disease-get- streamlined-review.html Drug cocktails for cancer, heart disease and other conditions may reach the U.S. market sooner under new guidelines that let companies seek approval for a combination of two or more medicines at the same time. The path will be reserved for serious i llnesses where a combination therapy is needed to overcome resistance or weak response to only one me dicine, per draft guidelines released by the FDA. Previously, the merit of each compound had to be fi rst proven on its own. SURVIVORSHIP Explaining marginal benefits to patients, when \"mar ginal\" means additional but not necessarily small http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21169251 This Clinical Cancer Research article discusses patient/physician communications surrounding prognosis and treatment options. The authors use the adminis tration of gemcitabine and erlotinib to pancreatic cancer patients as an example. Patients should be presented with honest, realistic, and caring descriptions of the pros and cons of every treatmen t option. The attitudes of 1066 patients with cancer towards participation in randomised clinical trials http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21119659 This article in British Journal of Cancer explores barriers to recruiting patients in random ized clinical trials. Clearly communicating with and informing p atients are necessary to achieve improved participation in clinical trials. "}
