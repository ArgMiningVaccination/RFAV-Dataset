DESCRIPTION Preserved intheBodleian Library, Oxford, the original manuscript is written inthe Gupta-script on the birch-bark inthefashion oftraditio- nal Indian \"Pothi\" (loose leaves) comprising fiftyone existing leaves* with broken and lost texts. Itis enclosed between two wooden- boards and astring runs through them. The whole manuscript ofsmaller portion i.e. Part VImeasure about 9\"X2\"3. 1.4. TH'E The author foremost- plates. Plate XXI bears two leaves 16&17ofPart II. Thus one leaf added tofifty four makes the total number offascimile appropriate tocall thework bythis name foritssweet and soft style and for quotations ofthe best-known remedies. The same analogy of appropriateness equally applies tothe alternative name 'Siddha-Sarnkarsa' i.e.collection ofproven remedies, for the work contains the foremost- formulae of the ancient medical authorities, indicating their useful- ness that was experienced inthe society ofthe far off days ofthe great antiquity. 1.5. THE AUTHOR Although thename and identity ofthe author ofNev eniteks isnot known, yet itissurmised that his name should be 'Navanita'. The reason behind this isthat the author constructs the name Nfl.vanitakam' for his work comprising ofsixteen chapters only; i.e.themost oftheauthor LAYOUT Bower manuscript isacollec- tive manuscript ofseven and it5 can bedivided into three books; Part I-III. which deals with medicine, Part IVand Vdealing with divination (forecast) by means ofdice (i.e. PfJ.sakakevali); and Parts VIand VII, containing protective charms (incan- tations) WRITING OF THE MANUSCRIPT 2.1. FROM ACOPY OFTHE AUTOGRAPH The Bower manuscript, isnotthe ofthesources ofNev leads ustoone conclusion that there must have been adefective original, other than theau- thor's autograph, before asubsequent copyist ofthe manuscript; due to which dots and theblundered phrases 6 were transferred, initsbody. This fact suggests that the autograph isof earlier antiquity. There must have been some interval between the wri- ting ofthe autogragh and the copy- ing ofthe existing manuscript, says Hoernle; which remark refers only to itsintermediate copy. 2.3. PENCRAFT OFFOUR SCRIBES According toHoernle, the inter- val between the writing ofthe auto- graph and the copying ofthe manus- cript should not have been the Bower manuscript isthe pencraft scribes who Part IV;Part V&VII and Part VIin distinguishable characters. They all are almost comtemporary scribes. The scribe who wrote the second portion, i.e. Part IVcommenced his writing onthe verso ofthe last leaf ofthe first portion (Part I-III), while the scribe who wrote the third portion i.e. Part V&VII appended aremark oneither ofthe two other portions. This proves that the first portion is earlier incopying date than the Part IVand also that, tothe writer of Parts V&VII, both Part VIand Parts I-III were available. As tothe fourth portion (Part VI), itiswritten for the benefit of the monk \"Yasornitra\" asthe dedi- catee ofPart VII. Differing ofletter \"ya\" indicatesBulletin Ind.Inst.Hist.Med.Vol.XVIII that the newly evolved form was just taking roots for establishing itself. This transitionary period can behardly aquarter ofacentury i.e. one gene- ration. From these the copying ofthe origin and spread ofthis letter in time ofcopying of the and itispossible that itshould besought nearer the beginning rather than the end ofthat period. Thus Hoernle supplies usthe lower limit ofthe date ofthe Niivenitek\u00bb,which inview of the necessary interval between wri- ting ofthe intermediate copy and of the manuscript may beplaced inthe beginning ofthe fourth century or about 300 AD. 3.1.

DATE OFTHEN:\\'VANITAKA 6.1. MATERIAL VIEW 6.1.1. SOURCES VIEW From thefacts setautinthefore- going paragraphs, itisclear that in making hiscompilation the author of Navanitaka, utilised anumber of standard sources ofthe approximate time of writing the Nsvenitek larbyhis work, although works of Atreya and his pupils were present before him. Thus, itfollows that the author ofthe Nsveniteke utilised the thecommentary ofDalhana name ofNagar june, has been identified as the redactor of Susrute Sar(lhita 51 Utters- 'Later Treatise'. provisionally becalledSusruta theYounger',52 6.1.4. CONTENTS VIEW- INDIRECT REFERENCE tosixformulae quoted from Susrute Ssmhite inthe Navanitaka53 differs from the Susrute's text insuch a manner astoshow that Additional evidences inNavani- taka areasfollows: 1. The 'Asvin-rasayana' formula5\u00a3l onAgni- vesetentre embodying teachings ofAtreya, even belong mythical and pre- historical personages. None of these formulae, with one excep- tion can and without naming its authors.\"? 6.21.

UPPER LIMIT Thus, tofixthe upper limit for writing the Navanitaka, the date of (a) Ka\";iraja-Divod5.sa and Su-rutaBulletin &.Jiva- ka83 Khilasthana XVII &XVIII) Century B.C. 6.2.5. LOWER LIMIT Turning tothe lower limit, so much iscertain from preceding pas- sages, that the date ofwriting the existing manuscript from the inter- mediate copy ofthe autograph of Navanitaka may limit. AStudy ofNa:;anitaka-Pandev &Pandey Then, date ofNavanitaka isapparently linked with ofCaraka as both arecontemporary veiw ofthe French Scientist M.Sylvan Levi who discovered from the Chinese Tripi- (aka, the name ofCaraka asphysi- cian, who was attached tothe court of the celebrated Buddhist King Kanisk a.s\"theruler ofGreater India, including Central Asia; his reign being with names like Naqarjuna. Asvaqhosa and Vasurnitra. Nagarjuna isthe famous expert in mercurial science while the latter couple mentioned tohave presided over the conference ofthe 'Maha- yana' (Great vehicle) philosophy of Buddhists.s\" is amatter ofcontroversy. But accor- ding toHoernle, the most probable theory places him inthe middle of thefirst century BC.asthe founder of the well known SaI11Vat- Era.90 Thus, the second Century A.D.may provisionally betaken asthe time of compilation ofthe Nii'/anil3ka taking the above date for Kaniska asthe upper limit and allowing the neces-15 sary interval for the growth ofthe Setahittis into standard authorities.v' But this view ofHoernla's is contested asthere are many adverse factors which confirm that Caraka could not have been contemporary to Kani-ka. Had hebeen so,how could hepreserve the Vedic nature ofhis it free from the prevalent Buddhistic stylistics, being acourt physician of azealous Buddhistic doc- like K,:anik.1-vijiiana-vada92 and tothat period ofIndian History when Buddhism was onthe wane and the Vedic tradition was reviving. This period may beseen as awatershed ofthe decline and the fallof'Maurvan' empire B.C. 6.2.8. LINGUISTIC EVIDENCE The above mentioned date has been determined from the 'Source point ofview'. The same can be confirmed from the Linguistic evi- dence, too. 16 The ungrammatical Sanskrit, or what has been called 'Prakrta' isa mixture ofliterary and colloquial Sanskrit and this layelement Yasomitra) 103 etc. Thus, occasional lapses ofrules ofSanskrit, indicate the usage of Prakrta, the language oflaity. This was adopted bythe Buddhist writers toattract themasses. However, this usage lowered the prestige ofthese writers. 6.2.10. REVIVAL OF BRAHMA~ISM Efforts then were made bythe Buddhists toimitate inusage of Sanskrit, their Brahmanic rivals thisreversionary circumstance B.C, But this view iscontested because the second century B.C. already had brought therise ofBrah- manic school. 6.2.11.

All the seven parts fallapart, ifviewed from theunity of ideas, the essential principle that welds the ideas into abook. This manuscript being asacustom, tohave been enshrined Sttsoe ravi have parts ofAyurveda and the sections ofKavacikitsa, Nidfwa and Sarira etc. are altogether absent even inthe scheme ofthis work.

CONTAINS UNKNOWN FORMULAE Itis,however, that some oftheformulae arefound formulae deserve experimental trials fortheir effective- ness and efficacy. These may turn out tobeuseful. 7.4. RE-APPRAISAL NEEDED Over eighty years have elapsed since theediting ofthis work. New ground has been broken inthe field ofPalaeography, Archaeology. History and Ayurveda, particularly after the indeoendence. New light has brought into focus many hitherto unknown facts about our lifeinthehoary past. Anappraisal ofthis work denovo is overdue inthe knowlegde. This noble endeavour islikely tobring into lime- light many hidden aspects ofAyurveda. Someone will accept this challenge someday with thematching intellect, courage and fortitude to release much imprisoned floodlight onour glorious past. 18 Bulletin Ind. tnst.Hist. Med. Vol. XVIII PART II THEMEDICAL CONTENTS 1.MEDICAL HISTORY The HISTORY OFMEDICINE is both history and medicine I.

PHARMACEUTICS: THE SPECIAL FEATURE: Single drugs are prescribed in the Nftvanitaka onthepattern ofthe Vedic period but varieties ofcom- mentio- ned. Itisanindication that pharma- ceutics had attained adistinct posi- tion bythat time. 1.4. PREPARATIONS Regarding the varieties ofprepa- rations. observation has been made ontheCaraka's theory according to which sixhundred purgative ofvariety ofsmell, colour, taste and touch etc. These preparations have been formulated due tothefact that drugs differ considerably from situation to situation inrespect oftheland and thesource etc. The men also differ other inrespect totheir AStudy 1,5 MODIFICATION PROPORTIONS the theory ofpreparation ofmedicines known toCaraka, weare astonished that many ofthe processes followed bythe modern pharmacy were well known bythat time, \"Preparation is the prOCESS performed to modify natural propr rties ofsubstances.\" By modification (Sarhskarah), that pro- properties of substances!\" ofthematerial receptacle\" and ongarlic isanaffirmation ofthefact that theNavanitaka would have been compiled specially forthe people ofcold climate like Kashmir and Kuchar inIndia and Central Asia respectively. Kashmir might have been theplace ofcompilation ofthe19 Navan/taka. Itwas from here that it was brought toKuchar byBuddhist Monks. 1.8. DRUG AND DIET INONE The La~unaka/pa represents the theory ofdrug due toitshot (Ussi\u00ab} property\", given preference inthefood substances ofthe people ofabove mentioned climate. Use has mentioned such food-habits asan agreeable food while mentioning agreeable substances for people of Bactria, (Bahlika), Central Asia (Sa- kas) and China etc.\" 2. PHARMACY: WEIGHTS &MEASURES (M.\\ TR\\/M\\NA) The pharmacy has towork with well precise standard measures of weight. Two different systems of weights have been adopted inths Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia.\"? One of them iscalled the Kalingamana and the other the Magadhamana. The former and thelatter have been ado- reason that itisbased on theterms Kudaval~ and Kalinga Raktika or Guiljapha which has taken These Rattis arethe red berries of Abrus precetor iuswith black spots on their heads. Eight Hattis make one Ma,,:a crMa:aand twelve Masas make one weight (i.e., gold) isequal tothe weight of aRupee. Thus itisaffirmation of the fact that the gold unit was in vogue inthose olden times. 2.4. CONTINUITY OF THE GOLDEN AGE Certainly the Golden age iscalled after the above mentioned gold unit. Another synonym ofthis unit, the term Bidalapadaka has been used byCaraka.!? Use ofthis term inthe NavanitakalH indicates that the gold unit was invogue and the Golden age was continuing bythat time, too.Bulletin Ind. Inst. Hist, Med.

The smallest unit of measurement according tothe Carakasamit'd. seems same particle i.e., Vam~i cles make one red rapeseed (Mustard- Sar,apa\u00bb J In respect of smaller measurements such arapeseed cer- tainly indicates the atomic measure that was prevalent inthose times. 2.5.2 POTS AND VESSELS POTS &VESSELS: isaclear used.' 5It isobvious from theNevenitek\u00bb that awaterpot (Jetspture] was made of\"Jalapatra\" orapot containing These vessels were made ofclay and copper asmention has been made of'Mrttikabhajana' 211 vessels both ofbigger and half the size ofthe above measures were also current and were utilized inthepharmacy.

DRUG PREPARATIONS The drugs prescribed intheVedic period were single herbs. They also prescribed minerals and animal sub- stances but prescriptions were not compound. The drugs that aremen- tioned inthe Caraka and Susrute Setiihites are both single herbs and compound preparations. The same is thecase with theNavanitaka. There isnomention ofdrugs ofmineral origin TOCOMPOUNDS: Besides, itisobvious from the Navanitaka that the use of single drugs ofthe Vedic origin ingraduated quantities (ie. verahsmene mfttrft) mple incase ofthe drug \"Pippali\" i.e., long This drug has been highly admired inthe Atherveve de.t? Therein the origin ofthis drug tothe story ofthe nectar churninq.w Thus itbears similarity with the origin of garlic (i.e. Lasuna) asthe origin of the latter isalso related tothe same story (i.e nectar-churninqj.w 32 THE DRUG AND THE DIET This success further accentuated the yearning forevermore and robust health giving and sensuous life-prol- onging drugs. Being related tonectar and being mentioned Veda such drugs were considered auspi- cious and bytheir use inthe society these were found excellently gratify- ing means ofthat yearning. Thus they became drugs and diet inone foralland sundry. 3.3 DRUGS FOR ALL HUMOUR VITIATIONS Such drugs were found beneficial inallthe three humours (dos as). The Navanitaka attributes efficacious pro- perties to oftreatrnents-\", Itisalso revealed from the NfJ..vanitaka that these drugs were often taken as a Kalpa; i.e., rejuvenating recipes. 3.4 KALPAS Inthe tobeused. In case ofPippali vardhamana i.e pro- gressively increasing dose of long pepper formula, itismentioned that the course ofone hundred days is started with adose ofone pepper on the first dav and then increasing one pepper daily upto the one hundredth day and then gradually reducing one pepper daily. This isknown asPippali verdhernerre'\", But if the same course isstarted inadose ofatleast three, five, eight orten pepper onthe first day according to the strength and 'ge ofthe patient followed by milk asan Anupsne and aregular diet (K~iropasevanam), this formula iscalled aKalpa.50 3.5 N.\\VANITAKA The with \"Lecunekelp pharmaco- graphic dealing with Haritakikalpa53, ofSakra (Indra) asperthe Navanitaka.57 This same story has been recounted intheBhavapraka~a58 later on. 3.7 THE .\"\\SVINASA]\\iIHITA : SOURCE OFHARiTAKi KALPA the Navanitaka the source quite certain. This uncertainty isdue tothe fact that Bhflvaprakasa does not quote the same matter inthe same chronology rather itmakes changes here and there while appendices call for our finding out thegenuine version, that must belying hidden inthe KNOWLEDGE OFVITALIZERS 4'1 VITAMINS IMPLIED Indeed wefeel astonished when we find that drugs ofthe above mentioned qualities having auspicious nature oforigin were advised tobe used intheir twig-fresh state. For instance Caraka prescribes that Emb- liemyrobelens (i.e. Amalaki) that were picked updirectly fresh from thetree were highly valued. r,1 4.2 FRESH FRUITS RECOMMENDED Here wecome across theempiri- green herbs ones.u3 elements although theterm \"Vitamin\" was not there, butthey 24 knew well about thevitaminous fac- tors ofthe herbs, vegetables, fruits and other articles. 4.3 KALPAS.' THEHARBINGERS OFPHARMACEUTICAL ADVANCEMENT Pharmaceutics had emerged and had well developed techniques. The Ka/pas had wide popularity among tne masses. There grew anintake capacity forsuch effect offresh juice ofgreen and of vegetable origin was well recognised. Itwas amatter ofmore concern for thepharmacists who tried tokeep up and develop some new processes for preserving other medicine same process Thus produced bythefollowing four metals, viz, gold, copper. silver and iron. When heated bythesun, the moun- tains, gold and theother metal ores emit impurities. ns They are particularly recognized bytheir corr- esponding colours. The Bitumen that isincolour like flower i.e. Jsptuiups isthat which istheout- flow ofgold, That which one isthat that the macerated Rock- Exudation should be mixed with additionally powdered iron i.e.l.ohectirne. Such amedica- ment ofBitumen was prescribed for silajatukalpa. Taken with milk and milk diet, itconfers long life fullof ease and comfort, relieves from the disease, resists old age, offers firm- ness tothe body, promotes memory and intellect and provides strenqtht- tothe user. Thus itperforms the same action which has been recog- nised for Rasayana orGeriatrics in the of\"Powdered iron\" iron blood both\"? was identified byphysicians for the purpose ofcuringthe pallor and anaemia and thus italso turned tobean important ingredient for geriatric preparations.

The Heriteki Kalpaisanextract from theevide- nce ofsuch Kalpas itisconcluded that time there was made the beginning ofcompound formulae tobring forth better results than those ofthesingle proved more useful intreatment asthese thefurther development ofalchemy. However, the NfJ.'Ianltaka fo!lows the methodology that was adopted in classical medical books like theCere- kesesohrt\u00ab, Therefore, there isthe same classical elegance ofalchemy inwhich both theVedic and theclassic ages are reflected vividly. 7, REFINEMENT AND ADORNMENTS The pharmacy thus made anaus-Bulletin Ind.Inst. The com- pound formulae pertaining topow- ders, pills, medicated and clarified butter herbo-metallic preparations, bevera- includ- ing hair lotions, collyria and cosmetics and various confec- tions coupled with alotofsex-stren- gthening drugs prove that people were leading aluxurious lifeand thus thegolden age was still reigning in opulence. 7.-1. PATTERN OFLIFE Although itisthe man who makes times, but itisequally true that thetimes make men. The Vedic age istheage ofsingle drugs. The simple reason behind itisthe plain living ofthe people. Due tostrict rules ofrighteousness and good con- duct, simplicity and austerity were thenorms. Being simple people, they possessed arobust health through a hygienic and balanced daily routine. But incourse oftime, they could not have better ofthe temptations and were enticed bythe luxurious life. The result was that there grew diffe- rent diseases and tocombat them compound formulae were prescribed inplace ofthesingle drugs asthere was demand forsuch and diversification society for effective treatment oftheever-comp- licating diseases. The Navanitaka, however, reveals that there were AStudy ofNftvanitaka-Pandev &Pandey comparatively afew disorders tocope with, because the that the Navanitaka is thework which was originally com- posed during confluence oftheVedic and classical orSarhhita periods. 7.2. CEREALS AND PULSES Among thefood articles there is mention ofTarH.lulaso (rice), Vaidala (pulse). Siip oden\u00ab (rice and pulse). Mudgodana (Moonodet and rice), Yava~J (barley) &Godhflma (wheat).

MEDICINE FOR ALL 8.1 ANEW HIGH POINT The pharmaceutics had touched anew high point. Virtually allaspects ofdiseases, deficiencies, invigora- tions and addictions were provided forbythepreparations turned out the pharmacies ofthat age. 8.2 SCIENTIFIC AGE OFPHARMACY From the primeval age ofthe Vedic single drugs the scientific age ofdevelopment evolved with doses and measurements ofminute units comprising the atoms. Thus the pharmacy and pharmaceutics develo- ped considerably. As based onthe foregoing classics and itsstudy reveals that the same scientific age was still reigning. From the gold standard ofweight it isevident that the golden erawas still prevailing and people were so prosperous that they could afford a luxurious living. 8.3 THE THERAPEUTIC OILS Medicated oils were also prescri- bed very much. There ismention of one such oilcomposed byAsvins, It was prescribed tosage Cyavana and later on used byMflrka09,eya. The former regained youth and the latter the longevity ofthis oilwhich would prove significant for valuable document ofthe classical age. Itislike awindow which HAIR VITALIZERS Itisapparent that long hair style were commonly pre- valent inthe society right from the Vedic men- . for washing of hair (Prak,'dJana) has been advised asone ofthe means ofgrowing hair.92 The reason ofbaldness and grey hair isgiven. Ithas been pointed out why women donot lose their hair but men often become bald-headed. The reason said isthe vitiation ofbile (Pitta) and blood that cause the premature grey hair.
