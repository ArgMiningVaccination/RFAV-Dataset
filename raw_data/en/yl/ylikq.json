At the beginning of 2008, I was a practicing attorney with a pro minent firm in South Carolina when my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. I returned home to Connecticut to care for her. We went through chemotherapy, radiation and a double mastectomy. Two years later the cancer returned with a vengeance and claimed her life on this earth. The side effects of the treatments were devastating, and ultimately they failed. Earlier in my career, I had worked in pharmaceutical research and development (in labs at Channing, Harvard Medical School, and Brigham and Women's Hospital.) I began researching medical marijuana as a patient option and consulted Dr. Andrew Salner, who had been my mother's radiation oncologist. He expressed his approval of the dr ug as a patient option. Since then, I have working full time to realize the vision of a pharmaceutical company committed to providing patients with this product thus affording them a wider array of treatment options, and am ready to apply my full range of legal and organizational skills, and all my energy, to serving patients through Curaleaf.

I watched my mother and sister suffer and ultimately fall victim to cancer. I have stood by scores of patients throughout my career as they tried to hold on to some quality of life. In medical cannabis, I have found a way to provide some of these patients with one more therapeutic option in the present pharmacopeia. Educating patients was the mission of Olive's Branch. Providing patients with more options is the heart and the motivation of Curaleaf. My professional journey has led to broad knowledge of cannabinoid science. I think it is fair to say that I am well known for my commitment to the patient and the patient's best interest. Curaleaf will serve patients in a manner consistent with my entire career.

For a full rational please see cover page.Curaleaf will strive to unlock the full therapeutic potential of cannabis through scientific research and pharmaceutical grade production with a commitment to regulatory compliance and sustainability. VisionOverview 5The Curaleaf mission is to produce pharmaceutical grade, standardized dose med - ical cannabis, for use by an educated medical and patient community to improve health, well-being and quality of life. Mission Statement Eileen Konieczny, President and Chief Visionary, is a Professional Registered nurse with more than twenty years of experience in oncology. She is also board member of the American Cannabis Nurses Association and formerly Executive Director of the Connecticut Cannabis Business Alliance. Eileen actively educated Connecticut legislators during the creation and passage of the Connecticut medical marijuana bill and also contributed to the Department of Consumer Protection's formulation of the regulations. Her excellent reputation in the medical cannabis community has inspired the most respected medical, cultivation and scientific experts in the industry to join the Curaleaf team. April Arrasate, Chief Operating Officer, is a Connecticut attorney with a background in pharmaceutical research and development. April lost her mother to breast can - cer in 2011 and has since transitioned into the realm of patient advocacy, using her pharmaceutical background to explore patient options in new medicines. Robert Birnbaum, Chief Executive Officer is a dynamic financial expert with a strong history in compliance and regulated environments. Robert has successfully managed both large and small organizations in addition to founding a successful start-up and has the experience necessary to ramp up and oversee the Curaleaf organization. The Curaleaf investors are largely longtime Connecticut residents using their own funds. In addition to being upstanding and well respected members of the commu - nity, they bring broad business experience and management skills to the venture. Curaleaf has the financial strength to fulfill its mission as envisioned by the state. Curaleaf has $6 million committed capital, including $2 million in cash As evidence of this strength, our balance sheet already shows assets of just over $6 million, including $2 million in cash immediately available to meet the State's requirements upon granting of license. More financial resources are available if required as the business develops. The People Behind Curaleaf RFA C Business Plan6 This portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.The Curaleaf production facility is located in the former world headquarters build - ing of Ensign Bickford Aerospace & Defense, a global leader of precision ener - getics systems and innovative explosive solutions. Because the building was designed for high tech manufacture, it is equipped with desirable characteristics such as clean rooms, extensive power and HVAC systems, industrial chillers and an inherently secure design and location. It is located in an industrial zone, which is consistent with the local zoning requirements for the production of medical mari - juana in the town of Simsbury. We anticipate investing over $1 million in remodeling and new security systems for the building, in addition to the equipment required for production. LocationOverview 6Based on the superior characteristics of the facility and the industry expertise of the Curaleaf cultivation and extraction team, Curaleaf will be able to cost-effectively meet both short-term and long-term patient demand. Phase 1 of our production plan Phase II build out will Production Expectations RFA C Business Plan7 This portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.The Curaleaf product line is guided by three main principles; organic cultivation of source product, standardized dosing that utilizes targeted delivery systems and familiar forms of pharmaceutical consumption. Each genetic strain to be cultivated has been specifically chosen to yield the types and combinations of active compound that research indicates will best address the needs of the eligible patient community. The raw material product will be grown using organic methods, as defined by the state of Connecticut in \u00a721a-92(19) of the Connecticut General Statutes. Each strain will be homogenized and tested in Cura - leaf's own in-house testing facility and by an independent state approved laborato - ry such that the patient is aware of the exact makeup of the particular strain. C uraleaf is committed to providing patients with familiar forms of medicine such as capsules, sublingual tabs, inhalers, creams and raw material that can be consumed by vaporization as well as \"medibles.\" Curaleaf understands the medical and pa - tient community concern about smoking a pharmaceutical. Curaleaf has obtained technology, techniques and intellectual property that can ultimately eliminate the need to smoke the product. The research and development initiatives of Curaleaf seek to deepen understanding of the usefulness of various cannabinoids and opti - mal methods of delivery.

RFA C Business Plan9 This portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.Overall, Curaleaf is modeled after a small pharmaceutical company. We aim to serve patients with legitimate medical needs, not recreational marijuana users. We will make products that are familiar to patients, in the form of pills, inhalers, sublinguals and topicals. Our objective is to be the premier provider of pharma - ceutical grade medical cannabis, in standardized doses, delivered through vehicles that do not necessarily require smoking. Specifically, Curaleaf has set the following objectives for the first two years of operations: 1. B uild an advanced cultivation & extraction facility, based on proven tech - nology to meet the needs of the eligible patient community. 2. I ncrease production capacity at a steady pace adequate to meet patient demand. 3. E ducate the medical and patient community regarding the benefits of medical cannabis, raising awareness, comfort level, and knowledge of the appropriate use of medical cannabis. 4. F und research on the use of medical cannabis as an additional available o ption for recommending physicians and eligible patients. 5.

Curaleaf products will be preferred in the pharmaceutical market due to effica - cy and safety. The ability to provide potent medicine without the accompanying side effects prevalent in today's pharmaceutical marketplace is valuable to both physicians and patients and will ultimately drive acceptance of medical cannabis. Unlike other pharmaceuticals, the side effects of cannabinoid compounds are relatively mild so that delivery in high doses does not pose a significant risk. Not a single documented case of a fatal overdose of cannabis exists. (US Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, \"In the Matter of Marijuana Rescheduling Petition\" (Docket #86-22), September 6, 1988) In addition, the reported side effects of cannabis are temporary and non-lethal. Curaleaf products stand apart from the available products in the cannabis market - place because every step of each product is handled and engineered as a phar - maceutical. Th e founders of Curaleaf were motivated to form this company to ensure quality op - tions for patients who are not interested in the recreational drug market. Our products embrace Connecticut's medicinal regulations rather than subvert them. That commit - ment will create confident and continued consumers of Curaleaf products.

Profit is an accounting concept, and is impacted by a number of accounting decisions, such as pace of depreciation of equipment, amortization of start up costs, etc, so there is some management dis - creation in determining profits. Sales, however, is an actual number, easily calculat - ed and verifiable without discretion. One percent of sales, with no cap, is budgeted to support a compassionate need program, the basic mission is to provide pharmaceutical grade medical cannabis to patients in need. Curaleaf will be refining our charitable programs on an ongoing basis in response to our experiences and evolving patient and community needs. One percent of sales, up to $100,000 annually, will be granted to groups that work to prevent substance abuse in Connecticut. Eileen Konieczny, Chief Visionary, a medical professional herself, will assemble and chair a Community Benefits Committee that will help Curaleaf, to identify recipients and ensure the money is effectively spent on worthwhile programs. One percent of sales up to $100,000 annually as described in section I of this RFA.Two percent of sales up to $100,000 annually as described in section I of this RFA.Compassionate Need Plan Substance Abuse Prevention Plan Job Creation Connecticut's regulations position Connecticut as the national leader in the pro - duction of medical cannabis. Employee Relations Curaleaf seeks to create a corporate culture that will foster a healthy and happy work environment that offers competitive salary and benefit packages. Employees will be registered with the state after a comprehensive background check. Curaleaf has created the following materials to address new employee relations: Application Reference Checklist New hire Orientation Checklist Employee Handbook New Employee Checklist Employee Education Employee Health and Safety Plan Performance ReviewHiring Materials Dispensary Relations The first goal of dispensary relations is the creation of a virtuous feedback loop. The pharmacist is the one with direct patient access. The manufacturer needs to know how well the medicines are working and what, if anything, requires mod - ification and/or development. Working with the dispensaries to collect feedback and data will be a significant and ongoing effort. This will lead to the second goal, which is to involve pharmacists in the product development process. The third goal will be to work with dispensaries on education in their local communities, by supporting seminars and other outreach programs to physicians, patients, and the community at large. Toward this effort, Dr. Khary Bryan, PharmD, will sit on the Curalef Advisory Board.Community Benefits Plan Research Plan RFA C Business Plan51 This portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act.

Each step of production takes advantage of current state-of-the-art technology, with the intent of incorporating future proven technology as it is developed. 54The controls group's objective is to assure the safety and security of the facility and the materials therein (including transportation to dispensaries), and to enforce compliance with all state and local regulation. Importantly, this department is inde - pendent of the other functional areas, reporting directly to executive management. This practice is consistent with best practices in other industries and companies that have developed a strong compliance and control culture. Control Group Community Group The community group's objective is to advance the overall efficacy of medical cannabis through programs and dialogue with a wide spectrum of stakeholders. The Curaleaf management has extensive experience in providing education to the medical and patient communities, and education will be a prime focus. We will also fund research and development activities related to medical cannabis\u2014appropriate medical uses, study of additional compounds, and delivery systems. We will work closely with dispensaries to gain feedback from them on patient experience. Some work will be technology based, but much will be done in person in the early stages. Moving beyond those who handle medical cannabis directly, Curaleaf will work with local law enforcement and other officials to ensure that communities are not disrupted. Finally, Curaleaf will be a \"good citizen\" with regard to the environment and ener - gy efficiency. Our facilities plan seeks to be as \"green\" as possible. Curaleaf will install the most efficient equipment and lighting available today that will accom - plish its tasks, and will upgrade to more energy efficient equipment as it becomes available. The business infrastructure group's objective is the creation of a solid, stable platform so that the functions described above can meet their objectives effec - tively, and includes finance, human resources, legal, administration, facilities, and information technology.

DEFINITION Ergonomics is a multidisciplinary activity dealing with the interactions between a person and their work environment. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Ergonomic Stressors Poor workplace designs can present ergonomic risk factors called stressors. These stressors include but are not limited to repetition, force, and extreme postures. \u007f Repetition- the number of motions or movements that are performed per cycle or per shift. \u007f Force- the muscles used to produce force in order to perform necessary activities such as lifting, grasping, pinching and pushing \u007f Extreme Postures- muscles are required to work at a level near or at their maximum capacity. Employee exposure to these stressors may cause injury or lead to the development of Musculoskeletal Disorders. SYPTOMS OF MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS (MSD) Symptoms of MSD identify that an ergonomic hazard is present. There may be individual difference in susceptibility and symptoms among employees performing similar tasks. Any symptoms are to be taken seriously. The following list of symptoms can be but are not limited to: \u007f Numbness \u007f Stiffness \u007f Redness Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 7 WORK STRATEGY CONTROLS When an ergonomic hazard has been identified, the Environment, Health and Safety Office will work with the department in e liminating or minimizing the hazard. There are two general approaches to controlling ergonomic hazards: Engineering and Administrative. \u007f Engineering Controls: Are changes made to the workstations, tools, and/or machinery that alter the physical composition of area or process. \u007f Administrative Controls: Are changes made to regulate exposure without making physical changes to the area or process, for example job rotation and frequent breaks . RESPONSIBILITIES All employees are responsible for attending training on ergonomics and for following proper work practices. Departments are responsible for providing sufficient resources to implement ergonomic recommendations in a timely manner as well as ensuring that employees are properly trained. Environmental Health and Safety is responsible for evaluating and monitoring the ergonomic program including assessing the nature and extent of ergonomic hazards, recommending ways of minimizing or controlling these hazards, and support the company in consultation and direction regarding ergonomics. The EHS is also responsible for ensuring that training on ergonomics is available to all employees. MEDICAL MANAGEMENT If an employee is experiencing any signs or symptoms of musculoskeletal disorders, the employee is to report their symptoms to their supervisor and consult the Occupational Health Clinic for a medical evaluation. The clinic will advise the employee, their supervisor, and EHS of the necessary follow- up.

Unobstructed hallways, stairwells and exits are necessary to provide access for emergency responders in a medical, fire or other emergency, including access to fire panels and building utilities. To comply with state and federal regulations, Curaleaf policy prohibits the storage of items - even on a temporary basis - in hallways, mechanical rooms, building common areas, paths of egress identified by \"EXIT\" signs, aisles which lead to exits, or loading dock areas in the immediate vicinity of an exit. Areas that may be used for evacuation must be kept clear at all times. The areas described above may never be used for the purpose of storage of tables, chairs, bookcases, or any kind of furniture or equipment. RESPONSIBILITY FOR SAFE EGRESS Employees, contractors and visitors are responsible for following Curaleaf procedures to maintain safe hallways, stairways and exits. CPortable Fire Extinguishers GENERAL The provisions of this policy apply to the selection, distribution, inspection, maintenance and testing of portable extinguishing equipment. The requirements given herein are minimums. Portable extinguishers are intended as a first line of defense to cope with fires of limited size. They are needed even when a facility is equipped with automatic sprinklers, standpipe and hose, or other fixed protection equipment. Fire extinguisher training is provided annually by EHS. DEFINITIONS The basic types of fires are Classes A, B, C, and D as defined in the following: Class A Combustible materials, such as wood, cloth, paper, rubber, and many Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 13 plastics. Class B Flammable and combustible liquids. Class C Energized electrical equipment. Class D Combustible metals, such as magnesium, titanium, zirconium, sodium, and potassium. CLASSIFICATION AND RATINGS OF FIRE EXTINGUISHERS Portable fire extinguishers are classified for use on Class A, B, C, or D fires and rated by nationally recognized testing laboratories for relative extinguishing effectiveness. The classification and rating are based upon the preceding classification of fires and the fire extinguishment potentials as determined by fire tests. SELECTION OF EXTINGUISHERS The selection of extinguishers for a given situation is determined by the character of the fires anticipated. MOUNTING LOCATIONS Extinguishers shall be conspicuously located where they will be readily accessible in the event of fire. They shall be located along normal paths of travel, including exits from an area. Fire protection and fire detection equipment shall not be obstructed. INSPECTIONS Extinguishers are to be visually inspected and the inspection documented monthly by departmental personnel. MAINTENANCE Extinguishers needing to be recharged due to use or pressure leakage will be recharged or replaced by EHS. Storage and Use of Flammable and Combustible Liquids GENERAL It is the policy of Curaleaf to use the recommendations contained in Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 14 the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Codes as minimum guidelines to acceptable practices in the facility. A number of the NFPA Codes have been incorporated into the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) Standards, the Connecticut State Building Code, or are mandated as a condition of insurance coverage by the Connecticut Department of Insurance. Questions regarding the applicability of specific NFPA Codes should be directed to EHS and the State Fire Marshal. The purpose of this policy statement is to list the basic standards for the storage and use of flammable and combustible liquids applicable to Curaleaf operations. DEFINITIONS Laboratory Unit A laboratory unit is defined as a room, or suite of rooms, separated from adjacent areas by walls and doors having at least a one-hour fire rating. Flash Point The minimum temperature at which, a liquid gives off vapor in sufficient concentration to form an ignitable mixture in air. Flammable Liquids A flammable liquid is any liquid having a flash point below 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C). Flammable liquids are also known as Class I liquids and subdivided according to flash point and boiling point as indicated in the table below. Combustible Liquids A combustible liquid is any liquid having a flash point at or above 100\u00b0F, and is known as a Class II or III liquid as indicated below: Combustible liquids shall be divided into two classes as follows: 1. Class II liquids shall include those with flash points at or above 100\u00baF (37.8\u00baC) and below 140\u00baF (60\u00baC), except any mixture having components with flash points of 200\u00baF (93.3\u00baC) or higher, the volume of which make up 99 percent or more of the total volume of the mixture. 2. Class III liquids shall include those with flash points at or above 140\u00baF (60\u00baC). Class III liquids are subdivided into two subclasses: \u007f Class IIIA liquids shall include those with flash points at or Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 15 above 140\u00baF (60\u00baC) and below 200\u00baF (93.3\u00baC), except any mixture having components with flash points of 200\u00baF (93.3\u00baC), or higher, the total volume of which make up 99 percent or more of the total volume of the mixture. \u007f Class IIIB liquids shall include those with flash points at or above 200\u00baF (93.3\u00baC). This section does not regulate Class IIIB liquids. Where the term \"Class III liquids\" is used in this section, it shall mean only Class IIIA liquids. When a combustible liquid is heated to within 30\u00baF (16.7\u00baC) of its flash point, it shall be handled in accordance with the requirements for the next lower class of liquids. Flammable liquid: any liquid having a flash point below 100\u00baF (37.8\u00baC), except any mixture having components with flashpoints of 100\u00baF (37.8\u00baC) or higher, the total of which make up 99 percent or more of the total volume of the mixture. Flammable liquids shall be known as Class I liquids. Class I liquids are divided into three classes as follows: 1. Class IA shall include liquids having flash points below 73\u00baF (22.8\u00baC) and having a boiling point below 100\u00baF (37.8\u00baC). 2. Class IB shall include liquids having flash points below 73\u00baF (22.8\u00baC) and having a boiling point at or above 100\u00baF (37.8\u00baC). 3. Class IC shall include liquids having flash points at or above 73\u00baF (22.8\u00baC) and below 100\u00baF (37.8\u00baC). MAXIMUM CONTAINER SIZE FOR POINT OF USE STORAGE The potential fire hazard depends on the flash point and the quantity of liquid being used. The following table gives the maximum size container allowed for each class of liquid. Class \u007f Container Type IA IB IC II III \u007f Glass 1 pt. 1 qt. 1 qt. 1 gal. 1 gal. \u007f Metal or Approved Plastic 1 gal. 5 gal. 5 gal. 5 gal. 5 gal. \u007f Safety Cans 2 gal. 5 gal. 5 gal. 5 gal. 5 gal. MAXIMUM QUANTITIES The potential fire hazard also depends on the total quantity of flammable and combustible liquids present within a containment unit and the type of containers in which the liquids are stored. The maximum quantity allowed per unit is as follows: \u007f Shelf or open storage/use: Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act.

The use of safety cans in laboratories, where applicable is strongly encouraged. SOLVENT STORAGE CABINETS Storage cabinets constructed to NFPA standards should be used when required by quantity limits. Storage cabinets are not permitted in hallways. REFRIGERATORS Flammable liquids must not be stored in domestic type refrigerators. Domestic type refrigerators should not be purchased for laboratory use, even if flammable storage is not contemplated, since future research needs may require the use of flammables. Safety refrigerators, which have the electrical contacts (door switch, light, thermostat, etc.) removed or exteriorized, are recommended for laboratory use. \"Explosion Proof\" refrigerators are not recommended except in unusual circumstances, such as in an inside storage room (for flammables) or in potentially hazardous atmospheres. WARNING SIGNS Bunsen burners and other open flames must not be used in the area where flammable liquids are being used. The area must be posted \"NO SMOKING\" and containers are to be labeled \"DANGER FLAMMABLE - KEEP AWAY FROM HEAT, SPARKS, AND OPEN FLAMES. KEEP CLOSED WHEN NOT IN USE.\" Sign and Tag Requirements for Accident Prevention GENERAL The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard Z53.1, Safety Color Code for Marking Physical Hazards, and the identification Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act.

CHAPTER FOURFOUR Industrial Hygiene Program Requirements INTRODUCTION Curaleaf is committed to protecting its employees from environmental hazards that arise out of or during the course of employment. The industrial hygiene program deals with the recognition, evaluation, and control of environmental health hazards. Environmental health hazards may include conditions which cause legally compensable illnesses, or any conditions in the work environment that impair the health of employees to the extent that they lose work and/or efficiency. The program provides industrial hygiene surveys and monitoring to identify hazards, inspections, and other information necessary to control the recognized health hazards. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH HAZARDS Measures are provided for the control of hazards such as: \u007f Chemical (29 CFR 1910.1000): Liquids, dusts, fumes, mists, vapors, or gases. The three routes of entry into the body being inhalation, skin absorption, and ingestion. \u007f Physical: Non-ionizing radiation, noise, pressure, vibration, illumination, and temperature extremes. \u007f Biological: Viruses, bacteria, fungi, and insects. RECORD KEEPING Records of all survey results and employee exposures are maintained at the Department of Environment, Health and Safety. Record keeping is particularly important in the area of occupational health hazards where the effects of exposure may not be apparent for several years, and delayed litigation results. Records of exposure monitoring, employee training programs, and medical examinations are maintained. Medical Surveillance Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 20 PURPOSE OSHA regulations require medical examinations for certain types of work involving exposure to hazardous or toxic substances.

For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 22 Hearing Conservation Program PURPOSE The purpose of the Hearing Conservation Program is to provide for the protection of Curaleaf employees from long-term hearing loss associated with noise levels in the workplace in compliance with OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910.95 Occupational Noise Exposure. HEARING CONSERVATION PROGRAM All Curaleaf employees whose noise exposures equal or exceeds an 8- hour time weighted average (TWA) of 85 decibels are enrolled in a hearing conservation program. The hearing conservation program includes: \u007f annual monitoring of noise exposures \u007f annual training on noise exposures \u007f use of hearing protectors \u007f annual audiometric testing RECOGNITION AND EVALUATION OF NOISE SOURCES When information indicates that any employee's exposure may equal or exceed an 8-hour time-weighted average of 85 decibels, the department is to notify the Environment, Health and Safety Office to implement a monitoring program. The noise survey is performed using a sound level meter (A-scale, slow response) and/or noise dosimeter for evaluation of personal exposures. The employee is to be notified when he/she is exposed at or above an 8-hour time-weighted average of 85 decibels. Monitoring shall be repeated whenever a change in production, process, equipment or controls increases noise exposures to the extent that additional employees may be exposed at or above the action level; or the attenuation provided by hearing protectors being used by employees is not adequate. AUDIOMETRIC TESTING Annual audiometric testing is performed by a licensed or certified audiologist at the Hearing and Communication Center. A baseline audiogram is obtained within 6 months of an employee's first exposure at or above the action level. The baseline audiogram is established to compare against subsequent audiograms. The results of problem Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 23 audiometric tests are sent to the Occupational Health Clinic for review and to determine whether there is need for further evaluation. Audiometric tests are to be pure tone, air conduction, hearing threshold examinations, with test frequencies including as a minimum 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hz. Tests at each frequency are to be taken separately for each ear. Employees are to be notified, in writing, of the results of exams. If the annual audiogram shows a standard threshold shift, employees are to schedule a retest within 30 days to verify the shift. When there is a verified standard threshold shift, the employee must be notified within 21 days after verification. CONTROL OF NOISE SOURCE When employees are subjected to sound levels exceeding 85 dBA TWA, feasible administrative or engineering controls are to be utilized. Types of administrative controls are rotation of employees, limiting time of certain operations, or restricting areas or work operations. Engineering controls include maintenance, modifying equipment, substitution of equipment, isolation, and acoustic material. HEARING PROTECTION DEVICES If feasible engineering or administrative controls cannot be accomplished personal hearing protective devices must be provided and used to reduce sound levels in areas above 85 dBA. The hearing protection used will depend on the operation, employee preference and attenuation required. The industrial hygienist is to assist in supplying information on attenuation data and supervise the correct use of hearing protectors. Employees are given the opportunity to select their hearing protectors from a variety of suitable hearing protectors. Personal protective devices should also be used during non-routine, infrequent operations, which do not warrant special engineering control. Curaleaf strongly encourages the use of hearing protection devices while working around noisy equipment. The use of hearing protection devices is required for the following: \u007f When the exposure is 90 dBA, or greater. \u007f When the exposure is 85 dBA, or greater, and the employee has experienced a threshold shift. \u007f When the exposure is 85 dBA, or greater, and the employee has not yet had a baseline audiogram established. For employees who have experienced a standard threshold shift, hearing protectors must attenuate employee exposure to an 8-hour Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 24 time-weighted average of 85 decibels or below. The adequacy of hearing protector attenuation shall be re-evaluated whenever employee noise exposures increase to the extent that the hearing protectors provided may no longer provide adequate attenuation. SIGNS Signs are to be posted in areas where noise levels are above 85 dBA stating that hearing protection is required. It is to read: \"Caution: Hearing Protection Required\". TRAINING An annual training program is provided for each employee included in the hearing conservation program. The training program includes effects of noise on hearing; the purpose of hearing protectors, and instruction on their selection, fitting, use, and care; and the purpose of audiometric testing. RECORDKEEPING Employee exposure measurements and assessments are maintained at the Environment, Health and Safety Office. Employee audiometric test records are kept at the Hearing and Communication Center. Audiometric test records shall be retained for the duration of the affected employee's employment. Employees can request access to their exposure information and audiometric test records. Use of Chemical Carcinogens CONTROL PRACTICES Planning and implementation of control practices for the prevention of occupationally acquired cancer and for the protection of the general environment is to be included in all research programs involving known or suspected chemical carcinogens. DEFINITION Chemical carcinogens are chemicals which have been demonstrated to cause tumors in mammalian species by induction of a tumor type not usually observed, by induction of an increased incidence of a tumor type normally seen, by the appearance of such tumors at an earlier time than would be otherwise expected, or by promotion of tumors initiated from exposure to other chemicals. Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 25 APPLICABILITY These policies apply to known or suspected chemical carcinogens. The OSHA Laboratory Standard 29 CFR 1910.1450 defines select carcinogens as those chemicals which are: regulated by OSHA as carcinogens; listed by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) as \"known to be carcinogens\"; listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer Monographs (IARC) in Group 1 (carcinogenic to humans); listed by NTP as reasonably anticipated to be carcinogens or by IARC in Group 2A (probably carcinogenic to humans); and listed by IARC in Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans) and causing statistically significant tumor incidence in experimental animals. The Environment, Health and Safety Office (962-5507) is to be consulted when questions arise about the carcinogenic potential of certain chemicals handled in laboratories. LABORATORY SAFETY PLAN The Laboratory Safety Plan describes procedures that will be used to ensure the safe handling of chemical carcinogens, an assessment of potential risks, the need for medical surveillance, procedures for handling accidental spills, and waste disposal methods. ACCIDENTAL EXPOSURES All overt accidental exposures of personnel to chemical carcinogens, such as exposure to a concentrated contaminated aerosol through research procedures, accidental spills, or accidental inoculation with a contaminated needle, are to be reported to EHS. HAPTER FIVE Chemical Waste Disposal As a generator of hazardous waste, Curaleaf is required to comply with federal standards promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Transportation (DOT). These regulations require documentation of the transfer of hazardous waste from the point of generation to final disposal. Each waste generato, is responsible for correctly identifying the hazardous waste generated in his/her work area, thereby ensuring proper transportation and disposal. Waste containers must be: \u007f Labeled with the words \"Hazardous Waste\" or other clear chemical identification Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 26 \u007f Securely closed except when material is being added or removed \u007f Placed in secondary containment if the container is a liquid, and in quantities of 4 liters or less, or if the container is made of glass and is stored on the floor. \u007f Conform with specifications for a satellite accumulation area. WASTE MINIMIZATION The most significant way that Curaleaf employees can assist in the management of hazardous waste is to reduce the volume of waste generated. Support services are encouraged to explore the use of nonhazardous cleaners, paints and solvents. EPA DEFINITIONS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE Current EPA regulations apply to wastes having the following characteristics: \u007f Ignitability: liquids with a flash point of less than 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F); oxidizers; flammable gases; and solids capable of burning vigorously and persistently after ignition through friction, absorption of moisture, or spontaneous chemical changes at standard temperature and pressure. \u007f Corrosivity: aqueous solutions with a pH less than or equal to 2 or greater than or equal to 12.5; liquids which corrode steel at a rate greater than 6.35 mm per year at 55\u00b0C. \u007f Reactivity: chemicals normally unstable that undergo violent change, react violently with water, form potentially explosive mixtures with water, emit toxic vapors when mixed with water, capable of detonation or explosive reaction. \u007f Toxicity: 43 specified heavy metals, solvents and pesticides. \u007f Listed wastes: discarded commercial chemical products or off-spec commercial chemical products. The EPA specifically names over 600 chemicals which are hazardous due to toxicity, reactivity and/or ignitability. ADDITIONAL WASTES EPA hazardous waste regulations do not address many materials used in various operations that may pose a threat to health when not managed properly. These include mutagens, carcinogens, teratogens, oils, refrigerants, herbicides, pesticides, cleaners, and controlled substances. By-products associated with nanotechnology are also deemed to be hazardous waste, and managed by the Environment, Health and Safety Office.

For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 27 OSHA Laboratory Standard LEGAL REQUIREMENTS OSHA 1910.1450, \"Occupational Exposures to Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories\" (henceforth referred to as the Laboratory Standard) dictates that employers limit employees' exposure to hazardous chemicals to below the permissible exposure limit (PEL) (or action level, if applicable) for a specific chemical. This Laboratory Standard requires that employees be apprised of the hazards of chemicals present in their work area through information and training. It also requires that a written \"Chemical Hygiene Plan\" be developed, implemented, and made available to employees. The Laboratory Standard applies only to laboratories, and, in general, supersedes other OSHA health standards. RESPONSIBILITIES The Environment, Health and Safety Office is responsible for development and implementation of the Chemical Hygiene Plan and will assist Laboratory Supervisors in developing their Laboratory Safety Plans, and obtaining chemical hazard information including material safety data sheets (MSDSs). The Environment, Health and Safety Office provides training for employees on the Laboratory Standard and on general chemical safety. In addition, the Environment, Health and Safety Office is available to offer advice on chemical hazards in the laboratory and will monitor employee exposures upon request. The Principal Investigator or laboratory supervisor is responsible for developing and implementing a Laboratory Safety Plan for his/her laboratory, providing training and information on chemical hazards, and enforcing safety procedures in the laboratory. CHEMICAL HYGIENE PLAN The Chemical Hygiene Plan is a written program developed and implemented by the employer which sets forth procedures, equipment, personal protective equipment and work practices that are capable of protecting employees from the health hazards presented by hazardous chemicals used in that particular workplace. LABORATORY SAFETY PLAN The laboratory safety plan is given to all employees to communicate the Laboratory Supervisors' expectations of safety in the laboratory. Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 28 The safety plan also serves as written documentation of how hazardous materials are handled. The laboratory safety plan is to be reviewed and updated annually. The following areas should be addressed in the safety plan: \u007f Laboratory Personnel: names of personnel working in the laboratory; \u007f Employee Information and Training: documentation of employee training programs, including the content of training sessions, location of material safety data sheets, and signs and symptoms of exposures to the agents with the most highly acute toxicity; \u007f Laboratory Safety Rules and Procedures: identification of special safety rules and procedures not described in the Laboratory Safety Manual including precautions and identification of designated areas for handling chemical carcinogens, reproductive toxins, or chemicals with a high degree of acute toxicity; \u007f Waste Disposal: identification of the hazardous waste streams generated and instructions for the disposal of various types of hazardous waste; \u007f Emergency Procedures: spill control procedures including prevention, containment, cleanup, evacuation, and procedures for emergencies occurring outside the laboratory, such as fires. A floor plan of the laboratory showing location of hazardous materials and safety equipment should be included; \u007f Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): identify the unique PPE required for laboratory procedures EMPLOYEE INFORMATION TRAINING Employees shall be apprised of the hazards and of chemicals present at the time of initial assignment and whenever a new hazard is introduced in the laboratory. A training session covering the items listed below and appropriate documentation is required for all laboratory personnel. \u007f The contents of the Laboratory Standard and Chemical Hygiene Plans \u007f The location of the Laboratory Safety Plan for the laboratory, chemical references, and Material Safety Data Sheets covering the safe handling, storage, and disposal of chemicals used in the laboratory \u007f Current recommended threshold limit values (TLVs) and the OSHA regulated permissible exposure limits (PELs) (available from the MSDS for a chemical) Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act.

EMPLOYEE EXPOSURE DETERMINATION For laboratory uses of OSHA regulated substances, employees' exposures must not exceed permissible exposure limits for such substances as specified in 29 CFR part 1910, subpart Z. If employees believe that exposure levels to a regulated substance routinely exceed PELs (or action level, if applicable) they should contact the Environment, Health and Safety Office to measure exposure levels. LABORATORY HOODS Laboratory hoods are used for operations that may result in release of toxic chemical vapors, fumes or dust. Chemical fume hoods are inspected and certified by the Environment, Health and Safety Office annually. An average face velocity of 90 to 150 feet per minute is required for all laboratory hoods.

CHAPT Respiratory Protection Program INTRODUCTION The purpos e of the Curaleaf Respiratory Protection Program is to protect the health of employees in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Respiratory Protection Standard, 29 CFR 1910.134. Respirators shall be used to protect against harmful dusts, fibers, fumes, mists, gasses, smokes, sprays, bio -aerosols, and vapors. When possible, occupational exposures caused by breathing contaminated air must be controlled through the use of feasible engineering controls such as the use of general and local ventilation systems, confinement of the operation, or substitution of less toxic materials. When effective engineering controls and other types of workplace controls (administrative, product substitution, etc.) are not feasible, or while they are being instituted, appropriate respirators shall be provided and used. The use of respirators is the last line of defense to protect employees from inhalation hazards. This program will be updated as necessary to reflect changes in Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 38 workplace con ditions that affect respirator use. RESPONSIBILITIES Department of Environment, Health and Safety The Department of Environment, Health and Safety is responsible for administering and overseeing the respiratory protection program and for conducting evalua tions of program effectiveness. Supervisor Supervisors are to develop and implement written site -specific procedures outlining the nature of the work, the hazard to which employees are exposed, and safety procedures to be followed. The specific duties re quiring the use of respirators are to be described along with identifying the type of respirators to be worn (see Worksite Specific Procedures). \u007f development and communication of worksite specific safety procedures (Job Safety Analysis) \u007f ensuring that the employees receive respirator training, fit - testing, and medical evaluations prior to issuing respirators for use. \u007f implementation and enforcement of all provisions of this program. Employee Employees who are identified as needing respiratory protection are required to comply with Departmental and Work Unit specific policies on respirator use: \u007f Male Employees (males) ensure they are clean shaven prior to annual fit -testing and anytime they must use and don a respirator. This will reduce the potential for leakage of the respirator as a result of an ineffective face to respirator seal. \u007f Reporting any problems associated with respiratory protective equipment to their supervisors and notifying the Occupational Health Clinic of any changes in medical condition or work practice that could impact their medical clearance for respirator use. Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 39 WORKSITE -SPECIFIC PROCEDURES Each department, shop, or work unit requiring the use of respirators is to have work- site specific procedures described in their plan outlining the nature of the work, the hazard to which employees are exposed, and safety procedures to be followed. The best way to create worksite -specific procedures is by developing a \"Job Safety Analysis (JSA)\". It describes a task in a step-by- step fashion, identifies associated hazards, and outlines proper controls that minimize the risk of injury or illness to the individual performing that task. Procedures for respirator use, care, cleaning, chemical cartridge change out schedules, maintenance, and inspection are to be included in the JSA. Employees must be trained on the JSA and the Work Unit's Hazards Management Plan. Employees must be cleared for respirator use prior to working in an area or assigned to a task that requires respiratory protection. SELECTION OF RESPIRATORS Respirators are selected by the applicable work unit with the guidance from the EHS Department while considering many factors including the nature of the hazard, the concentration of the contaminant to which an employee is exposed, extent of the hazard, regulatory requirements, work requirements and conditions, and the characteristics and limitations of available respirators. Respirators for Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) Atmospheres All oxygen -deficient atmospheres, less than 19.5% oxygen, are considered IDLH. The following respirators are to be used in IDLH atmospheres: \u007f A Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) used in the pressure -demand mode, certified by NIOSH for a minimum service life of thirty minutes, or \u007f A combination full facepiece pressure demand supplied -air respirator (SAR) with auxiliary self -contained air supply. \u007f Respirators provided only for escape from IDLH atmospheres are to be NIOSH -certified for escape from the atmosphere in Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 40 which they will be used. All employees who will be required to use an SCBA must be trained, tested, and certified prior to use. MEDICAL EVALUATIONS Using a respirator may place a physiological burden on employees, which varies with the type of respirator worn, the job and workplace conditions in which the respirator is used, and the medical status of the employee. Each employee assigned a respirator in carrying out his/her job responsibilities is to receive a medical evaluation to determine his/her ability to use a respirator, before being fit tested or required to use the respirator in the workplace. Medical evaluation procedures : Employees are to complete the medical questionnaire at the time of their medical examination at the Occupational Health Clinic. The medical staff will perform a medical evaluation of the ability of the employee to wear a respirator, conduct fit -testing, and determine the need for additional medical evaluations or restrictions on the use of respiratory protection devices. The medical questionnaire and examinations are administered confidentially during the employee's normal working hours or at a time and place convenient to the employee. Employees are encouraged to discuss the questionnaire and examination results with a member of the UEOHC medical staff. The following information must be provided to the clinic before a recommendation is made concerning an employee's ability to use a respirator: \u007f The type and weight of the respirator to be used by the employee; \u007f The duration and frequency of respirator use (in cluding use for rescue and escape); \u007f The expected physical work effort; \u007f Additional protective clothing and equipment to be worn; and \u007f Temperature and humidity extremes that may be encountered. Medical determination: The Occupational Health Clinic will Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 41 provide the employee and the employee's supervisor with a written recommendation regarding the employee's ability to use a respirator. The recommendation is to include the following information: \u007f Any limitations on respirator use related to the medical condition of the employee, or relating to the workplace conditions in which the respirator will be used, including whether or not the employee is medically able to use the respirator; \u007f The need, if any, for follow -up medical evaluations; and \u007f A statement that th e occupational health clinic has provided the employee with a copy of the written recommendation. Additional medical evaluations are provided if: \u007f An employee reports medical signs or symptoms that are related to the ability to use a respirator; \u007f The Occupational Health Clinic, supervisor, or the Department of Environment, Health and Safety determines that an employee needs to be reevaluated; \u007f Information from the respiratory protection program, including observations made during fit testing and progra m evaluation, indicates a need for employee reevaluation; or \u007f A change occurs in workplace conditions (e.g., physical work effort, protective clothing, temperature, etc.) that may result in a substantial increase in the physiological burden placed on an emp loyee. FIT TESTING PROCEDURES \u007f Employees using negative or positive pressure tight -fitting face piece respirators receive a quantitative fit test with the respirator that they will be using , to ensure an effective mask -to-face seal. \u007f Employees are fit tested prior to initial use of the respirator, or whenever a different respirator face piece (size, style, Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 42 model or make) is used, and at least annually thereafter e \u007f Employees are trained with the respirator they will be using prior to the fit- test. The employee must properly don his/her respirator before the fit- test without assistance in order to achieve an effective mask -to-face seal and to pass the fit- test with an acceptable fit -factor. \u007f An additional fit test is conducted whenever the employee, supervisor, the Department of Environment, Health and Safety, or the Occupational Health Clinic make visual observations of changes in the employee's physical condition that could affect respirator fit. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, facial scarring, dental changes, cosmetic surgery, or an obvious change in body weight. \u007f The employee may select a different respirator if he/she does not think the respirator fit is acceptable, even after passing the fit test. The employee will have to be re -fit tested if a different type, model, or manufacture of respirator is used. PROPER USE OF RESPIRATORS Face piece Seal Protection . Respirators will be used in accordance with specific procedures described in the manual provided by the respirator manufacturer. Respirators with tight - fitting face pieces are worn in a manner that does not interfere with the face piece seal. Employees with facial hair, or any other condition, that interferes with the sealing surface of the face piece and the face, or with valve function, are not permitted to wear tight fitting face pieces. Corrective glasses or goggles or other personal protective equipment is to be worn in a manner that does not interfere with the seal of the face piece to the face of the user. User Seal Check Procedures. For all tight-fitting respirators, employees are to perform a user seal check each time that the respirator is put on, before entering an area containing hazardous atmospheres, and periodically while wearing the respirator in the con taminated area. Both the positive and negative pressure checks listed below and/or the respirator Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 43 manufacturer's additional recommended user seal check method is to be used. Positive Pressure Check . Close off the exhalation valve and exhale gently into the face piece. The face fit is considered satisfactory if a slight positive pressure can be built up inside the face piece without any evidence of outward leakage of air at the seal. For most respirators this method of leak testing requires the wearer to first remove the exhalation valve cover before closing off the exhalation valve and then carefully replacing it after the test. Negative Pressure Check . Close off the inlet opening of the canister or cartridge(s) by covering with the palm of the hand(s) or by replacing the filter seal(s), inhale gently so that the face piece collapses slightly, and hold the breath for ten seconds. Although the respirators currently used by the University can be checked using the palm method, the design of the inlet opening of some cartridges cannot be effectively covered with the palm of the hand. The test can be performed by covering the inlet opening of the cartridge with a thin latex or nitrile glove. If the face piece remains in its slightly collapsed condition and no inwar d leakage of air is detected, the tightness of the respirator is considered satisfactory. Manufacturer's Recommended User Seal Check Procedures . The respirator manufacturer's recommended procedures for performing a user seal check may be used instead of the positive and/or negative pressure check procedures provided that the employer demonstrates that the manufacturer's procedures are equally effe ctive. Use of Powered- Air-Purifying of a powered- air purifying respirator uses a blower to force air through the air -purifying element. The advantage of using a PAPR is that it usually supplies air at a positive pressure, reducing inward leakage of contaminants when compared with non-powered air purifying respirators. Employees must ensure that the motor blower of the PAPR is providing the required airflow prior to operation or anytime a decrease in airflow is experienced to verif y that the PAPR is Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 44 providing the required airflow. To be certified as a PAPR by NIOSH, the blower must provide at least 170 Liters/Minute (6 cubic feet per minute (cfm)) to a loose- fitting face piece, helmet, or hood or 115 Liters/Minute (4 cfm) to a tight -fitting facepiece. To check the airflow prior to operation, the respirator manufacturer provides a device for verifying that the airflow exceeds these levels. The device includes a flow meter that can be attached to the respirator. Employees must read and understand the manufacturer instructions prior to use of the PAPR. Maintenance and airflow indicator tests should be included in your standard operating procedure and/or Job Safety Analysis for the operation of the PAPR for use for protection against air contaminants. Continuing Respirator Effectiveness . Supervisors are to maintain surveillance of the work area conditions and the degree of employee exposure or stress. When there is a change in work area conditions or degree of employee exposure or stress t hat may affect respirator effectiveness, the supervisor is to reevaluate the continued effectiveness of the respirator. The supervisor is to ensure that employees leave the respirator use area: \u007f To wash their faces and respirator face pieces as necessary to prevent eye or skin irritation associated with respirator use; or if they detect vapor or gas breakthrough, changes in breathing resistance, or leakage of the face piece; or \u007f To replace the respirator or the filter, cartridge, or canister elements. If the employee detects vapor or gas breakthrough, changes in breathing resistance, or leakage of the face piece, the respirator is to be replaced or repaired before the employee is allowed to return to the work area. MAINTENANCE AND CARE OF RESPIRATORS Cleaning and Disinfecting . Employees are provided with respirators that are clean, sanitary, and in good working order. Respirators are cleaned and disinfected using the following procedures, or equivalent procedures recommended by the respirator manufacturer. Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act.

BREATHING AIR QUALITY AND USE FOR ATMOSPHERE - SUPPLYING RESPIRATORS Compressed air, compressed oxygen, liquid air, and liquid oxygen used for respiration are to meet the United States Pharmacopoeia requirements for medical or breathing oxygen. Compressed breathing air is to meet at least the requirements for Type 1- Grade D breathing air described in ANSI/Compressed Gas Association Commodity Specification for Air, G -7.1-1989, to include: Oxygen content (v/v) of 19.5 -23.5%; hydrocarbon (condensed) content of 5 milligrams per cubic meter of air or less; Carbon monoxide (CO) content of 10 ppm or less; Carbon dioxide content of 1,000 ppm or less; and Lack of noticeable odor. Compressed oxygen is not to be used in atmosphere -supplying respirators that have previously used compressed air. Oxygen concentrations greater than 23.5% are to be used only in equipment designed for oxygen service or distribution. Cylinders used to supply breathing air to respirators are to meet the following requirements: \u007f Cylinders are tested and maintained as prescribed in the Shipping Container Specification Regulations of the Department of Transportation (49 CFR part 173 and part 178); \u007f Cylinders of purchased breathing air have a certificate of analysis from the supplier that the breathing air meets the requirements for Type 1 --Grade D breathing air; and \u007f The moisture content in the cylinder does not exceed a dew point of - 50\u00b0F ( -45.6\u00b0C) at 1 atmosphere pressure. Compressors used to supply breathing air to respirators are constructed and situated so as to: \u007f Prevent entry of contaminated air into the air -supply Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 49 system; \u007f Minimize moisture content so that the dew point at 1 atmosphere pressure is 10 degrees F (5.56\u00b0C) below the ambient temperature; \u007f Have suitable in- line air- purifying sorbent beds and filters to further ensure breathing air quality. Sorbent beds and filters are to be maintained and replaced or refurbished periodically following the manufacturer's instructions. \u007f Have a tag containing the most recent change date and the signature of the person authorized by the employer to perform the change. The tag is to be maintained at the compressor. For compressors that are not oil- lubricated, carbon monoxide levels in the breathing air are not to exceed 10 ppm. For oil-lubricated compressors, a high -temperature or carbon monoxide alarm, or both, to monitor carbon monoxide levels are to be used. If only high- temperature alarms are used, the air supply is to be monitored at intervals sufficient to prevent carbon monoxide in the breathing air from exceeding 10 ppm. Breathing air couplings are to be incompatible with outlets for non - respirable worksite air or other gas systems. No asphyxiating substances are to be introduced into breathing air lines. Only breathing gas containers marked in accordance with the NIOSH respirator certification standard, 42 CFR part 84 are to be used. RESPIRATOR TRAINING Employees are to be trained in the respiratory hazards to which they are potentially exposed during routine and emergency situations, and in the proper use of respirators, including putting on and removing them, any limitations on their use, and their maintenance. The training must be c omprehensive, understandable, and be prior to requiring the employee to use a respirator in the workplace. Retraining is to be administered annually, and when the following situations occur: \u007f Changes in the workplace or the type of respirator render previous training obsolete; \u007f Inadequacies in the employee's knowledge or use of the respirator indicate that the employee has not retained the requisite understanding or skill; OR, \u007f Any other situation arises in which retraining appears necessary to ensure safe respirator use. Each employee is Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act.

VOLUNTARY RESPIRATOR USE Respirators may be provided at the request of employees, or employees may use their own respirators, if such respirator use will not in itself create a hazard. OSHA requires that the voluntary use of respirators be controlled as strictly as if their use were required. The following requirements are made for the voluntary use of respirators: \u007f Medical determination that the employee is able to use the respirator; \u007f The respirator is to be cleaned, stored, and maintained so that its use does not present a health hazard to the user; and, \u007f Employees are provided a copy of Appendix D of OSHA 1910.134, \"Information for Employees Using Respirators When Not Required Under the Standard\". Exception: These requirements do not apply to the voluntary use of filtering face pieces (dust masks).

The medical evaluations and fit - testing results will be maintained in the Occupational Health Clinic medical records in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1020. This information will be made available upon request to regulatory agency inspectors or affected empl oyees. AIR PURIFYING RESPIRATOR CHEMICAL CARTRIDGE CHANGE OUT SCHEDULE Each Work Unit that uses half face or full face air purifying respirators equipped with chemical cartridges for protection against airborne hazards such as gasses and vapors (e.g. solv ent vapors) must implement a chemical cartridge change out schedule prior to the use of the respirator. EHS Department will assist in performing this task during scheduled workplace evaluations and inspections. EHS Staff will help implement a change schedu le for Work Units that use chemical cartridges that is based on objective information or data that will ensure that canisters and cartridges are changed before the end of their service life. The service life of a cartridge depends upon many factors, including; \u007f environmental conditions such as humidity, \u007f breathing rate of the respirator user, \u007f cartridge filtering capacity, and \u007f the amount of contaminants in the air. Detection of chemicals by taste, smell, or irritation is not acceptable indication to replace respirator chemical cartridges. An established change out schedule will help prevent \"break - through\" of the chemical cartridge and will prevent detection of chemicals by taste, smell, or irritation as a result of the overuse of a saturated cart ridge. EHS Department Staff will assist you develop chemical cartridge change out schedules upon request and during scheduled workplace evaluations. The OSHA Respiratory Protection e - tool/Respirator Change Schedule can be used to help establish acceptable chemical cartridge change schedules. CHAPTE Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.RFA C Business Plan- Appendix 52 Appendix A: Information for Employees Using Respirators When Not Required Under the Standard Respirators are an effective method of protection against designated hazards when properly selected and worn. Respirat or use is encouraged, even when exposures are below the exposure limit, to provide an additional level of comfort and protection for workers. However, if a respirator is used improperly or not kept clean, the respirator itself can become a hazard to the wo rker. Sometimes, workers may wear respirators to avoid exposures to hazards, even if the amount of hazardous substance does not exceed the limits set by OSHA standards. If your employer provides respirators for your voluntary use, of if you provide your own respirator, you need to take certain precautions to be sure that the respirator itself does not present a hazard. You should do the following: \u007f Read and heed all instructions provided by the manufacturer on use, maintenance, cleaning and care, and warnings regarding the respirators limitations. \u007f Choose respirators certified for use to protect against the contaminant of concern. NIOSH, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, certif ies respirators. A label or statement of certification should appear on the respirator or respirator packaging. It will tell you what the respirator is designed for and how much it will protect you. \u007f Do not wear your respirator into atmospheres containing contaminants for which your respirator is not designed to protect against. For example, a respirator designed to filter dust particles will not protect you against gases, vapors, or very small solid particles of fumes or smoke. \u007f Keep track of your respirator so that you do not mistakenly use someone else's respirator.

APPLIANCES AND EQUIPMENT Check appliances and equipment to make sure they are maintained in proper working order. Check electrical cords to make sure they are free from cracks and that the grounding prong is intact. If not, tag them as defective and remove them from service. PORTABLE SPACE HEATERS Electric space heaters are not permitted for use at Curaleaf. Automated External Defibrillator Policy Curaleaf and its EHS Department (EHS) are committed to the health and safety of its employees, contractors and visitors. An AED is used to urgently diagnose and treat ventricular fibrillation. An AED is attached to a victim's chest to assess the heart's rhythm. If appropriate, the device will recommend that a shock be delivered to resume a safe rhythm for the victim's heart. When delivered, a metered electrical charge restores the heart's functionality and often saves the victim's life. AEDs are most successful when their first shock is delivered within 3 -4 minutes of sudden cardiac arrest onset. Thus, it is important that AEDs are installed where they are most likely to be needed - and in highly visible, easily accessible locations - so that trained personnel can find and access them in a timely manner. Because of their ease of use and built -in safeguards, untrained bystanders have successfully used an AED, but they are intended for use by trained personnel [AED training offered by the A merican Red Cross and the American Heart Association includes recognition of cardiac arrest symptoms, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the proper use of an automated external defibrillator]. Because they are highly Employee Health and Safety PlanThis portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act.

The goal of this Policy is to ensure that AEDs installed at Curaleaf are safely maintained and used, and to promote training and easy access to installed AEDs. LIABILITY AND GOOD SAMARITAN LAWS Connecticut law allows for the use of an AED during an emergency for the purpose of attempting to save the life of another person who is, or who appears to be, in cardiac arrest. Accordingly, Connecticut law also expressly provides immunity from civil liability for those who obtain and maintain AEDs, and those who use such devices to attempt to save a life. Specifically : \u007f The person or entity that provides the cardiopulmonary resuscitation and AED training to a person using an AED. \u007f The person or entity responsible for the site where the AED is located when the unit has provided for a program of training. AED OWNER RESPONSIBILTIES Departments and other administrative units who acquire an AED (i.e., AED Owners) are responsible for maintaining the device to the standards of its manufacturer, the programmatic standards of the American Heart Association or the American Red Cross, and this Policy. AED owners must: \u007f Designate a person who is responsible for management of the AED (i.e., departmental responsible person). \u007f Ensure that inspections and maintenance is conducted in a timely manner and in accordance with written user and service manuals provided by the manufacturer. \u007f AED Owners are responsible for the purchase of batteries and other supplies. \u007f AED Owners are responsible for changing batteries, when indicated. \u007f Providing or arranging for training and refresher training in AED use for their staff, such that: \u007f Training is conducted in a timely manner and in accordance with written user and service manuals provided by the manufacturer.

As a family member, early on in her adult life she watched helplessly as her moth - er succumbed to the devastating effects of pancreatic cancer. This life changing experience was followed closely by a diagnosis of Stage IV Breast Cancer in her sister, who underwent treatment for over 10 years then lost her battle in early 2011. Her brother lived his life struggling with alcohol, substance abuse & diabetes until his death in 2008. As a healthcare provider, Eileen has witnessed her patients struggle with a host of side effects associated with their treatment protocols which \"greatly reduce their quality of life\". Her hospital nursing career runs the gamut, high-dose chemo - therapy with peripheral stem cell and/or bone marrow transplant rescue, palliative chemotherapy regimens, comfort care, research as well as administrative, working as the over-night supervisor of a 68-bed acute care hospital. Combining her personal and professional life experiences Eileen has found the un - stoppable calling to advocate for medical cannabis. She understands the need to live a happy and full life. Advocating for patients, seeing the whole person, not just an illness or a disease that needs to be treated, is what a nurse does best. Eileen believes in the healing pers that cannabis can provide to those in need. Since 2008, Eileen has been speaking out and advocating for medical cannabis, \"Every single day that I work I meet at least one patient who would benefit from medical cannabis.\" Eileen has spoken at legislative hearings, privately with state legislators throughout the country, attended and spoken at various press conference and town hall type meetings. Close to home, with the passage of Connecticut's medical marijuana legislation in 2012, she was a founding member and Executive Director of the Con - necticut Cannabis Business Alliance, a trade association created for the industry by the industry to promote Education, Best Practices and Industry Standards. She is the Founder of Olive's Branch, a patient advocacy organization working to bring healthcare back to its roots; educating healthcare providers, patients and the general public about the benefits of cannabis. Eileen is currently focusing all of her energies to acquiring a medical cannabis production license under the highly regulated Connecticut model.

He is one of the top horticultural scientists in the United States and has proven himself time and again as one of the leading experts in the cultivation of naturopathic and botanical medicaments. Jason is an expert in the sequencing of hybrid cannabis taxa and variants. He was awarded the prestigious Cannabis Cup, specifically to entries of cannabidiol (CBD) producing phenotypes. Jason Cranford's award winning specimen was an organically produced canna - bis phenotype, hybridized over a three year period and tested with a certificate of analysis recording the highest yielding organic CBD (cannabidiol) yield known to date at over 34%. Jason's has extensive experience in the design, construction, operation and estab - lishment of agricultural farms, including the cultivation of organic, non-pesticide medical cannabis. He is also a seasoned owner and operator of a large scale pro - duction and dispensary facility in Colorado named Rifle Mountain. Jason is the inventor of Cannatol, a phyto-medical compound, derived principally from a highly standardized, consistent and high yielding organic cannabidiol phyto stock, free from pesticide and mold contaminates.

New Jersey was the first state to enact highly regulated regulations including strong governmental oversight. Greenleaf Compassion Center was the only ATC able to pass the rigorous and extremely re - strictive Department of Health requirements. In his role as CEO and President, Joseph took a hand's on approach to building the organization and personally planned, implemented, and participated on a daily basis in all aspects of the cultivation facility. He has several years' experience cultivating pharmaceutical grade marijuana from seed to sale. The product is required to be State laboratory tested for heavy metals, microbiological contami - nants, mycotoxins, and pesticides. All of Greenleaf's harvests passed these tests without issue. Joseph designed a hybrid soil/hydroponic 5000 sq. foot facility utilizing high pres - sure sodium lighting. Plant nourishment is exclusively organic. The grow contains only female plants and mother plants are consistently maintained for cloning to ensure consistent, quality production. Joseph worked directly with the Department of Health and the State laboratory to establish testing procedures that would guarantee safe and organic patient medi - cation. Joseph is also working with Applied Separations, one of the world's leading man - ufacturers of carbon dioxide extraction machinery. Together, they are working on processes to extract cannabinoids from marijuana plants to create pharmaceuti - cal grade products such as gel caps, lozenges, and inhalers. This is new to the medical marijuana industry in that the extraction process is chemical and solvent free, leaving no harmful residues. Of significant importance is the ability to create product with standardized dosage. This will be the first opportunity for patients to have access to products in forms other than dried product, that must be smoked, in which they can be confident they are ingesting a consistent dosage each and every time. Once Curaleaf is awarded their license, this technology will be im - plemented at Curaleaf to ensure a quick implementation of safe products to the patients of Connecticut.

(ASI) has been a leader in Supercritical Fluid Technology (SFT) for over 20 years. They are leading the charge in making Supercritical Fluids a growing part of the conversation on green chemistry. What used to be a technol - ogy intended for extractions of things like caffeine from coffee can now be applied in dozens of areas, including aerogels, metal injection molding, medical implant cleaning and artifact restoration. Curaleaf has partnered with Applied Separation to fulfill its commitment to the medical and patient community to provide standardized dose products. Applied will supply the equipment and intellectual property necessary to perform quantitatively and qualitatively accurate extractions and infusions. Through our affiliation with Applied Separation, Curaleaf will use super critical fluid extraction and impregnation methods that revolutionize the industry. These processes allow Curaleaf to extract more active compound from the plant than the standard in the industry, meaning we require less raw material to produce our product line. In addition we can efficiently and uniformly infuse that extract into any product, even the raw material itself, resulting in a higher concentration of medicinal prod - uct. This process can reduce the cost of production, by requiring less plant material to create Marijuana Infused Prodcuts. In addition, in terms of raw material, the patient who is smoking as a method of consumption can smoke lessproduct to get the desired dosage, thus reducing the effects of the products of combustion on the patient's lungs.

This section briefly summarizes Curaleaf's basic approach to our charitable missions, but it should be understood that our board of directors will be refining our charitable programs on an ongoing basis in response to our experiences and evolving patient and community needs. An important aspect of our patient care mission is our commitment to increase access to medical cannabis for those who are medically underserved. Most immediately, we recognize that people with chronic or terminal illness often have limited financial means frequently made worse by the loss of ability to work and the expenditure of income on expensive medical or custodial care. While we will continually refine the administration of the program, the financial commitment is secure and is an integral part of our pro forma. Primary focus areas: R educing the cost of our medicine and expanding our indigent care pro - gram I nvesting in our research and development program D eveloping and expanding our charitable and philanthropic programs P roviding additional worker and patient education and training. O ffering more free healthcare services to patients.OverviewCompassionate Need PlanRFA I Bonus This portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.Financial Commitment 2Unlike most charitable contribution plans, Curaleaf will commit funding to the com - passionate need program based on sales, rather than based on profits. We did this to ensure that the funds are available to the program and will persist into the future. Specifically, 1% of sales, with no cap, is budgeted to support a compassionate need program. Compassionate Need Plan Educate Insurance Carriers Access issues for medical cannabis are especially pronounced because cannabis is currently a self-pay medication. Neither public nor commercial insurers provide any subsidies or reimbursements to patients electing to use this medicine. With our board's experience in the health care industry, we expect to bring forth research that may persuade third-party payers to reimburse patients using medical canna - bis for conditions for which it has been shown to be clinically efficacious, safe and cost effective in comparison to alternative therapies.RFA I Bonus This portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act.

We expect to pro - mote the role of the Pharmacist from the traditional role of dispenser, to the role of a pharmaceutical care provider, and that this will result in the overall reduction of healthcare costs through the reduction of polypharmacy and medication errors.

This Committee will be chaired by Eileen Konieczny, RN, Chief Medical Officer of Curaleaf and Board Member of the American Cannabis Nurses Association. Eileen's history of patient care and her background as founder of the patient edu - cation organization, Olive's Branch, makes her the ideal leader for this committee. As committee chair, Eileen will forward the compassionate need program by draw - ing on her local network of patient support groups for qualifying conditions, char - ities for qualifying conditions and any other platforms that can reach the patient populations most in need of free or discounted medicine to ease their suffering. The goal of the committee is thus to create more avenues than solely the dispen - saries in order to reach a wider spectrum of patients eligible for the compassion - ate need program. Compassionate Need Plan Patient Eligibility and Discounts Available We anticipate the ability to provide product at low or no cost to those patients with financial need. Patients will be pre-qualified for this program during an interview process using a form similar to the one below. The income levels are currently based on Federal Poverty Levels and subject to revision as new information be - comes available. For those patients with limited financial ability to purchase medical marijuana, we will offer a low-cost and a no-cost program, subject to approval. Each patient that requests participation in the low-cost or no-cost program will be required to complete the application below.

The facility is the former world headquarters of Ensign Bickford Aerospace & Defense, a global leader of precision energetics systems and innovative explosive solutions. The high tech production and secu - rity requirements of that business translate into a well equipped structure for the manufacture of medical marijuana. The Simsbury facility is exactly the right size to support our first two phases of production; it has installed clean room technol - ogy that can be re-commissioned and put to service quickly and effectively; it has extensive power and HVAC systems, industrial chillers and an inherently secure design and location. The building layout and height is well suited; and its excess parking area (see item 2 below) is ideally situated and oriented to support a poten - tial phase three development of a solar powered greenhouse growing operation. All of this can be achieved with a minimum amount of remodeling waste generation or disruption of the established neighborhood.\"Fitting Out\" an Existing BuildingRFA I Bonus This portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act. For a full rational please see cover page.The northern portion of the building is most suited to creating a naturally illuminat - ed growing space because the roof is lower over that area, and it is out beyond the shadowing of the higher portion of the roof to the south. It is anticipated that the 12 hour growing cycle for the flowering phase best matches the daylight availabil - ity, particularly during spring and summer. Putting the most intensive (Flowering Room) growing under natural light for the summer will greatly diminish the huge internal heat gain caused by artificial lighting during that period when the excess heat is unable to be diverted to space or ventilation air heating. It will also reduce the electric power demand during the period of peak utility demand. Curaleaf has also explored the possibility of a potential phase three development of a solar powered greenhouse growing operation as the site has an ideal location for such a structure. The existing flat roof replaced with vaulted skylight assemblies \u2014 either butted tight for a full coverage or spaced for partial coverage. Each assembly has a mech - anized black shade built in.Maximize the Use of Direct Sunlight in a Secure, Naturally Illuminated Production Facility 2Environmental Plan W e are not aware of any more efficient or effective lighting choices than the high-pressure sodium for the flower room (at 130 - 150 lumens per watt), or high output linear fluorescent fixtures in the Veg and Mother rooms (at 110 - 120 lumens per watt). F or the T5 linear fluorescent lamps, use the ultra low mercury products such as those produced by Phillips. L ED lighting shows promise, but is not yet at a stage where it can outper - form these currently conventional light sources. B ut to make sure that the production processes are keeping up with the rapid advances in lighting technology \u2014 particularly in LED and induction lighting, we will dedicate a portion of the growing area for research and development of growing practices using these cutting edge technologies and when we have understood their full potential and how to maximize their growing potential we will progressively upgrade our production lightingWhere Artificial Lighting is Used, Make this the Most Efficient and Effective Technology Available.

A t periods of maximum \"bio-climatic stress\" using imported bottled CO2 operation to reduce or eliminate the need for flushing in exterior air when the outdoor air is either too cold for the waste heat from the lighting to suf - ficiently temper the in-coming air, or too humid for the enthalpic recovery to reduce humidity to a production-optimal level. Improve ventilation effectiveness: U se point source extraction from enclosing hoods above the pair of lights at each grow table. R eorganize (or replace) the ventilation ducting to created a \"displacement\" ventilation mode of operation. Cool outdoor air is introduced at floor level and the exhaust is removed via a ceiling plenum \u2014 this is a development of the above strategy.Ventilation 3Environmental PlanRFA I Bonus This portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act.

The result is that approximately 20+% of the roof is shaded beyond what would acceptable for a PV installation. This leaves roughly 30,000 sq. ft. of roof plane suitably irradiated. The area required to generate sufficient elec - tricity to cover the entire annual electrical requirement would be approximately \u2014(producing 500,000\u00b1 kWh per year at 15W per sq. ft. each installed watt generating 1.2 kWh per year) \u2014 28,000 sq. ft. which is a close match to the useful roof area available.Pv's For On-Site Generation Of Electricity 5Environmental Plan Rainwater has a more desirable chemistry for growing than does the treated water from the municipal source, so there is some incentive to collect rainwater harvest - ed from the roof. On a flat roofed building such is the Ensign Bickford building collection is easy \u2014 it simply requires tapping one or more of the internal rainwater leader pipes that pass down through the building interior. Rainwater would flow by gravity to a cistern (approximately 5,000 gallons) located on a reinforced concrete pad over the existing slab inside the building. There would be modest filtration af - ter a \"first flush\" diversion to jettison leaf debris and coarse particulates. Overflow can be directed to the small irrigation demand of the landscape immediately adja - cent to the building. This system would reduce the draw from municipal water to a very small demand level \u2014 really only potable water is for the bathrooms, showers, and kitchenette. Again this collection process helps to reduce the carbon footprint of the entire operation as well as reduce storm water runoff.Rainwater CollectionRFA I Bonus This portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act.

Ecological services derived include soil forming and conditioning, soil stabilization, waste recycling, carbon sequestration, nutrients cycling, predation, pollination and habitats. By opting for organic farming it promotes a less polluting agricultural system. The hidden costs of agriculture to the environment in terms of natural resource degradation are reduced. Organic agriculture considers the medium- and long-term effect of agricultural in - terventions on the agro-ecosystem.

Cultivation and production(Nutrient, pest & disease management) of crops by inorganic chemical inputs Against Nature In chemically managed soil, the plant nutrients are supplied only through inorganic source, without any organic carbon source to derive food. This ultimately deprives the soil-eco system of the growth medium Blocks The Microbial Activity Due to the absence of carbon source, microbial population trends to be less or sometimes NIL in soil Soil structure is destroyed Non-availability of binding material of the soil particles result in disintegra - tion and reduce the soil granulation. In the long run it may reduce the pro - ductive capacity of land to harbor the crops & become unfit for production Soil becomes dead While chemical farming satisfies only the crop nutrient requirements, it is not conducive for biological environment of the soil, finally resulting in a prob - lematic soil loaded with inorganic salts Alters the soil pH Continuous use of inorganic chemicals leads to changes in the pH of the soil (either acidic or saline depending on the type of fertilizer used). It unbalanc - es the nutrient availability status and in some cases creates toxicity to the plantsSoil Differences 8Environmental Plan Organic Farming What is it?

The soil microbes derive the food from the carbaneous source and multiply and make the soil lively, also decomposing the complex organic compounds present in the added organics Soil structure improves Stable organic resins (humus) resulting from organic residue decomposition imparts stability to soil aggregates and corrects the permeability i.e., crumb like structure. This structure facilitates to improve soil aeration, water holding capacity, root penetration, while reduc - ing the soil erosion by b aggregation of soil particles Soils become fertile Here the biological property of the soil is improved by addition of organic manure. Intensive biological activity promotes better symbiotic relationship between plant and the soil focusing on sustainable plant production and nutrient management. Buffering of soils (Enables neutral pH) Presence of colloidal matter improves the buffering capacity of the soil and Cation Exchanging Capacity.

For a full rational please see cover page.Nutrients are available only for shorter period Certain fertilizers in the absence of microbes permanently fix on to the soil particles and may not be available for plant root absorption. In addition, the chemical fertilizers are easily water soluble and this may lead to various types of losses through leaching, evaporation, etc. Leads to erosion Absence of binding agents (organic substances) between soil particles makes the soil particles to be easily detached by water and wind. It leads to loss of top fertile soils ultimately making the land barren and unfit for farming/cultivation Accumulation of hazardous material in soilOver and abuse of chemical fertilizers (nitrate) & pesticides harm the bio - logical life of the soil. The residues such as heavy metals present in the inorganic soils may pose serious health hazards. Excessive nutrient & salt application such as nitrate, caus - es ground water pollution, & may be linked to certain diseases in human beingsSoil Differences(continued) 9Environmental Plan Nutrients available for longer period Microbes decompose the complex organic compounds to mineral com - ponents and CO2. Further the mineral elements are converted in to available plant nutrients through mineraliza - tion process. These ions are held by organic matter and soil colloids and are slowly released as nutrients over a longer period. Prevents the soil erosion Organic soil management techniques such as organic fertilization, mulching and cover cropping increases aggre - gation (by organic acid), improves soil structure and therefore increase the soil's water infiltration and retention capacity, substantially reducing the risk of erosion There is no hazardous material in soil It doesn't leave any residues/ hazard - ous material in the soil since all input is biodegradable & non-toxicRFA I Bonus This portion of the RFA is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act.
