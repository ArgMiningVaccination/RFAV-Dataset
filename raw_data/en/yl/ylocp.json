Talk with either of these national experts and you'll find their optimism contagious. \"Someone is going to cure Alzheimer's disease,\" says Dr. Swerdlow. \"We think it would be great if it was us. Even if we're not the ones who find the cure, we're going to make an important contribution to reaching that goal.\" KU ADC programs include research and direct care. The research division brings the latest clinical trials to KC and tests the newest medicines. The KU ADC Memory Care Clinic provides patient and family care, from diagnosis through treatment. \"The clinic gives me insights into the lab, and the lab gives me insights back into the clinic,\" says Dr. Swerdlow. \"Most of my colleagues in this field are doing one or the other, so seeing patients in the clinic gives me a unique perspective as a physician-scientist.\" According to Dr. Burns, gaining that \"labs to life\" perspective is a true advantage. \"It's important for our researchers to see patients who are living with Alzheimer's, so we can better understand the impact and see how the disease plays out in people,\" he says. \"We're not just working with test tubes and petri dishes. We're working on how to deliver better patient care.\"KC Proud: Life-Changing Research, Game-Changing Results How do you break down food and transform it into energy? Could that process-including the food involved-impact Alzheimer's disease? Researchers at the KU ADC believe there is a connection between diet, metabolism, and memory. \"We're trying to understand what is wrong with the brain energy metabolism in Alzheimer's, and why it has gone wrong,\" says Dr. Swerdlow. \"What are the consequences and how can we fix the problem?\" The Center's metabolism research includes studies on mitochondria, the powerhouse of our cells and tissues-including the brain. Mitochondria produce the energy necessary to move and think. Because the brain uses about 20% of the energy we make per day, good mitochondrial function is critical to a healthy brain. Our researchers are studying how changes to mitochondria may increase or decrease the risk of Alzheimer's disease. 2004 DR. JEFF BURNS ESTABLISHES THE KU ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH PROGRAM. Nestled away in Fairway, Kan., the KU Alzheimer's Disease Center has been something of a hidden gem in the Kansas City metro area. No more. With studies that are making a difference and researchers respected worldwide, the KU ADC is stepping into the spotlight. 2011 THE KU PROGRAM IS DESIGNATED AS ONE OF ONLY 31 NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE CENTERS IN THE COUNTRY. 2016 NIH RENEWS KU ADC STATUS AND FUNDING THROUGH 2021.20??

Will we have that cure in the next five years? Maybe not. In 15 years? \"Fifteen years down the road, we may well be spotting the changes of Alzheimer's before the onset of memory problems, and have interventions that postpone or prevent, reduce or stop, those changes,\" says Dr. Burns. \"Will we have a cure in 15 years? I don't know. I do know this: We will get there. I'm confident the day will come when doctors recognize the disease years before onset, and in time to start new and effective drugs. It's no longer a question of if we will be able to do this, it is a matter of when.\" Dr. Burns says Alzheimer's is both the most feared disease and the costliest disease. But, he adds, there's hope. \"We are empowered today, in ways that we weren't a few years ago. We can diagnose Alzheimer's and we can treat it. We have treatments that do help, and we are pushing hard to develop new drugs. \"We're also making progress with the care we provide. We've improved the delivery of care, and are better able to help families. We're talking about prevention, and we've come a long way in understanding the importance of lifestyle.\" In addition, Dr. Burns says, having the KU ADC in the metro area gives local and regional residents the rare opportunity to be part of the research that drives hope. CURING ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE:: No Longer a Question of If, but When DR. JEFFREY M. BURNS mD, ms Co-DireCtor, KU ADC You might think that a doctor who is immersed, day after day, in the world of Alzheimer's disease \u2014a man who has seen what this disease does to friends, family, and patients \u2014might be weary. You'd be wrong. Dr. Jeff Burns, a Kansas City native and co-director of the KU ADC, radiates energy and optimism. Dr. Burns attended the University of Kansas School of Medicine and completed his residency in neurology at the University of Virginia, a post-doctoral fellowship at the Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Washington University in St. Louis, and a master's of science in clinical research at the University of Kansas. He returned to Kansas City in 2004 to start the Alzheimer's disease clinical research program, designated as an Alzheimer's Disease Center in 2011. His research supports clinical trials testing new approaches to treating Alzheimer's disease, and a variety of research programs focused on how lifestyle issues, such as diet and exercise, can be used to prevent or delay onset. Our research is a community and team effort. There is hope and there are things you can do. You are empowered. Join a study.

Postponing memory changes for ve years will cut the incidence by 50 % / 6 / IMAGINE :: YOUR BRAIN HEALTH GUIDE / KU ADC / 2020 What's the difference between Alzheimer's disease and dementia? Dementia covers Alzheimer's disease and other conditions. It is an umbrella term used to describe memory loss and other cognitive decline that impacts daily life and activities. Alzheimer's is by far the most common type of dementia. Other types of dementia include: dementia with Lewy bodies; frontotemporal dementia; dementia. Am I at risk? Alzheimer's can strike anyone. Age is a major risk factor, along with family history and heredity. If you had a parent or sibling with Alzheimer's, you are in a higher risk group, but that does not mean a diagnosis is inevitable.There's a common misperception that Alzheimer's only targets the elderly. Not so. Some 640,000 Americans have early-onset dementia, most commonly related to Alzheimer's disease. An early- onset diagnosis is reached when the patient is younger than 65. Can I do anything to reduce my risks? Good news! Simple steps such as eating well and exercising regularly are proving effective. Check out our Super Six steps. SEE PAGE 11 What can I do if I'm concerned about my memory lapses or a loved one's behavior? We all forget things now and then, and it's not unusual to wonder if memory lapses are related to dementia. Review the warning signs. SEE PAGE 12 If even subtle memory changes are causing concern, don't assume it's a natural part of aging; it could be a sign of mild cognitive impairment, changes that sometimes precede more serious decline. The first step is to talk with your doctor. The KU ADC also offers research evaluations for mild cognitive impairment, and we have a number of studies underway in this area. Call 913-588-0555 for more information or to schedule an appointment. Why would I want to know the reason for memory changes? First of all, while Alzheimer's might be your biggest concern, people experience memory changes for numerous reasons, including: mild cognitive impairment, depression, medication issues, low vitamin B levels, and poor sleep patterns. Identifying and addressing the primary reason is important. If the memory changes are connected to Alzheimer's, the earlier you receive a diagnosis, the earlier treatment can begin. Current Alzheimer's treatments can slow the progression of dementia symptoms, and proper support and care navigation can improve life for patients and those who care about them. In addition, early diagnosis may open the door to participation in a research study that could benefit you, your loved ones, and countless others.

W e're All IN THIS TOGETHERBRAIN HEALTHY HABIT S: THE SUPER SIX Bob Deady Bob Deady's first KU ADC research study tested the theory that exercise helps memory. His initial connection grew into volunteer work at the KU ADC; Deady also continues to participate in studies. \"I'm happy to do it and be part of something so important. We need more people to step up for research. The only way to slow down onset or make a cure or treatment is to have lots of people in these studies. And the studies they're doing at the KU ADC are some of the best in the world. \"The studies point out that it's important to do new things. People tell me, 'I do the crossword every day!' And I tell them, 'Then let your husband do the crossword and you do the Sudoku. And don't do that Sudoku at your kitchen table. Go across the street and do it with your neighbor. The social interaction will be good for your brain. \"Risk reduction makes a difference. If you were to get Alzheimer's at 84 and you can delay that through lifestyle changes to 86 or even 90, well, statistically, that's almost like a cure.\"Lois Edmiston Lois Edmiston is a LEAP! champion. She first joined the KU ADC's Lifestyle Empowerment for Alzheimer's Prevention program in Fall 2017. She's now preparing to be a LEAP! facilitator. \"I love LEAP!. I felt like I had a good food plan going on before, but I realized it was really mediocre, so I made improvements. I was also doing some exercising, but with LEAP! I zeroed in on exercises and physical activities that are good for brain health. The LEAP! module that is the toughest, for me, is finding good ways to manage stress and taking the time to do so. \"My sleep habits have also changed dramatically. I work at having a good sleep routine-no computer or iPhone before bed. Maybe some reading or a bath. And I try to go to bed at the same time every night and get up at the same time every morning.\" Edmiston's LEAP! experience gives her a fresh perspective to share with people facing a difficult diagnosis. \"There is hope.

While it's common to forget something occasionally and remember it later, watch out for: \u2014MEMORY LOSS THAT CREATES CHALLENGES IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE such as frequently forgetting appointments or special dates like birthdays that you or your loved one always used to remember. When a person has trouble making decisions that would have been easy before, that's a warning sign. \u2014REPEATING THE SAME INFORMATION OVER AND OVER AGAIN or asking others to repeat something frequently. \u2014UNUSUAL JUDGMENT PROBLEMS such as making poor financial decisions, like giving money to online scams or unfamiliar telemarketers. \u2014CHALLENGES WITH FAMILIAR TASKS OR TROUBLE LEARNING NEW ONES can indicate an issue. If driving to the neighborhood grocery store or balancing a checkbook suddenly becomes difficult, that's a concerning change. \u2014LESS INTEREST IN PEOPLE, PLACES, AND ACTIVITIES that have mattered before, such as withdrawing from family events, hobbies, or work-related functions. \u2014PERSONALITY AND MOOD CHANGES such as becoming easily confused, anxious, or upset. Depression and fearfulness are also warning signs. \u2014DIFFICULTY FINDING THE RIGHT WORDS TO USE in a conversation, especially if the person is typically well-spoken.

W orried Well _or_ Concerning Changes? Once we reach a certain age, it's understandable if misplacing our car keys or forgetting why we walked into a room sets off internal alarm bells. The \"worried well\" are people who worry that their forgetfulness is an indication of Alzheimer's, when it's not.

What does a cure look like? We want to take what's not working, and make it work again. That's what the cure looks like. When what's taking down the brain is no longer taking down the brain. When what wasn't working, now works. When people hold onto what they have. That means we have to identify what's gone wrong, and figure out how to reverse it. The brain is like a set of fuses in a fuse box. With Alzheimer's, the fuses get screwed up. If we can restore them to the way they should be, that would be a cure to me. For the patient? They're able to do whatever they could do, and count on being able to do the same things just as well in the future. I don't have Alzheimer's, so why should I get involved in research? The question is: Why not be part of it? If you don't have Alzheimer's now, you may in the future. If you don't know someone who has it now, you may in the future. Figuring out the cause and finding the cure can be a rewarding journey, and we can't do it alone.Why is finding a cure so difficult? Many reasons, including a very basic one: Finding a cure requires us to take a new approach. What are we good at with medicine? Destroy and remove. Antibiotics can cure strep. Chemotherapy can kill cancer cells. If something is broken, we can cut it out. Alzheimer's is a fundamentally different problem. We're not going to fix it by finishing off what's damaged. We actually have to repair it. Answering the Big Questions by DR. RUSSELL SWERDLOW , mD DireCtor, KU ADC At the KU ADC, we want to cure Alzheimer's disease. That requires tremendous resources and infrastructure: You have to start small and build the infrastructure. That's exactly what we've done here. We're now part of the National Institutes of Health, and the importance of that can't be over-stated. The NIH has identified the KU ADC as a place where people hope the answer may be found. Our Center collaborates with other NIH Alzheimer's Disease Centers across the country, and our investigators collaborate with other investigators worldwide. We also work with physicians, patients, community leaders, and caregivers. This is a process, and it takes a village. It takes finances, intellect, and resources. It requires active stakeholders who embark on the journey with us. Dr. Swerdlow received his undergraduate and doctor of medicine degrees from New York University, and trained as a neurologist and Alzheimer's specialist at the University of Virginia. In addition to his work at the KU ADC, he is a professor in the Departments of Neurology, Molecular and Integrative Physiology, and Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Kansas School of Medicine and is active nationally on Alzheimer's and aging issues. Dr. Swerdlow's research focuses on brain energy metabolism, the role brain energy metabolism plays in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, and how to manipulate brain energy metabolism. I bought this bag the week I graduated from medical school. I carried my tools in there on house calls. It cost $75-all I had at the time. I still carry it with me every Wednesday to the clinic. I keep my cognition testing tools in there now. And, just in case I need a 24th century consultation, I take along Dr. McCoy from Star Trek. In all seriousness, whatever it takes, I want to figure things out and solve this. Am I hopeful? Yes. This isn't the biggest challenge mankind has had to overcome. If the will is there, we will solve this. HISTORY TELLS US: PROBLEMS GET SOLVED.''

She shares everything from basic information on Alzheimer's disease to brain-healthy recipes during her presentations at churches and other metro area sites. \"In the African-American community, there's a feeling that memory loss is a normal part of aging: This is what God wanted, so let it be,\" she says. \"Due to historical research events, there's a mistrust in research institutions which has impacted participation in research in the African-American community; people tell me they don't want to be a lab rat.\" Shaw says she explains the ethical and legal changes made to protect study participants throughout the U.S. and clarifies the value of participating with the KU ADC. \"Being involved in research helps the African-American community as a whole. We need more African Americans in clinical trials to ensure that the discoveries, treatments, interventions, and prevention strategies are going to be relevant to our community,\" Shaw says. \"My role is to ensure that we are including our community so that when we do find a cure and make advancements in prevention and intervention strategies they are for everyone; everyone will be able to benefit.\" Howard Pace, a longtime pastor in the African-American community, became involved with the KU ADC after his wife Pearl was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. He encourages everyone to \"get involved and help somebody else. Don't be fearful of it.\" \"People should be concerned- this disease affects everyone. It doesn't have a color to it,\" Pace says. \"The people at the Memory Care Clinic feel like family. They want what's best for us. We're there to be a part and help others for the future, but it has been a blessing to us, also.\"FROM THE DAY WE OPENED OUR DOORS... KU ADC has been an inclusive environment, dedicated to eliminating disparities in knowledge, treatment, and prevention. Alzheimer's disease impacts everyone\u2014 and everyone can help us find a cure. Dr. Shaw earned her Ph.D. in nursing, a master's degree in public health, and a bachelor's degree in nutrition and exercise physiology at the University of Missouri. Her main research interest areas include dementia prevention through culturally tailored dietary interventions, racial and ethnic health disparities in Alzheimer's disease, faith-based prevention and intervention programs, and health promotion in the African- American community. As a postdoctoral fellow, she leads the African- American outreach and education efforts at the KU ADC and the African-American Cohort, in which she recruits and conducts clinical dementia assessments.CARING SPIRIT:: Pearl Pace is also supported by her daughter, Cecille Swan. Since her mom was diagnosed several years ago, Swan has become both a caregiver and study partner. \"You can feel kind of lost when you get a diagnosis of Alzheimer's, and you don't know where to go,\" Swan says. \"The clinic has been a wonderful support system. Beyond getting the diagnosis, they've helped teach us how to care for someone with Alzheimer's. It's a difficult process, but the clinic is like a family. \"Everyone there really cares about people,\" she says. \"It's not just about the research and getting samples. Every person we've dealt with at the clinic really has a caring spirit.\" \"I'm hoping there's a cure for my mom.

As a computer programmer and a pastor, she was known for her \"really sharp\" memory. Her family wondered what was wrong when she couldn't balance her checking account. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was an explanation, and the start of a new journey. \"At first I thought, 'Whoo!

Dr. Perales received his doctorate in biomedicine and a master's degree in public health at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona. He has conducted research in Spain, England, and the United States, and has collaborated with many international teams. His primary interest is understanding and reducing dementia disparities among Latinos and other vulnerable groups through intervention and epidemiological research. He has led the development of a dementia educational and recruitment tool for Latinos (Envejecimiento Digno) to increase Latinos' dementia literacy and representation in research. He has studied the risk of dementia and mild cognitive impairment among sexual and ethno-racial minorities. \u2014MAKE PLANS EARLY ON. Making financial and legal plans as soon after diagnosis as possible helps patients participate in that process. Y ou'll know what your loved one wants. \u2014LEARN AS YOU GO. There are different stages of Alzheimer's. Trying to comprehend it all at once can be overwhelming, and no one can predict the future. Take it step by step. \u2014ASK FOR HELP. Y ou are not in this alone. There are support groups and other valuable resources in the KC metro area. If you wonder where to start, call the KU ADC and ask to speak with one of our social workers. \u2014ACCEPT WHAT YOU CAN'T CHANGE. It can be a challenge to accept the changes you see in a loved one, but insisting that someone \"must remember\" something isn't helpful-to the person or you. \u2014DON'T MISS THE GOOD MOMENTS. Even though things are changing, and they are different than you want them to be, there are still moments that you can enjoy. Try not to get lost in a comparison of what was. \u2014VISIT YOUR DOCTOR. Make your annual check-up a priority and schedule other appointments when needed. Stress and exhaustion are real health dangers. If you're losing weight, not sleeping well, or experiencing other symptoms, call your doctor. \u2014GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK. Caregiving is hard. Be nice to yourself: Make arrangements for someone else to provide care, so you can take a day off. Forgive yourself for any \"mistakes\" you make. Find time, every day, for something you enjoy. HOW TO BE A... Healthy Caregiver The first person to be cured will be a research participant.'' IMAGINE THAT SOME FATS, INCLUDING THOSE OFTEN INCLUDED IN LATINO MEALS, ARE BRAIN-HEALTHY. Avocados are on the good list, so enjoy! While every situation is unique, caregiving stress is universal. Managing life when a loved one has Alzheimer's disease can be overwhelming. If you're in this position, it's essential to take care of yourself. You need to be in good shape to help your family. And remember: you matter, too. / 20 / IMAGINE :: YOUR BRAIN HEALTH GUIDE / KU ADC / 2020 Join MyAlliance for Brain Health WWW.KUMC.EDU/KUADC/ Special invitations to webinars and other events/ Tips on eating, exercise, and lifestyle/ Caregiver advice and suppo rt/ Useful information, customized to your needs/ Easy access to research study opportunitiesMyALLIANCE FOR BRAIN HEALTH Change the future.

YOUR ANNUAL WELLNESS VISIT SHOULD INCLUDE SOME TYPE OF COGNITION TESTING. KU ADC / 2020 / IMAGINE :: YOUR BRAIN HEALTH GUIDE / 23 /MICHELLE NIEDENS, lsCsw, a clinical social worker, longtime aging advocate, and director of the Cognitive Care Network, says better tools and well-trained healthcare providers make a world of difference. \"Without the right tools and training, providers may ask a patient, 'Are you worried about your memory? Are you having any problems?'\" Niedens says. \"The answer often is, 'No.' While the person may not be having any problems that interfere in day-to-day life, they may indeed be experiencing cognitive changes.\" Doctors miss an estimated 70% of early-stage Alzheimer's cases. The Cognitive Care Network supports an earlier diagnosis, so patients and families receive essential support sooner. \"I know of a woman in her mid-60s in rural Kansas, with a bubbly personality, articulate, still working,\" Niedens says. \"She told two different providers that she was having problems, and that she and her husband thought she might have Alzheimer's or some issue. Both times, she was told she was fine. There was no further evaluation. \"She told a third provider, one who is participating in the Cognitive Care Network. He used an early-stage screening tool that triggered a concern. Then, he did a full dementia evaluation, and she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.\" The woman's response? Relief. \"She knew something was wrong,\" Niedens says. \"The diagnosis allowed her to make informed decisions. She could start on medication and on a wellness plan, including exercise. She was able to include her children in a dialogue and planning. And she is interested in participating in research.SPREADING THE WORD:: Cognitive Care Network Should the medical care you receive for Alzheimer's or other dementias depend on where you live? We don't think so. And we're doing something about that. To increase access and support across Kansas, the KU ADC launched the Cognitive Care Network in 2019, a program that goes beyond the metro area, helping providers in Douglas, Barton, and Russell counties incorporate early-stage-sensitive screening tools into their practice. Michelle Niedens holds clinical social work licenses in Missouri and Kansas, and has worked with older adults and those with Alzheimer's disease for more than 30 years. She previously served as Director of Education, Programs and Public Policy for the Alzheimer's Association, Heart of America Chapter. Her work has included leading education and policy efforts; providing direct service to individuals and families; and providing mentorship and oversight to social work staff. She has a special interest in helping individuals with neuropsychiatric challenges and has spent significant time on developing and providing early-stage programs and services.The tools, training, support, and service provided throughout the Cognitive Care Network are strengthened by the generosity of LINDA AND RAY CARSON , KU alumni who wanted to go beyond including the University in their estate planning. \"We asked ourselves, 'Why can't we do something now and begin to make a dent?' And that led to our work with the KU ADC,\" Linda Carson says. \"We want families to be educated on the issues of dementia and Alzheimer's, and know that they have a place in their community to go for services, diagnosis, and treatment. We want them to have a wellness plan, not just react in crisis-with a lack of planning and denial.\" Carson knows firsthand what it's like to be a caregiver for a loved one with dementia: She and Ray took care of her beloved Aunt Jeanne, when the unexpected happened. \"In 2018, Uncle Jim fell, hit his head, and died,\" Carson says. \"We were called, and confronted with the need to get Aunt Jeanne into short-term care, and then move her to be near us. Getting her the care she needed, and finding the right environment, was a family crisis. It was very difficult and very emotional for her and for us. That reinforced our decision and commitment to a program that would cover the disease, prevention, and support caregivers.\" Carson says the launch of the Cognitive Care Network at the KU ADC addresses all those critical issues. She is excited about its initial progress and the plans for future growth. \"For Alzheimer's patients and their families, we want to make this journey the best that it can be,\" she says. \"With the Cognitive Care Network reaching out into rural Kansas, there's a place to go for information and treatment, and it's all in the best interest of the patient and their families. They can move away from crisis mode and move into prevention and wellness planning. \"From the perspective of a family supporting a loved one, the work of the KU ADC brings hope.\" It's good to understand at the front end that there's still life to live. Lots of times, with early Alzheimer's, the bigger issue is depression. We can treat that, and there are tools we can use when short-term memory or speech issues come up. There are ways to navigate those changes. It's not about the proclamation of deficits. It's about the navigation of compensatory measures.'' SUPPORTING THE CAUSE:: / 24 / IMAGINE :: YOUR BRAIN HEALTH GUIDE / KU ADC / 2020 DR. RYAN TOWNLEY, mD, a cognitive neurologist and clinical researcher, was finishing training at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., when Dr. Jeff Burns reached out to see if he'd be interested in making a move to the KU ADC. For Dr. Townley, it was an offer too good to pass up: Kansas City is home, Dr. Burns has been a longtime mentor, and the KU ADC's focus on innovative Alzheimer's research is a perfect match for his work with atypical Alzheimer's patients. \"Atypical early onset disease isn't the same as what happens with older patients, and an MRI is often not diagnostic,\" says Dr. Townley. \"Many times, these situations can be misdiagnosed as depression or anxiety. Losing a job, due to working memory impairment, can be the first clue. A patient can often maintain daily activities, like driving a car, but won't do well in detailed testing. There's a mismatch with the cognitive abilities, and people think, he's depressed and not trying.\" At the KU ADC, Dr. Townley has the rare opportunity to combine his research with direct patient care, a blend with benefits for all. \"When the brain deteriorates, I see how the person changes. We want to learn why it happens and how to stop it. When I see patients in the clinic, I try to put the puzzle pieces together: the history, the exam, and the neuroimaging. Then, I can provide them with the best picture of what is going on,\" Dr. Townley says. To complete his busy schedule, Dr. Townley serves as an assistant professor in the Department of Neurology at the University of Kansas Medical Center, is the director of the Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology Fellowship, and is an associate director and primary investigator of the KU ADC's Clinical Trials Consortium. It's a full plate, and he's excited to dig in and see what progress he and the KU ADC team make in the years ahead. \"The KU ADC has grown so much in the last nine years,\" he says. \"What's going on here is really remarkable.\" Atypical Alzheimer's Disease: Putting the Puzzle T ogether Dr. Townley joined the KU ADC and KU Medical Center faculty in 2019, after completing a two-year cognitive behavioral fellowship at the Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education, where he also finished his neurology residency and an internal medicine internship. He is certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. Dr. Townley graduated from the University of Kansas School of Medicine, where he earned the 2013 Dewey K. Ziegler Award for Excellence in Neurology and was honored with the American Academy of Neurology's Outstanding Neurology Medical Student Award. He also holds a bachelor of science in neurobiology from KU. The brain is who we are: our memories, everything we are as humans.
