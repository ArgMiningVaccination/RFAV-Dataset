However, he has also cautioned against its free use. \"Mercurial preparations in Ayurveda are not toxic in nature if prepared according to classical parameters with guidelines of good manufacturing practices,\" said head of the department of Rasa Shastra Prof Anand Chaudhary. He said that the international regulations to ban trade of mercury, being prepared by the United Nation Environmental Programme (UNEP), US Food and Drug Administration and EU Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), should be rational. Looking to medicinal use of mercury in India, there is rational need of exemption for the availability of mercury in the country for its uses in Ayurvedic preparations, he said. The new Mercury Convention, also known as the ?Minamata Convention', was held in Japan in October 2013. Mercury is recognised as a chemical of global concern due to its long-range transport in the atmosphere, its persistence in the environment, its ability to bio-accumulate in ecosystems and its significant negative effect on human health and the environment. \"But, classically prepared Ayurvedic medicines are not toxic. Mercury in Ayurveda is processed specifically with very specific pharmaceutical preparation, known as ?Samskar' of mercury and finally converted into medicinal sulphide form, which is not harmful,\" claimed Chaudhary. However, he had a word of caution. \"Certainly, the mercury trade needs cautions and precautions to prevent humanity from its toxic effects,\" he said. According to him, western countries tried to use mercury as medicine in the 15th-16th century AD, but failed in their attempt. They used mercury to treat diuretic and syphilis in its chloride form and experienced many adverse effects. But Indian Ayurveda developed innovative methods in the 10th century AD to convert elemental mercury into its sulphide medicinal form. Indian knowledge is perfect as it developed technology to produce stable and non toxic form of Mercury as Rasa Sindoor, Rasa Parpati and many other forms of medicines of Ayurveda, he claimed. Pollutant and contaminated mercury element in the environment in the US, Latin America, many European countries and coastal area of East Asia is a reality. Elemental mercury in vapour form is highly dangerous for human health. There is need to control that applications of mercury which are responsible for production of elemental form of mercury especially as air pollutant and food contaminants. \"We support all the measures being planned by the US FDA and EU MHRA in this connection,\" he said. \"But at the same time, looking to medicinal uses of mercury in India, there is a need of exemption for its availability for Ayurvedic preparations,\" he added.
