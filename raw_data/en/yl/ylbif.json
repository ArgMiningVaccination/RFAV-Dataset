Long-term Measure: Portion of funded research that is chosen on the basis of merit review Reduce non-merit-reviewed and -determined projects by one half in two years (from 6.0% to 3.0%)Program Summary: The Basic Research program includes scientific study and experimentation to increase fundamental knowledge in the physical, engineering, environmental and life sciences and consists of a wide portfolio of projects. The program is carried out primarily through grants to universities and non-profits. The results of this research are expected to improve the country's defense capabilities, although the actual results of any specific project are unpredictable. Notable successes in the past have led to advances in satellite communications and imagery, precision navigation, stealth, night vision and technologies allowing greatly expanded battlefield awareness. Due to the long-term nature of research results, the R&D PART emphasizes assessment of the process of choosing funded projects and independent assessments of how well the research portfolio is managed. The assessment indicates that the basic research program has clear purposes of providing options for new weapons systems, helping prevent technological surprise by adversaries, and developing new scientists who will contribute to the DoD mission in the future. DoD can document--through its contracts and grants management regulations, public announcements of award competitions and results from independent review panels--the methodical management of its program. Additional findings include: 1. The grants/contract solicitation, review and award processes are competitive. 2. The program is reviewed regularly by technically capable outside reviewers, which recommend improvements they would like to be implemented. They indicate that the work is of overall high quality. 3. The program has competen t planning and management. 4. Earmarking of projects in the program has increased in the past decade and contribute less than the typical research project to meeting the agency's mission. In response to these findings, the Administration will: 1. Continue to emphasize the use of independent review panels in assessing the performance of the program. 2. Work with the research community and Congress to explain the need to limit claims on research grant funds to proposals that independently can meet the standards of a strict merit-review process.Year 2003 and laterTarget 100%Actual 2005 -50% Program Funding Level (in millions of dollars)Agency: Department of Defense--MilitaryProgram: Basic Research Program Type Research and Development*Rating: Effective Measures Adequate New Measures NeededBureau: Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Results Achieved Results Not Demonstrated8489100 Planning ManagementPurpose 80Results / Accountability 0 100 * This assessments has not changed since publ ication in the FY 2004 Budget.

The assessment found that the program: Provides funds to small businesses but has poor controls on unproductive spending Continues to provide funding to companies with track records of poor performance; Overestimates commercial successes resulting from Federal support by treating additional investment in the same way as product sales. In response to these findings, the Administration will: 1. Tighten eligibility requirements for accepting proposals from companies and individuals that repeatedly fail to sell resulting products in the marketplace. 2. Change the way companies' past performance is assessed to ensure that it more closely matches the intent of the law. 3. Look for ways to budget explicitly for the program's administrative costs. 4. Seek to get highly successful awardees to enter the mainstream of Defense contracting. Program Funding Level (in millions of dollars) 2003 Actual 9632004 Estimate 1,1002005 Estimate 1,133Key Performance Measures Long-term Measure: Revise the Commercialization Achievement Index (CAI) to eliminate counting of investments as commercialization no later than three years after receiving the first Phase II support. After that, count competitive sales receipts only. Long-term Measure:Stop funding companies with more than 5 current or past Phase II awards in the last 5 years if the company is in the bottom quartile in the CAI. Long-term Efficiency Measure: Emphasize commercialization so overall competitively awarded sales to the government (direct or indirect) from resulting products is at least equal to new R&D investment (Phases I-III), as a portfolio of prior 3-8 year investments (rolling average).2004 All 2005 All 2004 2005 2006 20070.15 0.2 0.3 0.5Year Target Actual6 01 0 0Results / Accountability43060 Purpose Planning ManagementUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R -2 Exhibit) DATE February 2004 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense -wide BA1 Basic Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Defense Research Sciences PE 0601101E , R-1 #2 (U) The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long -term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications.

Many of today's commercial practices have their roots in previous DARPA investments. As the DoD continues to be reliant upon commercial networks it is paramount that DARPA continue to look forward and investigate promising technologies. The 21st century transformation of the U.S. military will be more dependent on information technology for C4ISR and combat functions than perhaps any other aspect of the military. To a large extent, future combat systems will be more dependent on information than armor to accomplish missions succes sfully. The Department's vision for the future includes near -perfect knowledge of the battlespace and the ability to fight wars with information technology that enables remote C4ISR operations. Sophisticated computing capabilities like those available in current desktop workstation and server systems are moving to mobile wireless embedded systems that communicate over low bandwidth self -organizing tactical networks often with low -powered devices. Concurrent with the advanced computing capability will be security and other trustworthiness challenges in the systems on which the future U.S. military will be heavily dependent dur ing battle. With the increased U.S. military depen dence on information technology , the ability to maintain battlefield superiority requires control of our information systems against increasingly sophisticated adversaries employing computer network attack.

These technologies will make the diffe rence between mission degradation or failure and mission success even in the event of cyber -attack or component attrition resulting from kinetic warfare or accidental faults and errors. Systems that learn and reason will reduce the requirement for skilled system administrators and dramatically reduce the overall cost of system maintenance. As the military moves towards a sleek, dynamic expeditionary force, it is critical for systems to be more self -sufficient. (U) The Learning and Reasoning project will deve lop core technologies that enable computing systems to learn, reason, and draw on their accumulated experience by applying knowledge gained through such experience and then respond intelligently to things that have not been previously programmed or encount ered. These technologies will lead to systems demonstrating increased self -reliance, self -adaptive reconfiguration, intelligent negotiation, cooperative behavior, and survivability with reduced human intervention. This will be accomplished by creating un ique and powerful new abilities for computers to learn about and understand the world, and to reason intelligently with the results of learning. Cognitive systems will typically comprise three primary types of processes: reactive, deliberative and reflect ive. Each of these will be improved through learning and reasoning. Reactive processes respond quickly and directly to known stimuli. Deliberative processes embody what is usually known as \"thinking.\" Reflective (higher -order) processes allow a system to \"step back\" and evaluate the environment and their own capabilities to decide the next appropriate course of action. Capabilities developed in this project include novel representations for knowledge, skill learning, reasoning (deductive, abductive, pl anning, strategic inference, and hybrid approaches), pattern detection, and language learning, all of which will extend fundamental computing capabilities for dealing with real -world informat ion complexity and uncertainty.

These systems will act purposefully to assist military commanders and deci sion-makers. Embedded learning will provide faster response times and more effective responses by retaining what has been learned in the past and applying this knowledge to new scenarios, and most importantly, will allow the performance of a cognitive sys tem to improve over time. The Integrated Cognitive Systems thrust comprises Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL) , Dismounted Soldier Complement Enhancing Reporting and Navigation (DISCERN) , and Cognitive Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Int elligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C 4ISR). The Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL) program will develop integrated cognitive systems that will act as personalized executive - style assistants to military commanders and decision -makers. It is only through the exploration of full, integrated systems that we can ultimately validate the effectiveness of component technologies developed to support machine reasoning and learning. Initially the program will strive to create assistant programs that will display basic competencies, including interaction with people and other assistant programs in a normal operational environment; sending and receiving information in a natural manner; relating information and activities in various different media; inte racting with the assistant's user and inferring preferences and how to do useful procedures; and accepting coaching and guidance expressed naturally in language.

Methods for processing raw data will be learned in a way that optimizes per formance of the entire system. The Dismounted Soldier Complement Enha ncing Reporting and Navigation (DISCERN) program will develop episodic memory mechanisms to augment the individual warfighter's ability to accurately recall and communicate experienced events to reduce the operational impact of the \"fog of war.\" The warfi ghter's understanding of what is happening depends critically on knowing what has UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R -2 Exhibit) DATE February 2004 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense -wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Computing Systems and Communications Technology PE 0602301E, Project ST-30 UNCLASSIFIED already happened. To facilitate situational awareness, the military has developed extensive standardized reporting mechanisms and procedures to support the capture of inform ation and its communication to where it is needed . The warfighter is called upon to recall and report, in a timely and accurate manner, salient events that are experienced . However, the noise, smoke, and confusion of the battlefield, and the physiologica l and psychological stresses of combat, make this task very difficult . Furthermore, sleep deprivation reduces the warfighter's recall effectiveness even when physically removed from the battlefield . Foundational episodic memory technologies will be devel oped and applied to support and enhance after -action report generation, information sharing between dismounted squad members, information sharing across multiple shifts of command center staff, and the interaction of trainees and instructors in training si tuations . Lives depend on the decisions made by warfighters, from the theater commander down to the squad member on patrol . This effort will maximize the sensor and information resources available to the network -centric warfighter to improve not only the individual's cognitive ability but also the effectiveness of the collective force. The Cognitive Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C 4ISR) program will develop specific embedded learning and real -time reasoning elements to enable a new generation of C4ISR . The embedded learning will provide faster response times by retaining what it has learned in the past and real -time reasoning allows the system to apply what has been learned to new scenarios. T he resul ting knowledge will assist the c ommander by providing critical information in a timely manner with alternative courses of action for more effective decision -making.

Narrative Title FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 Knowledge -Based Systems 0.000 12.241 17.500 (U) The Knowledge -Based Systems program , formerly budgeted in Project ST -33, will develop enabling technologies, methodologies, ontologies, and specific knowledge bases to achieve the next generation of intelligent, knowledge -intensive systems. This work will focus on developing technology that spans the spectrum from large, strategic knowledge banks to small, individual knowledge -based systems. The program will develop technologies for codifying, linking, integrating, accessing, and using compl ex and cross -disciplinary knowledge at widely varying scales. This capability at a strategic level will provide DoD decision -makers with rapid as -needed access to decision -relevant background knowledge from a broad spectrum of distributed sources. The kn owledge will be expressed in formal knowledge representation languages that will allow computers to reason about the knowledge, consider its implications, imagine possible future scenarios, and query the warfighter for clarification of various aspects of t he information. The significant challenges are centered on the fact that critical knowledge involves temporal information, complex belief structures, and uncertainty, and current representation technology is not adequate to capture such information. This program will also develop the technology needed to enable the creation of individual knowledge -based systems that would incorporate into the reasoning process (in a computer -understandable form) knowledge of the warfighter's responsibilities, approach, tasks and activities. Another goal of this program is to support the warfighter's ability to understand the \"big picture\" for mission planning, monitoring and replanning. By formalizing situation model representations, automated support will be provided to commanders and analysts for prediction of unforeseen events and determination of the relevance of isolated or partial events to the evolving situation. To achieve these objectives, this program will formalize situation representation and develop analogic al and case -based reasoning, functional representation languages and situation markup languages UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R -2 Exhibit) DATE February 2004 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense -wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Computing Systems and Communications Technology PE 0602301E, Project ST-30 UNCLASSIFIED technologies. This effort would then provide the warfighter with intelligent automated assistance to help him plan and accomplish his daily activities and, ove r time, learn how he accomplishes these tasks and provide increasingly valuable automated assistance. (U) Program Plans: Develop knowledge module authoring tools. Develop methods, protocols, and tools for using interoperable knowledge modules resident on dist ributed knowledge servers. Develop integrated knowledge representation and learning technology that enables effective representation of essential forms of knowledge. Document a substantial library of formal declarative interoperable multi -use ontologies i nitially across single, then multiple domains. Demonstrate and evaluate prototypes of strategic and individual knowledge -based systems. Develop representations of events and methods for separating and tracking their association to merge multiple scenarios, assimilate one event within the context of the other, and identify where events deviate from the norm. Narrative Title FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 Advisable Systems 0.000 8.077 12.027 (U) The goal of the Advisable Systems pr ogram is to design and build systems that warfighters can control in natural and flexible ways - not via menus or by programming them, but by exchanging advice and instructions with them. \"Advice\" will span a spectrum ranging from high -level policy and go als to intermediate preferences and constraints on system behavior to specific direction and contingency actions. The warfighter will be able to express this advice in natural English and engage in a dialogue to clarify/elaborate the general advice. Base d on this dialogue, the system will incorporate the advice into an executable plan and start behaving as if it were originally programmed for that function. As Advisable Systems mature, this behavior will increase in complexity from configuration of exist ing capabilities to the automated acquisition or generation of new capabilities. Advisable Systems will furthermore continuously engage in natural dialogues with warfighters as they encounter unforeseen circumstances or conflicts in priorities and standin g orders, eventually becoming fully autonomous in their functioning as commanded. Although progress in this area will require initial focus on selected mission domains to constrain the dialogue, tools will be developed for adapting the technology to other domains. While natural language interfaces are an essential enabler for Advisable Systems, this project will not support UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R -2 Exhibit) DATE February 2004 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense -wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Computing Systems and Communications Technology PE 0602301E, Project ST-30 UNCLASSIFIED speech recognition research per se (except where important conceptual gaps exist that would bear on successful expression of advice a nd explanations), but rather the development of dialogue management systems that allow systems to glean and clarify warfighter intent. Advisable systems will allow commanders and other decision -makers more natural and more productive access to and control over a wide range of software capabilities in a variety of mission -critical areas, including command and control, intelligence and logistics. (This project was previously listed in ST-33). (U) Program Plans: Select two or three key mission domains and compe lling scenarios to drive advisable systems research with a series of increasingly difficult challenge problems. Metrics for assessment include \"programming\" speed and length of dialogue necessary, correctness of resulting system behavior, and performance of the advisable system versus a hand -programmed one. Develop domain -specific intermediate languages for expressing guidance/advice with precise operational and declarative semantics and tools for translating these languages into either executable plans or parameterized configurations of existing software modules. Develop a dialogue system with domain -specific semantics for eliciting natural language advice from the warfighter. This dialogue system will translate warfighter guidance into the precise interm ediate languages described above for both implementation and verification of purpose and intent. Develop protocols and tools for applying policy preferences and constraints and mediating conflicts among them.

Specifically, this project will develop technologies to enable systems to detect and assess the user's cognitive state and adapt to optimize understanding and effectiveness of the user; and high -level languages for rapid but precise specification of complex behavior in response to mission demands, such as configuration of sensor networks. Since it is equally important for the warfighter or commander to understand the system as it is for th e system to understand the user's goals and needs, this project will develop technologies that give systems the ability to explain, perceive, and reason about their behavior and actions affecting the external world. A remarkable and unique aspect of natur al perceptual systems is their ability to take an inordinate amount of raw sensor data, such as visual flow and rich auditory input, filter and integrate that data, and almost instantaneously unify the resultant data into meaningful elements. The human br ain is able to create from this information perceptual units that parcel the world into objects and discrete entities that are then recognized, remembered, and used in problem solving. Looking closely at these innate perception abilities will yield insigh ts into how to build totally novel computational systems that identify important, low -frequency events in a noisy environment . This kind of approach should lead to dramatic improvements in the abilities of computers to process and analyze huge amounts of data to form a high -level understanding within their environment. This project will significantly advance the military's ability to address information overload in the operational environment. (U) Robust interaction among cognitive systems, legacy systems, a nd operators will require incorporation of advanced models and control of the network infrastructure that connects them to ensure adequate provisioning of quality -of-service under dynamic loads to meet mission requirements. These technologies, taken toget her, will greatly increase operator effectiveness by allowing the operator to focus on high -level mission objectives rather than low -level interactions with the system while at the same time ensuring that he maintains essential understanding of how (and ho w well) the system is implementing and responding to that high -level direction.

This research ar ea seeks to significantly expand the operators' capabilities in a real -time operational environment by enhancing intellectual performance in the way that weapons, vehicles and sensors extend operators' physical capabilities today. In addition, this thrust will help create context -based computational systems that will understand, predict and participate in goal -directed collaboration to maintain situational awareness and assist the warfighter in the decision -making process. The hypothesis of this emerging area is that recent impressive progress in neural science, computation and miniaturization can now be leveraged to enable new concepts of warfare . The technologies developed under this thrust will revolutionize the way 21st Century warriors and commande rs interact with computer -based systems, advance systems design methodologies and fundamentally re -engineer military decision -making processes . The IWIP thrust comprises two programs: Improving Warfighter Information Intake Under Stress and Context -Based Co mputing for Command and Control . The Improving Warfighter Information Intake Under Stress (Augmented Cognition) program will develop the means, devices, and infrastructure necessary to assess the warfighter's or commander's status in real time and then en hance operational effectiveness via adaptive strategies in order to greatly improve the information throughput in the computational interface. This program will develop the technology to integrate new digital devices that support memory, attention, and co ntext recovery and link that support with the operator's status to directly improve overall performance in complex and operationally stressful conditions. The program will culminate in the development of closed -loop computational systems in which the comp uter system adapts to the state of the warfighter or decision -maker to significantly improve performance. The program will enhance operational effectiveness through at least these specific improvements to operator efficiency: 1) increasing the amount of i nformation that operators can handle; 2) reducing manpower requirements (e.g., one person doing the job of three); and 3) improving attention management during stressful operations. This research will also pursue perceptual processing -based displays that are sensitive to information processing mechanisms inherent in the human perceptual system to invent, modify and redesign devices that deliver content more effectively to the operator.

The program seeks to dramatically improve the coordination of warfighter activity in dynamic operational environments including task selection and scheduling. The COORDINATORs program will enhance system perfor mance, improve response times, increase adaptability and flexibility, add a level of re liable autonomy and decrease the number of assets required to perform tasks or solve problems . COORDINATORs, through real-time reasoning that adapts and changes in response to the environment, will enable commanders to focus on the \"hard problems\" and offload certain mechanizable coordination decision tasks to automated systems as necessary and appropriate.

(U) The Self -Aware Peer -to-Peer Systems program, an outgrowth of the DARPA Networking program, will develop r esilient, scalable sensor/computation/communication networks with decentralized control. This technology will support battlespace awareness by enabling the self - formation of large ad hoc networks of sensors and computational elements within the severely resource -constrained environment (power, bandwidth, stealth) of military operations while enabling networks to survive component failure, network intrusion, and the subversion of elements. This self -aware network of sensors and communication elem ent will provide a lifeline to the warfighter in the support of effective operations while automating the burdensome and distracting tasks of network deployment, configuration, and management. High-level languages will be developed to map the warfighter's mission plans, including geographical constraints and direct control of individual sensors , into network control actions.

Narrative Title FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 Security -Aware -Controllable Computing) 1.293 5.525 6.500 (U) Today's mechanistic military software systems are brittle in the face of changing requirements, and vulnerable to skilled attackers who bring creat ivity and unpredictability to their strategies. Prior work in system security has focused on flexible design and removing, or compensating for vulnerabilities. These approaches, however, cannot be perfectly realized and risk to military systems remains h igh. The goal of a security -aware system is to minimize unavoidable cyber risk to military missions by having a system itself smoothly adapt to chang ing resources, building blocks, secur ity requirements, mission goals and threats. A security -aware system will reason about its own security attributes , capabilities and the utility of its functions wit h respect to a mission context. A security -aware system will dynamically adapt to provide desired levels of service while minimizing risk and providing cohere nt explanations of the relative safety of service level alternatives. (U) The Security -Aware Critical Software (SACS) program, formerly Visibly -Controllable Computing, will leverage the research conducted under Cyber Panel and other DARPA programs to create a new generation of software that provides a comprehensive picture of security properti es and current status, and will present this information at multiple levels of abstraction and formality. SACS will eliminate confusing and information -free error messag es in favor of useful explanations. This capability will make security properties and status transparent to decision - makers, which will increase the speed and confidence with which military systems can be securely and dynamically reconfigured, particularl y under stressful conditions. SACS will revolutionize the security of general -purpose information systems and reduce the threat from stealth attacks in which attackers take control of systems without being detected. In addition, this program will develop quantitative information assurance measurement techniques to enable military system integrators to construct networks and information systems with a high degree of confidence that systems are protected against cyber -attacks by the assurance properties of available components. The technology will greatly enhance the reliability and security of C4ISR systems. (U) Program Plans: Demonstrate automated techniques for reasoning about and understanding the security -relevant interactions between software components of military systems.

The significant challenges are centered on the fact that critical knowledge involves temporal information, complex belief structures, and uncertainty, and current representation technology is not adequate to capture such information. This program will also develop the technology needed to enable the c reation of individual knowledge -based systems that would incorporate into the reasoning process (in a computer - understandable form) knowledge of the warfighter's responsibilities, approach, tasks and activities. Another goal of this program is to support the warfighter's ability to understand the \"big picture\" for mission planning, monitoring and replanning. By formalizing situation model representations, automated support will be provided to commanders and analysts for prediction of unforeseen events and determination of the relevance of isolated or partial events to the evolving situation. To achieve these objectives, this program will formalize situation representation and develop analogical and case -based reasoning, functional representation languages and situation markup languages technologies. This effort would then provide the warfighter with intelligent automated assistance to help him plan and accomplish his daily activities and, over time, learn how he accomplishes these tasks and provide increa singly valuable automated assistance .

The warfighter will be able to express this advice in natural English and engage in a dialogue to clarify/elaborate the general advice. Based on this dialogue, the system will incorporate the advice into an executable plan and start behaving as if it were originally programmed for that function. As Advisable Systems mature, this behavior will increase in complexity from configuration of existing capabilities to the automated acquisition or generation of new capabilities.

Although progress in this area will require initial focus on selected mission domains to constrain the dialogue, tool s will be developed for adapting the technology to other domains. While natural language interfaces are an essential enabler for Advisable Systems, this project will not support speech recognition research per se (except where important conceptual gaps ex ist that would bear on successful expression of advice and explanations), but rather the development of dialogue management systems that allow systems to glean and clarify warfighter intent. Advisable systems will allow commanders and other decision -maker s more natural and more productive access to and control over a wide range of software capabilities in a variety of mission -critical areas, including command and control, intelligence and logistics. (This program moves to project ST-30 in FY04). (U) Program Plans: Select two or three key mission domains and compelling scenarios to drive advisable systems research with a series of increasingly difficult challenge problems. Metrics for assessment include \"programming\" speed and length of dialogue necessary, c orrectness of resulting system behavior, and performance of the advisable system versus a hand -programmed one. Explore domain -specific intermediate languages for expressing guidance/advice with precise operational and declarative semantics and tools for tr anslating these languages into either executable plans or parameterized configurations of existing software modules. Begin development of a dialogue system with domain -specific semantics for eliciting natural language advice from the warfighter.

Current lighting systems use electrical distribution and the generation of light at the point -of-use. HEDLight remote source lighting will use centr alized light generation and optically transport the light to the point -of-use. This allows the lighting system electrical circuitry and wiring to be concentrated, protected, and removed to the interior of the warship, thereby remov ing a source of vulnerab ility from the outer -envelope. Critical metrics that are necessary for the successful implementation of HEDLight are system efficiency, weight, and control of the illumination pattern. The technical areas key to the success of the HEDLight program includ e: the development of compact high -efficiency full -spectrum light sources, high efficiency coupling optics, high efficiency integrated optical -fiber luminaries , and integrated illuminator engines that effectively combine the light source, the optical coupl er, and fiber -luminaire.

The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that will enhance the military's effectiveness while decreasing the exposure of U .S. or allied forces to enemy fire. This project consists of the following programs: Novel Sensors for Force Protection; Dynamic Optical Tags (DOTS); Guided Projectiles, Networking Extreme Environments (NetEx); Stimulated (SIER), MAg Military Engines, Anti -Sniper , and Vertical Infiltration, Persistent Extraction Robot (VIPER) . (U) Program Accomplishments/Planned Programs: Narrative Title FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 Novel Sensors for Force Protection 11.784 8.719 12.810 (U) The Novel Sensors for Force Protection program (formerly known as the Close -In Sensing Program) is exploring and developing a varie ty of novel methods that will contribute to enhance protection of U.S. warfighters. Concepts for the projects originated in DARPA's Close -In Sensing program and have now matured into specific approaches that have been heavily influenced by situations enco untered by U.S. warfighters in the Global War on Terrorism, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The motivation behind all the programs is to reduce the exposure of U.S. warfighters when they are operating in disadvantageous territory, especially those complex settings (densely populated and structured areas, multi -storied buildings, etc.) typically found in urban settings. The technologies investigated in Close -In Sensing considered new hardware and approaches to detect traditionally l ow signal -to-noise or concealed targets without placing people in harm's way and include infiltration and exfiltration technologies to incorporate sensor data reachback capability. Novel Sensors program consists of the Unique Signature Detection Project ( formerly known as the Odortype Detection program), the Enemy Dismount Intrusion Detection Project, the Urban Vision Project, the Explosives Detection Project and the Anti Sniper Project. Because of the multiple potential uses beyond close -in sensing in ur ban UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R -2 Exhibit) DATE February 2004 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense -wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Tactical Technology PE 0602702E , Project TT-04 UNCLASSIFIED environments the Dynamic Optical Tags Program (DOTS), which was previously budgeted in this section in FYs 2003 through 2005 under the Close -In Sensing Program, has been delineated into its own narrative elsewhere in this PE/Project. (U) The objective of the Unique Signature Detection Project is to determine whether there are unique signatures in emanations that can be used to identify and distinguish specific high -level-of-interest individuals within groups of enemy troop s or combatants, and if so, to develop enabling technology for detecting and identifying those specific individuals. The program leverages research that demonstrated the same set of genes that code for internal immune system self/non -self recognition in m ice, the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), also code for unique emanated signatures. Although experimental data for humans is far less quantitative, behavioral studies have yielded compelling results to suggest that such phenomenology can also be expected in humans. Recent experimental results with mice suggest that MHC -determined urinary signatures are expressed in a mixture of volatile carboxylic acids occurring in relative concentrations that are characteristic of the emana tion. This suggests the possibility of a corresponding unique and exploitable chemosignal. Accordingly, the program will design detectors that exploit this phenomenon by reliably detecting and identifying specific signatures of interest. The program will first characterize the nature of the signal, and determine its robustness in the presence of background signals. If an exploitable robust signature is identified, the program will then pursue detector development. Such detectors would enab le U.S. troops to remotely detect the presence of high -level-of-interest individuals within groups of enemy troops or combatants with high reliability. (U) The Enemy Dismount Intrusion Detection Project will develop a chemical se nsor that is capable of providing an advanced warning of the presence of enemy troops or combatants by detecting the chemical emissions or pattern of emissions that are common to all humans and therefore would be common to all enemy dismounted troops or co mbatants, but are otherwise not ordinarily encountered in the environment. This program will leverage capabilities found in nature to recognize and locate the volatile chemicals that are t he most reliable indicator of the presence of enemy troops or combatants. This program first seeks to observe operation of organic sensoring modalities in order to develop a fundamental understanding of these chemical emissions and their relationship to e nemy troops or combatants. With this knowledge, a sensor and detection scheme can be developed that will be capable and robust against false alarms. This detection capability would provide advanced threat warning to troops involved in perimeter defense a nd similar operations. (U) The Urban Vision Project will develop the technology and systems to provide the warfighter with an advanced in -depth view of the distribution and location of dielectric bodies that resemble those of enemy dismounted troops or combat ants within a building in an urban area. The envisioned system is an array of UAVs surrounding the location of interest (building, wooded area, etc.). Each node of the array carries a UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R -2 Exhibit) DATE February 2004 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense -wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Tactical Technology PE 0602702E , Project TT-04 UNCLASSIFIED suite of low -power multi -spectral transmitters and receivers that act in concert with real -time electromagnetic analysis codes to \"peel back\" the structure of the building and the disposition of signatures that are indicative of enemy dismounte d troops or combatants within. (U) The Explosives Detection Project seeks to deve lop a system of technologies capable of standoff (non -contact) detection of explosive compounds. Of particular importance are high throughput applications, such as military checkpoints, where an extremely low false alarm rate is required. Rather than promoting a single, particular technology, this program will develop a systematic framework of understanding for both the target and background signals. With such an understanding, concepts such as sensor fusion and the optimum setting of thresholds can b e properly optimized. In this manner, a system of sensors can be developed that has reliable detection capabilities in both laboratory and field environments. This capability will greatly reduce the threat of suicide bombing and similar tactics faced by troops in the field. (U) Program Plans: Close -In Sensing.

This program has been combined with the Collaborative Munitions effor ts, which seek to expand the functionality and lethality of munitions by enabling new ways for them to collectively accomplish difficult and time critical missions , and are based on the success of the Antipersonnel Landmines Alternatives (APLA) program (completed in FY 2002) .

Narrative Title FY Based on concepts identified under the collaborative munitions program (budgeted under this PE/Project), the MAgnetoHydrodynamic Explosive Munition (MAHEM) program will demonstrate compressed magnetic flux generator (CMFG) -driven magnetohydrodynamically formed metal jets and self forging penetrators with significantly improved performance over e xplosively formed jets and fragments. Explosively formed jets (EFJ) and self forging penetrators (SFP) are used for precision strike against targets such as armored vehicles and reinforced structures. Current technology uses chemical explosive energy to form the jets and fragments. This is highly inefficient and requires precise machining of the metal liners from which the fragments and jets are formed. Generating multiple jets or fragments from a single explosive is difficult, and the timing of the mul tiple jets or fragments cannot be controlled. MAHEM offers the potential for higher efficiency, greater control , the ability to generate and accurately time multiple jets and fragments from a single charge, and the potential for aimable, multiple warheads with a much higher EFJ velocity, hence increased lethality and kill precision, than conventional EFJ/SFP. MAHEM could be packaged into a missile, projectile or other platform and delivered close to target for final engagement and kill. This could provid e the warfighter with a means to address stressing missions such as: lightweight active self -protection for Future Combat Systems (FCS) vehicles (potential defeat mechanism for a kinetic energy round); counter armor (passive, reactive, and active); mine c ountermeasures; and anti -ship cruise missile final layer of defense.

Narrative Title FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 Laser Star 3.340 8.476 5.885 (U) The Laser Star program will investigate technologies and techniques for improving laser guide star generation for adaptive optics atmospheric compensation of laser propagati on. Current technology makes use of either stratospheric Rayleigh backscatter or mesospheric sodium resonance scattering. These techniques have been utilized to successfully demonstrate strategies for wavefront compensation, but suffer from practical res trictions limiting operational utility. Rayleigh guide stars can be effectively generated to altitudes of 15 - 20 km, beyond which decreasing air densities reduce the backscatter to the point where unrealistic laser powers are required for useful return s ignal. The altitude is insufficient to provide full atmospheric sampling and suffers from sensor/target signal cancellation . Sodium resonance scattering is available to 90 km, which is an essentially complete atmosphere sample, but the return is monochro matic and cannot provide information about turbulence - induced absolute tilt. Laser Star technologies are being developed to overcome these shortfalls.

Narrative Title FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 Helicopter Rotor Blade Quieting 0.000 0.000 5.150 (U) Studies and performance results from current U.S. military operational systems, as we ll as other DARPA programs in this project, have shown that it is vital to increase the survivability and lethality of U.S. helicopters by reducing their aco ustic signature, thereby making them harder to track and engage. The Helicopter Rotor Blade Quieti ng program will employ advanced technology to address this objective. Reducing acoustic signature without sacrificing performance requires a significant departure from current rotor blade designs. Because of the exorbitant cost associated with wind tunne l testing, novel blade design must rely on computational modeling to narrow down the experimental test matrix. Today's models are essentially empirical and therefore allow for only small excursions from existing blade designs. This program will address this barrier to novel blade design by leveraging recent advances in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to develop physics -based predictive design tools that will yield blades with vastly improved acoustic characteristics. The predictive tools will be teste d using existing data sets and data collected from fully instrumented small -scale experiments. The tools will then be used to design new blades that yield a significant reduction in low -frequency in -plane signatures compared to a baseline design. (U) Program Plans: Develop predictive blade design tools . Validate models using experimental data . Use the tools to design new blades that yield a significant reduction in low -frequency, in -plane signature .

The Walrus program will develop and evaluate a very large airlift vehi cle concept that is designed to fly heavier -than-air, unlike earlier generation airships. As a \"hybrid aircraft,\" it will generate lift through a combination of aerodynamics and gas buoyancy. The program will develop and construct a Walrus Advanced Techn ology Demonstration (ATD) air vehicle with comparable C -130 airlift capability, and will explore, develop, and demonstrate the system concepts of operation. Scalability of the concept will also be demonstrated. An objective vehicle is envisioned to be ca pable of lifting over 500 tons across intercontinental distances, being able to transport a Unit of Action (UA) from \"Fort -to-Fight\" as a complete integrated action -ready package of personnel and equipment. Additionally, Walrus may meet the multi -agency n eeds of common requirements for extended range airborne patrol, persistence and intra -theater support and re -supply. Two advanced breakthrough technologies that will be investigated in the first phase are: vacuum / air buoyancy compensator tanks, and electrostatic atmospheric ion propulsion. The program's first phase will include system studies and development of a notional concept of the objective vehicle.

(U) HyperJAM p rovides the capability to deliver GPS precision guided weapons to high value, well defended, and relocatable targets with range capability in excess of 400 nm. HyperJAM uses conventional rocket technology (black brandt rocket) integrated with a modified aerodynamically enhanced Joint Direct Attack Munition ( JDAM ) high speed nosecone to deliver MK84 munitions to precise locations. Utilization of a zoom maneuver from a high performance aircraft (F -16, F /A-18) allows delivery of an air -to-surface weapon on a ballistic trajectory that greatly enhances its range capability with the same lethality/accuracy . (U) MAULLM will develop and test a containerized, platform -independent multi -mission weapon concept that will provide rapid response and lethality in packages w ith significantly lower missile unit cost, decreased logistical support and lower life -cycle costs, while increasing flexibility compared to current Naval gun and missile systems. MAULLM will address current Naval threats such as massed, swarming suicide attack boats, and will significantly enhance operations ashore by providing a long -loiter, on -call weapon capable of engaging multiple (~10) individual targets. MAULLM builds on and extends many of the concepts developed in NetFires, will be air deployabl e in C -130 (and smaller) aircraft, and will enhance the situation awareness and survivability of the Navy and Marines by providing standoff target acquisition and extended -range, non -line- of-sight engagements.

In addition to the ability to detect and characterize potential attacks, robustness against attack is provided by proliferation of assets, ready access to space, the ability to neutralize man -made space en vironments, and a flexible infrastructure for maintaining the capabilities of on -orbit assets. Ready access to space allows the delivery of defensive systems and replenishment supplies to orbit. An infrastructure to service the mission spacecraft allows defensive actions to be taken without limiting mission lifetime. In addition, developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the ex ploitation of space. Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space -derived information and services with terrestrial users. Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enable satellit es and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness; enabling concepts include solar thermal propulsion, novel ion thruster applications, payload isolation and pointing systems.

Up to 300m long electronically scanned antenna (ESA) designs wil l be developed by leveraging major advances in novel materials (such as rigidized inflatables), and ultra lightweight low -power density RF electronics. An antenna of this size enables a medium Earth orbit (MEO) constellation that provides 24/7 true contin uous coverage with as few as eight satellites, as compared to many dozens at low Earth orbit (LEO) . In particular, the ISAT program will retire the risk associated with two major technical obstacles: 1) the reliable and controllable deployment of a ~300m long ESA with a linear compaction ratio of 100:1; and 2) the on -orbit calibration (particularly on transmit) and control of the ISAT antenna. Novel power generation and distribution systems will also be investigated. The program will conduct ground -based risk reduction experiments demonstrating the accuracy of the constitutive models for deployment and control of rigidized inflatable structures, and will develop performance predictions on the selected designs as well as lifecycle cost models. These desi gns will be down selected to carry out a space -based experimen t of the critical technologies.

The concept is to develop a responsive, routine, small payload delivery system capable of providing flexible access to space using a combination of reusable and low cost expendable vehicle elements. Specifically, the RASCAL system will be comprised of a reusable airplane -like first stage vehicle called the mass injection pre -compressor cooling (MIPPC) p owered vehicle (MPV) and a second and third stage expendable rocket vehicle (ERV) . The RASCAL demonstration objectives are to place satellites and commodity payloads, between 50 and 130 kilograms in weight, into low -earth orbit at any time, with launch ef ficiency of $20,000 per kilogram or less. While the cost goal is commensurate with current large payload launch systems, the operational system, through production economies of scale, will be more than a factor of three less than current capabilities for the dedicated micro payload size. This capability will enable cost effective use of on - orbit replacement and re -supply and provide a means for rapid launch of orbital assets for changing national security needs. This program will utilize reusable aircraf t technology for the first stage and will take advantage of low -cost rocket technologies for the expendable upper stages. With recent advances in design tools and simulations, this program will prudently reduce design margins and trade -off system reliabil ity to maximize cost effectiveness. This program will also leverage advancements in autonomous range safety, first -stage guidance; and predictive vehicle health diagnosis, management and reporting to lower the recurring costs of space launch.

Narrative Title FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 Tactically Responsive Satellites (TRS) 2.032 5.016 3.800 (U) The TR S program (formerly titled Low Cost Tactical Image r) will develop next generation satellite systems capable of on -demand deployment. Existing satellite systems require e xtensive time to both integrate onto launch vehicles and checkout once on orbit. This timeline, currently on the order of months (at best), needs to be sho rtened to days or even hours. Examples of militarily significant tactical payloads include imaging, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), as well as tactical communications. Rapid replenishment of space assets in the event of pre -mature failure or worse is a major side benefit of TRS technology.

Near -term capability will be accomplished via development of a rocket boosted, expendable munitions delivery system that delivers its payload to the target by executing unpowered glide maneuvers at hypersonic speed. This concept called the Common Aero Vehicle (CAV) would be capable of delivering up to 1,000 pounds of munitions to a target at global distance. A Small Launch Vehicle (SLV) will place CAV at the required al titude and velocity. The FALCON program will develop a low cost, responsive SLV that meets these requirements and demonstrate this capability in a series of flight tests culminating with the launch of a functional CAV. In addition, this SLV will be capab le of launching small satellites into sun synchronous orbit. Far -term capability is envisioned to entail a reusable, hypersonic cruise vehicle (HCV) capable of delivering 12,000 pounds of payload to a target 9,000 nautical miles from CONUS in less than tw o hours. Many of the technologies required by CAV are also applicable to this HCV concept such as high lift -to-drag technologies, high temperature materials, thermal protection systems, and periodic guidance, navigation, and control. Initiated under the Space Vehicle Technologies program, and leveraging technology developed under the Hypersonics Flight (HyFly) program, FALCON will build on these technologies to address the implications of powered hypersonic flight and reusability required to enable this f ar-term capability. The FALCON program addresses many high priority mission areas and applications such as global presence, space control, and space lift.

The FY 1990 Appropriation Act provided funds for the creation of HAARP, jointly managed by the Air Force Rese arch Laboratory and the Office of Naval UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R -2 Exhibit) DATE February 2004 APP ROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense -wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Advanced Aerospace Systems PE 0603285E , Project ASP -02 UNCLASSIFIED Research to exploit emerging ionosphere and high power radio technology for new military sy stems applications. Key to the current effort is the expansion of the experimental research facility that includes a 3.6 MW high-frequency transmitter and a variety of diagnostic instruments, to conduct investigations to characterize the physical processes that can be initiated and controlled in the ionosphere and space, via interactions with high power radio waves. Among thes e are: (1) the generation of extremely low frequency/very low frequency radio waves for submarine and other subsurface communication, and the reduction of charged particle populations in the radiation belts to ensure safe spa cecraft systems operations; (2) the control of electron density gradients and the refractive properties in selected regions of the ionosphere to create radio wave propagation channels; and (3) the generation of optical and infrared emissions in space to calibrate space sensors. To date , the facility has been developed to include a suite of optical and radio diagnostics and an advanced, modern, high frequency transmitting array that has a radiated power of 960 kW, about one -third of the 3.6MW called for in the original concept and plan. The current high frequency transmitting array has proven to be extremely reliable and flexible, and has shown the feasibility of the overall concept. Basic and exploratory development research programs are now being conducted routinely with it. Results to date indicate that advanced applications -related research activities and new military system concept demonstrations envisioned under the program require that the high frequency transmitting capability at the site be increased from the present 960 kW lev el to the originally planned 3.6 MW level. A recent study completed by an Air Force/Navy Panel also points to additional high-value functions that can potentially be accomplished with the a 3.6 MW capability, in particular, the exploration and refinement of scientific principles that could lead to the development and deployment of a system to provide protection for space -based assets from emergent asymmetric threats. (U) An April 2001 Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Study indicated that a single lo w-yield (10 -20 kt), high -altitude (125 - 300 km) nuclear detonation (HAND) would enhance the magnetospheric high energy particle density by three orders of magnitude or more, and persist fo r over a year. This event would disable all low earth orbit (LEO) satellites not specifically hardened to withstand radiation generated by that explosion. The resultant loss of communications, imaging, and weather satellites would have catastrophic global security and economic impacts. Replacing the lost inventory afte r the fact would cost in the trillions of dollars. The cost of hardening new satellites is also prohibitive. The probability of such an asymmetric threat is not negligible, given the recent nuclear weapon activities in Asia, and the consequences of such a threat are disastrous. HAARP will provide a ground -based testbed for early feasibility examination and tradeoffs of concepts for accelerating the reduction of HAND -enhance d charged particle populations in the radiation belts. Two concepts will be consi dered: (1) space -based propagation of very low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic waves into the ionosphere in the magnetic field line where the trapped particles are oscillating between magnetic mirror points, causing the particles to be \"swept away\" ten ti mes faster than the natural decay; and (2) high voltage multi - kilometer Electrodynamic/Static (ED/ES) space tethers to remove highly charged trapped radiation particles as they traverse the magnetic field lines. In both concepts, HAARP would be used to es tablish the optimum electromagnetic wave/tether parameters for an operational system that could be based on the ground, in space, or both.

The key to attaining such performance is the recognition that mechanical structures are circuit elements in their own right, each with the capability to filter signals via their resonance properties, switch signals via mechanical actuation , and distort/shape/amplify signals via their nonlinearities, all at bandwidths rivaling those of transistors when implemented on the nano -mechanical scale . When connected into larger circuit networks, such mechanical elements can then be structured to perform increasingly complex functions, including filtering, mixing, amplification, and A/D or D/A conversion, all with dynamic ranges and power usages potentially better than exhibited by transistor -based counterparts . For data storage, the key approach in this program that allows it to break the 100Gb/in2 thermod ynamic barrier presently constraining conventional ma gnetic storage approaches is the use of MEMS techno logy to store, access , and erase data as tiny pits, phase changes, or even molecular changes (e.g., in a DNA chain) . One possible rendition might use a MEMS based probe to manipulate the bits . A successful program in micromechanical computation and data storage would not only make single - chip (electrical or mechanical) computers possible, but wo uld also enable circuits that can be powered by means other than electrical energy (e.g. direct chemical energy is possible), and that are practically immune to Electro -Magnetic Interface ( EMI) and robust against radiation.

The first thrust addresses active photonic components based on silicon which do not rely on generating light within the material. While passive photonic components, such as waveguides, can be fabricated from silicon, silicon's indirect bandgap does not lend it to fabricating active photonic components based on the generation of photons (lasers, amplifiers etc.). The first alternati ve technology development will be optical amplifiers using Raman gain. Fiber amplifiers based on Raman gain currently play a major role in optical networks, and demonstrating this optical amplification in silicon will be a major step toward overcoming on chip losses in complex chip -scale optical components. The second alternative technology development will address optical transistor action, or switching, in silicon, (i.e., a three -terminal optical device, in which control photons at one terminal will mak e a large change in the photons transmitted between the other two terminals). Taken together, these two capabilities will create a new paradigm, in which silicon will provide a platform for monolithic integration of photonic and electronic functions.

JAGUAR technology makes use of a) targeting information , both for sensor targets and for strikes, expressed both as point targets and area targets (search, combat air patrol); b) rules of engagement and procedural constraints such as airspace restrictions; and c) availability of platforms, weapons, sensors and communications equipment. From this information JAGUAR produces ingress routes, flight schedules and patrol zones, while assuring airspace and electronic deconfliction. It allows pilots and commanders either to choose conventional tactics or to invent u nconventional operations. In the latter case, the system captures the innovation and makes it available for future mission plans.

Partial plans are represented in h ierarchical task networks and visualized through synchronization matrices, icon overlays, or tactical sketch animations. Commanders and staff modify, refine, and extend a plan through voice, sketching and semi -structured input. The system links plan frag ments constructed at different sites, transfers information among related parts of the plan and discovers and recommends solutions for inconsistencies. The system continuously compiles a set of plan cases and employs analogical matching to propose extensi ons to current plans suggested by past experience. Plan elements are communicated through an integrated set of protocols from the unit commander down to dismounts equipped with advanced heads -up displays and helmet -worn sensors. Finally, the system conti nuously assesses progress against the plan and alerts users to significant deviations. The Urban Commander effort develops planning and control tools tailored to dismounted operations in complex urban environments. Urban warfare combines limited sightlin es and mobility with ever -insufficient knowledge of the disposition of enemy combatants, civilians, and the structures they occupy. Urban Commander forms a command and control substrate that enables ground forces, including vehicles and dismounts, to rapi dly coordinate actions as the situation and commanders' knowledge of the situation, change. Elements of the Urban Commander program include 1) spatial analysis, to determine lines of sight and fields of fire; 2) planning aids, to assist in sensor placemen t and route planning; 3) visualization tools, to allow commanders and soldiers to rapidly apprehend a situation and make plans to deal with it; and 4) analysis tools, to suggest locations and types of potential threats. The Multispectral Adaptive Networke d Tactical Imaging System (MANTIS) effort develops, integrates and demonstrates a soldier -worn visualization system. The system consists of five elements: 1) a head -mounted multi -spectral sensor suite with a high resolution visor display; 2) an inertial n avigation system; 3) a global positioning system (GPS); 4) a soldier -worn processor; 5) a high bandwidth transceiver; and 6) a power supply. It provides the warfighter with digitally fused, multi -spectral video imagery in real time from the helmet -mounted sensors. The system fuses imagery in the Visible/Near Infrared (VNIR, .4 -.9 microns), the Short Wave Infrared (SWIR, 1-2 microns) and the Long Wave Infrared (LWIR, 8 -12 microns) frequency bands. It displays the fused imagery on the helmet -mounted visor. The warfighter sees where the enemy cannot.

The soldier -worn, high -speed processor adaptively generates an optimized image under variable battlefield conditions. This process takes advantage of the unique signatures in each of the spectral regions. The system also allows the soldier to record the sensor video, and then play it back after taking cover. The record and playback feature includes electronic zoom, scroll, pan and panoramic image stitching. This furnishes a larger field of view to enhance context. The MANTIS INS and GPS devices provide precise soldier location and pose estimation, on which the digital display overlays battlefield information. In this way MANTIS furnishes the warfighter with augmented reality and increased situational awareness. The warfighter can share his position and images with others in real time by means of a high - bandwidth transceiver. The transceiver also allows the soldier to rec eive images and information from remote sensors. The coupling of the imaging system with the INS/GPS gives the soldier a \"point -click -kill\" capability for targeting smart weapons fired from elsewhere.

It employs a model -based control ar chitecture to allow new platforms to enter the system at any time. Commanders register new platforms with the battle manager by submitting platform capability models (kinematics, maneuverability, endurance, payloads and communications links). C3RS provide s a commanders' interface which allows collaborative tasking of the platforms in the form of operational missions, such as search, track, identify, or engage, rather than routes and events. It supplies computationally intensive decision aids, such as adva nced 4D airspace and groundspace deconfliction tools, route planners and task/platform assignment algorithms.

ACN will augment and enhance the battlefield communications infrastructure in order to adapt communications, s ituational awareness and SIGINT services to the flow of battle. Therefore, the ACN system needs to be adaptable, interoperable, robust, secure, and affordable within the size, weight and power constraints of the intended platforms. Additionally, the ACN architecture allows for the implementation of technologies that can securely adapt the various wireless systems (such as unattended ground sensors (UGS)) and command & control tiers that will exist in the future network centric battlesphere. The ACN syste m operational utility will be assessed by U .S. Joint Forces Command as part of a Joint ACTD , named the Adaptive Joint C4ISR Node (AJCN ) that began in FY 2003 and will complete in FY 2005 with an extended user evaluation in FY2006 - FY2007. The ACTD, jointly funded by DARPA, Army, Air Force, U .S. Joint Forces Command, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, will integrate ACN payloads onboard Air Force and Army aircraft.

The SAW program will develop and demonstrate an adaptive waveform agile communications system that can change structure (frequency, modulation, data rate, hop rate, code, etc.) on a periodic or aperiodic basis to minimize the probability of detection, interception, and exploitation in order to suppo rt covert operations. New means of conducting secure communications are needed because the commercial availability of high performance RF components makes the basic tools necessary for conducting signals intelligence (SIGINT) exploitation available to our adversaries. It is realistic to assume that adversaries will soon have the capability and means to develop software exploitation techniques that make even the most advanced U. S. communications systems vulnerable. To defeat this threat, the technical go al is to eliminate repeatability in transmissions by adapting the waveform randomly and forcing random network routing. In keeping with the multi -INT focus of the ACN program, secondary objectives of the SAW program include making the system capable of si multaneously supporting multiple missions, to include communications, SIGINT, radar, and electronic warfare. (U) The goal of the Polarized Rotation Modulation (PRZM) Communications program is to develop new extremely high data rate, point -to- point, wireless c ommunications using the PZRM communications concept which can be implemented at any wavelength - RF to visible - to exploit the presently unused polarization and rotation dimensions of radiation. The PRZM communications program will investigate the use of polarization modulation and the ability for conventional radios to carry all information over the transmitted signal amplitude, phase and frequency. Polarization modulation introduces as additional dimension . A radio with four polarization possibilities would transmit four times the information with all other aspects of the waveform held constant. Use of the antenna as part of the information processing architecture of a radio has not been previously performed. This technology will greatly increase the capability of existing channels without increase in spectrum or modem complexity. The program will be demonstrated as an enhancement to an otherwise state of the art networking system. (U) Program Plans: Secure Adaptive Waveforms . Initiate system design ef fort.

Narrative Title FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 Connectionless Networking (CN) 0.000 8.372 7.800 (U) In order to bring data efficiently from high value, but energy limited sensors (such as unattended ground sensors (UGS), into system architectures like that of the Airborne Communications Node (ACN) a new fundamental emphasis must be placed on how these kinds of sensor networks communicate. The Connectionless Network ing (CN) program will develop technology to allow networks (such as UGS) to send and receive messages without initial link acquisition or previous sharing of routing information. This will, in turn, improve energy per bit of delivered information by as much as 100 to 1,000 times compared to conventional and near -term deployable communications systems such as contemplated by both commercial and military users. Conventional radio link an d network designs expend most of the energy on link establishment and maintenance as well as packet and network overhead. This energy requirement not only limits the lifetime of energy -limited systems, it unnecessarily fills the radio spectrum, limiting a vailable bandwidth, creates unnecessary risks of detection, and increases thermal loads. These impacts are especially severe for communications such as proliferated sensors or remotely operated or updated weapons. Eliminating the requirement to maintain a continuous network linkage would enable these platforms to provide continuous connectivity without consumption of power, or compromising emanations.

Narrative Title FY 2003 FY 2005 Next Generation (XG) 8.912 18.305 15.571 (U) The Next Generation (XG) program goals are to develop both the enabling technologies and system concepts to provide dramatic improvements in assured military communications in support of a full range of worldwide deployments through the dynamic redistribution of allocated spectrum along with novel waveforms . U.S. Forces face unique spectrum access issues in each country in which they operate, due to competing civilian or government users of national spectrum. These constraints must be reflected in all force planning and may preclude operation of critical systems. Coalition and allied operations are even more complex to manage, and may severely limit the U.S. ability to fully exploit its superiority and investment in information tec hnology. The XG program approach is to develop the theoretical underpinnings for dynamic control of the spectrum, the technologies and subsystems that enable reallocation of the spectrum, and the system appliqu\u00e9 prototypes to demonstrate applicability to legacy and future DoD radio frequency emitters. The approach plans to investigate methods to leverage the technology base in microele ctronics with new waveform and medium access and c ontrol protocol technologies to construct an integrated system. The pro posed program goals are to develop, integrate, and evaluate the technology to enable equipment to automatically select spectrum and operating modes to both minimize disruption of existing users, a nd to ensure operation of U.S. s ystems. The result of the X G program will be to develop and demonstrate a set of standard dynamic spectrum adaption technologies for legacy and future emitter systems for joint service utility .

Narrative Title FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 Advanced Speech Encoding (ASE) 8.491 9.683 6.228 (U) The Advanced Speech Encoding (ASE) program will achieve an order of magnitude reduction of voice communication bit rates in noisy military environments over current state -of-the-art vocoders . The program will compress speech to bit rates between 200 bps and 800 bps while producing speech quality at least as good as that produced by the current DoD standard and maintaining that quality and bit rate in noisy military environments. Reduction of voice communication bit rates will decrease the probability of detection of transmit ted signals and also decrease the required transmit energy, hence increasing battery lifetime. ASE will reduce voice communication bit rates by directly measuring the glottal excitation function, using non -acoustic sensors allow ing for a more accurate det ermination of the parameters needed for speech encoding. The ASE program will develop novel noise suppression and low -rate vocoding approaches that exploit the additional information provided by the noise -robust non -acoustic sensors. Reliable authenticat ion of the speaker's identity using vocal excitation measurements will be investigated along with technologies for secured voice communications systems that are encrypted on the basis o f the user's voice.

Narrative Title FY 2003 Symbio tic Communications 18.004 19.696 12.726 (U) Future combat systems increasingly rely on accurate intelligence preparation of the battlefield. This includes timely and accurate georegistration of all sensed data for precision weaponry on t argets (including mobile targets). The single biggest error source that exists in the georegistration process is the lack of accurate knowledge of the terrain. Current national databases provide only coarse Level 1 data; Level 2 data will become availabl e in the next several years. Neither Level 1 nor Level 2 data is sufficient to take full benefit of even current generation weapon accuracies , and the situation will worsen as weapons navigation and guidance systems improve at a faster pace. In order to overcome this, the Symbiotic Communications (SYCO) program will develop an airborne system that can generate, in real -time, Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) with a precision commensurate with NIMA defined Level 4. This system will operate in all weat her and passively. Additional attributes being explored include production of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and ground moving target indication (GMTI) to facilitate the detection, tracking and engagement of moving targets passively and in all wea ther conditions. Finally, exploration of techniques for using multiple frequencies to achieve enhanced spatial resolution leading to a potential DTED Level 5 precision will be conducted. Initial flight tests have been conducted that demonstrate the basic feasibility of SYCO operating modes and support studies of SYCO measurement phenomenology.

Narrative Title FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 Tera Hertz Operational Reachback Optical & RF Combined Link Experiment 9.930 (U) The Tera Hertz Opera tional Reachback (THOR) program 's goals were to mature required technologies and credibly demonstrate a system able to provide a high data rate (internet -like) backbone to the tactical user whether airborne, terrestrial, or mar itime. By focusing on the militarily unique need for a truly mobile and deployable high -data-rate infrastructure that extends access to existing commercial and military terrestrial fiber infrastructures, the Department's vision of a \"Global Grid\" will be enabled by creating the high -data-rate nexus among the terrestrial, space, and air grids. This is expected to be accomplished by leveraging the commercial global optical fiber network, multi -quantum well retro -reflectors, and advances in optical phased ar ray technology that have been motivated by directed energy applications. Together, these technologies enable the creation of a hybrid fiber -free space optical network extension. Gigabit -per-second connectivity and long -haul reachback to and between deplo yed theater command nodes, airborne, and maritime assets will be demonstrated in the final year of the program.

This effort will demonstrate improved battlespace communications using a hybrid RF and FSO link in air -to-air-to-ground environment . The central challenge is to enable optical communications bandwi dth without giving up RF reliability and \"all -weather\" performance.

This p rogram leverages other DARPA efforts related to unfettered access to space and space control with a transition targeted to the Air Force. Significant technical obstacles include networking using high speed RF and optical links with high latencies due to d istances of hundreds of kilometers , topology formation among fast moving nodes yet in predictable paths (orbits) or locations (ground -based), and the power, size, and weight constraints associated with space operations using micro -satellite s.

This effort seek s to create a system control methodology that will allow intuitive control over complex communications systems while still preserving the flexibility of the emerging ad -hoc networks. In addition to creating a method for an operator to understand the state of the netw ork, PBNM will allow the network to implement the commander's intent for the operation by dynamically changing function and allocation throughout the duration of a mission. PBNM will control traffic at the application level by making the system aware of w hat is currently possible, what is currently allowed, and how communications are expected to change over the duration of a mission.

Narrative Title FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 Network Centric Operations/Battle Command 0.000 0.000 7.500 (U) The D oD is transforming to a more network centric focus for military operations, e.g., FORCENet, Joint Battlespace Infosphere, and Future Combat Syst ems/Unit of Action (UA). Until recently, the primary technological emphasis has been oriented towards improving Command, Control, Communicati ons and Computing, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance ( C4ISR ) systems to enabl e better sensor -decider -shooter linkages. To be more effective in joint operations, network centricity development must receive equal priority to facilitate battlefield understanding to the commanders at all echelons, in a form best suited for their information assimilation (recep tive) and decision processes (intuitive). In other words, network centricity must improve the art of battle command, rather than just the science of C4ISR, to be a force multiplier. This new initiative will develop and demonstrate the enabling technologi es for Network Centric Operations, with emphasis on creating understanding for battle command. It will seamlessly connect the Network Centric Enterprise and Network Centric Warfare layers through understanding, thereby enabling shared awareness, collabora tion and self -synchronization among the various joint components and echelons. This program integrates technologies enabling secure, assured, multi -subscriber, multi -purpose (e.g., maneuver, logistics, intel ligence ) networks with commander -centric command and control / intelligence technologies, including forecasting /prediction of Courses of Action (COA) and UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R -2 Exhibit) DATE February 2004 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense -wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Command, Control and Communications Systems PE 0603760E , Project CCC -02 UNCLASSIFIED sustainment tools, into one unified joint battle command system.

Current antenna technology limits the ability to miniaturize the physical size of the anten na, resulting in a requirement for large platforms or physical deployments for frequencies suitable for special operations. Similarly, limited antenna bandwidth limits the ability to fully exploit software -based radios, such as Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), since the antennas they utilize are limited in bandwidth. Non -Foster matching greatly reduces the transmitter power needed to deliver a prescribed amount of Radio Frequency (RF) to an electrically -small antenna. Application of advanced technolog y (Wide -band gap materials, such as SiN) offers the ability to fabricate devices that can effectively couple to very non -resonant antennas. DARPA will develop the basic technology, and then apply it to develop radios with wide bands of operation and very small physical size. A potential application will be a self -contained cell phone size device that can use High Frequency (HF) to communicate around the world without any infrastructure. (U) The Ultra -Fast Radar program will entail the design, construction, a nd demonstration of an X-band noise correlating radar with a retro - directive antenna. This effort will research and develop a new type of radar sensor based on the correlations of the Gaussian noise received by an antenna array from a small object located in the far field of the antennas and the retro -directive re -radiation of the correlated noise by interconnecting the receive elements to transmit elements in a conjugate (\"van -Atta\") fashion. The idea is the combining and tailoring of noise - correlating i nterferometry and retro -directive antenna arrays into retro-directive noise -correlating (RNC) radar. The combination of these innovations allows the radar to operate in omni -directional search mode by broadcasting white noise over a specified search angle determined by the beam pattern of the individual elements. Once a target of adequate cross section enters the beam within the range of the sensor, correlations appear in the noise power spectrum between neighboring antennas. The received noise power is then amplified by the transceiver electronic chain and re -transmitted directly towards the target in a process call the RNC feedback loop. The result of this project will be a new type of search - mode radar having promising performance in terms of short ac quisition time and low probability -of-intercept.

Four projects are funded in this program element: Guidance Technology, Aerospace Surveillance Technology, the Air Defense Initiative, and Sensors and Exploitat ion Systems. (U) The Guidance Technology project will increase the ability of Global Positioning System (GPS) users to operate effectively in presence of enemy jamming; to increase the versatility of navigation systems applications by developing microelectrom echanical sensor inertial navigation system technologies; and to apply the geolocation technologies/techniques to precision threat geolocation of short -dwell emitters or passive air defense systems. Fire -and-forget standoff weapons need precise targeting information if critical fixed and mobile targets are to be eliminated effectively with minimal collateral damage and minimum cost -per-kill. This requires that: (1) military surveillance and targeting systems geolocate targets accurately in the same coord inate system in which the weapon system navigates; (2) the surveillance, targeting and weapon systems have precision navigation and guidance systems on -board; and (3) navigation and target location systems robustly operate day/night and in adverse weather. In addition, future systems designed to accomplish precision strike missions must be significantly more affordable. The achievement of these characteristics in an integrated system is the goal of this program.

Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather c onditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars. This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at ti mes, in a covert manner. This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low -power high -performance computing, and low -cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems. Surve illance is not an end to itself, but rather an enabler for force protection and precision strike. Therefore, a key component of this program is the development of a comprehensive sensor -to- shooter architecture. (U) The Air Defense Initiative project encompas ses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats. These technology developments are embodied in programs such as the Low -Cost Cruise Missile Defense (LCCMD), Global Eye, Affordable Large Ar ray (ALA), RF MEMS Improvement, and the Integrated Sensor Is Structure (ISIS) programs. (U) The Sensors and Exploitation Systems project funds development and demonstration of advanced sensors. Tools that extract and compile information from data provided by sensors are elements of the project. These efforts, along with those in Projects SGT -01, SGT -02 and SGT -03, provide warriors with situational awareness and precision target identification. The project is driven by four needs: (1) countering camouflage, concealment and deception (CC&D); (2) providing near -real-time, semi -automatic exploitation of wide -area moderate - and high - resolution imagery; (3) obtaining real -time, accurate Battle Damage Assessment (BDA); and (4) accomplishing robust, precise identi fication, precision fire control tracking and engagement of high value targets. These needs are addressed by the following programs: Advanced Exploitation Systems Technology, Network Centric Sensing and Engagement, Advanced Optical Sensor Technology, and Advanced Radar Sensor Technology.

The targeting system will negate emitter shutdown tactics now employed to defeat anti -radiation missiles (AR M) guidance, and thereby enable simplified ordnance inv entories. The goal is generation and distribution of near real-time, comprehensive, and highly precise location of threat radars to all theater combatant aircraft without deploying any additional SEAD - dedicated, emitter -collecting platforms. AT3 will acc omplish this by widely deploying emitter collection packages hosted on existing airborne platforms, including combat aircraft. AT3 will integrate distributed multi -platform emitter collections in real -time using existing or planned tactical data links wit h advanced network management and signal processing. To achieve wide deployment, AT3 focuses on transition through inexpensive upgrades to digital radar warning receivers. Enabling technologies include: coupled GPS Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU ) packag es, tactical communications, advanced highly dynamic data fusion network management capabilities, and algorithms to ensure robust, flexible performance of geolocation algorithms for locating multiple emitter types in noisy, high pulse density environments.

The technical objective of the program is to provide a proof -of-concept for operation at tactically relevant high altitudes and at long ground ranges. A secondary goal of the program is to demonstrate single -view ground moving target indication (GMTI) with targeting quality absolute accuracy in range and cross -range when operating in a coherent, real -aperture mode. Eyeball is developing novel methods for precision tar get identification (ID) of moving and stationary tactical targets from standoff platforms.

It accomplishes this through the real -time integration of a dynamic envir onmental knowledge database. Real -time \"environmental awareness,\" absent in conventional systems, dramatically improves clutter and interference rejection and significantly enhances sensor products. Current radio frequency sensors with adaptive signal pr ocessing estimate the background interference using sample statistical estimation. This necessarily entails an explicit assumption of stationarity. However, sensors operating in real environments around the world demonstrate that this homogeneity assumpt ion is not valid. The problem manifests itself in increased false alarms, decreased target detections, and substantially degraded minimal detectable velocities in GMTI systems. KASSPER leverages the advent of detailed databases and high fidelity models t o address inhomogeneities and non - stationarity at the front end of adaptive signal processing systems. Key technologies include advanced algorithms and high -performance computing architectures capable of memory -intensive adaptive signal processing. The p rogram includes data collections, and a real -time demonstration of its processing gains. The Counter Camouflage, Concealment and Deception (Counter CC&D) program significantly enhances the commander's capability to detect and track targets hidden under fo liage and camouflage. The program is validating Foliage Penetration (FOPEN) target detection and false alarm rejection capabilities. A FOPEN synthetic aperture radar (SAR), developed for demonstration on a manned RC -12 aircraft, provides inputs via tacti cal data links for ground image exploitation.

The Generation After Ne xt Airborne Surveillance Radar (GAN) initiative develops new concepts for wide area coverage airborne ground surveillance radar technology by exploiting wide beam staring systems rather than narrow beam scanning systems. This approach overcomes challenges associated with low revisit rates, limited concurrency of modes, low power efficiency, low resolution, and difficult sensor management problems. The program develops techniques to demonstrate critical concepts, including: (1) very high revisit rates; (2) high concurrency of modes (e.g., simultaneous SAR and GMTI, with potentially every pulse used for every function); (3) high power efficiency (again, every pulse used for every function); (4) high resolution (due to tomographic processing of wide angles); and (5) potentially straightforward sensor management (sensor management becomes a post -processing decision rather than a pre -sensing decision).

A systems integrator has been competitively selected by the FCS program. A group of 31 critical capabilities, with mor e than 100 candidate technology programs, were identified as integral to the baseline FCS configuration . For spiral development and incremental improvement to the FCS baseline, the Program Management Office (PMO) for FCS Technologies has identified multip le spiral insertion windows, and has begun plans for delivering I ncrement II capabilities. As part of the spirals, the program will insert 6 deferred systems, supported by more than 15 possible feeder technology programs, and will manage the potential ins ertion and integration of at least 12 identified technology insertion candidates. Additionally, the PMO will continue to research the technology base, including DARPA, Army, Joint Services, other DoD, industry, and international programs in order to meet future FCS requirements. (U) The Future Combat Systems Lead System Integrator (FCS LSI), with direction from the Program Manager FCS -Technologies (PM FCS - TE), will develop the FCS Technology Development Strategy, the plan for the integration of enabling techn ologies and systems over the life of the FCS program . The LSI will coordinate the development of Transition and Integration Plans for the FCS Increment I deferred systems, and will coordinate and support the identification, maturation, and integration of technologies and systems into the FCS baseline . The LSI will coordinate or conduct System of Systems (SoS) and systems experiments to investigate technology and integration readiness . The LSI will assist Training and Doctrine Command ( TRADOC ) in developi ng operational concepts and requirements documents for Increment II . The LSI will also provide support to the Army Science Board and DARPA in assessing Technology and Concept Candidates for Increment II. (U) Program Plans: Transition ed program from concept a nd technology development to system design and demonstration. Initiate d Force Development Testing and Evaluation activities including limited man -in-the-loop testing. Initiate d concept and technology demonstration (CTD) for follow -on block improvements.

UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R -2 Exhibit) DATE February 2004 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense -wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Land Warfare Technology PE 0603764E , Project LNW -03 UNCLASSIFIED Narrative Title FY 2005 FCS Supporting Technologies 75.499 62.990 62.400 (U) DARPA and the Army identified key areas where technology development is needed to support the overall FCS system of systems design: robotic perception, unmanned ground combat vehicles, maneuver command control and communication (C3), beyond line of sight fires, organic adverse weather unmanned air vehicles and advanced radar and sensor system s. (U) The Perception for Off -road Robotics (PerceptOR) program will identify and develop revolutionary unmanned vehicle perception prototypes. These perception systems will be flexible en ough to operate in off -road environments and will be backed by extensive experimental test data in a variety of operationally relevant terrain and weather conditions. The resulting technology will be applicable to a variety of combat roles and will enable greater confidence in postulating the conditions under which unmanned off -road robotics should be used. The use of advanced remote imagery in aiding off -road navigation will be explored . (U) The Unmanned Ground Combat Vehicle (UGV) program will develop vehi cle prototypes exhibiting advanced performance in endurance, obstacle negotiation, and transportability (small size) based on novel designs unrestrained by the need to accommodate human crews. These prototypes may include unique mobility configurations (t raditional wheeled to organic -mimicking, i.e. crawling), exceptional drivetrains, advanced structures/composites, terrain/soil analysis, sensory exploitation and interaction with robotic control architectures. (U) The UGCV -PerceptOR Integration (UPI) program will exploit the expansion in UGV capability that merges inherent mobility, perception, and use of terrain data into one research platform that also allows for operational UGV considerations via real payload integration. Significant gains in mobility (obs tacle negotiation and associated autonomous mobility), endurance, and payload fraction are expected by allowing the vehicle to operate without embedded crew comfort, protection, and fatigue factors. Smaller and lighter vehicles will be demonstrated, enabl ing a) reduced deployability burden for the associated combat payload, b) reduced combat service support associated with resupply, and c) reduced signatu re for gains in survivability. (U) The Future Combat Systems MultiCell and Dismounted Command and Control program enables experimentation with advanced command and control information technology. MultiCell emulates the functionality of an entire tactical combined arms force . It incorporates both UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R -2 Exhibit) DATE February 2004 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense -wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Land Warfare Technology PE 0603764E , Project LNW -03 UNCLASSIFIED unmanned air and ground robotic platforms, higher headquarters working at the operational level, and human dismounts. MultiCell also provides commanders with recommended interface functions and workload allocations. MultiCell enables them to experimentally validate their understanding of the dynamics of their comple x warfighting organizations. It defines commander interface layouts, functions and displays for maximum fl exibility and effectiveness. It recommends capability enhancements in supporting technology for the nomination of sources of information. It suppor ts visualization of current and future operational states. MultiCell enables commanders to successfully prosecute future command and control operations with significantly reduced staff. (U) The Maneuver C3 program will develop robust, assured and potential ly high data rate connectivity for the Future Combat Systems (FCS) elements along with a command and control architecture to reduce the number of forward deployed Command and Control (C2) operators. The communications component will develop an integrated architecture that provides for a seamless transition from line -of-sight to non -line-of-sight communications. To enable this functionality, development of new secure waveforms, directional antennas and mobile ad hoc networks will be initiated. The C2 comp onent will directly leverage the Army's investment in the automation of the Battlefield Functional Areas within the Army Battle Command System (ABCS). Because of the multitude of single aspect systems that feed information in ABCS, large amounts of data a re made available to the commander, thus requiring a much larger staff of operators and workstation analysts to complete the fusion function of battlefield data into information for the commander to make decisions. Future operations involving FCS technolo gies and operational capabilities cannot be restricted by a less responsive C2 architecture and large support staffs. (U) Under the Maneuver C3 program, the Mobile Networked Multiple -Input/Multiple -Output (MIMO) (MNM) project will pursue MIMO communication sy stems, which have the potential to increase dat a rates by 10 -20 times above current systems. MIMO will use multipath to create parallel channels in the same frequency band thereby increasing spectral efficiency. This effort will demonstrate the MNM capab ility under dynamic urban Non -Line-of-Sight multipath channel conditions where conventional techniques are degraded. This effort will undertake advanced MIMO technology development and perform field demonstrations of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). This effort will culminate in the development of a wideband form -factor (Joint Tactical Radio System ( JTRS) cluster 1 size PC card) system. (U) The Integrated Multifunction Antennas (IMA) project will develop integrated multifunction affordable, low -profile/confo rmal antennas that achieve directionality via the antenna pattern and/or (distributed) arrays. These arrays will provide significant enhancement to signals intelligence (SIGINT), electronic warfare (EW), and JTRS communications functions in low band frequ encies. Research will also be undertaken in this effort that will allow active protection, search, fire control radars, combat identification, and communications in high band frequencies. UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R -2 Exhibit) DATE February 2004 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense -wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Land Warfare Technology PE 0603764E , Project LNW -03 UNCLASSIFIED These antennas will be designed for use by ground combat vehicles with the objective of low profile and conformability. Multifunction affordable, low -profile/conformal antennas at the JTRS and mm -wave bands will significantly increase the combat capability of ground mobile combat vehicles through increased survivability (low visual and electronic signature; active protection function) and networked operations. (U) The FCS C2 program integrates and compresses selected Battlefield Functional Area s in a scaled architecture to support the FCS Unit Cell operations. Through emul ation of advanced information technologies and knowledge base engineering, this program develop s advanced method s of command and control, integrat ing the previous ly stove -piped Battlefield Functional Areas into a single information environment (Commander's Support Environment, CSE) that support s the command and control of manned and unmanned systems. The technical approach is to regulate the flow of information presented to an FCS Commander by moving much of the information/data integration to a hardware/s oftware environment thus allowing the Commander and Battle Managers to leverage existing operational opportunities by focusing on fewer unknowns, and clearly visualize current and future operational end states and dictate the tempo of operations within a v ariety of environments, while being supported by a significantly reduced staff. The true compression and integration of these functions will provide the FCS commander with information for rapid decision making vice numerous data streams requiring analysis by a large battle staff. The compression of these selected functions would enable a reduction of personnel in the Unit Cell C2 element, and facilitate anticipatory planning and adaptive execution by the FCS Commander. A top level C2 architecture (system s and operational) will be developed and validation of the architecture and assessment of performance (e.g., command latencies) will be achieved by conducting a series of four experiments within a simulated environment. (U) The Netfires (formerly Advanced Fir e Support System) program will develop and test a containerized, platform -independent multi - mission weapon concept as an enabling technology element for FCS. NetFires will provide rapid response and lethality in packages requiring significantly fewer pers onnel, decreased logistical support and lower life -cycle costs, while increasing survivability compared to current direct fire gun and missile artillery. NetFires will allow FCS to defeat all known threats, will be air deployable in C -130 (and smaller) ai rcraft, and will enhance the situation awareness and survivability of FCS by providing standoff target acquisition and extended -range, non -line-of-sight engagements. The program will develop and demonstrate a highly flexible modular, multimission precisio n missile and a loitering attack missile that can be remotely commanded. Both missile types will have a self -locating launcher and a command and control system compatible with FCS. (U) The Organic Adverse Weather Air Vehicle program provides FCS direct and i ndirect weapons system targeting under all operating conditions at the small unit level. The approach is to develop adverse weather vehicles for operation at two tiers; an upper tier for wide area coverage and a lower tier that allows a close -up view for positive target identification. For the higher tier, the A160 Vertical Take Off and UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R -2 Exhibit) DATE February 2004 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense -wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Land Warfare Technology PE 0603764E , Project LNW -03 UNCLASSIFIED Landing Unmanned Air Vehicle program will develop a vehicle for carrying out airborne surveillance and targeting against ground targets. The A160 vehicle will further pro vide an airborne communications/data link relay between the various ground components and the command nodes and satellite communications. In addition, the A160 will deploy unmanned ground sensors , unmanned ground vehicles , and Micro Air Vehicles (MAV s) and provide a data link between them and the C2 components. For the lower tier, the Organic Air Vehicle program consists of 2 primary elements: development of lift augmented ducted fan vertical flight vehicles together with their associated flight controls; and evaluation and integration of supporting technologies including non -line-of-sight communications, improved sensor combinations, improved navigation and obstacle avoidance, low -burden multi -vehicle command and control, and acoustic noise reduction . Once the basic flight vehicle is proven, these technologies will be integrated into the flight vehicle and demonstrated in a simulated mission . The OAV program will leverage several programs in DARPA and the services including advanced communications, senso r developments, the MAV ACTD, and UAV command and control programs. The dry system weight (no fuel) of the organic air vehicle to be developed in F Y 2005 will be no greater than 112 lbs. (U) The primary goal of the Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) Advanced Concept Te chnology Demonstration (ACTD) program is to further develop and integrate MAV technologies into militarily useful and affordable backpackable systems suitable for dismounted soldier, marine, and special forces missions. It will focus is on the development of MAVs to accomplish unique military missions, particularly with regard to flight operations in restricted environments. The objective of the MAV ACTD is to demonstrate a backpackable, affordable, easy -to-operate, and responsive reconnaissance and surve illance system. The system will provide the small unit with militarily useful real -time combat information of difficult to observe and/or distant areas or objects. The system will also be employable in a variet y of warfighting environments (f or exam ple: in complex topologies such as mountainous terrain; heavily forested areas; confined spaces; and high concentrations of civilians ). The initial MAV technology development program focused on the technologies and components required to enable flight at small scales, including flight control, power and propulsion, navigation and communications. The MAV ACTD program is intended to get DARPA -developed small, vertical lift UAVs rapidly into the hands of the users for evaluation and evolution of the technologies; development of tactics, techniques and procedures; and to provide a residual operational capability to active duty forces. The program was funded in FY03 under project LNW -01. (U) The Jigsaw program develop s advanced laser radar (LADAR) sensor systems and t echnologies . Jigsaw will enable warfighters to accomplish day/night target identification and verification in stressing environments. Stressing environments include targets hidden by foliage and camouflage, and targets in urban settings, such as alleyway s. Jigsaw technologies will provide warfighters with reliable combat identification; the LADAR sensor will deliver a visual picture of the target scene.

It is developing FOPEN Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) radar. This radar promises persistent, long -term detection and tracking of enemy combat vehicles and di smounted troops moving in open and forested areas of the battl efield. The technology allows Objective Force co mmanders to operate with confidence in forested areas. It also detects low - flying aircraft such as helicopters and ultra -lights. Its synthetic aperture radar images support terrain delimitation, road identification, and target tracking in wooded areas. FORESTER is a UHF -band FOPEN GMTI radar for deployment on rotary wing platforms such as the A160 unmanned helicopter. The radar, operating from a hovering platform under calm wind conditions, can achieve calm -weather detection ranges in excess of 30 km against dismounted troops moving in forested areas. It employs adaptive antenna pro cessing and innovative radar waveforms to overcome radio freque ncy interference and electronic countermeasures in hostile electromagnetic environments. This program was funded in FY 2003 in PE 0603762E, project SGT -04. (U) The Affordable Adaptive Conformal Electronically Steerable Array Radar (AACER) program develops c omponents and technologies for a helicopter -borne surveillance, targeting, and communications capability and integrates them into an airborne system suitable for use on the next generation Unmanned Airborne Vehicles such as A -160. The technologies being d eveloped include: (1) Ka band Electronically Scanned Antenna Arrays (ESA) which lend themselves to affo rdable manufacturing techniques; (2) underlying ESA devices such as phase shifting elements and power amplifiers/combiners which operate at Ka band and are affordable yet support the requirements of a high performance radar system; (3) miniature receiver exciter modules capable of generating waveforms for high performance MTI and SAR radar, for communications functions including Combat Identificat ion, and for growth to higher performance and additional functions in radar and electronic warfare; (4) very high performance, small size and low cost signal processors to support high resolution radar surveillance and tracking functions, target imaging an d geolocation, and communications functions; (5) signal processing algorithms to optimally exploit the inherent capability of the ESA to support multiple functions simultaneously, each with state -of-the-art operational performance ; and (6) integrati on of all technical elements into a functional system that meets UAV platform constraints, is suitable for flight demonstration on manned and unmanned vehicles, and provides a concrete basis for demonstrating the affordability of production units. If successful, this program will provide a vastly improved intelligence and targeting capability for local commanders by providing a dedicated, rapidly taskable asset with the capability to maintain surveillance of a large region of their battlespace, including areas in accessible or obsc ured to larger airborne assets. (U) The Affordable Weapon System Long Gun program will evaluate and develop a re -useable, long endurance, low cost, joint, unmanned/armed missile system combined with a low -cost hyper spectral seeker. Ducted fan propulsion will provide efficient thrust for long UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R -2 Exhibit) DATE February 2004 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense -wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Land Warfare Technology PE 0603764E , Project LNW -03 UNCLASSIFIED endurance. The low cost hyper spectral seeker requires no gyroscopic stabilization. The missile will be launched from a canister carried on a sea or ground vehicle, will fly to a specified target area , and use a hyper spectral seeker operating in visible and near -infrared wavelengths to search for targets. If a qualified target is found, the missile will attack the target with a self -contained munition. If no ta rgets are found, the missile could either be refueled in air, or commanded to return to base. The missile will include a data link back to a human controller/operator to confirm target characteristics, approve engagement , and perform battle damage assessment . (U) The electro -magnetic ( EM) Mortar program will design and demonstrate EM guns (coilgun and railgun) capable of firing modified 120 mm mortar rounds to 420 m/s. The second goal is to evaluate significant system \"trade space issues\" fo r implementation including: 1) a mmunition integration an d compatibility; 2) v ehicle integration concerns; 3) system reliability metrics (Barrel life, EM Interference ); 4) l ethality chan ge due to modification; and 5) s ystem supportability metrics . (U) The DP -5X program will provide a flight -ready, tactically trans portable, vertical take -off and landing unmanned air vehicle ( VTOL UAV ) to integrate with a gimbaled payload for technology demonstration of the JIGSAW sensor package . The UAV will be employable by a two person team and deployable in a single HMMWV . It will provide lift for a 75 lb payload with 6 hours endurance, 100 kts cruising speed, with nap of the earth agility. Multi -mission capability and modularity will allow the DP -5X to rapidly integrate additional payloads for sensing, comm unications, and targ et effects. (U) The Future Combat Systems Studies, Analysis and Experimentation Project enables the continued Joint analysis and integration of enabling future land warfare concepts and technologies into the U .S. Army Future Combat System program . It enables the rapid analysis of opportunistic concepts and technologies, and provides support for Joint Force effectiveness modeling of DARPA enabling technologies by the TRADOC \"Future's Center.\" The project has three initial focus areas: Air Assault Expeditionary Forces (AAEF), USMA Systems Engineering, and Directed Studies. (U) The objective of the FCS International Cooperation program is to establish a Science and Technology Project Agreement with Singapore as well as supporting the conduct of FY 2004 Coalition Int eroperability wargaming analysis with Singapore and the UK using the DARPA developed Joint Semi Automated Forces (JSAF) Simulation and the OSD developed Joint Warfighting Simulation (JWARS). The Singapore Project agreement will initially support the Mecha nized Air Assault, Unmanned Air Vehicles, Coalition Command and Control, and Multispectral Goggles for Dismounted Infantrymen and Scouts.

Sensor DART will leverage and integrate capabilities derived from the SilentEyes small UAV demonstrator and Steel Rattler (hand emplaced) and Steel Eagle (F-15 air emplaced) projects. (U) The WolfPack program will further develop the initial capability for close approach electronic warfare. WolfPack was previously budgeted in PE 0603764E Project LNW -01. The overall effectiveness and efficiency of FCS will be improved by this effort through the development of an advanced, collaborative electronic warfare sensing and attack system. This will lead to improved situational awareness of the battlespace for other FCS platforms and will improve their survivability i n a wide range of potential conflicts. The improved WolfPack system will be able to suppress enemy air defenses, RF communication systems, and networks either through sensing and passing back targeting information to other FCS weapon platforms for kinetic fire or by collaboratively jamming those systems and networks on its own.

It leverages current and emerging network, robotic and information technology. This provides next generation U.S. forces with greatly exp anded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness. The critical constraints facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents are using and adapting network technology to make their systems more flexible and robust and more difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants. Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning. We must acquire an understanding of opponent networks and develop creative options to ta rget them. We must synchronize air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects . Finally, we must still be able to operate against fleeting targets of opportunity. The operational benefit of the Joint Warfare Systems project is an enhanced ability to counter opponents' capabilities, not just their facilities and equipment. This project will support all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic/operational level, by generating targeting options agains t opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the operational/tactical level, by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level, by developing platf orms that can acquire targets of opportunity cued by network -based analysis of likely enemy operations.

These techniques use all -source information to continuously update models of urban networks (e.g., transportation, ene rgy, social). One aim is to elicit operational objectives for urban interventions, expressed in terms of desired and undesired effects. The technology will use these objectives to find vulnerabilities in the networks . It then nominates targets for prose cution so as to maximize desired effects while minimizing undesired effects. Further, the program develops techniques for predicting those observables that will rapidly identify an opponent's response when several courses of action are available. The pro gram enables warfighters to develop effects -based target sets at forward command nodes . It provides commanders a means to anticipate and counter an opponent's workarounds . Finally, it minimizes undesired effects by anticipating downstream consequences an d selecting targets with low risk of collateral damage , permit ing targeting operations to proceed , even within restrictive rules of engagement. (U) Program Plans: Develop tools to: (1) extract relevant information from source data (especially signals, text an d imagery); (2) correlate that information to existing models; (3) update the models while resolving conflicts among sources; and (4) analyze the overall effect of newly discovered changes. Develop tools to analyze networks, singly and in combination, to i dentify vulnerabilities and predict effects of candidate interdictions. Demonstrate selected tools on real -world cases, validating them against historical and natural situations.

The objective is to provide continuous surveillance against limited (one or two) specific target classes. The program employs on -board electro -optics/infrared or low cost radar (motion cue or imagery based detecti on) sensors. It demonstrates an on -weapon automatic target recognition capability to detect the presence of a valid target vehicle and confirm engagement with the human operator . It also is capable of providing image -based, long -duration suppression of n on- emitting surface -to-air and surface -to-surface missiles. The program delivers persistent, on -station munitions that enable rapid weapon response to emerging targets. The program's unmanned mechanisms patrol lines of communication and other delimited r egions to prevent breakout, escape and reinforcement. The program enables suppression of targets emerging from suspect underground facilities. It provides the capability to suppress pop -up electronic warfare threats, before they have the opportunity to e mit. (U) Program Plans: Characterize component capabilities (platform, sensor, and onboard automatic target recognition and data links). Develop and analyze alternative designs, using high fidelity simulation and analysis tools, in a variety of joint mission contexts. Select combinations of components that achieve the most effective system capabilities. Develop a brass board platform, mountable on a standard test aircraft .

It allows commanders, and their staffs, to share situation information ; to develop coordinated bat tle plans ; to generate and compare alternate courses of action; and to assess likely outcomes, all without conventional group briefings. It builds on the paradigm established by the Command Post of the Future program which showed how commanders, working w ith voice -over-IP and robust graphical collaboration software, can build and maintain a coherent understanding of a situation and operational plan withou t any face -to-face interactions . The Command Post of the Future (CPOF) program continues to supply tec hnical improvements to the baseline system deployed with the First Armored Cavalry Division. In particular, it increases network efficiency, analyzes system workload and performance data to tune system control parameters, and modifies display formats to i ncrease the utility of information depicted and shared among the Division and Brigade level command posts. This is a continuation and expansion of CPOF efforts previously budgeted in PE 0603760E, Project CCC -02. The Multiuser, Adaptive Command Environ ment ( MACE) program is an outgrowth of the Command Post of the Future (CPOF) program to make collaborative tactical command more adaptive, cross -functional, and scalable . It implants monitors in the collaboration environment to observe data traffic, ident ify patterns, and proactively move information through the system to meet users' needs more rapidly. It allows users to be distinguished by their military function - intelligence, maneuver, fires, security, logistics - and tailors displays and communicati on modes to those functions. Finally, it scales the environment from the dozens of workstations to hundreds of workstations operating over a diverse set of tactical communication networks. The Network -Centric Situation Assessment program develops and dep loys technologies to assess military situations at levels of interest above individual targets. It uses all -source data to reconstruct unit organizations, mission relationships, logistics connections, and communications connectivity. It analyzes data ove r time to infer movement, communication, and supply patterns. With this context, it analyzes capabilities and hypothesizes future courses of action. The objective is to understand potential capabilities and intentions of opposing forces. This effort pro vides greater understanding of opponents' force structures, capabilities, and operational practices.

It provides a context for discovering vulnerabilities in o pposing forces. It also provides cues for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance planning, as it suggests areas of future enemy activity that may merit more intense scrutiny. The Joint Mission Rehearsal program integrates high -fidelity; mainframe -based combat simulations with situation assessment and planning tools. The objective is to allow rehearsal of joint missions while participants are still at their home stations, or en route to operations. The program uses current situation data to (1) pr ovide initial conditions for the simulations; and (2) to plan data to steer the dynamics of the simulations along the selected courses of action. It streams data from the simulations to display and visualization systems available to the prospective partic ipants. This allows them to interact with the simulation in a manner consistent with their anticipated role in the mission being rehearsed. The program delivers the capability to practice and fine -tune mission plans for joint military operations. It enables commanders and staff to participate from their current location, rather than a training facility. It thereby reduces deployment needs while improving mission planning and effectiveness.

These systems will be developed within the framework of both legacy forces and expected future forces . The result will be to move precision munitions accuracies from meters to centimeters thus allowing very small weapons to be effectively employed; and to provide dismounted soldiers with increased capability and flexibility . The program will be a multi -phase program with frequent user reviews to ensure th at the resulting products are meaningful and affordable .

Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft hav e allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems. Naval forces will play an ever increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces. This project funds the Mobile Undersea Distributed System (MUDS), which includes the Sea Sentry program, the Persistent Ocean Surveillance program, the Warfighting in the Littoral program , and Hologram . The MUDS concept represents the transformation of the LOKI concept (originally budgeted in PE 0603763E in FY 2003) into a more effective, distributed, networked capability. (U) Program Accomplishments/Planned Programs: Narrative Title FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 Mobile Undersea Distributed System (MUDS) Program (formerly Loki Program) 0.000 13.253 25.927 (U) The Mobile Undersea Distributed System (MUDS) originated from the Loki Program in PE 0603763E, Project MRN -02. Pr eliminary results from the Loki program and its associated studies (including the Vortex Combustor testing) indicated that the program goals (enhancing operations in the littorals to counter asymmetric threat posed by diesel submarines and other forces ope rating in the littorals) would be best obtained by distributing efforts (development of a revolutionary \"fighter -like\" submersible and development of associated supporting systems) throughout a networked system. Therefore, the investment in the Loki progr am transitioned in FY 2003 into the Mobile Undersea Distributed Systems (MUDS) program. The network -centric MUDS program includes the Sea Sentry program, the Persistent Ocean Surveillance program, Warfighti ng in the Littoral program, Hologram, and Piranha .

Using covert, mobile, and energy -efficient vehicles, the tactical gain available from the collective intelligence behavior of a swarm of individual agents will be demonstrated. This effort will develop technologies in the areas of agent -based autonomous control; vehicle navigatio n; high data rate/low underwater communications; network management and optimization; sustainable energy concepts; and low power sensing/signal processing enabling covert persistent underwater surveillance in denied areas. The military utility of un derwater gliders will be demonstrated in a sensor system that is configurable in 3D, adaptable to the physical environment for sensing and communications, sustainable by getting its on -station locomotion and 'staying power' from the environment, self -confi gurable using sensory feedback, and self -optimizing using efficient dynamic network management techniques. (U) The Persistent Ocean Surveillance program will combine geolocation techniques such as the global positioning system with station keeping and intra -sensor communication technologies to provide long -term station keeping ocean environment sensing buoys. These technologies when applied with state -of-the-art undersea warfare sensors will result in a floating field of smart sensors capable of observing the undersea environment in an area, including the presence of submarines and other undersea vehicles. A range of technologies will be considered including those that rely on the local environment (such as wind, solar energy, temperature differentials, etc.) for their power, miniature geolocation technologies, and technologies for sensor data storage, transmission, and intra -field communications. (U) The Warfighting in the Littoral program will explore potential technologies for successful operation in the litto ral. It is the vehicle for investigating and developing technologies recommended by the joint DARPA/Navy Littoral Naval Force Architecture Study to explore future concepts and potential technologies for successful operation in areas defended by forces ash ore, mines, submarines, small craft, and anti -ship missiles. Its principal focus is rapid access into contested littorals. The technologies developed will directly affect the ability of Naval Forces to accomplish missions in the world's littorals \u2014some ma y involve significant technical obstacles that, if overcome, would lead to dramatic improvement in capability. Potential transition targets include a broad spectrum of existing and future naval programs. (U) Hologram is an effort to demonstrate technologies necessary for a completely disruptive approach to littoral warfare. This is follow -on from previous efforts including Loki systems development and the Littoral Naval Force Architecture study. The program will include investigating and developing Micro -Autonomous Ocean Craft (MAOC) to spectrally emulate platforms comprising U.S. maritime expeditionary forces. The MAOC will operate in a networked/synchronized fashion, serving as a multi -dimensional counter measure for naval forces.

(U) The Piranha effort will enable submarines to engage elusive maneuvering land and sea targets by exploiting emerging battlefield Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors, wideband networked communications, real -time exploitation targeting algorithms, and existing/planned submarine strike weapon systems. This effort will develop key technologies that enable attack and cruise missile submarines to play a wider role in responding to time -urgent maneuvering targets from a forward -deployed position. The effort will focus on the following key technology areas that enable submarine strike missions in the littorals: continuous asymmetric connectivity to intelligence, sensors, weapons and other vessels while at depth; ISR sensor data exploitation for targeting (sensor -to-weapon handoff); advanced off board sensor concepts to include swarms o f mini unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) for sensing sea targets; mobile underwater Global Positioning System (GPS) concepts; undersea networked sensor communications; and low latency target detection, identification, and geo -referencing.
