It does not contain all of the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist. All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking ORKAMBI against the benefits he/she expects it will have for you. If you have any concerns or questions about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Keep this leaflet with your medicine. You may need to read it again. What ORKAMBI is used for ORKAMBI is for the chronic treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients age 2 years and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. What is cystic fibrosis? Cystic fibrosis is caused by genetic defects that limit the flow of chloride and water through cell membranes. As a result, the mucus in the lungs (and other organs) becomes thick and sticky, clogs the lungs and makes it easier for germs to grow. ORKAMBI is a medicine that works by improving the flow of chloride and water in patients with cystic fibrosis who have a certain genetic defect. How ORKAMBI works ORKAMBI belongs to a group of medicines called \" cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators. \" The CFTR protein is a chloride ion channel that is normally present at the cell surface of epithelial cells where it transports chloride ions out of the cell in multiple organs. In people who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene, the amount of CFTR protein at the cell surface is much lower than normal. The small amount of CFTR protein that reaches the cell surface does not function properly, as the chloride ion channel remains closed more often than normal. ORKAMBI is a combination product that contains: a CFTR corrector (lumacaftor), which increases the amount of working CFTR at the cell surface and a CFTR potentiator (ivacaftor), which makes the CFTR protein at the cell surface function better because the chloride ion channel is open more often. ORKAMBI therefore allows more chloride ions to get transported out of cells in multiple organs. ORKAMBI is not addictive.
