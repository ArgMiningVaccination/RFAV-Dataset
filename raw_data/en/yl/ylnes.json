It remains today one of the major texts on herbs, natural diet and lifestyle and holistic health. Best known for his best-selling herbal Back to Eden, Jethro Kloss was one of America's earliest and most creative soyfoods pioneers. In 1935, while living in Takoma Park, Washington, D.C., after several decades of studying and writing, Kloss published the first edition of what was to become his magnum opus, Back to Eden. A revised and geatly expanded edition was published in 1939. This edition became extremely popular in the late 1960s and by 1986 had sold almost 3 million copies. Here he set forth his method of natural self healing based on herbs, a diet that used no meat, dairy products, or eggs, and a life in harmony with the laws of health and nature. He opposed the use of sugar, spices, pepper, mustard, vinegar, and fermented foods. He recommended the use of soymilk in numerous healing diets and considered it far better than cow's milk. Kloss' main contribution to soyfoods was the more than 50 creative American-style soyfoods recipes he developed in Back to Eden. These included soymilk and tofu, and many dairylike products made from them, including cream cheese, cheese, soy & nut cheese, soymilk cottage cheese and cottage cheese loaf, soy buttermilk, soymilk cream (soymilk with oil whipped in), soymilk ice cream (America's second recipe for it), and soy butter (made from soy flour). Other recipes included canned soybeans, soybean coffee, soy sprouts, sprouts with rice, okara & brown rice patties, soy loaf, soymilk aspic or jelly, mock egg yolks, soymilk & okara pancakes, soymilk gravy, soy oil mayonnaise, soymilk pumpkin pie, whole wheat breads with soy flour and okara, soy & wheat spaghetti, and many soups using soymilk. Kloss called soybeans \"The King of Beans.\" Also in the book he included a 4-page statement excerpted from Dr. J.A. LeClerc of the USDA (Sept. 1936) stating that \"The soybean is going to revolutionize the future of humanity.\" I liked this book. I felt like it was well worth the effort to get through. However, I feel that to get the most out of Kloss' book, you need to find one that was published while he was alive. There are revisions in here that are appalling. Things that he preached against have been put in by editors or his kids or whoever to make it seem like he believed in it (ie vaccinations). Some things are obvious, but others aren't. I plan on finding an older copy for myself. Jehtro Kloss was a great healer. He dedicated his life to learning, and teaching, about; nutrition, personal rights, freedoms, and herbalism. This incredible book was a compulation of his life's work. I love this book! Use it all the time. A close friend entrusted it to me and I make good use of it. If you want to find out about natural herbs and remedies for various ailments, this book has a wealth of information. Inside the pages of this masterpiece Jehtro Kloss even discusses his personal life and influences, making it relate-able and understandable for everyone and anyone who reads it. Preppers will appreciate the sections on farming techniques, crops, growing fruits and vegetables, an extensive listing of fruits, veggies, minerals, vitamins, the history of herbal medicine, herbs, their uses, the body system, the health benefits of water, fish, fresh air, exercise, sleep patterns, oatmeal, fiber, breads, salts, milk, etc. This book is a MUST HAVE for every Bug Out Bag! Cooks and Bakers will appreciate all the baking recipes, natural ways to make breads, cakes, soups and more, as well as hints on preserving vitamins, cooking utensils to avoid and use, and all the desserts and beverages! You will come across a few passages that are out-dated, however; for the most part this book is just as relevant today as the day it was written. I have to HIGHLY RECOMMEND this one for EVERY HOUSEHOLD out there! Back to Eden is often referred to as the bible or herbal medicine. It is a must have for anyone interested in gardening and the healing properties of plants. I never finish reading this book because I refer to it over and over again. A must read for anyone interested in natural health. Especially important for western/eclectic herbalists. Even though i doubt I'll ever agree with him about soy it was amazing how much Jethro intuitively new. Read this in connection to a correspondence course on herbal education that I am taking. Interesting that the author knew about the health problems relating to processed food in the early part of the 1900s when it seems like it is a \"new discovery\" by current authors decrying the same today. If you are knew to herbal cooking, healthy cooking, gardening, healing yourself then you must begin your journey to healthy living with this book. Consider it America's herb Bible. You will want to buy this and keep it in your library because you will have to refer to it often. In fact, I am on my third copy. I bought my first copy in 1989 and I still have ripped cover on my third copy because I use it so much. This obviously isn't a book that you would read through as if it were a novel, but it is an amazing source of information for those who are just a TINY bit leery of the side affects of modern medicine. Jethro Kloss was a true healer and crusader for nutrition, personal rights, freedoms, and herbalism. This huge book was his biggest work and deserves to be celebrated for what it is: a lifetime gathering of intense study and dedication to the good of man. And why, yes, I DO live to sound dramatic. He discusses everything he can think of here. While some of his viewpoints and procedures are now frowned upon - and a few of the herbal remedies taken to the degree he suggests are now believed to be dangerous - the large bulk of his remedies and procedures are still regarded as safe and, in some circles, preferable to things available in modern medicine and society. Everything from his personal life and influences, to farming techniques, crops, growing fruits and vegetables, an extensive listing of fruits, veggies, minerals, vitamins, the history of herbal medicine, herbs, their uses, the body system, the health benefits of water, fish, fresh air, exercise, sleep patterns, oatmeal, fiber, breads, salts, milk, etc is included here. He even gives his favorite baking recipes, natural ways to make breads, cakes, soups and more, as well as hints on preserving vitamins, cooking utensils to avoid and use, not to mention desserts and beverages. One really fascinating thing about this book is the large section devoted to water and hydrotherapy. Here we get a rundown of the history of the water cure, various ways to use water to treat - from saunas to foreign bath treatments - temperatures to use when a person is ill to fit their condition, and much much more. Excellent! This massive bible of sorts ends with various enemas and their purposes, charcoal, guides for people wanting to be a nurse, and different massage techniques. You couldn't ask for much more in one volume. Sure, a little of it is outdated but most of it stands true today and shall forever. The man is to respected, and his remedies and treatments are invaluable. Many of his formula is similar or almost identical to the great Dr. John R Christophers, another pioneer of herbal medicine, the modern Dr. Schulz who has a following of his own, and several other herbalists, naturopaths, massage therapists, hydrotherapists, and nutritionists. And, even more incredibly, it's under 10 bucks to own - amazing considering its offering. The edition I read & used was earlier than this one ( the 70's or 80's ? ) It is amazing for anyone who want's to understand more about specific health-giving properties of natural foods or use natural remedies & foods to improve their health, or overcome a long list of illnesses. Using a diet of natural / fresh foods high in sulfur,I managed to clear up a girlfriend's serious case of acne in just one week ! I liked this one. This time through I read it quickly and didn't take notes. I will definitely sit down and gleen what I can from this man. I can see where Dr. Christopher got his writing style, since this book read very much like one of DC's. He was one to work on a problem with what he had on hand. His advise on food is interesting, but I'm not sure what I think about it yet. Good read. Very resourceful book. Since reading it, I've been more conscientious about what I eat and have been using herbs to heal my body rather than manufactured chemicals. The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is that it's kinda like reading an encyclopedia, which can get tedious. I'm happy I persevered though, as the information in the last chapter was just as useful as that in the first. THIS BOOK IS INCREDIBLE. I HAVE TRIED SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS IN THE BOOK AND EVERY ONE I HAVE TRIED HAS WORKED. THIS GOES TO SHOW THAT MEDICINE CAN BE POISON TO THE BODY. THE BODY IS INCREDIBLE. WE JUST NED TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF IT AND USE THE RIGHT METHODS TO CURE IT. This is for my correspondence class with Susun Weed. It's known as a classic of heroic medicine. My mother's father used it and my mother had a copy when I was growing. I remember looking at the illustration of a fish with a tumor and deciding to go vegetarian. This is similar to Culpepper's Complete Herbal. Jethro Kloss is a more recent figure than Culpepper and this edition includes lengthy letters from his three children, giving insight into the author and what life was like living with him. "}
