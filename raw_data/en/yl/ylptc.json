Based in Richmond and offering one of the UK's most thorough chiropractic assessments, Healing Hands Chiropractic was set up by Dr Sanvir Maharaj to help restore healthy balance to the mind and body following his own transformative chiropractic health journey. Using advanced chiropractic techniques and massage therapy, clients are taken through a transformative healing journey to identify imbalances, causes of the problem, and related symptoms. Part of this process is the Healing Hands' unique 10-step chiropractic assessment, one of the most thorough measurement-based chiropractic assessments available in the UK today, including initial postural analysis, measurements of weight distribution, and a nerve function scan. Following an assessment of the results during a detailed in-person presentation, clients are provided with a personalised healing plan to help bring the body back to a healthy range. In celebration of its 5th Anniversary, Healing Hands is offering 50% off new patient consultations during October including its unique 10-step initial chiropractic check-up and a 45-minute follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and establish the cause of problems. The 5th Anniversary new patient consultation costs \u00a337.50, reduced from \u00a375 when booked in October 2022. Dr Sanvir Maharaj, Founder of Healing Hands Chiropractic said, \"My 5th year of chiropractic school especially helped me develop as a health professional after a serious car accident left me with a shattered right arm and extensive nerve damage. Steel plates were used to piece the bones together but sadly the nerve damage left the arm with barely any function and extremely weak. As a practicing chiropractor, this could have been the end of my career... With the support of family and friends, I devised my own rehabilitation and strengthening program which included regular chiropractic adjustments, exercises, stretches, and visualisations. After a grueling 8 months, I thankfully managed to regain function and strength giving me a second chance at life after perfecting my skills working with one of the largest chiropractic groups in Europe, it was a dream come true to set up my own clinic in London.\" This October, Healing Hands Chiropractic celebrated five successful years as one of West London's leading practices with an evening spent with clients and friends.
