Soci al factors previously associated with vaccination amongst older individuals in Europe were first determined by conducting a comprehensive systematic review. Methods were developed to identify and investigate the recording of these factors in the linked UK EHR data. These methods were then applied in two cohort studies, focussing on herpes zoster (a common debilitating condition in older populations), to identify the social determinants of (a) zoster incidence in the decade before zoster vaccine introduction , 2003 -2013 and (b) uptake of zoster vaccination in 2013 -15 (the first two years after vaccine introduction). The methodological study showed that, among 591,037 individuals aged 65 years , completeness of recording of individual social factors varied fro m 1.6 -80%. The ethnic distribution, and prevalence of deprivation, living alone, living as a couple and care home residence, were all comparable with data from the 2011 English Census. In the first cohort study of 862,470 older individuals, those at highe r risk of zoster in the pre - vaccination era included females, those in care homes, those of White ethnicity and non - immigrants , with increased zoster incidence in these groups ranging from 10 -100%. Known clinical risk factors for zoster ( co-morbidities and immunosuppressive treatment) explained little of these increased risks. In the second cohort study of 35,333 individuals, social factors associated with lower uptake of zoster vaccination included: care home residence (adjusted odds ratio 0.90)), and being of non -White ethnicity (for example: Black ethnicity versus White ethnicity: aOR: Uptake decreased versus most affluent): 0.69 (0.64 -0.75) . Lower uptake was also seen amongst females in the older catch -up group. The findings from this thesis should help inform specific interventions to mitigate zoster vaccine inequalities, including amongst doubly disadvantaged groups (with higher zoster burden and lower vaccine uptake) such as care home residents. The methods developed 5 can also be used to examine other h ealth inequalities in older UK populations. Future linkages to other data sources, such as the Census, would further enhance the availability of information for studies of the social determinants of health. 6 Acknowledgements I have been very lucky to ha ve the guidance and encouragement of Prof. Sara Thomas who is not only my PhD supervisor but also supervised me during my MSc in Epidemiology.

The focus of the thesis is on herpes zoster and it describes the disparities for zoster burden and zoster vaccine uptake. The background section for this thesis has two chapters: Chapter 1 gives a general outline of health inequalities and their impact o n older individuals . It also summarises the biology and epidemiology of herpes zoster . The existing knowledge of the association of social factors with herpes zoster disease burden and vaccination is also discussed , highlighting the gaps in our understand ing which provided the rationale for this PhD research. The end of the chapter describes the aims and objectives, and the overall structure of this thesis. Chapter 2 presents a systematic review and meta -analysis of the association of social factors with v accine uptake amongst older individuals. 21 Chapter 1 . Background 1.1 Health inequalities and their social determinants 1.1.1 Definition Health inequalities can be defined as systematic differences in health amongst different population groups.1 These inequalities may arise due to ge netic or biological variations (for example , women have uterine problems but men do not) or from autonomous choices ( such as choosing an unhealthy lifestyle), or they may be socially produced and therefore unfair and modifiable (for example, if access to a particular treatment varies between different income groups).1-3 Health inequalities, as illustrated in the last example, which are unjust, avoidable, and amenable to interventions result in health inequities, a term that has an ethical and moral basis.3-5 However, in the public health context , the term s health inequity and inequality are often used interchangeably and are considered to be synonymous , as the element of unfairness is implicit in both terminologies.3 In this thes is, in which the focus is on investigating socially generated differences in health, the term health inequalities is used for the most part , except when describing studies that have specifically used the term health inequities. The World Health Organisa tion's (WHO) Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) in 2010 proposed a conceptual framework describing the inter-relationship s between the social determinants of health inequities (Figure 1 -1).4 On the left of the figure (Figure 1 -1) are structural determinants : socioeconomic and political contexts (such as public policies and societal values ) that stratify society into a set of socioeconomic positions based on an individual's income, occupation, education, gender and ethnicity. These structural determinants of health inequities operate through a set of intermediary determinants , comprising individuals' material ci rcumstances (such as housing and employment conditions , ability of buy food ), biological/ behavioural factors (such as substance misuse, physical exercise) and psychosocial factors (such as relationships and social support ).4 The resulting health inequities can further disadvantage individuals who are 22 already socially disadvantaged, for example by affecting th eir income or employment (as shown by the reverse arrow in the Figure 1-1). The actions required to mitigate health inequities should ideally act on both structural and intermediary factors to have a large r impact .4 Figure 1-1 Conceptual framework of social determinants of health * * Reproduced from4 1.1.2 Health inequalities and older individuals A population group particularly vulnerable to health inequalities is older individuals.6 The number of older individuals is growin g rapidly world -wide due to increase s in life expectancy , and the proportion of individuals aged 60 years is expected to nearly double , from ~12% in 2012 to 22% in 2050 .7, 8 In the European Union, the number of individuals aged 65 years is predicted to increase by 53% , from ~19% in 2014 to ~29% by 2080.9 However, this increase in life expectancy does not neces sarily translate into an increase in healthy life expectancy, a term that takes into account both mortality and morbidity and provid es a comprehensive measure of disability -free years , with implications for a country's health and social care expenditure.10, 11 Healthy life expectancy acquires significance as older individuals are at 23 increased risk of di sability not only because of a higher prevalence of chronic conditions but because they are also predisposed to higher mortality and morbidity due to infectious diseases.11, 12 This increased susceptibility to infectious diseases is due to the age-related decline in immune function (immunosenescence ) and may also result from the detrimental effect of chronic conditions and their treatments on immune functions.12 Health inequalities in general have been described for both life expectancy and healthy life expectancy amongst older individu als.13 A 2015 systematic review reported the association of socio -demographic factors such as gender, ethnicity, level of education, socioeconomic class and behavioural factors with disparities in both mortality and disability i.e. healthy life expectancy amongst older individuals.14 In England, gend er and socio -economic differential s (social class, education, wealth and income) have been found to be associated with both life expectancy and healthy life expectancy amongst individuals aged 50 years.13 Psycho -social factor s such as living alone are also known to be associated with higher morbidity and mortality a mongst older individuals.15 Studies have shown that t he burden of certain infectious diseases have a socio -economic gradient making older individuals from disadvantaged social strata more prone to inf ections, resulting in inequalities of infections - related mortality and morbidity .16-19 1.1.3 Reducing health inequ alities Achieving health equality remains a challenging global ambition for governing bodies and health care providers. Reducing health inequalities is an ethical and social obligation. In the UK, promoting equality and reducing inequality in health remains a statutory requirement enshrined under two separate laws: Health and Social Care Act 2012 and Equa lity Act 2010.20, 21 It is also acknowledged as one of the people's rights as set out in the National Health Service ( NHS) constitution, an absolute objective set by the UK Department of Health and other national bodies , and it is a common theme in the area of health improvement for public health.22-28 An important action to reduce health inequalities amongst the older individuals is to first identify their social determinan ts and then plan specific interventions. In fact, one of the WHO's CSDH recommendations to tackle health inequalit ies was to set up global and 24 national surveillance systems to measure these inequalities , and also monitor the equality impact of any interven tions.5 This also includes promoting universal healthy ageing by reducing disabilities resulting from both chronic and infectious diseases. For the latter , a key intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality in all age groups (including o lder individuals ), is vaccination.29, 30 Vaccines administered to older individuals include seasonal influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine for pneumonia. More recently, a vaccine targeting zoster amongst older individuals was introduced. 1.2 Herpes zoster 1.2.1 Aetiology Herpes zoster or shingles is a neurocutaneous dis ease, which occurs due to reactivation of latent varicella -zoster virus, a double -stranded DNA human herpesvirus. Chicken pox or varicella is a common childhood infection that occurs due to primary infection with varicella - zoster virus. Following this prim ary infection, the virus remains dormant in the host's nerve cells.31 The reactivation of the dormant virus in form of zoster occurs due to waning of virus - specific immunity and the virus then migrates along the nerve cell to reach the skin , giving rise to its charact eristic clinical features , as detailed below .31, 32 1.2.2 Clinical characteristics of zoster Zoster is characterised by a painful unilateral vesicular rash in the affected dermatome.33 Patients might also experience pain or sensitive skin in the affected area 2 -3 days prior to the rash.32, 33 The symptoms generally last for ~2 -4 weeks. In some cases, the pain persists leading to the commonest complica tion of zoster in ~5 -30% of individuals with zoster .34, 35 The pain of PHN may be associated with long-term morbidity and can significantly affect quality of life.32, 36 Other less common but serious complications of zoster include stroke, encephalitis, visual i mpairment following ophthalmic zoster, secondary infections of the rash and neuro -muscular conditions.32, 37 25 1.2.3 Zoster d isease burden and risk factors The lifetime risk of zoster is ~10% -30% in the general population with the overall zoster incidence rate ranging from 3 -5/1000 person -years.32, 35, 38. Individuals may also experience more than one episode of zoster, the risk of recurrence varying from 1% to 6%.31, 35 The risk of zoster increases sharply after the age of 50 years with nearly 1 in 2 people experiencing zoster by the age of 85 years ; the age -specific zoster incidence varying from 6 -8/1000 person-years (aged 60 years) to 8-12/1000 person -years (aged 80 years) .31, 32, 35 The quality of life and ability to perform activities of daily living amongst older individuals could be adversely affected by the pain associated with acute zoster , and for some frail individuals it may also lead to permanent loss of independent living .39, 40 The risk of zoster - related complications and their severity , zoster -related hospitalisations and deaths also increases amongst the older age groups, giving rise to a much higher disease burden.35, 41 For example, both the risk of PHN and severity of PHN symptoms increase s with age.35, 42 The higher morbidity resulting from zoster and its complications amongst older individuals is also associated with considerable healthcare costs .41, 43 During 2004 -2013 the average annual hospitalisation costs in England for individuals aged 60 years was estimated to be 10 million ( 95% confidence interval (CI): 9.8 -10.4) based on 2013 nationa l tariff.43 As stated in Section 1.1.2 , increasing age is associated with higher zoster burden due to an age-related decline in immune functions: immunosenescence.12, 32, 44, 45 Zoster -specific immunity is also hypothesized to be related to the age at which chickenpox is acquired , as individuals acquiring chickenpox later in life may have immunity lasting to older age and thus lower risk of zoster .44, 45 Conditions that compromise immune fun ction are major risk factors for zoster. For example, higher risk of zoster is observed in patients with severe immunosuppression due to conditions such as leuk aemia, lymphoma, HIV infection, bo ne marrow transplant and immuno suppressive therapies such as c hemotherapy, radiotherapy and steroids.44-46 In a large matched UK case -control study , some autoimmune conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus er ythematosus , and chronic conditions associated with moderate immunosuppression such as asthma, chronic 26 obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal disease and diabetes , were also identified to be associated with increased zoster risk .44 The association of socio -demographic factors with zoster incidence is described in Section 1.3.2 . 1.2.4 Diagnosis and treatment of zoster A clinical diagnosis of zoster, based on its typical clinical features ( Section 1.2.2 ), is usually accurate.47 The most common differential diagnosis of zoster includes recurrent herpes simplex virus infection.46, 48 Laboratory confirmation is usually obtained by detecting the viral DNA using polymerase chain reaction, which offers rapid confirmation with high sensitivity and specificity .48, 49 This is seldom done for diagnostic purposes, except for atypical present ation of zoster, for example amongst immunocompromised individuals .47 Other diagnostic tests include serological testing for VZV virus antibodies and antigens but they have lower sensitivity and specificity compared to the polymerase chain reaction test.48, 49 Studies that have looked at the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis have shown high positive predi ctive value s.50, 51 A Dutch study compared the clinical diagnosis in primary care with serological testing amongst older immunocompetent individuals.50 Of the total 260 zoster cases diagnosed clinically, 236 cases were serologically confirmed, giving a positive predictive value of 91%.50 The authors acknowled ged that the positive predictive value might have been even higher had a more sensitive confirmatory test such as a polymerase chain reaction test been used .50 In an earlier German study conducted in a dermatology clinic , which utilised a polymerase chain reaction test as the reference test to confirm the clinical diagnosis , all 65 clinically diagnosed cases of zoster were confirmed , giving a positive predictive value of the clinical diag nosis as 100%.51 An important challenge in treating zoster is early initiation of antiviral therapy. Treatment with oral antiviral agents, if initiated within 72 hours of the onset of rash, may reduce the du ration of symptoms.52, 53 However, it is known that most patients do not present to their doctor in time to benefit from the treatment.47 The effectiveness of antiviral therapy, as perceived by the pati ents, is also reported to be low.39 A 2014 Cochrane review also found the effect of antiviral treatment in preventing PHN, an important zoster complication, to be inconclusive.54 27 Due to the limitations of current therapeutic options, zoster prevention becomes central to minimise its burden amongst older individuals. 1.2.5 Prevention of zoster: z oster vaccine In view of the impact that zoster has on older people and the limitations of available treatment ( Section 1.2.4 ), zoster prevention becomes important . The Joint Vaccine Working Group of the European Union, which provided vaccination guidelines for individuals aged 60 years, recommended zoster vaccination to reduce morbidity and promote healthy ageing in 2009 .55 At present, two types of zoster vaccines are available: a live zoster vaccine (Shingr ix\u00ae).56, 57 The inactive vaccine, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in October 2017 and also by the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices , is not yet approved for use in the UK.56, 58 In UK only the live zoster vaccine (Zostavax \u00ae) is curren tly available.59, 60 The efficacy of Zostavax \u00ae to reduce the incidenc e of zoster and was reported confirmed in the post -licensure vaccine effectiveness studies.62, 63 A 2016 Cochrane review, which combined 13 studies on both live (N=10) and inactive zoster vaccines (N=3), also concluded vaccination to be effective amongst older individuals: the risk ratio for zoster incidence amongst the vaccine recipients (reference group: placebo) was 0.49 (95% C I: 0.43 -0.56).64 In order to reduce the zoster disease burden amongst older individuals and based on clinical, epidemiological and vaccine -effectiveness data, in 20 10 the UK Joint Committee o n Vaccination and Immunisation recommended a single -dose zoster vaccination programme for older individuals .59, 65, 66 The national zoster vaccination programme was introduced in September 2013 , which targeted people aged 70 years ( the routine / main target coho rt) and a catch -up programme for older individuals up to the age of 79 years.59, 67, 68 The eligibility for the vaccine was determined based on the an individual's age on 1st of September of the year, for example in 2013, individuals aged 70 years on 01/09/2 013 were targeted as a part of the routine cohort (Table 1 -1).68 The vaccine was also sequentially rolled out to the catch - up cohort as follows: individuals aged 79 years on 01/09/2013, those aged 78 years and 79 years on 01/09/2014 for the year 2014 -2015 , and to those aged 78 years on 01/09/2015 for 28 the year 2015 -2016 .68-70 Moreover, in 2015 -2016, there were three additional cohorts consisting of individuals who had missed vaccination in the previous two years and were aged <80 years (Table 1 -1); in c ontrast there were no additional cohorts in 2014 -2015 due to vaccine shortages.70, 71 Based on the UK Green Book guidance - the zoster vaccine, which is a live vaccine, is contraindicated in individuals with immunosuppressive conditions . These include lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g. acute and chronic leuk aemias, lymphomas), cel lular immune deficiency, immuno suppression due to HIV infection, individuals on immun osuppressi ve treatment with high dose of corticosteroids, biological and non - biological immune -modulating treatments, cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy.60 29 Table 1-1 Eligibility for zost er vaccine in the first three years of the UK national programme Year: z oster vaccination programme Age-based eligibility for zoster vaccine Routine cohort Catch -up cohort Additional cohorts 1/09/2013 to 31/08/2014 Number of cohorts 1 1 None 01/09/2014 years date of birth * Included individuals who missed vaccination in 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 and remain ed eligible till 80 years of age 30 1.2.6 Zoster vaccine uptake in England In England, the zoster vaccination programme was rolled out via general practice with GPs encouraged to administer zoster vaccine at the same as time as the seasonal influenza vaccine.72 A national zoster vaccine uptake surveillance was also established, the data for which is derived from the aggregated coverage data at the general practice -level using automated extraction methods.68 Amongst the routine cohort, the annual uptake of 61.8% during the first year of introduction (2013 -2014) was reduced to 59 % and 54.9% during 2014 -2015 and 2015 -2016, respectively.68-70 The annual uptake during 2013 -2014 for the catch -up cohort (for individuals aged 79 years on 01/09/201 3) was 59.6%, which also declined to 58.5% in 2014 -2015.68, 69 This decline in the uptake also persisted for the catch - up cohort aged 78 years, with uptake reduced from 57.8% (2014 -2015) to 55.5% during 2015 -2016.69, 70 Thus , the national data for annual zoster vaccine uptake in England has show n a gradual decline in uptak e amongst both the routine and the catch -up cohorts in the first three years of its introduction. Some of the reasons identified for the decrease in zoster uptake over these three years of vaccine introduction included decreasing public awareness about the vaccination programme and inefficient GP reminder -recall systems for identifying and calling eligible individuals for zoster vaccination during a busy seasonal influenza vaccination season.70 In each year of the first three years after zoster vaccine was introduced, the majority of vaccine uptake occurred by the end of January (Figure 1 -2), which also marks the end of surveillance period for seasonal influenza vaccine .68-70 This was not a surprising finding for two reasons. Firstly, seasonal influenza vaccine and zoster vaccine can be given simultaneously and GPs were encouraged to co -administer these vaccines.60, 72 Secondly, the eligibility for zoster vaccine is determined by an individual's age in Septembe r, which also marks the start of seasonal influenza vaccination season, and thus co-administrating the two vaccines also becomes logistically convenient from the programme implementation point of view .60, 73 Some US studies have also reported a higher uptake of zoster vaccine amongst those who had received seasonal influenza vaccine.74, 75 31 Figure 1-2 Monthly cumulative zoster vaccine coverage for routine cohorts (2013 - 2016)* *Reproduced from70 1.3 Health inequalities and soci o-demographic factors disease burden and zoster vaccine uptake 1.3.1 Socio -demographic factors To achieve the overall goal of reducing health inequalities and to meet the requirements of equality laws in the UK ( Section 1.1.3 ), the planning and implementation of an y health intervention including vaccination programmes have to be effective and equitable.20, 21 Thus to achieve an equitable zoster vaccination programme and determine its effect on disease burden, it is important to identify the socio -demographic factors associated with both zoster disease burden and zoster vaccine uptake in England. Identification of these factors is essential as it will subsequently help in monitoring an y inequalities in specific socio - demographic groups and aid in planning actions to reduce these inequalities. In the following 32 two sections ( Sections 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 ) soci o-demographic factors associated incidence and vaccination are discussed 1.3.2 Soci o-demographic factors associated with zoster disease burden The association of age with risk of zoster was discussed in Section 1.2.3 . Other socio - demographic factors are detailed here. The risk of zoster is reported to be higher amongst females.44, 45 This female preponderance of the disease could be due to a yet unkno wn genetic predisposition to the disease and/or a reflection of healthcare seeking behaviour .45 Ethnicity is also associated with zoster: individuals of non -White ethnicity have a lower risk of developing zoster.45, 76, 77 The protective effect of non -White ethnicity could be due to genetic factors or due to spending childhood in tropical countries where the average age at varicella infection is later than that observed in temperate countries ; the reasons for this are unclear but may reflect the effect of environmental t emperatures on VZV transmission .78 The lower zoster risk amongst individuals of non-White ethnicity may also be contributed by immune -boosting due to repeated contact s with chickenpox amongst children in extended families .45 However, the evidence for the association of zoster disease burden with other social factors such as immigration , marital status (a possible proxy for social support) and socio -economic status including education has been largely inconclusive.32, 44, 45, 76, 79, 80 The association of soci o-demographic factors with zoster disease burden could be mediated in part by coexisting co -morbidities. Some soci o-demographic groups might be predisposed to certain co -morbidities; these conditions and/or their treatments ( Section 1.2.3 ) in turn may increase an individual's risk of zoster by their effect on cell -mediated immunity.44 In a large matched UK case -control study some of these conditions ( as described in Section 1.2.3 ) and therapies were id entified to be associated with zoster .46 In this study, these association s were still present after adjusting for socio -economic status but the independent association of socio -economic status with zoster incidence was not reported.46 In England, zoster is not a notifiable infection. In 2017, the impact of zos ter vaccination programme on the incidence of zoster was reported but apart from age and gender , no other socio-demographic factors were evaluated.81 33 1.3.3 Socio -demographic factor s associated with zoster vaccine uptake Similar to the zoster disease burden, the association of socio -demographic factors with the uptake of zoster vaccine in Europe is not well described. In England, the data for the national zoster vaccine uptake survei llance provides information only on two social factors: gender and ethnicity.68 A 2017 UK study utilised these national data and reported the association of zoster vaccination for the year 2014 -2015, amongst individuals aged 70 years, with ethnicity and additionally with deprivation.82 The zoster vaccine uptake was reported to be lower amongst those from the most deprived areas (reference group: least deprived) and those of Mixed (White and Black African ) ethnicity (reference group: White - British).82 However, in this study only 35.6% of the individuals with vaccine coverage data had ethnicity data available and the remainder were excluded from the study .82 Moreover, these results have to be interpreted with some caution as no individual -based d ata were available i n the study and thus ethnicity and vaccination data were allocated to the individuals in a manner to ensure that the number vaccinated in each ethnicity strat um matched the aggregated coverage data for that general practice; also the area -level deprivation data was based on the location of the general practice rather than the individual.82 A Dutch study, in which free zoster vaccine (zoster vaccine is not offered routinely in the Nether lands) was provided concurrently with seasonal influenza vaccine found lower zoster vaccine uptake amongst those with higher education level but found no association of age or gender with uptake.83 Further data for the association of socio -demograp hic factors with zoster vaccination are available from other high -income countries from the non -European region such as the US, where the zoster vaccination was approved for use in 2006.84 These US studies have reported higher uptake amongst females, those of non-Hispanic White ethnicity, married individuals and those with high er education and income levels.74, 75, 85, 86 Similarly, in Alberta, Canada , where zoster vaccination is not a part of public funded immunisation programme, uptake was reportedly higher amongst females and those from higher income levels.87 However, it is plausible that these findings may not be generalizable to the publicly funded health system in the UK. Also, zoster vaccine up take has been low in the US (31.1% and 34.2% in 2014 and 2015, respectively) amongst individuals aged 65 years.88, 89 34 Another important social factor which m ay be associated with zoster vaccination is religion. The zoster vaccine (Zostavax \u00ae) consists of porcine gelatine which may compromise its acceptability amongst Muslim and Jewish religions.90 However, so far the association of zoster vaccine uptake with religion has not been assessed in the UK. 1.3.4 \"Double\" inequ alities It is feasible that individuals from specific social groups with a higher burden of zoster may also have lower zoster vaccine uptake. This differential distribution of both burden and vaccine uptake in specific groups may make these individuals \"doubly disadvantaged\" by having a much higher zoster disease burden after the zoster vaccination programme is in place . Identifying socio-demographic groups with not only burden or vaccination inequalities but also the \"doubly disadvantaged\" individuals amongst older individuals is therefore essen tial for planning preventative strategies to mitigate inequalities of zoster burden and to promote healthy ageing. 1.4 Electronic health records This thesis utilised routinely collected anonymised primary care electronic health records (EHR) linked to hospitalisation and deprivation data (detailed in Chapter 3 ) to ascertain inequalities in zoster burden and zoster vaccine uptake amongst older indiv iduals in England. The utility of these data to ascertain ethnicity -associated health inequalities in chronic disease burden have been examined.91 My PhD thesis explored to what extent these large linked primary care EHR can provide information on soci o-demographic factors including ethnicity associated with zoster disease burden and zoster vaccine uptake to supplement/enhance existing surveillance methods. As further discussed i n Chapter 3 , the advantages of using these linked datasets include their very large size allowing for longer follow -up time, the data are population -based that are collected prospectively and using these data also allow more efficient use of limited resour ces. Using EHR also provides an additional advantage of automating the monitoring processes to generate an ongoing cycle of assessment, intervention and re -evaluation. 35 1.5 Thesis rationale, a ims and objectives 1.5.1 Thesis rationale Infection -related mortality and morbidity, which are more likely amongst disadvantaged social groups , can be targeted by effective vaccination to promote healthy ageing and health equality.16, 29, 55 Equitable healthy ageing can also help to minimise t he negative impact of population ageing on a country's healthcare expenditure. Therefor e, tackling inequalities in burden and vaccination of zoster , an infectious disease associated with significant impact on older individuals, becomes an important component to address overall health inequalities in this group . To accomplish this aim it is v ital to first assess the magnitude of these inequalities, if any, which will subsequently inform the design of any appropriate interventions. 1.5.2 Aims and objectives The overarching aim of this PhD was to ascertain inequalities in vaccine -preventable disease burden and vaccine uptake using routinely collected EHR and contribute towards achieving the goal of health equality and healthy ageing amongst older individuals. Specific objectives were as follows: Objective 1 : To summarise and critically appraise the ex isting studies of the social determinants of vaccine uptake by reviewing the literature systematically . Objective 2 : To develop methodology for ascertainment of soci o-demographic factors (including those identified from objective 1) and assess their availa bility in linked electronic health records . These methods were then applied in objective s 3 and 4 as follows: Objective 3 : To describe the association of socio-demographic factors with zoster disease incidence in England , by applying the methodology developed in objective 2 . 36 Objective 4 : To describe the association of socio-demographic factors with zoster vaccine uptake in England , utilising the methods developed under objective 2 .

Identifying social factors for vaccine uptake enables targeted interventions to reduce health inequalities. Objective: To systematically appraise and quantify social factors associated with vaccine uptake amongst individuals aged /C2160 years from Europe. Methods: We searched Medline and Embase from inception to 24/02/2016. The association of vaccine uptake was examined for social factors relevant at an individual level, to provide insight into individuals'environment and enable development of targeted interventions by healthcare providers to deliver equi- table healthcare. Factors included: living alone, marital status, education, income, vaccination costs, area- level deprivation, social class, urban versus rural residence, immigration status and religion. Between-study heterogeneity for each factor was identied using I 2-statistics and Q-statistics, and investigated by stratication and meta-regression analysis. Meta-analysis was conducted, when appropriate, using xed- or random-effects models. Results: From 11,754 titles, 35 eligible studies were identied (uptake of: seasonal influenza vaccine (SIV) only (n = 27) or including pneumococcal vaccine (PV) (n = 5); herpes zoster vaccine (n = 1); pandemic influenza vaccine (n = 1); PV only (n = 1)). Higher SIV uptake was reported for individuals not living alone (summary odds ratios (OR) = 1.39 (95% condence interval (CI): 1.16-1.68). Lower SIV uptake wasobserved in immigrants and in more deprived areas: summary OR = 0.57 (95%CI: 0.47-0.68) and risk ratio = 0.93 (95%CI: 0.92-0.94) respectively. Higher SIV uptake was associated with higher income (OR = 1.26 (95%CI: 1.08-1.47)) and higher education (OR = 1.05 (95%CI: 1-1.11)) in adequately adjustedstudies. Between-study heterogeneity did not appear to result from variation in categorisation of socialfactors, but for education was partly explained by varying vaccination costs (meta-regression analysis p = <0.0001); individuals with higher education had higher vaccine uptake in countries without free vac- cination.Conclusions: Quantication of associations between social factors and lower vaccine uptake, and notably living alone (an overlooked factor in vaccination programmes), should enable health professionals targetspecic social groups to tackle vaccine-related inequalities. /C2112017 The Author(s).

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( Introduction Vaccination is an important intervention to prevent infections amongst older individuals, who have increased susceptibility to infections and often experience more severe outcomes [1-3] .A successful vaccination programme depends not only on vaccineeffectiveness and well-organized programme delivery but also on high vaccination uptake [3]. Inequalities in vaccine uptake amongst older individuals could be related to social factors: thesocial circumstances of living and working [4-6] . Determining the association between social factors and vaccine uptake helpsto quantify any vaccination inequalities in specic population groups and assists health care providers in planning targeted inter- ventions and making any necessary changes to vaccination pro- grammes. The social factors affecting vaccine uptake may vary with age and with the type of vaccine [4-7] . A 2011 systematic review summarised the association of social determinants ofhealth with uptake of a single vaccine (seasonal influenza (SIV)) for older individuals (aged /C2165 years), without quantitative syn- thesis [6]. This previous study found conflicting associations of fac- tors such as education, marital status, ethnicity, socio-economic level and place of residence, without undertaking a comprehensive assessment of between-study heterogeneity [6]. The social factors associated with SIV uptake may be different from other vaccines used for older adults such as pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccines that are not administered annually. The objective of this review was to systematically appraise and quantify the association of social factors with uptake of vaccinesamongst individuals aged /C2160 years from Europe including a detailed between-study heterogeneity assessment when neces-sary. It was anticipated that the studies from the European region may be more homogenous compared to those from low-income settings, making data synthesis more feasible. 2. Methods 2.1. Search strategy This review formed part of a larger search for studies exploring social determinants of vaccine uptake in Europe for all age groups. The wider search ensured that studies spanning different age groups, including subgroups of older individuals, were notpotentially missed. The data sources comprised Medline and Embase, searched from inception to 24/02/2016. Search terms (text words and subject headings) were drawn up for four search con- cepts: social factors, the European region [8], vaccination and uptake. The search included articles, letters and conferenceabstracts published in English. Additionally, reviews of vaccine uptake (worldwide from the last ve years) were searched to iden- tify further European studies. The detailed search strategy is pro- vided in Appendix-1 . Reference lists of all eligible studies and reviews were also searched. To identify social factors associated with vaccine uptake, we adapted the conceptual framework developed by the World HealthOrganisation's Commission on Social Determinants of Health (Appendix-2) [7]for tackling health inequalities globally. This framework provides a comprehensive approach for identifyingcomplex relationships between social factors and inequality, and how to plan and implement interventions. We sought evidence for social factors relevant at an individual level or provided insight into individuals' environment that could assist healthcare provi- ders to target specic social groups for equitable healthcare deliv- ery. The following factors were identied as possible determinants of vaccine uptake: country of birth, religion, urban/rural residence, marital status, living arrangements (living with others versus liv- ing alone), and socio-economic position (education, income (indi- vidual or household), type of health insurance, area-level socio- economic status (SES), social class/occupation). For the purposes of this review, we did not examine factors that were possible medi- ators of the main factors of interest: knowledge, attitude andbeliefs, access to healthcare and health status/co-morbidities (Appendix-2). The titles and abstracts of the records retrieved were screened for full text assessment based on a priori inclusion criteria ( Appen- dix 3 ). Studies reporting the effect of one or more social factor of interest on vaccine uptake amongst individuals aged /C2160 years from Europe [8]were potentially eligible. The outcome was any routine vaccination programme and/or one-off vaccination such as pandemic mass vaccinations or catch-up vaccinations; travel or occupational health vaccinations were excluded. Eligible study designs comprised cross-sectional, ecological, case-control or cohort studies. We further restricted to studies that quantied the relationship between social factors of interest with vaccine uptake by either reporting relative risks or providing raw data2316 A. Jain et al. / Vaccine 35 (2017) 2315-2328 44for their calculation; studies presenting the results of hypothesis testing without reporting effect measures were described narra- tively. Multiple papers describing the same study population were included once. The abstracts of the records that appeared to meet these screening criteria were selected for a full text review. The eligibility criteria were applied by one reviewer (AJ) to the titles/abstracts identied, for full-text assessment. A random sam- ple (10%) of titles considered ineligible were screened indepen- dently by two other reviewers (ST and AJVH) (no disagreements were observed). Of the total records identied for full text review, the eligibility for 10% of the records for which eligibility was ini- tially unclear was resolved by discussion (ST, AJ and AJVH). 2.2. Data extraction Data were extracted by one reviewer (AJ). Information was extracted for: author, study characteristics (year, country, design, size, participants) vaccine types, social factors, effect estimates and confounders used for adjusted effect estimates. 2.3. Quality assessment Quality assessment was performed by one reviewer (AJ) includ- ing detailed discussions with the second reviewer (ST), using theCochrane approach for risk of bias adapted for observational data [9,10] . Risk of bias (categorised as low, high or unclear risk) was assessed for the following ve domains: selection bias, missingdata, misclassication of vaccination status, misclassication of social factors (including consideration of timeliness for time- varying social factors - marital status, living alone, rural/urban res- idence, area-level SES, income and insurance status), and con- founding bias. Details of the bias assessment are provided in the Appendix-4 . 2.4. Data analysis Forest plots of effect estimates (odds ratios (OR) or risk/rate ratios (RR)) were generated for each social factor, stratied by vac-cine type. Raw data were used to calculate ORs if effect estimates were unavailable. The effect estimates from the most appropriate model (ideally, controlling for confounding and not adjusted for mediating variables) were used when available, otherwise the unadjusted estimate was used. For social factors with more than two categories, reported estimates for the highest or lowest cate- gory were selected. To address varying choice of baseline exposure group in different studies, effect estimates for a comparable base- line were re-calculated when possible using raw data; if the expo- sure variable was binary, the effect estimates were reversed forstudies that used a different baseline. Similarly, effect estimates for non-uptake of vaccination were reversed to obtain estimates for vaccine uptake. Studies were described narratively if such com- parisons were impossible or if estimates from probit or linear prob- ability models were presented. Between-study heterogeneity was explored using I 2-statistics and the Cochrane When the I2-statistic conducted. 50%) was for a partic- ular factor, a random effects meta-analysis was conducted if effectestimates were all broadly in the same direction, but was not attempted when effect estimates were in opposing directions as the summary estimate was considered uninformative [11]. Between-study heterogeneity was explored as follows: stratify- ing by vaccine type (influenza vs other vaccine uptake), different effect measures (OR or RR), re-categorising exposures with >2 cat- egories (when feasible) to maximise homogeneity of exposure initions; restricting analyses to studies reporting adequatelyadjusted estimates (Appendix 4 ), and stratifying results by whether the vaccine was available free-of-charge in the country (to see whether costs of vaccination modied effect estimates). Meta-regression analysis was conducted to further investigate heterogeneity for social factors with at least 10 studies, assessing: vaccine type (influenza vs other vaccine uptake); OR/RR as effect estimates; heterogeneity in the categories chosen for the social fac- tor; confounding bias; whether the vaccine was available free-of- charge; and any over-adjustment of effect estimates (inclusion of hypothesized mediating variables in multivariable models). Data were analysed using Stata 14 software package (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). 3. Results A total of 11,754 titles were identied, of which 479 titles (including one title identied from references) were evaluated for full text review ( Appendix-5 ) resulting in 35 eligible studies conducted between 1997 and 2015 (Appendix-6 ). Most were cross-sectional with ve cohort studies and one case-control study. Three studies reported data for more than one European country [12-14] , with the remaining 32 studies conducted in 11 countries (Table 1 ), Spain being the most frequent (n = 11) followed by the UK (n = 5). The studies ascertained uptake of SIV (n = 27), pneumo- coccal vaccine (PV) (n = 1), both SIV and PV (n = 5), SIV and pan- demic influenza vaccine (n = 1), and SIV and herpes zoster vaccine (n = 1). Amongst studies providing effect estimates education was the most frequent social factor investigated (n = 14), followed by living alone (n = 13), and country of birth (n = 11). The least studied fac- tors were health insurance (n = 3) and religion (n = 1) (Table 1 ). Two studies reported effect estimates for some social factors butonly statistical evidence (without effect estimates) for country of birth [15] and for private medical insurance [16] (Appendix-7 ). Nine additional studies [17-25] (Appendix-7 ) that did not provide effect estimates were summarised narratively. 3.1. Quality assessment As shown in Table 2 and Appendix-8 , studies had low risk of bias for outcome and exposure measurement but confounding bias was common. The confounding bias mostly resulted from lack of adjustment for at least one other social factor (Appendix-4 ) in mul- tivariable models. 3.2. Social factors of vaccine uptake 3.2.1. Living alone Of the nine studies considered for meta-analysis, six classied living alone as a binary variable, and for the other three [26-28] studies ''living as a couple\" was compared to living alone. Although results were heterogeneous, studies consistently showed increased uptake amongst those not living alone, with an overall 25% and 53% increase for SIV uptake after restricting analysis to adequately adjusted studies and stratifying by vaccine cost respectively (Fig. 1 ). Re-analysis of living arrangements as a binary variable (Fig. 1 ) did not reduce heterogeneity. Two studies [29,30] categorised living arrangements differently. One (comparing smaller versus larger households) reportedincreased uptake amongst individuals from large households [29], whereas the other (living with children versus not living with children) [30] reported lower vaccine uptake amongst those living with children. The studies that used probit or linear regression models found negative associations between vaccine uptake and housing density [31] and those living with children [14]. The singleA.

Effect of living arrangements and marital status on vaccine uptake.A. Jain et al. / Vaccine 35 (2017) 2315-2328 2321 49UK study that did not provide effect measures, found no associa- tion between living arrangements (categorised as a seven-level variable) and SIV uptake amongst patients admitted to a geriatric ward [20] (Appendix-7 ). 3.2.2 Marital status Four of the seven studies considered in the meta-analysis cate- gorised marital status as a binary variable, for the remaining three studies single status was compared to being married. After strati- cation by vaccine type, 18-53% lower vaccine uptake was observed amongst unmarried individuals in all studies except one [12] with notable between-study heterogeneity (I2= 74%, Fig. 1 ). Reclassify- ing marital status in three studies as a binary variable (unmarried versus married) did not reduce the between-study heterogeneity (Fig. 1 ). Heterogeneity was reduced but still appreciable after restricting analyses to adequately adjusted SIV uptake studies. Results were more homogeneous after stratifying by vaccine cost; in countries in which SIV was free-of-charge, overall uptake amongst unmarried individuals was 30% lower compared to mar- ried individuals (Fig. 1 ), echoing ndings for living arrangements (Fig. 1 ). The studies that used linear probability [14] or probit mod- els[31] also found higher SIV uptake amongst married individuals or those with a partner, as did one of the three Spanish studies thatdid not provide effect measures (uptake 47.8% vs 53%) [21]; the other two Spanish studies found no evidence for an associationbetween marital status and SIV uptake [16,18] (Appendix-7). 3.2.3. Education Twelve studies were considered for meta-analysis (Fig. 2 ). There was no consistent effect of higher education on vaccine uptake after stratication by vaccine-type (I 2> 80%). Results were little changed after re-categorising education in seven studies as a bin-ary variable (education up to ages 12-15 years and >15 years) [16,26,32-36] (Fig. 2 ). Restricting analysis to adequately adjusted studies resulted in a consistent direction of effect (Fig. 2 ) with a summary estimate of 5% higher uptake amongst those with the highest education level. Interestingly, stratication by vaccination cost [32,34,35,37-40] showed marked differences. In countries where the vaccine was provided free-of-charge there was no overall effect of education. In contrast, in countries where a payment for vaccination was nec- essary, higher education was associated with an overall 67% increased odds of SIV uptake. (Fig. 2 ). A reverse effect (20% decreased odds of uptake) was seen in the single Irish study, wherevaccine administration payments are means tested [39,40] . Two studies excluded from meta-analysis reported marginal probabilities: one found no evidence of an association of education level with SIV uptake [31] and the other (including fteen coun- tries) found low education level associated with lower SIV vaccina- tion (linear probability model coefcient = /C00.034) [14]. Four further studies did not provide effect estimates: a Greek study[24] showed higher uptake amongst those with at least primary education whilst three Spanish studies [18,21,22] reported no evi- dence of effect of education on SIV uptake (Appendix-7 ). 3.2.4. Household/individual income The eight studies that reported ORs for income and SIV uptake showed no consistent effect ( Fig. 2 ). Amongst the two studies [27,41] reporting RRs, there was no overall effect of income on SIV uptake ( Fig. 2 ). Despite remaining heterogeneity, results were more consistent after restricting to studies with adequate adjustment for confound- ing, with an overall 26% increased odds of SIV uptake amongst those with higher income, consistent with that observed for the effect of education ( Fig. 2 ). Unlike the ndings for education, in stratied analyses an overall 14% higher odds of SIV uptakeamongst those with higher income was observed in countries offering free-of-charge vaccination [37,40] (Fig. 2 ). However, in a single Irish study [33] where vaccination payment was means tested [40], the effect of higher income was similar to that of higher education: those with higher income had lower odds of SIV uptake(Fig. 2 ). It was not possible to re-classify income status as a binary variable for comparison across studies, and the exploration ofheterogeneity for this aspect was therefore not undertaken. Four studies did not provide effect estimates for the association of income with vaccine uptake (Appendix-7 ). A second Irish study found uptake of both SIV and PV to be higher (p < 0.001) amongstindividuals entitled to free vaccine (possessors of a medical card) compared to those who paid for vaccination [17]. Higher SIV cov- erage was reported for individuals with lower income in urbanareas of Turkey where the vaccination was not available free-of-charge [19]. In contrast, two Spanish studies found no evidence of an association between income and SIV uptake [18,21] . 3.2.5. Urban or rural area of residence Eight of the nine studies (SIV n = 6, SIV and PV n = 3) with effect estimates reported the association of vaccine uptake with the loca- tion of individuals' own homes (urban or rural), whilst one French study [42] investigated thelocation of individuals' nursing homes (Fig. 3 ). No consistent direction of effect was observed for studies reporting ORs for the association of SIV uptake with residence. However, the studies that presented RRs for SIV uptake and ORs for PV uptake found an overall 11% and 15% increase in uptake respectively amongst urban residents (Fig. 3 ). The location of nursing homes had no effect on SIV uptake, but (in contrast to individuals living independently) a lower uptake of PV was observed in residents in urban versus rural nursing homes (Fig. 3 ). Between-study heterogeneity for SIV uptake could not be explained by restricting the analysis to adjusted ORs (Fig. 3 ) and all studies except one [12] offered free vaccination. Again, it was not feasible to re-categorise this exposure as binary variable. A UK study that did not provide effect measures found no asso- ciation between location of general practices and SIV uptake [23]. 3.2.6. Area-level SES Five UK studies reported the association of area-level SES with vaccine uptake (SIV alone n = 3, SIV and pandemic influenzan = 1, SIV and PV n = 1, Fig. 3 ). All but one study reported RRs [43]. The reference group for one study [44] was the third quintile of deprivation in contrast to the other four studies (the baseline group being the least deprived area). The results were similar to the effect of household income (Fig. 2 ), with risk of SIV uptake modestly (7-11%) lower amongst those living in most deprived areas. This effect was seen consis- tently irrespective of vaccine type or measure of effect (Fig. 3 )o r using a different baseline group. All studies were from countriesproviding free-of-charge vaccination and it was not feasible to re-categorise this exposure. 3.2.7. Private medical insurance Two [45,46] of the three studies considered in meta-analysis categorised insurance as a binary variable; one study [47] used a four-level variable ( Appendix-6 ). The latter study compared indi- viduals with private medical insurance to those without insuranceas baseline. After stratication by vaccine types (Fig. 3 ), overall SIV uptake was 67% more likely amongst individuals with private med-ical insurance, but uptake of both SIV and PV was 62% lower (Fig. 3 ). One study [46] provided adequately adjusted estimates; all but one study [47] were conducted in countries that provided vaccine free-of-charge (Fig. 3 ). SIV uptake was 72% higher amongst2322 Jain et al. / Vaccine 35 (2017) 2315-2328 50Fig. 2. Effect of education and income on vaccine uptake.A. Jain et al. / Vaccine 35 (2017) 2315-2328 2323 51Fig. 3.

A Spanish study [16] that did not provide effect measures reported no evidence of association of private medical insurance with SIV uptake ( Appendix-7 ). 3.2.8. Country of birth Nine studies, all except one conducted in Spain, were consid- ered for meta-analysis ( Fig. 4 ). Overall, there was lower uptake of vaccination amongst immigrants irrespective of vaccine type, withuptake 43% and 33% lower for SIV and PV vaccines respectively (Fig. 4 ). The summary effect estimate was near-identical after restricting SIV studies to those with adequate adjustment of con-founding, and after reclassifying country of birth in one study [43] as a binary variable ( Fig. 4 ). Stratication based on vaccine costs was not required as all included countries offered free vaccinations. Two studies from Israel with effect estimates were excluded from meta-analysis, one [32] used a different denition for country of birth (those born in Asia or Africa versus elsewhere) and the sec-ond used marginal probabilities to investigate immigration status; neither found an association with SIV uptake [31]. Two further studies did not provide effect estimates: an Israeli study [25] found statistical evidence for lower uptake of both SIV and PV amongst Russian speakers compared to Arabic speakers, whilst a German study found no evidence for lower SIV uptake amongst immigrants [15]. 3.2.9. Social class/occupation Five studies (SIV: n = 4, SIV and PV: n = 1) provided effect esti- mates for the association of social class with vaccine uptake (Fig. 4 ). There was no consistent effect seen for SIV uptake (I 2= 80.2%), but the single study of PV uptake (from Spain) reported higher uptake amongst individuals from the lowest social class [28]. Between-study heterogeneity could not be explained after restricting to studies with adequate adjustment for confounding or stratifying by vaccine costs (Fig. 4 ), and this exposure could not be consistently re-categorised as a binary variable across stud-ies to further explore between-study heterogeneity. 3.2.10. Religion The one study that provided effect estimates [32], found no strong evidence for an association with SIV uptake (religious ver- sus not religious: OR = 1.71 (95%CI:0.96-3.03)) Another study (no effect estimates provided) [25] reported an association of SIV uptake with place of residence that varied with individuals' reli-gion: amongst Jewish individuals higher uptake was noted in ruralareas compared to urban areas (p < 0.04) whilst the association was reversed amongst Muslim individuals(with higher uptake in urban (80%) compared to rural areas (76%) (Appendix-7 ). 3.3. Meta-regression There were sufcient studies (n = 12) to further examine the reasons for heterogeneity for the association of education withSIV uptake [15,16,28,32-37,48-50] . Multivariable meta-regression analyses included vaccination cost (free versus paid), confounding bias (low or high risk of bias) and 'over-adjustment' (studies that included in multivariable anal- yses variables hypothesized to be on the causal pathway between education and vaccine uptake). There was strong evidence (p < 0.0001) that the association of education with vaccine uptake varied with vaccination costs: in studies from countries (Sweden and Norway) where the population had to pay for vaccination, the ORs were 1.93 times the ORs reported from countries wherevaccines were available free-of-charge for some (e.g. Ireland) orall (e.g. Spain) of the population. There was some evidence (p = 0.05) that between-study heterogeneity could be explained by risk of confounding bias, but little evidence that it was explained by 'over-adjustment' (p = 0.2). All education studies reported ORs and investigated SIV vaccine uptake, and thus the type of effect estimate and vaccines were not examined. Each study categorised education differently making it infeasible to examine this the meta-regression model. Analyses were repeated after excluding the study reporting both SIV and zoster uptake (n = 11), revealing similar results, but the effect 'over-adjustment' could not be investigated in the reduced model due to collinearity. 4. Discussion To our knowledge, this is rst review to quantify systematically the effect of a wide range of social factors on vaccine uptakeamongst older individuals in Europe. Not living alone, an important social factor for this population group, was associated with higher SIV (39%) and PV (71%) uptake. Marital status, which is likely to be highly correlated with living alone, also showed lower uptake of both SIV and PV amongst unmarried individuals in all except one study. Other characteristics associated with lower vaccine uptake included being an immigrant (43% and 33% lower uptake for SIV and PV respectively), and lower area-level deprivation (7% lower uptake for SIV), highlighting that vaccination inequalities continue to exist despite availability of free vaccines. The direction of effect for all these factors remained even after restricting the analyses to studies with low risk of confounding bias. No consistent direction of effect was observed for education. However, restricting analyses to adequately adjusted studies showed a small (5%) overall increase of SIV uptake with higher education. The effect of income also initially appeared heteroge- neous, but amongst adequately adjusted studies that measured ORs (and excluding the single study in which vaccines were not universally supplied free-of-charge), the effect of higher income was consistent with that of higher education. These ndings con- cur with those from a study of individuals aged /C2150 years from 13 European countries, which reported lower utilisation of a rangeof preventative services, including SIV uptake, amongst those with lower income and education [51]. In contrast, there was no evi- dence of an effect of income for the two studies measuring RRs.This could in part be explained by ORs having more extreme values than RRs when the outcome is common [52]. Stratication by vac- cine costs revealed contrasting results for education and income:unlike education, income-related inequalities persisted, withhigher uptake amongst those with higher income in countries offering free-of-charge vaccination. Contrarily in Ireland (where vaccination payment are means-tested) [40], both lower income and lower education were associated with higher uptake. Overall there was no consistent effect of social class on vaccine uptake; between-study heterogeneity could have resulted fromdifferences in the denition used for this exposure, although data were not available to explore this further. The role of urban resi- dence with vaccine uptake was also variable; although summary estimates for two SIV studies (measuring RRs) and for two PV stud-ies (measuring ORs) indicated higher uptake in urban areas, most of the SIV studies showed inconsistent direction of effects for urban residence. Some important determinants such as religion and access to pri- vate medical insurance were not consistently included across stud- ies from different countries. Given increasingly diverse populations and differences in provision of healthcare across Europe, these determinants could be important end-points for future studies.2326 A. Jain et al. / Vaccine 35 (2017) 2315-2328 54Living alone was identied as an important factor associated with lower vaccine uptake in this review and may be an indicator for social isolation [53]. Living alone has emerged as an important determinant of health in older populations. For example, in a 2010systematic review, lack of social relationships was associated with a 50% increase in mortality, comparable to the increased risk resulting from smoking or obesity [54]. Similarly, a 2015 meta- analysis [53] found that living alone was associated with 32% higher mortality (OR 1.32, 95%CI 1.14-1.53). In 2013, approxi- mately 13% of households in the European Union comprised indi- viduals aged /C2165 years living alone [55]. With an increasingly ageing population, the numbers living alone are likely to rise,increasing the importance of preventative measures such as vacci- nations. Interestingly in our review, living with children or increas- ing housing density in some studies was associated with lower SIVuptake, suggesting that not living alone also may have different effects on vaccine uptake depending upon household composition. Our analysis is an important update (with nineteen additional studies) of the previous 2011 systematic review by Nagata et al., which assessed only SIV uptake amongst older individuals [6]. Our review extends the scope to all vaccines given routinely toolder individuals, has provided the results of quantitative synthe- ses, and has carried out extensive investigation of between-study heterogeneity. Our review also included religion as a social factor, incorporates studies prior to 2011 that were not presented in this earlier review [6], and provides more detailed analyses of social factors such as country of birth, individual components of socio-economic position, marital status and living alone. Our review has several strengths. A comprehensive search strat- egy was utilised to identify pertinent social determinants of SIV and other vaccine uptake amongst older populations. Stringent cri- teria for quality assessment were followed. Meta-analyses to obtain summary estimates, and detailed exploration of the causes of between-study heterogeneity using a priori stratication criteria and meta-regression, allowed insight into the complex relation-ships between various social determinants and vaccine uptake in different countries. Our review also has some limitations. A number of the studies included in the review had high risk of confounding bias, and restricting analyses to studies presenting adequately adjusted effect estimates led to a reduced number of studies in these anal- yses. Our use of stratication revealed some causes of between- study heterogeneity. Meta-regression analysis, to further explore the causes for heterogeneity for factors other than education was not feasible due to insufcient numbers of studies. The multivari- able meta-regression analyses for the effect of education indicated that both vaccine costs and confounding bias independently explained some of the heterogeneity in results. In this review theeffect of social isolation or loneliness on vaccine uptake was not examined; individuals living alone may have strong social net- works. The relationship between social isolation and vaccine uptake can perhaps be explored in future research. In addition, we hypothesized correlations between some social factors based on our conceptual framework, but it is possible that other complex inter-relationships between these factors may exist. Finally, we included only studies published in English language, which could have excluded some relevant data. 5. Conclusion This is the rst systematic review that quanties the association of living alone, an important social factor for older individuals,with lower vaccine uptake. This, along with quantication of other factors such as immigration status, deprivation and education level, will help to target older individuals for interventions to mit- igate vaccination inequalities. This review has also highlighted thelimitations of existing studies in terms of study quality andbetween-study heterogeneity. As the role of social factors becomes increasingly recognised for equitable healthcare delivery, the nd- ings of this review should provide guidance to healthcare providers for addressing vaccination inequality amongst older individuals. Our review should also help researchers to design future studies of higher quality with potentially more standardised denitions of social factors.

Letters and conference abstracts reporting quantita tive data were included Publications Published on any date, language: English 67 Appendix 4 Details of bias assessment In the selection bias assessment, response or follow -up rate (depending on the study design) had to be 70% to be classified a low risk of bias. If >30% data were missing, the study was considered to be at high risk of missing data bias. Vaccination status ascertained using records were considered at low risk of bias. For the purposes of this review self -reported vaccination was considere d at low risk of bias. [67-69] Variables that do not change over time, such as country of birth, religion, and (for this older study population) education and occupation were considered unlikely to be misreported by participants. However, the time -varying factors (such as marital status, living alone, place of residence, area -level SES, income and insurance) ascertained more than five years before the outcome were considered at high risk of bias for exposure misclassification. For adequate adjustment for co nfounding all effect estimates needed to be adjusted for gender and at least one other main social factor (Appendix -2) to which the exposure of interest was not deemed to be strongly correlated. For example, effect estimates for the association between mar ital status and vaccine uptake were considered at high risk of confounding bias if they were only adjusted living arrangements (living alone/with others) and gender, as the former was likely to be strongly correlated with marital status.

1/11/2017 using the same methodology as described in the published paper ( Section 2.2 ). The details are described below. 2.4.1 Updated review: results Nine additional studies, published between 25 /02/2016 and 31/10/2017 , were identified in the updated search (and herein referred to as \"2017 -updated search/review\") .82, 92 -99 Eight studies were cross -sectional82, 92 -95, 97 -99 and one was a cohort study.96 The studies reported the association of socio -demographic factors with seasonal influenza vaccine uptake (n=6),92, 93, 95 -97, 99 uptake of zoster vaccine (n=1),82 pneumococcal vaccine uptake (n=1) ,94 and uptake of both seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccine (n=1)98 (Tabl e 2-1). The socio-demographic factors of interest reported in these studies included education (n=5) ,93, 94, 97 -99 living arrangements (n=4),92-94, 97 marital status (n=4),93, 94, 98, 99 area of residence (n=4),92, 97 -99 individual or household income (n=4),92, 97 -99 area-level socio -economic status (n=2) ,82, 96 and country of birth (n=1).95 The studies included data from Spain (n=2),93, 94 France (n=2),92, 96 Poland (n=2),97, 98 UK (n=1),82 Denmark (n=1)99 and Italy (n=1).95 Of the nine studies identified in the 2017 -updated review, four studies were hospital based .93, 94, 97, 98 An overview of the studies is provided in Table 2 -1 in th e same format as the published review paper. The details of these nine additional studies are provided in Appendix 1. 2.4.1.1 Quality assessment of the additional studies Consistent with the published review paper, the studies included in the 2017 -updated review had low risk of exposure and outcome misclassification (Table 2 -2 and Appendix 2) and high risk of confounding bias, mainly due to the unavailability of adjusted es timates in the studies. 90 Table 2-1 Updated literature review: Summary of additional studies area -level COB country of birth Edu education LA living arrangements MS marital status Res residence SIV seasonal influenza vaccine N=study reported no association with vaccine uptake *adequately adjusted estimates based on confounding bias assessment # from the model unadjusted for chronic disease higher vaccine uptake reported lower vaccine uptake reported PV pneumococcal vaccine HZ herpes zoster vaccine 1 most deprived (area -level) versus least deprived (reference) 2 Highest versus lowest income level (reference) 3 Immigrants versus native ( reference) 4 Highest versus lowest education level (reference) 5 Not living alone versus living alone (reference) 6 Single versus married (reference) 7 Urban versus rural area (reference) ^ baseline 2nd and 3rd quartile Social determinants associated with vaccine up take Author Country Study period Sample size Study population Vaccine SES (A)1 Inco2 April- September 2008 7,088 Respondents (aged 65 years) of French National survey on health and disability (people with disabilities were over -represented using a sampling co -efficient) SIV N*# Dominguez93 Spain 2014 1,038 Individuals aged 65 years , admitted via emergency departments to 19 different city hospitals in 7 regions for causes other than respirat ory illnesses SIV N N 3 Dominguez94 Spain September 2013 - September 2014 916 Individuals aged 65 years , admitted via emergency departments to 19 different city hospitals in 7 regions for causes other than respiratory illnesses PV N N 4 Fabiani95 Italy 2012 -2013 27,003 Respondents, aged 65 years, of a multi -purpose survey conducted to gather information ab out health service utilisation amongst Italian residents SIV * 5 Ganczak97 Poland November 2015 - April 2016 230 Consecutive patients aged 65 years admitted to municipal hospital in city of Szczecin SIV N N N 6 Gorska - Ciebiada98 Poland 2013 219 Patients aged 65 years with type 2 diabetes diagnosed at least a year previously and attending the medicine and diabetes outpatient clinics in a university hospital SIV & PV SIV: PV: N N N SIV: PV: N 7 Hellfritzsch99 Denmark February 2016 4,237 Individuals aged 65 -79 years who participated in the 2006 public health survey conducted by Centre for Public Health, Denmark SIV N N N N 8 Ward82 UK 2014 -2015 178,808 Individuals aged 70 years on 01/09/2014 eligible for zoster vaccination between 1 Sept 2014 -31 Aug 2015 and with available ethnicity data, extracted from GP re cords in England HZ Cohort study 9 Gallini96 France 2007 -2009 5,269 Individuals aged 65 years selected from the Fren ch Health Insurance database containing claims for a 1/97th random sample of the French population.

Irrespective of the vaccine type and the measure of eff ect, all studies except one,97 showed a consistent direction of effect, similar to the published review paper, with higher uptake of vaccine amongst individuals who were not livi ng alone. As with the previous analysis, there was considerable between -study heterogeneity. The results remained unchanged when the analysis was restricted to the same five adequately adjusted studies as in the published review, the summary odds for seaso nal influenza vaccine uptake were 25% higher amongst those not living alone compared to those living alone. When the studies were stratified by vaccine costs, the findings were again similar to the published review paper: the summary odds of seasonal influ enza and pneumococcal vaccine uptake were 50% and 42% higher, respectively amongst individuals not living alone in countries where vaccines were available free -of-charge. In countries where seasonal influenza vaccination was paid for, no consistent effect of living arrangements on vaccine uptake was observed in the two studies (including one study97 identified from the 2017 -update). To summarise, living alone was consistently associated with lower vaccine uptake in all except one study, similar to the findings from the published review. 93 Figure 2-1 Association of living arrangements on vaccine upt ake: including studies identified on updating the review 94 B) Marital status The results of meta -analysis after including the four additional studies identified in the 2017 - updated search are shown in the Figure 2 -2.93, 94, 98, 99 Inclusion of these additional studies did not change the findings for the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine from the published review paper, the di rection of effect remained that of lower uptake amongst unmarried individuals, with strong evidence of between -study heterogeneity. There was no evidence of between -study heterogeneity (I -squared=0.0%) for the three pneumococcal vaccine uptake studies (inc luding the two recent studies94, 98 identified in the 2017 -updated search), with the summary estimate of 26% lower uptake amongst unmarried individuals. These observations reflected the findings of the association of living arrangements ( discussed under (A) a bove ). The findings of lower (17% -27%) summary odds for vaccine uptake amongst unmarried individuals after stratifying the studies based on vaccination costs and vaccine types, were similar to those reported in the published review paper. 95 Figure 2-2 Association of marital status on vaccine uptake: including studies identified on updating the review 96 C) Education The results of meta -analysis after including the five additional studie s identified in the 2017 - updated review are shown in Figure 2 -3.93, 94, 97 -99 Again the findings from the published review paper remained unchanged with overall 5% higher odds of uptake amongst those with higher education level when the analysis was rest ricted to the same three adequately adjusted studies. The uptake of both pneumococcal and seasonal influenza vaccine was higher, by 43% and 68% respectively, amongst individuals with a higher level of education in countries where vaccines were paid for (Fi gure 2 -3), echoing the results of the published review paper. The inclusion of three recent studies93, 94, 99 also strengthened the findings of the published review for the countries where vaccines were available free -of-charge: there was no association (summary odds ratio: 1.02 (95%CI: 0.97 -1.06) of seasonal influenza vaccine uptake with education level, while the summary odds of pneumococcal vaccine uptake were 32% lower amongst those with the highest education level. 97 Figure 2-3 Association of education level with vaccine uptake: including studies identified on updating the review 98 D) Household/individual income As described previously, meta -analysis was repeated after including the four additional studies identified in the 2017 -updated search which reported the association of income with vaccine uptake,92, 97 -99 (Figure 2 -4). Again, t he inclusion of these additional studies did not change the findings from the published review ; there was no consistent effect from the studies reporting odds ratios for the association of income with seasonal influenza vaccine uptake. Similar to the findings from the published review, there was no evidence for an overall association (summary risk ratio - 0.99 (95%CI: 0.95 -1.04) of income with seasonal influenza vaccine uptake after adding a third study to the two studies that reported effect estimates as risk ratios (Figure 2 -4). The higher summary odds for seasonal influenza vaccine uptake amongst those with higher income when the analysis was restricted to the adequately adjusted studies and where vac cine was available free -of charge, of 26% and 13% respectively (Figure 2 -4), remained unchanged from the findings of the published review paper. In countries where the seasonal influenza vaccine was paid for, the inclusion of two97, 98 additional studies to the previously identified single study, showed no consistent effect of income on seasonal influenza vaccine uptake. 99 Figure 2-4 Association of income on vaccine uptake: including studies identified on updating the review 100 E) Urban or rural area of residence The results of meta -analysis for the effect of area of residence on vaccine uptake, after including the four additional studies identified in the 2017 -updated search, 92, 97 -99 are shown in Figure 2 -5. As found previously, no consistent effect was observed for the studies reporting odds ratio for the association of an individual's residence with seasonal influenza vaccine uptake after including three additional studies.97-99 Amongst the thr ee studies reporting a risk ratio (including one recent study from France 92 and the two previously described UK studies100, 101) for the association of individual's residence with seasonal influenza vaccine uptake, no consistent effect of residence on vaccine uptake was observed (Figure 2 -5). This latter finding was in contrast from that of the published review where the summary estimate from the two UK studies:100, 101 showed 11% higher uptake amongst urban residents (summary risk ratio 1.11, 95%CI: 1.02 -1.20). The higher (15%) summary odds for pneumococcal vaccine uptake among st individuals residing in urban area after including one additional study,98 as described in the published review, remained unchanged. Similarly no change was observed after the 2017update when analyses were restricted to the adequately adjusted studies and to the countries where vaccines were available free -of- charge. (Figure 2 -5). The 2017 -updated review provided additional information from two Polish studies where vaccinations were not free; 97, 98 the odds of uptake of both seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccines were higher (more than twice) amongst urban residents in these studies. 101 Figure 2-5 Association of residence with vaccine uptake: including studies identified on updating the review 102 F) Area -level socio -economic status Two studies identified from the 2017 -updated search reported the association of area -level socio -economic status with the uptake of seasonal influenza96 and zoster vaccine.82 The findings of the meta -analysis from the publis hed review remained unchanged following the inclusion of these two additional studies (Figure 2 -6); the risk of seasonal influenza uptake remained modestly lower (7 -11%) amongst individuals from most deprived areas. Additional information was available fo r the association of area -level socio -economic status with zoster vaccine uptake from the 2017 -updated review, the odds for zoster vaccine were lower (0.66 (95%CI: 0.64 -0.68)) amongst individuals from the most deprived areas as compared to the baseline gro up of least deprived areas,82 keeping with the finding for other vaccine types from the published review. The reference group for the study reporting the uptake of seasonal influenza v accine identified in the 2017 -updated review, was the second and third quartile of deprivation; the reported adjusted risk ratio amongst those from the lowest quartile of deprivation was 1.00 (0.96 -1.04) and amongst those from the highest quartile of depri vation was 1.02 (0.97 - 1.06) , respectively .96 103 Figure 2-6 Associatio n of area -level socio -economic status with vaccine uptake: including studies identified on updating the review 104 G) Country of birth As described previously for other social factors, the meta -analysis was repeated after including one additional study ident ified in the 2017 -updated review (Figure 2 -7).95 The findings from the published review remained unchanged, the summary odds of uptake were 40% and 33% lower amongst immigrants for both seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, respectively (Figure 2 -7). Similar to the published review there was a s trong evidence of between -study heterogeneity. 105 Figure 2-7 Association of country of birth with vaccine uptake: including studies identified on updating the review 2.5 Chapter summary A systematic review and me ta-analysis of the socio -demographic factors associated with vaccine uptake amongst older individuals was conducted to meet the first objective of this thesis. The factors associated with lower vaccine uptake included living alone, being not married, being an immigrant, individuals with lower -level of education, lower income, 106 residence in rural areas and area with higher level of deprivation. The findings were presented as a published paper. The review was updated in November 2017 and nine additional studie s that identified were included with the studies from the published review paper and the meta -analyses were repeated, which corroborated the findings of the published review paper. One difference was the inclusion of a single extra study from France, that unlike the two UK studies from the published review (which showed slightly higher uptake in urban areas), reported no difference in uptake between urban and rural areas. In the next chapter ( Chapter 3 ), the details of the electronic health data utilised in this thesis are provided and in Chapter 4 I will describe how the socio -demographic factors identified in this review were determined in the electronic data. 107 Methods section The methods section for this thesis has three c hapter s: Chapter 3 describes the different electronic datasets used for the analyses in this thesis. It also presents the methods used to select the study populations from these data for the three observational studies conducted to meet objectives 2-4 of this thesis. Chapte r 4 describes the methods used to identify the social factors of interest in the electronic data that were identified from the findings of the systematic review ( Chapter 2 ). Chapter 5 presents the methods used to ascertain the outcome variables in these d ata, namely herpes zoster and zoster vaccine uptake, as well as all other covariates used in analyses. 108 Chapter 3. Data source s: Electronic Health Records 3.1 Introduction Health care provided by the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK is delivered free at point -of-care.102 The general practice forms the main component of primary care delivered by the NHS, and offer diagnostic, preventative and therapeutic services to the UK population. More than 98% of individuals in England are registered with a general practitioner (GP) and nearly 80% of patient contact in the NHS occur s via general practice; the GP consultation rate during 2 013-2014 was ~5 per person -year.103-105 General practice, considered to b e the most digitalised part of the NHS, began using computers for patients' records in the 1980s and by the middle of the 2000 decade nearly all practices were using EHR at point -of-care.106, 107 In 2004, a pay -for-performance scheme (the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF)) was introduced for general practices in England.108 Under this scheme, GPs are financially incentivised based on their performances against a set of QOF parameters, which are defined annually. General practice EH R are also indispensable when claiming for QOF payments.106 Data from NHS hospitals in England are also available in form of a data warehouse: the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), managed b y NHS Digital.109 These data are recorded by healthcare providers for patient care and payment purposes.109 There are different types of data in HES and these include all admitted patient care data, data for attendances in outpatient departments and accident and eme rgency (A&E) attendances data.109 The HES data are discussed further in Section 3.3. Routinely collected electronic medical data such as thos e described above provide an invaluable data resource for research. Compared to research based on data collected specifically for research purposes, EHR -based research typically offers a quicker, more efficient and less expensive alternative.110 It generally allows larger sample sizes, longer follow -up and assessment for numerous outcomes including rare conditions.110 In England where all residents have access to primary and hospital -based health care that is 109 computerised, the results of EHR -based research are more likely to be generalizable than specific research population. It is also feasible to link primar y care EHR with other data sources such as hospitalisation data, disease registries and death registration data, which makes these an attractive research option.111, 112 It is therefore not surprising that in this era of financial constraints, EHR are increasingly utilised for heal th research and many research groups now specialise in conducting research using EHR.110 However, there are caveats to using EHR data for research. The primary purpose of these data is patient care and not research. Therefore, researchers should consider the completeness and validity of the EHR data. This also includes change s in EHR data over time, for example with changes in clinical, diagnostic and QOF criteria.111 In the following sections, the main electronic health datasets used in this thesis are described, including primary care data, hospitalisation data and deprivation data. 3.2 Primary care EHR: The Clinical Practice Research Datalink The primary care elec tronic health data utilised in this thesis were the anonymised longitudinal UK primary care data provided by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), known as CPRD GOLD.113 The CPRD was initiated in 1987, and provides one of the world's largest repository of primary care dat a for research, which has been used in more than 1000 peer -reviewed publications.113, 114 CPRD GOLD ( herein referred to as CPRD data) covers ~7% of the UK population and is representative of the UK popu lation in terms of gender, age and ethnicity.114 The CPRD software system extrac ts de -identified patient information (Figure 3 -1) from consenting general practices monthly. Patient -identifiable data such as the patient's name, full date of birth, address, and NHS number are not extracted and to maintain patient confidentiality, CPRD p rovides only the year of birth for adult patients.114, 115 As outlined in Section 3.2.3 , CPRD primary care data are also linked to other data such as hospital or deprivation data. These anonymised data are subsequently made available to researchers.115 110 Figure 3-1 Data extraction and linkages by Clinical Practice Research Datalink* *adapted from115 3.2.1 CPRD d ata collection and format As mentioned in Secti on 3.2, the data available in CPRD are collected in general practices, as a part of routine clinical care and therefore the frequency of these records is dependent on a patient's medical circumstances.114 Much of the information in EHR is captured using structured and coded data; free -text being used if required.107 Previously, selected anonymised free text data could be purchased by researchers, ho wever changes in the information governance of CPRD means that these data were no longer available after March 2016 [ Personal communications via email with the CPRD Knowledge Centre ]. The majority of the information (e.g. clinical, administrative and lifes tyle data) is recorded using Read codes (Read Version 2) and other specialist codes (described below), while therapies are record ed using Gemscript codes.107, 114, 116 The aim of coded data entry is to help ensure that recordings are largely consistent, speedy, and retrievable for audit or payment purposes.107 The information received by practices from a range of referral services, EHR from GP CPRD De-identified EHR from GP + Pseudonym ID + De-identified other data Anonymised data Other data e.g. hospitalisation data, deprivation data De-identified data Patient identifiable information Trusted Third Party (NHS Digital): data linkages Pseudonym ID or encrypted identifier for data linkages Researchers EHR Electronic health records; GP general practices; CPRD Clinical Practice Research datalink. 111 Gemscript/ Product code Entity type Read/ Medical codes Patient demographics (e.g. year of birth, gender, family number, marital status), whether the patient met CPRD's quality criteria and details of registration with general practice Details of the general practice (e.g. region, date when the practice achieved CPRD's quality criteria) Details of general practice staff (e.g. gender, role) Date, duration and place of consultation Coded medical history, diagnoses including relevant dates Additional information for clinical events and includes information recorded as entity type code for e.g. entity type code 132 gives information about residence and living alone, entity type code 98 gives information about next of kin for elderly patients Data about referral to other services from primary care Details of immunisations (e.g. date, type, status (advised, given, refused)) Investigations performed Prescribing information from the general practice e.g. total quantity prescribed, duration of prescription, codes for British National Formulary Patient file Practice file Staff fil e Consultation file Clinical file Additional Clinical Details file Referral file Immunisation file Test file Therapy file CPRD data files Main contents Codes in the files Up to eight data fields Consultation type Immstype codes & status Figure 3-2 Clinical Practice Research Datalink: data structure and contents 112 including patient -related correspondence, may be also recorded using coded data.114 CPRD also generates unique codes for the Read and the Gemscript codes called medical codes and product codes respectively, that are available to the researchers. The information captured in the CPRD is formatted in ten different data files (Figure 3 -2). These files provide information about the patient, the general practice and its staff, medical and preventative care provided to the patient, investigations, details of referral and correspondence with specialist care and also include the treatments provided. A patient's demographic details, an overall indicator of whether their data are of acceptab le quality (further described in Section 3.2.2 , below), and their registration details with the practice such as their current registration date and the date they left the practice, are available in the Patient file (Figure 3 -2). It also includes informati on (the family number) to identify other individuals registered with the practice sharing the same address as the patient. The Practice file includes unique practice identifiers for all practices in the database and provides details about the region where the general practice is located, the date when the data were last collected from the practic e (the last collection date ) and the up to standard date (UTS date: discussed in Section 3.2.2 ). The Read codes and corresponding medical codes are present in the Clinical, Referral, Test and Immunisation files while the Gemscript/product codes are available in the Therapy files. In addition to the medical codes, the immunisation files also provide information about of the type of vaccine administered (e.g. seasonal influenza, zoster) and the status of immunisation i.e. whether the vaccination was advised, refused or given. Additional clinical information and test results (for e.g., a patient's weight or blood pressure results) are also available in the form of entit y type codes, which capture additional structured coded data i.e. data recorded in a format that can be identified by the GP computer systems. This entity type field is available in the Clinical, Additional Clinical Details and Test files. Each entity type field may additionally have up to eight data fields (Figure 3 -2) depending upon the type of data file, that gives additional information regarding that entity . With the exception of the Patient, Practice, Staff and Additional Clinical Details files, all CPRD data files provide two date fields associated with 'events' (for example - recording of 113 symptoms and signs, diagnoses, tests, prescriptions): (i) the event d ate, which is the date the event occurred as recorded by the GP and (ii) the system date, the date when the event was recorded on the GP computer system . The details of all medical and product codes are provided by CPRD in the form of medical and product d ictionaries, which can be searched using the supplied Browser Tool function (the Medical Browser tool for medical codes and the Product Browser tool for medications or product codes) to create various code lists for research studies. Similarly, CPRD also provides detailed information for all entity type codes present in the data. 3.2.2 CPRD data quality The validity and reliability of the results of an EHR -based research depend upon the quality of data in terms of both completeness and validity. The introduction of QOF in 2004, which remunerated the GPs for their performance against pre -specified targets, played an important part in improving the quality of some aspects of primary care health records.107 Secondly, CPRD also provides data quality checks at both the patient and the general practice level.114, 117 Patients meeting CPRD's quality criteria are identified in the Patient file by an 'acceptable' flag, which gives an indication about the continuity of their follow -up and the qualit y of their captured data.114, 117 Some of the criteria for labelling patients as 'unacceptable' include invalid recording of: gender, year of birth, current or first r egistration date, transfer out date; age >115 years, and temporary registration.114, 117 It is recommended that patients who do not meet the CPRD's acceptability crit eria should not be included in research projects. At the practice level, the date when a practice meets the CPRD quality assurance criteria is indicated by the UTS date in the Practice file. The quality of the data from the practice is judged on (1) data c ontinuity and (2) any unexpected gaps in the death rate for the practice.114 As with the patient acceptability flag, it is recommended to include the practice data for research purposes only after the UTS date. The validity of the diagnoses recorded in CPRD has been examined in numerous studies.114, 117 A 2010 systematic review summarised the findings and the quality of validation studies 114 for 183 diagnoses recorded in CPRD and reported a high positive predictive value (median value of 89% (ran ge 24 -100%)) for the diagnoses in these data.118 However, this review also found that most validation studies did not report the negative predictive value, specificity and sensitivity for the diagnoses.118 Although overall there is a good comparability of disease rates for a range of diseases estimated using the CPRD with rates from external sources, an overestimation of incidence rates have been observed within these data during the immediate post -registration period for patients.118, 119 This overestimation in rates soon after patient registration may result from either a patient with new onset of symptoms seeking to register with a new GP, or during these earlier visits to the GP a patient's past medical conditions are recorded with the date of the visit, thus being misclassified as ongoing or present conditions.119 Excluding the period immediately following a patient's registration for six months (f or acute conditions) to one year (for chronic conditions) has been shown to minimise this misclassification.119 3.2.3 CPRD: data l inkages General practices in England, subject to their consent, can have their data linked with other datasets at an individual -level. All patients registered with the consenting practices are included for the linkages, unless they opt out. 114 By 2015, linked data were available for up to 75% of the English practices (~57% of all UK practices).114, 120 Some of the other datas ets available for linkages include deprivation data, hospitalisation data, disease registries and death registration data.120 The linkages with these data, which require access to patient identifiable information, are conducted by a trusted third party (NHS Digital).115 The trusted third party provides CPRD with an encrypted linker key, which is common to both primary care records and the linkage da ta (Figure 3 -1).120 For this thesis, CPRD data linked to admitted patient HES data and deprivation (IMD data) were utilised. These two linked data sources are described in the next two sections : Sections 3.3 and 3.4. 3.3 Hospital Episode Statistics As introduced in Section 3.1 , HES includes different types of data such as admitted patient care d ata, A&E attendances and outpatient appointments data.109 In this thesis, the Admitted Patient Care data, which includes administrative and c linical details for all patients admitted 115 in the NHS hospitals in England, were utilised. Unlike other data in HES, the Admitted Patient Care data records full diagnostic information. CPRD provides linkages with Admitted Patient Care HES data from 1997 onw ards as the NHS number, a patient identifier required for data linkages, was introduced in 1997.120 Depending upon the linkage period covered, CPRD provides different sets/ versions of HES data linked to CPRD patients. For example, in this thesis HES version 10 (covering the Admitted Patient Care data for the period: 01/04/1997 -31/03/2014) and version 13 (covering the Admitted Patient Care for the period: 01/04/1997 -29/02/2016) were utilised. Primarily, HES data are used for clinical care and also allow the healthcare providers to be paid for their activities.109 Additionally, these data have non -clinical or secondary uses; they are utilised for the commissioning of health services, planning for future healthcare and research by numerous bodies such as the Department of Health, NHS, local commissioning groups, commercial and national organisations.109 3.3.1 Data collection and format The hospital data are collated by a single data repository, the Secondary Uses Service (SUS) maintained by NHS digital, which extracts this information as a database (HES) and also supplies information to the healthcare commissioners for payme nt purposes.109 The SUS takes extracts from the data submitted by the healthcare providers at predetermined intervals and sends it to HES. Th e HES extracts are available every month, which are cumulative. For example at the start of the financial year the April extract will include data for only one month, but in month 4 the extract will include cumulative data from April -July.109 116 Figure 3-3 Hospital Episode Statistics: data structure In HES, the period of hospitalisation between admission and discharge is known as a 'spell'. Each hospital spell in turn comprises of one or several consultant episodes (Figure 3 -3), each episode being defined as a period of continuous care from one consultant at a single hospital.109 As mentioned earlier in Section 3 .3, HES Admitted Patient Care data consists of individual -level data about clinical diagnoses and hospital procedures during hospitalisation.109 It also includes basic demographic details for the patient (age group, sex, ethnicity, geographical location) and a HES generated patient identifier. Each HES episode has an episode start date, one primary diagnosis and may have up to 19 secondary diagnosis and up to 24 procedures recorded.121 The primary diagnosis for the first episode typically indicates the reason for hospital admission.121 The codes used for recording the clinical diagnoses and procedures are the World Health Organization's 10th revision of International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD -10) and the 4th revision of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys: Classification of Interventions and Procedures (OPCS -4), respectively.122 CPRD supplies the HES data as text tab delimited files with different types o f data content. The HES data files used in this thesis are shown in Figure 3 -4; these included the Patient, Hospitalisation, Episodes, Diagnoses and Procedures files. Hospital Spell Admission Discharge Consultant A Episode 1 Consultant C Episode 3 Consultant B Episode 2 117 Figure 3-4 Hospital Episode Statistics: data format and contents 3.3.2 HES data quality The data captured from the NHS hospitals by the SUS is audited against set standards for validity and completeness.123 Before these data can be made available in the HES data warehouse, NHS Digital removes patient -related sensitive data, carries out data cleaning including removal of duplicate recor ds, performing routine and ad hoc quality checks, and publishing data quality reports.123 The accuracy of diagnoses and procedures coding in data submitted for payment were audited in 2012 -2013 and a mean erro r rate of 11% -16% was found .124 The majority of the errors were reported for secondary diagnoses coding due to poor capture of co -morbidities data.124 However, since the introduction Payment by Results (2004) whereby the hospitals are remunerated based on the coding data, the accuracy of the coding information continues to improve in more recent data.125, 126 Patient Hospitalisations Episodes Diagnoses Procedures Basic patient details including ethnicity* Details of hospitalisation including admission and discharge dates, source of admission (e.g. usual place of residence, care home) Details of episodes, episode start date, ethnicity~ Details of diagnoses including primary diagnosis, ICD -10 codes, episode start date Details of procedures including OPCS codes, episode start date HES data files used in the thesis Contents *HES version 10 ~HES version 13 ICD International Classification of Diseases OPCS Office of Population Censuses and Surveys 118 3.4 Deprivation data Patients' and/or general practices' postcodes in CPRD datab ases can be linked by a trusted third party (NHS Digital) with a small area -based measure of relative deprivation called the English Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), a proxy marker for socio -economic status.127 The IMD is defined at a Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA): an area with an average population of 1500 p eople.128 This index is a composite score of 38 indicators derived from seven domains, which measure different aspects of deprivation including income, employment, education and skills, health and disability, crime, housing and living environment.129 The actual IMD scores are not provided to researchers using CPRD to avoid the risk of identification of LSOA and patients' area of residence. Instead, all LSOA in England are ranked based on their area -level IMD score and are divided into equal groups or quantiles (generally quintiles), which are available to the researchers. Quintile one represents the least deprived and quintile five represents the most deprived quintile.129 There are four English IMD datasets (2004, 2007, 2010 and 2015) available for linkage.120 To mitigate the risk of deductive disclosure of an individual's area of residence, CPRD provides linkage with only one these datasets for any one study.120 3.5 Identifying the study populations In Chapters 6, 7 and 8, the three observational studies conducted to ascertain the recording of social factors amongst older individuals in linked electronic health data and then the application of these methods to examine the socio -demographic determinants of zoster burden and uptake of zoster vaccine are described, respectively. In this section an overview of how the stu dy populations for these three studies were selected from the linked electronic data is provided. 3.5.1 Identifying the study population for the cross -sectional study to ascertain socio -demographic factors and assess their recording in the electronic health reco rd data (objective 2) The CPRD data used for this study was from the January 2015 release, linked to version 10 of the HES data and the 2010 English IMD dat a. To assess both completeness and 119 timeliness of recording of the social factor data, an index date of 01/01/2013 (the start of the year in which zoster vaccination was introduced in England) was chosen.68 The study population was required to be a ged 65 years on 01/01/2013. As only year of birth was available in these dat a (Section 3.2), the common convention of using the mid -year (1st July) to assign study participants' day and month of birth was followed. To ensure data quality, both the individuals and the practices included in the study were required to meet the qualit y requisites set by the CPRD i.e. individuals were required to be acceptable for research ( Section 3.2.2 ). Participants were required to be active (alive and registered with a CPRD practice that was UTS) on the index date (01/01/2013). Active registration on the index date was determined by ensuring patients' start da tes (the later of their current registration date with the practice or the UTS date for the practice) fe ll before the index date and their end dates ( the earliest of their transfer out date, date of death or practice 's last collect ion date) we re after the index date . This led to the inclusion of 591,037 patients from 389 general practices. 3.5.2 Identifying the study population for the cohort study t o describe the socio -demographic factors associated with zoster disease incidence in England (objective 3) This cohort study spanned a period of ten years (01/09/2003 -31/08/2013) prior to the introduction of zoster vaccine in England on 01/09/2013.68 The CPRD dat a utilised for this study was from the January 2016 release, linked to HES data version 10 and 2007 English IMD data (the latter approximately at the midpoint of the study period). The participants were required to have no prior history of zoster, and to b e alive and currently registered with a CPRD practice in England. As described previously ( Section 3.2.2 ), to ensure data quality, only participants categorised as 'acceptable' by the CPRD, were included in the study. Follow -up for each individual started on the latest of: their 65th birthday, one year after their current registration date, the UTS date for the practice or the study start date (01/09/2003) (Figure 3 -5). As discussed in Section 3.2.2 , a period of one year was added to the current registrat ion date to avoid overestimation of zoster incidence in the immediate post - registration period as a patient's past zoster history might be misreported as an ongoing or a 120 presenting complaint.119 The end of follow -up was defined as the earliest of: the patient's transfer out date from the practice, their death date, the date of zoster, the last collection date from the practice or the end o f the study (31/08/2013) (Figure 3 -5). Patients were required to have a minimum follow -up of one day. Figure 3-5 Cohort study ascertaining the socio -demographic factors associated with zoster disease incidence : study follow -up period Two approaches were used to identify and exclude individuals with previous zoster history using CPRD data linked to HES: (1) Patients with a code for zoster or PHN (Appendix 3) prior to the start of follow -up were excluded (2) Individuals for whom the firs t zoster code was that for PHN during the follow -up period were also excluded (Figure 3 -6). Both medical codes and ICD -10 codes130 were utilised to identify individuals with zoster and PHN (Appendix 3). Follow -up starts at the latest of: 1. Age 65 years 2. One year after current registration date 3. Up to standard date of the practice 4. Start of st udy (01/09/2003) Follow -up ends at the earliest of: 1. Transfer out date 2. Death date 3. Last collection date from practice 4. Zoster date 5. End of study (31/08/2013) Individuals with no previous history of zoster Study period: 01/09/2003 -31/08/2013 (10 years) 121 Figure 3-6 individuals' history of zoster or post -herpetic neuralgia The number of patients meeting the above defined eligibility criteria was 931,830 from 385 practices in En gland. Of these participants, 69,360 (7.4%) individuals were excluded due to a prior history of zoster (Figure 3 -7).

This cohort study spanned the first two years following the introduction of zoster vaccine in England, from 01/09/2013 until 31/08/2015.68 Follow -up started on 01/09/2013 (start of national programme) and all participants we re required to be \"acceptable\" ( Section 3.2.2 ), alive and currently registered with a UTS CPRD practice in England on this date. Follow -up ended at the earliest of: the patient's transfer out date, death date, the date data were last collected from the pra ctice or the end of the study (31/08/2015) (Figure 3 -8). To allow sufficient time for the individuals to be invited for vaccination and the possibility of co -administration of zoster vaccine with seasonal influenza vaccine amongst the older population, the study participants were required to have a minimum follow -up of 5 months (September 1st until the end of January 2013), which coincided with the main part of the seasonal influenza vaccination campaign.131 As zoster vaccine was available to a limited extent (privately at first followed by availability on the NHS based on GP's discretion) prior to the introduction of the national programme, any individuals with a zoster vacci ne code prior to 01/09/2013 were also excluded from the study.132, 133 123 Figure 3-8 Cohort study ascertaining the socio -demographic factors associated with zoster vaccin e uptake: study follow -up period 3.5.3.1 Identifying individuals eligible for zoster vaccination In England zoster vaccine is offered routinely to individuals aged 70 years on 1st of September of the corresponding vaccination year, with a catch -up amongst older individuals as detailed in Section 1.2.5 and Table 1 -1. For this study, which spanned a two -year period (2013 -2015), the routine cohort eligible for vaccination comprised of individuals born between 0 2/9/1942 -1/9/1943 for the first vaccination year (2013 -2014) and those born 02/9/1943 -1/9/1944 for the second vaccination year (2014 -2015) (Table 1 -1). As discussed previously, to maintain patient confidentiality, only year of b irth is available for adults in CPRD data. This posed a problem in how to identify an individual's age -based eligibility for zoster vaccine during the study period. The common convention of assigning individuals with a nominal birth of 1st July would misclassify some individuals' eligibility. For example, during the 2013 -2014 vaccination year, individuals born between 02/09/1942 -01/09/1943 and aged 70 years on 01/09/2013 were eligible for vaccination as a part of the routine cohort. The assigned date of birth for those born between 02/09/1942 -31/12/1942 would be 01/07/1942, therefore misclassifying all these individuals as ineligible as their CPRD age on 01/09/2013 would be 71 years (Figure 3 -9). On the other hand, individuals born between 0 1/01/1943 - 01/09/1943, with an assigned date of birth as 01/07/1943 and aged 70 years on 01/09/2013 Follow -up starts on 01/09/2013 (start of the national vaccination programme) Follow -up ends Earliest of: 1. Transfer out date 2. Death date 3. Last collection date from the practice 4. End of study (31/08/2015) Individuals eligible for zoster vaccination Study period: 01/09/2013 -31/08/2015 (2 years) 124 would be correctly identified as eligible. The remaining group of individuals, those born between 02/09/1943 -31/12/1943 with an assigned date of birth of 01/ 07/1943 would be incorrectly identified as eligible (Figure 3 -9). Importantly, the inclusion of this latter group could bias the effect estimates for vaccine uptake for the socio -demographic factors of interest because the unvaccinated group would comprise a mixture of individuals with possibly differing socio -demographic factors : a) those eligible for vaccination who chose not to be vaccinated and b) those ineligible on the grounds of age (Figure 3 -9). To address this, all individuals born in 1943 (or 193 4 for the catch -up cohort), who would have been eligible for the vaccine in 2013/14 (if born between January -August) or in 2014/15 (if born between September -December) were selected to investigate vaccine uptake for the 2-year study period (Figures 3 -9 and 3-10). The study population therefore comprised individuals born in 1943 ( the routine cohort , Figure 3 -9) and in 1934 ( the catch -up cohort, Figure 3 -10). 3.5.3.2 Excluding patients with immunosuppressive conditions and treatments As zoster vaccine contains the li ve attenuated virus, the UK Green book provides guidance about contraindications to its administration amongst individuals with certain immunosuppressive conditions and treatment ( Section 1.2.5 ).60 To ascertain eligibility for zoster vaccination, individuals with the following conditions and treatments were identified and excluded at the start of follow -up. These conditions included: leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma, other plasma cell dyscrasias, stem cell transplant, bone marrow tr ansplant , solid organ transplants, Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection and c ellular immune deficiency .60 The immunosuppressive treatments ( Section 1.2.5 ) comprised: biological therapies, other agents such as tacrolimus, disease modifying anti - rheumatic drugs such as ciclosporin, specific doses for some of these: azathioprine, methotrexate, 6 -mercaptopurine, steroids; cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy.60 The details of how these immunosuppressive conditions and treatment were identified in the linked CPRD data are provided in Chapter 5 (Section 5.5 ).125 Figure 3-9 Individuals included in the zoster vaccine uptake cohort study during 2013 -2015 based on year of birth in Clinical Practice Research Datalink: routine cohort 126 Figure 3-10 Individuals included in the zoster vaccine uptake cohort study during 2013 -2015 based on year of birth in Clinical Practice Research Datalink: catch -up cohort 127 3.6 Data management Data were analyse d usin g Stata\u00ae14 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) . In Chapters 4 and 5 details of how I identified the exposure and outcome variables in these data including the other covariates used in the analyses, are provided. I first generated the patient de nominator files for the different studies from the Patient and Practice files in CPRD data to identify eligible individuals for each study. The patient list thus created was used to identify their records in all the remaining CPRD data files. Information for the variables of interest was extracted using code lists, which were generated using both text terms and hierarchical searches of the relevant Read codes applied to the CPRD's Medical Browser tool. Similarly, for drugs and therapeutic agents, a list of product codes was generated using the CPRD's Product Browser tool ( Section 3.2.1 ). In addition to code lists, information was also captured from the Patient file, Consultation file (using consultation type codes) and the structured coded data in these rec ords (entity type codes). Information as to when data were recorded was extracted using event dates and system dates ( Section 3.2.1 ). As discussed in Section 3.2.1 , the Additional Clinical Details files does not have dates showing when any entity type code was recorded. However, it is feasible to link the Clinical details file with the Additional Clinical Details file using the specific identifier present in both files. This allows an event date which is present in the Clinical file to be associated with an entity type code recorded in the Additional Clinical Details file (Section 3.2.1 ). I brought together the information from these different sources using specific algorithms where necessary (as described in the relevant sections of Chapter 4 for socio -demo graphic factors of interest, and of Chapter 5 for the outcome of interest and other variables used in analyses). In HES, code lists were generated to identify ICD -10 codes for the conditions of interest. Similarly, OPCS code lists were created to identify procedures (for example, bone marrow transplants) performed in hospital. The list of patients eligible for inclusion in the study was merged with the Patient, Hospitalisation, Episodes and Diagnoses files in the HES data. The resultant file comprising eli gible patients' hospitalisation records was subsequently used to 128 identify the ICD -10 codes of interest from the ICD -10 code lists generated. The Procedures file was used to select the OPCS codes of interest from the OPCS code lists. 3.7 Ethics All data were an onymised prior to receipt by the candidate. Objective 2 : Approval for this study was obtained from the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency Database Research (Ref: 15_253 ). The study was also approved by the Obse rvational Research Ethics Committee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (reference: 10524 ). Objectives 3 and 4 : The protocol for this research was approved by the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency Database Research (protocol number 16_168 ). The study was also approved by the Obse rvational Research Ethics Committee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ( Reference : 11910 ). 3.8 Chapter summary This thesis utilised CPRD data, one of the world's largest repository of routinely collected primary care electronic health data, linked to hospitalisation data (HES) and deprivation data (IMD) from England. These quality -assured primary care data are generally representative and cover ~7% of the UK population. In this chapter I described the nature of the data sources and how I selected the study population for the three different observational studies from the linked CPRD data, conducted to meet objectives 2, 3 and 4 of this thesis . In the next chapter ( Chapter 4 ), I describe the methods I used to identify the socio - demographic factors of interest (exposure variables), including age, gender, ethnicity and the relevant socio -demographic factors id entified from the systematic review ( Chapter 2 ) in these linked data. 129 Chapter 4 . Defining social factors in electronic health records In this chapter (the second of the three methods chapters in this thesis), I describe the following - (1) the rationale for selecting the socio -demographic factors considered for further investigation, (2) the electronic data sources used to identify these factors, (3) identification of socio -demographic factors in linked electronic data and (4) how data al gorithms were developed and categorisation for each factor was carried out. Th e results of analyses to assess the completeness, timeliness and representativeness of recording for these socio - demographic variables in the electronic health data are described under the Results section (Chapter 6 ). 4.1 Rationale for selecting the socio -demographic factors The factors examined were chosen if they were considered relevant at an individual level, informed by my systematic review ( Chapter 2 ) that was based on the WHO CSDH's conceptual framework ( Section 1.1.1 ) (Figure 1 -1), and if they were potentially available in the li nked CPRD data.4 Apart from age and gender, the seven socio -demographic factors of interest included: ethnicity, immigration status, religion, living ar rangements (including two closely -related variables: living alone and cohabitation (living as a couple) ),134 marital (relationship) status, residence and deprivation ( the latter available as linked data). Of t hese factors , immigration status, living arrangements, residence, marital status and area -level deprivation were identified as important determinants of vaccine uptake from the findings of my systematic review (Chapter 2 ). The review also highlighted the lack of availability of studies examining the association of religion with vaccine uptake. Also, as discussed earlier ( Section 1.3.3 ), the zoster vaccine used in the UK includes porcine components which may compromise its acceptability amongst some religiou s groups . Therefore religion was included as one of the factors examined in this thesis. Place of residence , which was examined as a binary variable 130 in the systematic review ( as urban versus rural area of residence ), was examined in greater detail , as desc ribed later ( Section 4.4 ). Ethnicity was included because of its association with both zoster disease burden and zoster vaccine uptake , as previously described (Sections 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 ) and to allow comparisons of this thesis ' findings with the analyses of zoster vaccine uptake that had been carried out using the national data , which included ethnicity (Section 1.3.3 ).82 The additional rationale for including specific socio- demographic factors in the analyses conducted to meet Objectives 2-4 are described in Chapters 6 -8. 4.2 Electronic health data for ascertainment of socio -demographic factors As discussed in Chapter 3 , the electronic health data utilised for analyses compris ed CPRD, HES and IMD data. Information for socio -demographic factors was extracted from all three sources, as described below. 4.2.1 CPRD data The data structure of CPRD was detailed in Section 3.2 . Information about the socio - demographic factors of interest was gathered from different data files ( Section 3.2.1 ) available in this primary care database. Information was obtained from (1) coded data available in different data files and (2) using more targeted information in specific data fields within these files ( Figure 4 -1). To extract information recorded as coded data, specific code lists ( Section 4.3 ) were generated for each factor, while information from the specific data fields in the Patient files was extracted using specific criteria ( Section 4.4 ). Code li sts comprised medical, entity type and consultation type codes. Medical codes were utilised to gather information for specific socio -demographic factors from the Clinical, Immunisation, Referral and Test files (Figure 4 -1). Entity type codes available in t he Additional Clinical Details files and the place where the consultation with the GP took place (consultation type codes) was taken from the Consultation files. Targeted information from specific data fields available in the Patient file (Figure 4 -1) included gender, year of birth, marital status and family number. Family number , as 131 described previously in Section 3.2.1 , is a practice -specific data field based on a patient's address.135 This number may help to identify individuals registered with the same practice who may be sharing a household. Apart from the same households, famil y number may also represent patients with the same address from institutions such as long -term hospital care (e.g. neuro -disability), sheltered accommodation, prisons or even under some circumstances a block of flat s.136 This field is generated by the general practice software when a patient registers with a GP or moves address but it is unclear as to how often t he family number field is updated with changes in address [Personal communications via email CPRD Knowledge Centre ]. Family number was used to provide information for the following social factors: residence, living arrangements (cohabitation and living alo ne) and marital status (Figure 4 -1), further details are provided in Section 4. 3. 132 Figure 4-1 Information for socio -demographic factors from Clinical Practice Research Datalink data 133 4.2.2 HES data The data structure of HES was described in Section 3.3 . The data for socio -demographic factors were gathered from the Patient, Hospitalisation and Episodes files of HES (Figure 4 - 2). The basic demographic (ethnicity) information abo ut individuals was obtained from the Patient and Episodes file ( Section 4.3.3 ). Information was also accrued from the source of admission codes in the Hospitalisation file. (Figure 4 -2). 4.2.3 IMD data As described in Section 3.4 , CPRD provides information on patient - and general practice - level deprivation data as linked datasets. Further details on how the IMD data were categorised for use in the analyses are provided in Section 4.5 . 134 Figure 4-2.

Further information was also obtained from data held within the Patient file of CPRD. The code lists of CPRD medical codes for soci o-demographic factors except ethnicity w ere developed by Prof. Sara Thomas. I went through the se medical code s to assess if I concurred with the se codes and any differences were resolved by discussion . Ethnicity codes for both CPRD and HES data were those used previously by Mathur et al. and recommended for use under QOF.137 I identified other types of codes (entity type codes and consultation type codes) for social factors of interest from the Additional Clinical Details file and the Consultation files of CPRD (Figure 4-1). I also identified relevant socio -demo graphic factor codes available in the Patient file of HES data (Figure 4 -2). The code lists generated for use in the different data sources were then combined to generate final code lists for each factor after discussions amongst Prof. Sara Thomas, Dr AJ v an Hoek and myself. The details of the development of code lists for specific socio -demographic factors is described in the following sections. As mentioned in Section 4.2.1 , four data fields: year of birth, gender, marital status and family number, avail able in the Patient file of CPRD data (Figure 4 -1) were also utilised to gather information for socio -demographic factors. Information from the family number field was obtained as described below. Information from family number available in the Patient fil e of CPRD As mentioned briefly in Section 4.2.1 , family number is a general practice -specific data field based on a patient's address.135 As family number is not a unique entity across all general practices in CPRD, I created a unique identifi er by combining both the practice identification number and the family number. This unique number was subsequently used to identify individuals sharing the same family number (i.e. likely to be from the same household) within 136 the same practice . This allowed identification of study participants who shared the same family number (and with other individuals in the general practice who were not part of the study population) (Figure 4 -3). Figure 4-3 Identifying individuals sharing a family number in general practices Family number was utilised to provide information for residence, living arrangements (cohabitation and living alone) and marital status for the cross -sectional study ( objective 2 ) and the two cohort studies ( objectives 3 and 4 ). For the cross -sectional stu dy, individuals sharing same household as the study patients were required to be actively registered on the index date of interest (01/01/2013) and their age was also ascertained on this date . For the two cohort studies, individuals sharing the same househ old had to be actively registered with the practice at the start of follow -up of the study participant and their age (which was required for the development of algorithms to extract relevant information and is discussed for each specific factor below) was also determined on this date. General practice 1 General practice 2 Key: Other patients in the practice Study patient in the practice Study patient sharing family number with other patient in the same practice Study patient sharing family number with another study patient in the same practice Putative household 137 I will now describe how the code lists for specific socio -demographic factors were developed and how the information from the Patient file including family number was utilised to identify specific factors in the linked data . 4.3.1 Age Age was estimated from year of birth available in the Patient file (Figure 4 -1) by the common convention of using the 1st of July (mid-year) to assign study participants' day and month of birth. 4.3.2 Gender The categorisation of gender available in the Patient file is discussed in Section 4. 4. 4.3.3 Ethnicity As mentioned in Section 4.3 above, the codes used for identifying ethnicity from the linked CPRD data (Figures 4 -1 and 4 -2) were those used by Mathur et al.137 The code list is provided in Appendix 4 and consisted of 183 codes. The medical codes were sought in the Clinical, Referral, T est and Immunisation files of the CPRD dataset (Figure 4 -4). In the HES data, information on ethnicity was captured from the Patient file (HES version 10) or the Episodes file (HES ve rsion 13) . The site for ethnicity codes in the HES data changed over time and I found that it was available in the Episodes file of HES version 13 unlike the HES version 10 where this information was available in the Patient file. The implications of this finding for extracting ethnicity information from HES are described further in Section 4.4 . 138 Figure 4-4 Ascertainment of socio -demographic factors in linked Clinical Practice Research Datalink 139 4.3.4 Immigration status I identified immigration status using both country of birth codes and specific immigration codes. Unlike ethnicity, information for immigration status was available only from the CPRD data and not from the HES data (Figure 4 -4). Initially 240 medical codes were identi fied for country of birth and immigration status ; records with these codes were accrued from the Clinical, Referral, T est and Immunisation files of the dataset . However, when the initial analysis indicated that these codes did not capture the full extent of immigration status (as outlined in Chapter 6 ), the code list was expanded to additionally include language codes to identify individuals born in non -English speaking countries. This broader defi nition was used to maximise the use of available data because from 2008 -2011 GPs were incentivised to record the first language spoken for all registered patients.138, 139 This decision led to inclusion of an additional 225 medical codes. So , in total 465 codes were used for the broader definition of immigration status (including country of birth , immigration status and language codes) ( Appendix 5). 4.3.5 Religion As with immigration status, information on patients' religion was also only available in the CPRD data (Figure 4 -4). A code list consisting of 110 medical codes for religion (Appendix 6) was used to extract relevant information from the Clinical, Referral, T est and Immunisation files of the dataset ( Figure 4 -4). 4.3.6 Residence CPRD does not provide information on whether practices or patients are situated in urban or rural areas. However, information was sought on the type of residence for the older study populations , such as whether they lived independently, in sheltered housing, or resided in care homes . Care homes included both (i) nursing homes that provide nursing care and (ii) residential homes providing only personal care to their residents.140 Homelessness was also a potential variable of interest. Codelists were drawn up to identify all these factors as detailed below. 140 Informati on from CPRD data (a) Information from medical, entity type and consultation type codes in CPRD Information from the Clinical, Immunisation , Referral and Test files was extracted using 20 4 medical codes (Figure 4 -4) for place of residence and homelessness ( Appendix 7). The code list comprised of codes such as - 'seen in own home ', 'residential care ', 'sheltered housing ' and 'homeless '. Additional information on place of residence was obtained from the Consultation file and the Additional Clinical Details file. Two consultation type codes in the Consultation file were used: consultation type code 30 (nursing home visit) and 31 (residential home visit) (Figure 4 -4). The entity type code 132 from the Additional Clinical details files provided information on care ho me residence, residence in the patient's own home, sheltered accommodation and other places of residence. (b) Information from the family number (Patient file of CPRD) Family number was utilised by Shah et al. as one of the criteria used to define care home residence, using data from the Health Improvement Network (THIN) (another UK primary care database comprising of some general practices contributing data to both CPRD and THIN).141 This study included individuals aged 65 years from 326 general practices from England and Wales; all these practices had to provide data at least up to March 2008.141 Care home residence was defined b y the presence of a Read code for living in a care home, or at least two of the following three criteria: (i) 4 individuals aged 65 years residing in one household, identified using family number, but excluding households where the majority of individual s were aged <65 years; (ii) a specially commissioned postcode linkage to an area with a care home; (iii) a record of a consultation in care home.141 Although no explanations were provided as to why thes e criteria were utilised, the age and gender distribution of care home residents identified by this methodology were comparable to the distributions from a national survey and from census data.141 In the UK, ~94% of care home residents are aged 65 years .142 The average nursing home size (~47 beds) is larger tha n the average residential ho me size (~18 places), and ~40% of residential home s provide <10 beds.140 I used this information on the size of care home (ranging from <10 - 47 beds), the age of care home residents (majority being 65 years of 141 age) , and the methodology of Shah et al. ,141 to develop two independent criteria to define care home residence. Criterion 1 was based on the family number definition used by Shah et al. and was as follows:141 a household with >3 individuals aged 65 years was defined as a care home if the total count of these older individual was grea ter than the number of individuals aged <65 years in the same household. For Criterion 2, to further allow capture of information if the care homes included individuals aged 51 -64 years, households with >3 individuals aged 65 years and 3 individuals age d 50 years were defined as care homes (Figure 4 -5). *Based on141 Figure 4-5 Criteria for defining care home residence using family number Information from HES data The codes for source of admission in the Hospitalisations f ile of the HES data, which provide information about patient's location immediately prior to hospital admission, were also used to derive information about an individual's place of residence . The code list utilised is shown in Table 4 -1 and comprised codes for place of residence such as prison, care home and hospice. Family number: criteria for defining care home residence Criterion 1* In a household: A. Number of individuals aged 65 years is >3 And B. Number of individuals aged 65 years is more than those aged <65 years Criterion 2 In a household: A. Number of individuals aged 65 years is >3 And B.

The categorisation of the residence variable after information from all sources was combined is described in Section 4.4.4 . 4.3.7 Living arrangements: cohabitation Information from CPRD data (a) Information from medical codes in CPRD The medical code list for cohabitation comprised 86 codes and included codes such as 'cohabiting ' and 'spouse unwell ' (Appendix 8). The list was used to identify information recorded in the Clinical, Immunisation, Referral and Test files (Figure 4 -4). 143 (b) Information from the family number (Patient file of CPRD ) Further information on cohabitation was accrued from the family number field of the Patient file. The criteria used to identify cohabitation status from the family number were based on two previous studies conducted using the THIN database.143, 144 In the older study, conducted between 2005 -2008 amongst individuals aged 60 years, the criteria for identifying cohabitation were based on an analysis of national survey da ta.144 In this study, individuals aged 60 years residing with a member of the opposite sex with an age gap of 10 years, and with an age gap between the couple and any other younger member of the household of >15 years, were identified as a cohabiting couple.144 In the second study, conducted between 2003 -2013, cohabitees were identified as a two adult household (to avoid counting care homes or a block of flats), irrespective of ge nder, with age gap of 15 years .143 These authors excluded household with two adults where the age difference was >15 years to avoid co unting individuals residing with their children or individuals who had parents living with them.143 For this thesis, the criteria from the two studies described above,143, 144 were adapted to identify cohabitation status from the family number as follows. Two adults (at least one aged 65 years) living in a household size of two or three, irrespective of gender, were considered as a cohabiting couple if their age difference was 15 years (to avoid counting offspring); if there was another occupant, the age difference between the couple and the third occupant was required to be >15 years to capture either living with children or an elderly parent. Further information for cohabitation was also obtained from the other two closely related social factors: living alone and marital status (described further in Section 4. 4). 4.3.8 Marital status Information from CPRD data (a) Information from medical and entity type codes in CPRD The medical code list for marital status consisted of 152 codes ( Appendix 9). Entity type code 98 from the Additional Clinical Details files (Figure 4 -4), which provided information on 'next of ki n- spouse' was also used to extract information. 144 (b) Information from the Patient file of CPRD Further information for marital status was also gathered from the two data fields present in the Patient files of the CPRD data (Figure 4 -1): marital status and fa mily number. The information obtained from the marital status data field in the Patient file (Figure 4 -1) was used to supplement data obtained from the marital status code list . The categorisation of this variable in the Patient file is supplied by CPRD an d provides information about whether an individual was single, engaged, married or in civil partnership, separated, widowed or divorced (Table 4 -2). The 'stable relationship' field was not utilised to extract marital status data as this field was deemed to o non -specific to provide further information about the relationship status of an individual. Table 4-2 Extraction of marital status information from the Patient file of Clinical Practice Research Datalink Marital status field in Patient files Information extracted for marital status variable Single Single Married Married/ civil partnership Remarried Married/ civil partnership Civil partnership Married/ civil partnership Co-habiting Partner uncategorised Stable relationship Not used as does not provide information on marital status Engaged Single Widowed Widowed Divorced Divorced Separated Separated Individuals who were cohabiting ( Section 4.3.7 ) were also assigned the marital status of - 'Partner uncategorised' (categorisation of marital status is discussed in Section 4.4.4 ) due to limited information about marital status available from cohabitation status. 145 4.3.9 Living arrangements: living alone Information from CPRD data (a) Information from medic al and entity type codes in CPRD The code lists for living alone status (as a binary yes/no variable) comprised both medical codes and entity type codes. The medical code list comprised 91 codes ( Appendix 10) and included codes such as ' lives alone ' and 'lives with relatives ' (the latter providing evidence for not living alone). Entity type code 132, available from the Additional Clinical Details file (Section 4.2.1 ) was also used to provide information on living alone (Figure 4 -4). (b) Information from the fam ily number (Patient file of CPRD) Further information on not living alone was also accrued from the family number field of the Patient file. S tudy participant s were described as not living alone if their family number was shared by one or more individuals (household size 2). Additionally, indirect information on not living alone was also obtained from other social factors: place of residence, cohabitation and marital status (Figure 4 -4) as described in Section 4.4.3 . 4.4 Data algorithms and categorisation of socio -demographic factors In this section, I describe: variation of some socio -demographic factors over time how the information about socio -demographic factors , depending upon their variability over time, was assimilated from different data sources (as described in Section 4.3 ) using data algorithms and how indirect information was obtained from other social factors ; categorisation of factors; and how variables that varied with time were managed for specific studies conducted as a part of this thesis . 146 4.4.1 Effect of time on socio -demographic factors Certain socio -demographic factors such as ethnicity and immigration status which do not change with time, and factor s such as religion which are unlikely to change over time, were assumed as time -invariant variables. For example, if a person had their ethnicity recorded 20 years ago, it was assumed to hold true for the present time. On the other hand, a recording made 20 years ago about individual s' marital status might not necessarily reflect their current marital status. Therefore, marital status, place of residence and living arrangements, which were more likely to change with the passage of time, were classified as time-varying factors in this thesis . 4.4.2 Determining the date of recording of socio -demographic factors For the time -varying social factors - residence, living arrangements and marital status, it was important to determine the date when the factor was recorded in the health data. Determi ning dates of recording of time -varying factors in CPRD data As described previously in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.6, all CPRD data files (with a few exceptions - namely the Patient, Practice and Additional Clinical Details files) provide two different date fields associated with any recordings made. These include an event date (the date the event occurred, as recorded by the GP) and a system date (the date when the event was recorded on the GP computer system ). The event date was used to determine when a soc io-demographic factor was captured in these data . If the event date was unavailable, the system date was utilised. For information extracted from the Patient files (as described in Sect ion 4.3 ), both the event date and system date were unavailable to indicate when the data for the given factor was recorded. For such records, patients' current registration date (the da te when a patient's current registration began with the general practice, Section 3.2.1 ), which is available in the Patient file, was used as a conservative estimate of the date of recording the socio -demographic factor. The dates for recording of entity c odes in the Additional Clinical Details file, as described in Section 3.6 , were ascertained after linking this file to the Clinical file and using the event date field present in the Clinical file. 147 Determining date s of recording s in HES data For informati on extracted from the Hospitalisation file in HES data, the hospital admission date was utilised as the date of recording of the factor; for data extracted from the remaining HES files, the episode start date (as described in Section 3.3.1 ) was used. The issue of when factors were recorded in these data (timeliness of recording) is further discussed in Chapter 6 where timeliness of recording of time -varying factors was considered as a quality criterion in terms of ascertaining these factors from EHR. 4.4.3 Developing data algorithms An individual may have single or multiple records of a socio -demographic factor of interest in their EHR. Multiple records can be made on either the same event date or on different event dates. When an individual had multiple rec ords for a factor with the same event date, if the information was discordant or contradictory, those records were excluded. For example, if an individual had two records on a single event date, with one record coding this individual as an immigrant and an other record coding this same individual as a non -immigrant, both these records for the patient for that event date were excluded from any further analysis. In the following sections, I describe how information for both time -invariant and time -varying factors for a given patient were further processed. (I) Data algorithm for assimilation of information for time -invariant factors As discussed in Section 4.3.1 , information on ethnicity was assimilated from both CPRD and HES data (Figure 4 -4). If a patient ha d no ethnicity information from CPRD data but had this information available in their HES data (if version 10), no algorithms were required to extract ethnicity information as the information from the HES Patient file was supplied as a single record. Infor mation from individuals with multiple records of ethnicity in CPRD data which did not have discordant information on same event date, was extracted using an algorithm developed by Mathur et al. 91 According to this algorithm, when an individual had multiple ethnicity coded records in CPRD data, the code which was most common was utilised to assign ethnicity. If all ethnicity codes were equally common then the most recent code was used to assign ethnicity. However, for HES version 13, I found that ethnicity 148 information was recorded in the Episodes file and not (as in HES version 10) in the Patient file (Figure 4 -2). As a result, there could be more than one ethnicity -coded record for a patient in the HES version 13 data. I adapted the above described algorithm (Figure 4 -6) to extract ethnicity information, using the same principle of first utilising the most common code followed by most recent code if all codes were equally common. Unlike ethnicity, information for religion and immigration status was only available from CPRD data (Figure 4 -4). The algorithm described above for determining ethnicity from multiple records per patient, using the most common code or mo st recent code if codes were equally common (Figure 4 -6), was also utilised to gather information for these two factors.149 Figure 4-6 Algorithm for ascertainment of time -invariant social factors (ethnicity, immigration status and religion) in linked Clinical Practice Research Datalink data* * Based on91 Code available in CPRD data Single record with the code Yes Code available in HES data No Multiple records with code Code used for analyses Equally common codes Most common code Most recent code used for analyses Most common code used for analyses CPRD Clinical Practice Research Datalink HES Hospital Episode Statistics No Two conflicting codes on the same day Yes Discard both records 150 (II) Data algorithm for assimilation of information for time-varying factors II a) Information from family number Information for time -varying factors, namely marital status, place of residence and living arrangements (as described in previous Section 4. 3), was gathered from different sources using CPRD and HES data (Figure 4 -4). Information for these variables was also accrued from the family nu mber in the Patient files ( Section 4.3) . However, as it was unclear as to how often the family number field is updated ( Section 4.2.1 ) with changes in patient's address [Personal communications via email with the CPRD Knowledge Centre ]; information for mar ital status, residence and living arrangements extracted from this field was used only when data for these factors for a given patient were unavailable from other data sources in CPRD or HES (Figure 4 -7). Figure 4-7 Using information for marital status, living arrangements and residence extracted from family number in linked Clinical Practice Research Datalink data II b) Indirect information about a social factor from other closely rel ated social factors Indirect information was also obtained for a time -varying social factor from information for another social factors (Figure 4 -4) in the following manner. Ascertainment of marital status Code* available in CPRD or/and HES data * for marital status, residence or living arrangements CPRD Clinical Practice Research Datalink HES Hospital Episode Statistics Yes Code* used for analyses No Use information* if available from family number 151 also provided indirect information for cohabitation, as shown in the Table 4 -3 and Figure 4 -4. Individuals with codes for being married, in a civil partnership or in a stable relationship were assumed to be cohabiting, and individuals who were cohabiting were assumed to be not living alone. Ind ividuals with a residence code for living in a care home or residential home, in a hospice, psychiatric unit or prison were also assumed to be not living alone (Table 4 -4 and Figure 4 -4). Similarly individuals with codes for residing in households, care h omes, sheltered accommodation or other places of residence were assumed not to be homeless.

In the following section I describe how these factors were categorised. 152 Age Age in years was categorised into age -groups (described further in Chapters 6 -8). Gender Gender was a binary (male/female) variable. Ethnicity The ethnicity data w ere categorised in to five categories: White, South Asian, Black, Others and Mixed. Immigration status In the 2011 English Census data, country of birth had four main categories: (a) Europe including the United Kingdom, (b) Africa, Middle East and Asia, (c) The Americas and the Caribbean and (d) Antarctica, Oceania and other.152 I anticipated that the data from the EHR would provide less detailed information about immigration status and therefore categorised this factor as a binary variable: immigrant and not an immigrant . It was still feasible to compare the r ecording of immigration status with the 2011 English Census data, which could also be categorised as a binary variable.152 Religion Religion was categorised into eight categories : Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, Others and no religion (atheists) . Residence Place of residence was grouped in to four categories: household, care home including residential homes, sheltered accommodation and `other places of residence '. The latter consisted of places of residence not included in the first three residence categories: for example - prison s and hospices . Information obtained about care home residence was also considered as a binary variable in its own right as it was assumed that a GP was more likely to record care hom e residence than other places of residence such as household, perhaps due to differences in healthcare requirements - this is further discussed in Chapter 6 . Homelessness was also categorised as a binary variable. 153 Living arrangements: cohabitation and livi ng alone Cohabitation and living alone were both categorised as binary (yes/no) variables. Marital status Marital status had seven categories: single (including engaged) , married/ in a civil partnership, widow/er, divorced, separated, partner -other, and partner -uncategorised. The partner -other category included the following three groups: common -law husband, common - law wife and common -law partnership. The partner -uncategorised category included non - specific codes such as 'cohabita tion', 'partner unemployed' and 'partner stops working' entire list of codes included in the partner uncategorised category are presented in Appendix 11). I considered that some of these non -specific codes could be used by GPs for individuals who were previously categorised with a more specific code such as married, common -law husband or engaged. A decision tree was generated for individuals categorised as partner -uncategorised to gather more specific information from earlier codes, if available. If an individual had an earlier code for being married, engaged or a partner -other category, their marital status was categorised as per their earlier code (Figure 4 -8). However if individuals' previous marital status was widowed, divorced or separated, I decid ed to keep the marital status as partner -uncategorised, as these individuals might have a different current relationship status (Figure 4 -8). No changes were made if the individual's previous marital category was also partner -uncategorised (Figure 4 - 8). 154 Figure 4-8 Decision tree for categorisation of marital status: partner uncategorised Ascertainment of socio -demographic factors for the cross -sectional and cohort studies This section outlines how date of recording was used to ascertain socio -demographic factors for the cross -sectional study carried out for objective 2 (the investigation of completeness, timeliness and representativeness of recording of socio -demographic factors in the linked Is the marital status for the patient: partner - uncategorised?

Time -invariant factors: ethnicity, religion and immigration status Codes for factors considered as time -invariant ( Section 4.4.1 ) were considered for analyse s irrespective of the date of recording. Time -varying factors: marital status, living arrangements and place of residence For the cross -sectional study ( Section 3.5.1, objective 2 ), the latest code of a time -varying social factor in the period immediately before or on the index date of interest (01/01/2013) was used for the analysis. For the two cohort studies ( Sections 3.5.2 and 3.5.3 , objectives 3 and 4), infor mation for time-varying social factors, with the exception of care home residence (explanation to follow), f or a given patient was carried forwards or backwards depending upon the availability of the code in relation to the study period. This is illustrated in the Figures 4 -9, 4- 10 and 4 -11. If a single code for a given factor was available before the start of follow -up, the information from the code was carried forward for the duration of the study (Figure 4 -9). Similarly, if a code was available only after the end of follow -up of the study, the information was carried backwar ds for the study period (Figure 4 -10). If multiple codes were available (Figure 4 -11), the information from a code was carried forwards up until the appearance of another code. 156 Figure 4-9 Utilising information for time -varying factors (except care home residence ) available only before the start of follow -up of cohort study Figure 4-10 Utilising information for time -varying factors (except care home residence ) available only after the end of follow -up of cohort study A.

Therefore carrying a care home code information backwards i.e. assuming that a patient was residing in a care home in the period preceding the care home code, as was conducted for other time -varying factors, could have an increased risk of misclassification. So in the period preceding the appearance of a care home code, individuals were considered as not residing in a care home (Figure 4 -12) and in the period after the code, they were assumed to be living in a care home until the appearance of another code indicating different residential circumstances. Further details about ascertainment of these factors in the specific cohort studies are presented in Chapters 7 and 8. Figure 4-12 Utilising information for care home residence from linked data for cohort study. 4.5 Index of Multiple Deprivation: Patient - and practice -level As detailed in Section 3.4 , the IMD quintiles used in analyses were available at a LSOA level for both the location of the general practice and for the patient's residence .

The details about the proportion of patients with missing IMD status for whom the practice -level IMD data were used are provided in Chapters 7 and 8. As CPRD provides linkage with only one of the IMD datasets for any one study to maintain patient confidentiality,120 the 2010 IMD data were used for the cross -sectional study ( objective 2 ) while the 2007 and 2015 IMD data were used for the zoster burden and zoster vaccine uptake cohort studies ( objectives 3 and 4 ), respectively. 4.6 Chapter summary In this chapter, I have described the methods used to ascertain and categorise the socio - demographic factors of interest in the linked EHR. In the n ext chapter, I continue to discuss the methodology employed in this thesis, and describe how the outcome variables and other covariates used in the analyses of zoster burden and zoster vaccine uptake were ascertained in the electronic data. 160 Chapter 5. Defining outcomes and other variables of interest in electronic health records 5.1 Introduction This is the third and the final chapter for the Methods section of this thesis. In this chapter, I describe the ascertainment of the outcomes of interest in the linke d data for objectives 3 and 4, namely incident zoster and receipt of zoster vaccination, as well as other covariates used in the analyses. 5.2 Outcome variables As mentioned earlier ( Section 1.5), two observational studies were conducted to meet objectives 3 and 4: to examine the socio -demographic determinants of the burden of incident zoster and of zoster vaccine uptake amongst older UK individuals, respectively. 5.2.1 Defining zoster incidence in the linked data To meet the third objective, a 10 -year cohort study (2003 -2013), covering the period prior to zoster vaccine introduction in the UK, was conducted to ascertain the association of socio - demographic factors with a first episode of zoster. The identification of the study population in these linked data was de scribed previously ( Section 3.5.2 ). It consisted of individuals aged 65 years who were alive and currently registered with a CPRD practice in England. As the objective of this study was to determine the incidence of a first zoster episode during follow -up (i.e. a first code for a zoster diagnosis during the study period) it was not necessary to generate multiple zoster episodes during the follow -up period and individuals with a history of zoster prior to the start of follow -up had to be excluded. The gene ration of the zoster code list and the method of excluding individuals with past zoster was detailed in Section 3.5.2 when describing the study population , and a brief overview is presented here. Both CPRD and HES data (Admitted Patient Care data, Section 3.3) were examined to identify a diagnosis of zoster as patients with zoster c an present in general practice or directly to a hospital. This entailed using medical codes (CPRD data) and ICD -10 codes 161 (HES data) for zoster and PHN (the code list is availabl e in Appendix 3). In CPRD data, the Clinical and Referral data files (described in Section 3.2.1) were utilised to identify these individuals. In HES data, the diagnosis of zoster or PHN was identified using relevant ICD - 10 codes recorded in either the pr imary or secondary diagnosis fields ( Section 3.3.1 ) of the Diagnoses data file (Figure 3 -4) from any hospitalisation episode. After identifying patients with relevant zoster codes, I ascertained the date of recording of the zoster diagnosis using the eve nt date field in CPRD (described in Section 3.2.1 ) and the episode start date in HES data (described in Section 3.3.1 ). Individuals with missing dates for zoster diagnoses were excluded from the zoster incidence study as it was impossible to ascertain whet her zoster occurred prior to or during the study period. Zoster -coded records of study participants from CPRD and/or HES were appended together. To identify and exclude patients with a prior history of zoster (as detailed in the Section 3.5.2 ), individuals who had a code for zoster or PHN recorded prior to the start of follow -up were excluded (Figure 3 -6). Similarly, individuals who had their first code for zoster as PHN (a sequela of zoster) during the follow -up period (Figure 3 -6) were also excluded. For the remaining participants, t he earliest date of a zoster code recorded during the study period in the appended CPRD and HES dataset was used to identify the first zoster code and this was used as a date of the outcome (incident zoster) . The incidence of first episode of zoster during follow -up was ascertained using a Poisson regression model and was determined by dividing the number of individuals with a first zoster code (the numerator) by the person -time at risk of developing zoster (th e denominator). The details of the statistical analysis, and the results of this analysis: ascertaining the socio -demographic determinants of zoster incidence in this study population, are presented in Chapter 7 in form of a published paper. 5.2.2 Defining z oster vaccine uptake in CPRD For the fourth objective of this thesis a cohort study, spanning a two -year period (2013 -2015) following the introduction of zoster vaccine in the UK, was conducted to examine the association of socio -demographic factors with zoste r vaccine uptake. The study population (identified as described in Section 3.5.3 ) comprised individuals currently registered with a 162 CPRD practice in England and eligible for zoster vaccination during the study period (01/09/2013 -31/08/2015). Below, a descr iption of how I identified zoster vaccine uptake during the study period is provided. The CPRD data were examined to determine zoster vaccination for the participants during the study period as the NHS zoster vaccination programme is delivered through gen eral practice and not via hospitals. Zoster vaccination was determined from five different data files in CPRD data. These included using product codes in the Therapy files, immstype vaccine codes in the Immunisation file and medical codes in the Clinical, Referral and Test files (codes provided by Prof. Sara Thomas, Appendix 12). In the Immunisation file an additional 'status' field exists (as described in Section 3.2.1 , Figure 3 -2) which also provides information on the status of vaccination: i.e. whether the vaccine was advised, refused or given. Similarly, medical codes for declining, not consenting or not attending for zoster vaccination were also identified ( Appendix 12). The records for individuals with relevant zoster vaccination codes from these five different data files were first appended. I then excluded from the study individuals with conflicting information on zoster vaccine uptake on same date; i.e. participants with the simultaneous recoding of a zoster vaccination code and a refusal/declining/ not attending/not consenting code on a given date. An individual might have multiple records for zoster vaccination recorded on the same day or on different days in the same and/or different data files. For a participant with multiple vaccination records o n different dates but in the same data file, I used the earliest record. In order to integrate information from individuals with multiple vaccination codes recorded on different event dates in different data files, I developed an algorithm (Figure 5 -1) to determine when these individuals were vaccinated during the study period. In this algorithm, the Therapy files were given the highest priority as the presence of a product code in this file indicated that a prescription was actually issued by the GP.113 The second priority was give n to the Immunisation files that provided information about both the vaccine type (zoster) and additional information on whether the vaccine was advised, refused or given (the 'status' field). Finally, medical codes from the Clinical, Referral or Test file s were used. After excluding individuals with conflicting vaccination information on a given date (Figure 5 -1), receipt of zoster vaccination during the study period was first ascertained by the presence of 163 Figure 5-1 Algorithm for determining zoster vaccination status in Clinical Practice Research Datalink Patients with presence of a product code for zoster vaccine in the Therapy file Vaccinated Patients without zoster vaccine code in the Therapy file but with an immunisation type code for zoster vaccine and the status field was `given' Patients with conflicting codes on the sa me date i.e. if zoster vaccine codes and codes for refusal/declining/did not attend/no consent co -exited Patients without zoster vaccination information from the Therapy and Immunisation files but with zoster vaccination medical codes in the Clinical, Referral or Test files Vaccinated Vaccinated Patients excluded from the study Patients without any conflicting zoster vaccination codes on the same date 164 a relevant code in the Therapy file, as described in the algorithm. For patients without vaccination information from the Therapy file, the Immunisation file was then examined f or the relevant immunisation type codes with the immunisation status field recorded as `given' to assign vaccination status. Finally, the Clinical, Referral or Test file records of the remaining participants were examined for the presence of specific zoste r vaccine medical codes (Figure 5 -1) to categorise individuals as vaccinated. The association of socio -demographic factors with zoster vaccine uptake was assessed using a logistic regression model. The reasons why a logistic regression model was used for these analyses and the results are discussed in Chapter 8 in form of a research paper (submitted for publication). 5.3 Other covariates In the two analyses for objectives 3 and 4, conducted to ascertain the association between socio -demographic factors and outc ome of interest (zoster disease burden and zoster vaccine uptake respectively), the reasons why other covariates needed to be considered, follow. Firstly, in the zoster disease burden analyses, certain chronic conditions and immunosuppressive conditions/th erapies that are risk factors for zoster were considered as a priori potential mediators of the relationship between socio -demographic factors and zoster disease incidence. Secondly, in the zoster vaccine uptake analyses, the study population consisted of individuals eligible to receive this live vaccine ( Section 3.5.3 ). In order to identify eligible participants, individuals with certain immunosuppressive conditions or taking immunosuppressive therapies, which are contraindications for zoster vaccine administration had to be identified and excluded from the study. Addi tional covariates for the vaccine uptake analysis comprised a past history of zoster and administration of seasonal influenza vaccine. In Chapters 7 and 8, the rationale for using these covariates in these two analyses is further discussed. In this section , I provide the details of how these variables were determined in the linked electronic health data. The immunosuppressive conditions and therapies which are contraindications to zoster vaccine administration were identified based on the UK Green Book guidance .60 Chronic conditions that increase the risk of zoster were identified from a previous UK study.46 The 165 covariates were identified using medical codes in CPRD ( Section 3.2 ), and usi ng ICD -10 codes in HES Admitted Patient care data ( Section 3.3 ). For some hospital -based procedures (described in the relevant sections below), OPCS codes ( Section 3.3.1 ) were also utilised to identify certain immunosuppressive conditions in HES data. The code lists were provided by Prof. Sara Thomas. I examined the entire records of the patients for the presence of these codes at any point prior to the end of follow -up. The only exceptions to this were the two covariates utilised in the zoster vaccine upta ke analyses: (a) for past history of zoster, I looked for the relevant code present at any point before the start of follow - up, and (b) for seasonal influenza vaccine uptake - I ascertained relevant codes during the zoster vaccine uptake study period (2013 -2015). Individuals with chronic conditions (described in Section 5.3.1 below ) were considered to have the condition from the date of the first recording of the code in either the CPRD or HES dataset; if codes for chronic conditions were identified in both CPRD and HES data, the earliest date of recording was used. For immunosuppressive conditions and therapies, I devised algorithms and criteria to ascertain periods of immunosuppression during the study period (details to follow in Sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 ). Following the common convention when routinely collected health data are utilised for research, individuals without a relevant code were assumed not to have that condition or treatment. Further details for these covariates are provided below in Sections 5 .3.1-5.3.5 . 5.3.1 Chronic conditions The chronic conditions that increase the risk of zoster were identified from a previous study and included: r heumatoid arthriti s, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, chronic kidney disease and diabetes.46 Both CPRD (Clinical, Referral and Test files) and HES data were used to identify these conditions using medical codes and ICD -10 codes, respectively ( Appendix 13). 5.3.2 Immunosuppressi ve conditions Based on the UK Green Book guidance, the following immunosuppressive conditions, in which zoster vaccination is contraindicated, were identified: haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue malignancies, human Immunodeficiency vi rus (HIV) infection, other c ellular immune 166 deficiency and s olid organ transplant .60 The details of how these conditions were identified in CPRD (Clinical, Referral and Test files) and hospitalisation data, and the criteria used for determining the duration of immunosuppression are provided below. A) Haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue malign ancies including haematopoietic This l lymphoma, myeloma , other plasma cell dyscrasias and haematopoietic stem cell transplant .60 Individuals with these conditions were identified using both medical codes and ICD -10 codes ( Appendix 14) in CPRD and HES data. OPCS codes (to identify procedures carried out during hospitalisation, Section 3.3.1 ) were also used to identify h aematopoietic stem cell transplant in the Procedures file of HES data. T he list of OPCS codes used is provided in the Appendix 14. Following each diagnostic or procedure record, individuals with any of these conditions were considered to be immunosuppressed for a period of 24 months.46, 60 B) HIV, other cellular immune deficiency and solid organ transplan t Individuals with these conditions were identified in both the CPRD and HES data, using medical and ICD -10 code lists ( Appendix 15), respectively. The OPCS code list was also used to identify individuals with solid organ transplants ( Appendix 15). Individ uals with cellular immune deficiency (e.g. Di George syndrome, Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ), with HIV infection or with a solid organ transplant were considered to be immunosuppressed from the date of the first appearance of the code, as these are life -long conditions. 5.3.3 Immunosuppressi ve medications As described for the immunosuppressive conditions, the UK Green Book also provides criteria for certain immunosuppressive treatments during which the administration of zoster vaccine is contraindicated.60 These immunosuppressive treatments (Table 5 -1) included chemotherapy, radiotherapy, specific high doses of oral or injectable corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents (thiopurine medications, Disease Modifying Anti -rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), non -biological immune modulating agents and biological therapies). The 167 details of how I identified these medications in the linked CPRD data and criteria used for defining the duration of immunosuppression are provided below. A) Immunosuppressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy As for other conditions described in previous sections, individuals undergoing immunosuppressive chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were identified in the Clinical, Referral and Test files of CPRD using medical codes (Appendix 16); and using ICD -10 codes and OPCS codes ( Appendix 16) in HES data. Study participants with these codes were considered to be immunosuppressed for a period of three months before the first documented prescript ion in the general practice , as the se therap ies are initiated in hospital . Individuals on these medications were also categorised as immunosuppressed for one year after each record instead of the recommended duration 6 months in the UK Green Book to account for potential recording del ays in GP data for any hospital -based treatments .60 Table 5-1 Immunosuppressive medications: defining dose criteria and period of immunosuppression Immunosuppressive medications Immunosuppressive dose Duration of immunosuppression prior to first documented script* Duration of immunosuppression after every script Corticosteroids >40 mg/daily for >7 days or >20mg/ daily 3 months 3 months Methotrexate >3.57 mg/day or >25mg per week 3 months 3 months Azathioprine 50mg/daily# 3 months 3 months 6-mercaptopurine 45mg/daily# 3 months 3 months Other immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus, sirolimus Any dose 3 months 3 months Other DMARDs such as ciclosporin, mycophenolate, leflunomide Any dose 3 months 3 months Biological therapy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy Any dose 3 months 12 months * these treatments might be initiated in hospital prior to the first documented record in primary care # UK Green Book and British Society of Gastroenterology guidance (as described in the text) DMARD disease modifying anti - rheumatic drugs 168 B) High dose corti costeroids and other immunosuppressive therapies Individuals on immunosuppressive treatment were identified using code lists (product codes) from the Therapy files of CPRD ( Appendix 17). I classified the product codes in these code lists into specific therapeutic categories to apply the specific immunosuppressive dose criteria (Table 5 -1). The immunosuppressive dose of corticosteroids was defined as >40mg of prednisolone/day for >7 d or >20mg for days; for methotrexate, doses were immunosuppressive (Table 5 -1).60 The immunosuppressive doses for azathioprine and 6 -mercaptopurine were defined as 50mg/day a nd 45mg/day respectively, based on the recommendations from the UK Green Book and the British Society of Gastroenterology. 60, 153 Other immune -modulating drugs such as tacrolimus, ciclosporin, etc. were considered to be immunosuppressive irrespective of the doses used. As with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, patients on these therapies were considered to be immunosuppressed for a period 3 months prior to the first documented script in primary care based on assumption that the therapy was typically initiated in a hospital setting (Table 5 -1). Patients on any dose of biological therapy (e.g. anti-tumour necrosis factor agents such as alemtuzumab, ofatumumab and rituximab) were considered to be immunosuppressed for one year after each prescription.60 For the remaining medications, patients were considered to be imm unosuppressed for a period of 3 months following each prescription (Table 5 -1).60 5.3.3.1 Data management to obtain information for immunosuppressive medications from the therapy files in CPRD Apart from the product codes and generic drug codes, the Therapy file in CPRD data also includes data fields which provide additional information about a given prescription. These data field can be used to estimate the dose and duration for each prescription which are unavailable in CPRD data .46 These data fields include: (i) Product name: provide s the name of the product including the dose ( for example prednisolone tablets 5 mg) (ii) Text identifier: This field provides information from the free text associated w ith the record in form of numeric values, which are interpreted by CPRD. A value of 169 0 indicates there is no free text available for that record. This field consists of actual prescribing information i.e. how many tablets are to be taken by the patient, for example, \"take one daily\". This data provides information on numeric daily dose , as described below under (iii). (iii) Numeric daily dose: This data field provides information about the numeric daily dose of each drug, which describes the total number of doses of the prescribed product to be taken by a patient per day. CPRD uses an algorithm based on information obtained f rom text identifier (described in (ii), above) to provide information in this field . To illustrate this with an example , if the free text associated with a record was \"one tablet twice a day\", the numeric daily dose provided for that record will be 2. (iv) Total quantity: the total quantity of the prescribed product for that prescription as entered by the GP. (v) Other fields: these include the number of treatment days and the number of product packs prescribed for a particular prescription. The information on the number of treatment days and the numeric daily dose was required to apply the dose and duration criteria for defining the immunosuppressive phase of specific therapies. However, the data for numeric daily dose and number of treatment days were missing for ~>30% of the prescriptions for oral corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications ( Appendix 18). I modified a technique called `hot decking' which was developed by Forbes et al for cleaning the prescription data for immunosuppressive agents and i mputing the missing values for numeric daily dose.46 In this technique, the missing values for the numeric daily dose are replaced by the median numeric daily dose of the chosen group of records. These groups of re cords could be from the same patient (intra -patient) or from different patients (inter -patients) sharing common characteristics such as the same age group, gender, and drug dosage. These records are selected based on an algorithm in which missing values fo r the numeric daily dose are first replaced by the median values from intra -patient observations; if these were unavailable the median values from records of patients sharing common characteristics are utilised (inter -patient values) (Figure 5 -2).46 I adapted this algorithm 170 in two ways. Firstly, changes in the information governance policies of CPRD [ personal communication via email CPRD Knowledge Team ] led to unavailability of the data for free text (described in (ii) above) when the numeric value of the text identifier was 100,000 . This had implications for the data management. Secondly, to reflect temporal changes in prescribing and to capture prescribing practices of practice staff members, I used two additional criteria (in addition to age -groups, gender and dosage) to d efine groups of patients sharing the same characterises and use their median values for numeric daily doses from these inter -patient observations. These additional criteria included observations with prescriptions issued within two years of each other (a 2 -year calendar period) and prescriptions issued by same member of staff (using the staff identifier available in the Therapy file) (Figure 5 -2). Applying this adapted algorithm, the missing numeric daily doses were sequentially replaced by the median numer ic daily dose value from the chosen stratum, as detailed in Figure 5 -2. 171 Figure 5-2 Algorithm# for imputing missing values of numeric daily dose # Modified from46 Missing data for NDD in the Therapy file records Use median NDD of records for same patient, same dose in mg and same quantity NDD still missing: Use median NDD of records for same patient, same dose in mg and same quantity group* NDD still missing: Use median NDD of records for same patient and same dose in mg NDD still missing: Use median NDD of records for same 5 -year age -groups, gender, dose in mg, quantity, staff identi fication number and 2 -year calendar period NDD still missing: Use median NDD of records for same 5 -year age -groups, gender, dose in mg, quantity and staff identification number NDD still missing: Use median NDD of records for same 5 -year age -groups, ge nder, dose in mg and quantity NDD still missing: Use median NDD of records for same 5 -year age -groups, gender, dose in mg, quantity group*, staff identification number and 2 -year calendar period NDD still missing: Use median NDD of records for same 5 -year age -groups, gender, dose in mg, quantity group* and staff identification number NDD still missing: Use median NDD of records for same 5 -year age -groups, gender, dose in mg and quantity group* NDD numeric daily dose: number of tablets/day *binary variable (low/high): cut off was the median quantity (56 tablets for oral corticosteroids and 28 tablets for other immunosuppressant drugs) Intra-patient observations Inter-patient observations 172 5.3.4 Seasonal influenza vaccine uptake For the zoster vaccine uptake study ( objective 4 ), I also examined the co -administration of zoster vaccine with seasonal influenza vaccine, as GPs were encouraged to administer zoster vaccine at the same as time as seasonal influenza vaccine ( Section 1.2.6 ),72 although zoster vaccine could continue to be administered outside the seasonal influenza season. Seasonal influenza vaccine uptake was identified during the influenza vaccination campaign season (September -March)73 of the corresponding ye ars of the zoster vaccine uptake study (2013/14 and 2014/15) . Similar to zoster vaccine, the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine was identified in the CPRD data by utilising specific product codes in the Therapy file , immunisation type codes in the Immuni sation file and medical codes in the Clinical, Referral and Test files (Appendix 19). The information for seasonal influenza vaccine code was first extracted using the Therapy file (as described for zoster vaccine uptake in Section 5.2.2 ). The Immunisation file, for individuals with no vaccination information from the Therapy file, was examined for the presence of specific immunisation type codes and the status field had to be `given' ( Section 3.2.1 ) to categorise these individuals as vaccinated for seasona l influenza. Amongst individuals without seasonal influenza immunisation information in either the Therapy or Immunisation files, the vaccination status was determined based on information obtained from the presence of specific medical codes from the Clini cal, Referral and Test files. 5.3.5 Past history of zoster To examine whether the association of zoster vaccine uptake with social factors varied with prior history of zoster (as a potential partial mediator for some social factors such as ethnicity, as discusse d in Chapter 8 ), 154, 155 individuals with a prior zoster history were identif ied as described in Section 3.5.2 . 5.4 Chapter summary This final chapter of the Methods section has detailed the data algorithms that I developed and/or adapted and applied to the linked electronic health data to ascertain the two outcome variables of interes t for objectives 3 and 4 of the thesis , namely incident zoster and zoster vaccine uptake, respectively. The definitions and data algorithms to identify the key 173 covariates in the analyses for objectives 3 and 4, comprising selected chronic conditions and im munosuppressive conditions/therapies, have also been outlined. The next chapter ( Chapter 6 ) is the first of the three chapters comprising the Results section of the thesis and presents the findings of the cross -sectional study conducted to meet the second objective ( Section 1.5.2 ): to develop method ology for the ascertainment of socio - demographic factors in linked electronic health records, and to assess their availability in these data. 174 Results section The Results section of this thesis has three chapters: Chapters 6 -8, which present the findings of the three observational studies to meet objectives 2 -4 of this thesis ( 1.5.2 ). Chapter 6 presents the finding of the cross -sectional study (the first observa tional study) conducted to investigate the completeness , timeliness and representativeness of recording of socio -demographic factors of interest in the linked CPRD data ( objective 2 ). Chapter 7 presents the findings from the cohort study (the second observ ational study), which describe the association of soc io-demographic factors with zoster disease incidence in England using the methodology developed and presented in Chapter 6 . Chapter 8 presents the findings of the third observational study: a cohort stud y that investigated zoster vaccination inequalities amongst older individuals in England by determining the socio -demographic factors associated with zoster vaccine uptake . All these three chapters are presented in a journal article format with brief abstr act, background, methods, results, discussion and overall conclusion sections. Any additional results or discussions follow the journal article in the relevant chapter. 175 Chapter 6. Quality and completeness of recording of social factors in linked electron ic health records: a cross -sectional study 6.1 Introduction This chapter forms the first of the three chapters included in the Results section of this thesis. It reports the findings of the cross -sectional study conducted to meet the second objective of this t hesis: to assess the methodology for ascertainment of soc io-demographic factors (including those identified from the systematic review ( chapter 2 )) and assess their availability in the linked electronic health records. The details of this work, published i n the journal PLOS ONE, are presented in the next section. The detailed methodology for determining the socio -demographic factors of interest was presented previously ( Chapter 4 ). The paper presented in this current chapter reports the results of the analyses to assess among 59,1037 older individuals the completeness of recording of socio -demographic factors, including: the extent to which linked data improved completeness; timeliness of recording for factors that might change with time (such as marita l status, living arrangements or residence); and the representativeness of the results compared with data from the English 2011 Census. The paper is followed by supplementary material for the published paper ( Section 6.3 ); further discussion on how immigra tion status was determined in these data and the implications of this ( Section 6.4 ), and how data from the family number variable were utilised ( Section 6.5 ). 176177 178 6.2 Paper 2: Identifying social factors amongst older individuals in linked electronic health records: An assessment in a population based study RESEARCH ARTICLE Identifying social factors amongst older individuals in linked electronic health records:An assessment in a population based study Anu Jain1*, Albert J. van Hoek1, Jemma Smeeth1, Sara L.

This study investigated the record-ing of social factors in linked electronic health records (EHR) of individuals aged \u001565 years, to assess the potential of these data to identify the social determinants of disease burden and uptake of healthcare interventions. Methodology was developed for ascertaining social factors recorded on or before a pre-specified index date (01/01/2013) using primary caredata from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked to hospitalisation and depriva-tion data in a cross-sectional study. Social factors included: religion, ethnicity, immigrationstatus, small area-level deprivation, place of residence (including communal establishmentssuch as care homes), marital status and living arrangements (e.g. living alone, cohabita-tion). Each social factor was examined for: completeness of recording including improve-ments in completeness by using other linked EHR, timeliness of recording for factors thatmight change over time and their representativeness (compared with English 2011 Censusdata when available). Data for 591,037 individuals from 389 practices from England wereanalysed. The completeness of recording varied from 1.6% for immigration status to ~80%for ethnicity. Linkages provided the deprivation data (available for 82% individuals) andimproved completeness of ethnicity recording from 55% to 79% (when hospitalisation datawere added). Data for ethnicity, deprivation, living arrangements and care home residencewere comparable to the Census data. For time-varying variables such as residence and liv-ing alone, ~60% and ~35% respectively of those with available data, had this informationrecorded within the last 5 years of the index date. This work provides methods to identifysocial factors in EHR relevant to older individuals and shows that factors such as ethnicity, deprivation, not living alone, cohabitation and care home residence can be ascertained using these data. Applying these methodologies to routinely collected data could improvesurveillance programmes and allow assessment of health equity in specific healthcarestudies.

Increase in life expectancy has led to an aging population, and globally the proportion of individuals aged \u001560 years is projected to nearly double by 2050 from ~12% in 2013.[7, 8]The higher prevalence of chronic diseases in this age group is associated with greater disability and requirement for long-term care, necessitating changes in health and social care delivery.[9, 10] The effect of ageing on future health expendi- ture will depend on health expectancy: a measure that takes both life expectancy and disabilityinto account.[11, 12] A 2015 systematic review reported associations of social factors such as gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic position (including education) with inequalities in healthy life expectancy amongst older individuals.[13] Similarly, amongst individuals aged 50\u00b1 65 years, social class, education, wealth and income were found to be associated with all threeindicators of health expectancies: disability-free, illness-free and healthy life expectancy.[9] Living alone is also known to be associated with higher morbidity and mortality.[14] Uptake of preventative measures such as vaccination amongst older individuals has been shown to belower amongst immigrants, individuals of certain ethnicities, and those living alone.[15, 16] One of the recommendations by the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) in 2008 was setting of global and national equity sur-veillance systems to monitor health inequities routinely.[17] Surveillance programmes in theUK lack detailed information about social factors.[18] However, these factors potentially could be ascertained using routinely collected electronic health records (EHR). This provides an opportunity to utilise routinely collected data to improve surveillance programmes and toassess health inequities in specific studies. The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) is the world's largest primary care data- base, comprising anonymised patient information from ~7% of the UK population and includ-ing>79 million person-years of follow-up cumulatively.[19, 20] These EHR comprise not only data relating to primary care consultations, but also records of referrals to and feedbackfrom secondary care.[21] Data in CPRD are representative of the UK population and are qual-ity assured at both patient and general practice level.[20, 21] In England, linkage of the CPRD data at the individual level (from ~75% of English practices that consent to linkages) is avail- able for hospitalisation data (Hospital Episode Statistics, HES)[22] and deprivation data (e.g. quintiles of Index of Multiple deprivation (IMD) score).[21, 23] For deprivation data, the link- age is made at the lower layer super output areas (LSOA) level, which covers a population of 1000\u00b13000.[23] The completeness and quality of recording of one social factor in the CPRD, namely ethnicity, have been assessed by Mathur etal using data up to 2012 and focusing chiefly on the time during which GPs were financially incentivised to record the ethnicity of newly registered patients.[24] This study showed that in linked CPRD-HES data, completeness of recording reached 90% in newly registered patients. However, this analysis did not includeassessment of recording specifically for older patients in CPRD, and was not extended to examine completeness after incentivisation was withdrawn in 2011.[25] In the UK, EHR have also been utilised to study cohabitation and care home residence,[26\u00b128] but these studies didnot provide information on timeliness or representativeness of recording of these factors anddid not utilise linked hospitalisation data.

This study aimed to investigate the utility of the CPRD and linked databases in ascertaining social factors that are potential determinants of disease burden and inequitable healthcare interventions targeted towards older individuals, to discuss challenges associated with using routinely collected data and to supplement and enhance existing surveillance methods with the overarching goal of informing interventions to reduce health inequities. Methods Data source and study date This was a cross-sectional study using CPRD data linked to HES data and deprivation data (IMD 2010) in England. It investigated the historical recording of social factors among indi-viduals aged\u001565 years, actively registered with a CPRD practice on a randomly chosen index date (1st January 2013), to allow assessment of both completeness and timeliness of recordingof social factor data. Active registration on 01/01/2013 was determined by ensuring thatpatients' start dates (the later of their registration date with the practice or the date the practicereached CPRD-defined quality criteria[21]) fell before the index date and their end dates (the earliest of their transfer out date, date of death or practice last collection date) were after the index date. CPRD data are supplied in ten different files,[19] of which eight (patient, practice, clinical, consultation, additional clinical details, immunisation, referral and test files) were used for thisstudy (S1 Table). These files include information about patients' demography, lifestyle factors,clinical details, feedback from secondary care, therapy and laboratory results, stored in form of medical, therapy and other codes used by the GP practice staff.[21] Social factors examined In this study, social factors relevant at an individual level and informed by the conceptual framework of the WHO's CSDH,[1] were examined in CPRD and included: religion, ethnicity,immigration status, deprivation based on LSOA of each individual's residence,[23] livingarrangements (living alone and cohabitation), residence (place of residence and homelessness) and marital status. Lists of medical codes (S2 Table) for each factor were compiled by searching the CPRD's Read code dictionary [21] for specific and broader text terms (using wild card searches)encompassing all social factors of interest. This was an iterative process that subsequently included a hierarchical search of the Read codes identified. The number of codes identified forthese factors ranged from 86\u00b1465 (S2 Table). Further information (S1 Table) was accrued from other sources within the dataset as follows: the consultation files provided codes (`consul- tation type') on where the consultation took place and thus patients' residence (for example ina care home), while the patient files provided information regarding patients' marital status and their family number.[29] The latter variable can identify individuals sharing the same household and therefore can be used to get information for living arrangements (living alone,cohabitation), marital status and care home status. Similarly, the additional clinical details filesprovided coded information (`entity type') about residence, living alone and marital status. The linked hospitalisation data from HES provided additional information for ethnicity and residence, whilst the deprivation data provided deprivation scores for individuals' LSOA asIMD quintile. The multiple code lists thus generated were discussed amongst the three of the authors (AJ, SLT and AJvH). These code lists were then utilised to systematically search for the Read codes in the clinical, immunisation, referral and test files. Additional information was Identifying social factors amongst older individuals in electronic health records PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0189038 November 30, 2017 3 / 17 181sought from consultation type and entity types in the consultation and additional clinical details files respectively and also from the patient file and from linked HES and deprivation data. Some factors also provided information about another social factors: for example an indi-vidual coded as living alone was deemed not to be cohabiting, whereas an individual residingin a care home was considered not to be living alone. The following example illustrates how information for social factors was assimilated. Type of residence (whether a patient lived in their own home, in sheltered accommodation, or in acare home) can be recorded in numerous way in both CPRD and HES. In CPRD, this informa- tion can be determined using the medical codes within multiple files as described above, using the entity type 132 for residence in the additional clinical details file, from the consultation file(e.g. \u00aanursing-home visit\u00ba) and from the family number (as described below); residence data are also potentially available in HES by using information about individual's location prior to hospital admission. Exposure variables definition and categorisation The code lists for the social factors of interest (religion, ethnicity, living arrangements (includ- ing living alone and cohabitation), immigration status, deprivation, residence (including place of residence and homelessness) and marital status) are presented in S2 Table. Ethnicity codes were those recommended for use by the Quality and Outcomes Framework, as used by Mathuretal.[24] Family number was used to derive additional information by modifying approaches used in previous studies,[27, 28,30] as follows. Two adults, living in a household size of two or three, were identified as cohabiting (adults living in a couple) if the age difference between the couple was\u001415 years and age difference between the other household occupants and those liv- ing in a couple was >15 years. Couples identified as cohabiting were also allocated `partner- uncategorised' category for marital status. Individuals from household size of two or morewere identified as not living alone. Based on previous studies [26, 31,32] care home was defined as a household with >3 individuals aged \u001565 years and if their total count was more than individuals aged <65 years. In sensitivity analyses households with >3 individuals aged \u001565 years and\u00143 individual aged \u001450 years were defined as a care home. Religion was categorised into eight categories (Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jews, Mus- lims, Sikhs, Others and no religion (atheists)) to ensure comparability with Census data.[33]We hypothesised that certain minority religions might be more likely to be coded by GPs, andexplored this by categorising one religion (Muslim) as a binary (yes/no) variable. Ethnicity was categorised in five groups: White, South Asian, Black, Others and Mixed as per the UK 2011 Census.[34] Living alone and cohabitation were coded as binary variables (yes/no). Immigration status, a binary variable (immigrant/ not immigrant) was defined using: i) country of birth informa-tion and (to increase completeness of ascertainment) ii) codes for the first language spoken (S2Table). Place of residence had four categories: living in a care home, sheltered accommodation, other places of residence (e.g. prison, hospice, hostel, welfare home) and living in a household.Care home status was also considered as a binary (yes/no) variable, on the assumption thatbeing in a care home might be more completely recorded by GPs than other places of resi- dence (e.g living in a household). Homelessness was also a binary variable. Relationship status was characterised by using following seven categories: single, married/ civil partnership, widow/er, divorced, separated, partner-other (e.g. common-law husband/wife) and partner (uncategorised). As the last category was non-specific, an algorithm was developed to obtain more specific marital status information. If the `partner uncategorised' Identifying social factors amongst older individuals in electronic health records PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0189038 November 30, 2017 4 / 17 182status was preceded by any of the following three categories: 1) Single/engaged 2) Married/ civil partnership and 3) Partner-other category, the `partner uncategorised' category was updated to that of the earlier observation. Deprivation status is a composite score of 38 indicators for seven domains of deprivation (income, health and disability, employment, education and training, housing, living environ- ment and crime).[23] These indices are available at the small area level (LSOA) as quintiles: quintile one representing the least deprived to quintile five representing the most deprived.[23] Analysis For the purposes of recording, the social factors that were likely to change with time (e.g. mari- tal status, living alone status) were treated as time-varying exposure variables whereas ethnic- ity, religion and immigration status were deemed to be time-invariant. In CPRD the event date (the date the event occurred as recorded by the GP) was used to ascertain when the factor was recorded in relation to the index date. If the event date was miss-ing then the system date (the date when the event was recorded on the GP system) was usedfor these observations.[19] For information extracted from the patient files (such as marital status, family number), which does not include event dates, a conservative estimate of the date of recording was taken, using the date the patient registered with the practice[19], and the hos-pital admission date was utilised for HES data.[22] All mentions of each factor of interest were identified within a patient's linked records. Observations providing discordant information for a factor on the same date for a patientwere excluded and the social factor recorded nearest the index date was used. As family number provided information for social factors indirectly, and the date of record- ing this variable was unclear, information from family number was used only when data for aparticular social factor were unavailable from other sources in CPRD or HES for that patient. For each social factor, the following information was analysed: (a) Completeness of recording and contribution from linkages. Completeness was described as the percentage of total patients who had data available: i) within CPRD and ii) within CPRD linked to HES, to investigate the extent to which use of the linked data increasedcompleteness. For time-varying variables, completeness was determined in the period before or on the index date (taking the value nearest the index date). However, for time-invariant var- iables such as country of birth, ethnicity and religion, completeness of recording included boththe period before and after the index date. For ethnicity, we further investigated completeness of recording by GPs over time by plotting completeness against year of registration with the general practice. We also assessed the contribution of family number by looking at complete-ness with and without family number data. (b) Representativeness. The representativeness of the recorded data was investigated by comparing the distribution of each social factor amongst those with non-missing data with thedistribution recorded in the 2011 Census (data from England for individuals aged \u001565 years). When applicable, we also considered the binary version of multi-category variables (i.e. carehome status instead of the four-category variable for residence, and Muslim religion). For allbinary variables, (immigration status, care home status, Muslim religion, homelessness, livingalone, and cohabitation status) we assessed representativeness assuming that those without a code did not have the attribute, and thus compared the distribution of each factor among the entire study population to the Census data. (c) Timeliness. For the time-varying factors, the duration between index date and the record nearest to the index date was calculated. Factors recorded more than five years beforethe index date were not considered timely.

Approval for this study was obtained from the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee of the Medicines and Healthcare prod- ucts Regulatory Agency (Ref: 15_253) and the Research Ethics Committee of the LondonSchool of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (reference:10524). The original Independent Scien- tific Advisory Committee protocol was made available to the reviewers of this paper. Data were analysed using Stata-14 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Results The study population comprised 591,037 patients from 389 GP practices in England. More than half of the study participants (55%) were females, and 53% were aged between 65\u00b174 years at the index date, with ~14% aged \u001585 years. The median age for women was 75.5 years (interquartile range (IQR): 69.5\u00b182.5 years) whilst for men it was 73.5 years (IQR: 68.5\u00b179.5 years). Information for one or more time-invariant social factors was available for~92% (n =541,197) of the study population, while 75% (n = 444,827) had data for one or more time-vary- ing social factors. Overall, ~98% (n = 578,410) had information for one or more social factors. Further details of the overall pattern of completeness is given in S3 Table; only 45 patients (<0.01%) had data for all seven social factors included in this study while ~21% (n = 123,450) had information for three social factors: ethnicity, IMD and living alone. The system date was used to replace missing event date for only 0.4% (n = 2,219) of the study population (S4Table). The maximum number (n = 456; <0.1%) of patients were excluded due to discordant information recorded on the same date (S4 Table) were for the factor: living alone. Completeness of recording for individual social factors, and contribution from linkages Completeness of recording for all social factors was better for females and amongst the oldest individuals (aged\u001585 years) for all factors except for religion, immigration status and IMD score (Table 1). Of the seven social factors ascertained, recording for deprivation data and eth-nicity were the most complete, at ~82% (n = 486,426) and ~80% (n = 469,557) respectively (Table 1). The recording of ethnicity over time showed an increase in completeness in the year 2006 (when incentivisation was introduced) with a slight downward trend in 2011 and 2012(Fig 1). The most incompletely recorded social factor was immigration status which available for only 4,187 (0.7%, data not shown) of the study population when country of birth codes wereused alone. However, the additional use of `first language' codes with country of birth codes more than doubled the information, to 1.6% (n = 9,713) of the study population (Table 1). Religion was the second most poorly recorded factor, available for only 2.6% (n = 15,449) of study individuals (Table 1). Data on place of residence was recorded for 10.3% of the popula-tion, whereas living alone (yes/no) and marital status were recorded for nearly a third of the study population (29.2% and 27.2%, respectively). The contribution of data from linked datasets to completeness of recording was particularly important for ethnicity, which showed a ~45% improvement (increasing from ~55% to ~80%, Table 1) after including linked hospitalisation data, and for IMD data (which was only avail- able as linked data). For other social factors, there was hardly any evidence of improvement incompleteness of recording from the linked data compared to using CPRD alone (Table 1). The utilisation of family number in providing information for individuals who had no data for living alone, cohabitation, care home residence and marital status in either CPRD or HES Identifying social factors amongst older individuals in electronic health records PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0189038 November 30, 2017 6 / 17 184showed that there was much higher completeness of recoding for living alone (70% versus 29%), cohabitation (60% versus 22%) and marital status (60% versus 27%) when information from family number was included (S3 Table, S4 Table and S5 Table). In contrast, family num- ber contributed little to the completeness of recording of care home residence (11% versus10%), irrespective of definitions used (S4 Table).Table 1.

In contrast, amongst the small number of individuals with available data on religion, 85% (n = 13,074) were recorded as Christians (Table 2), with anover-representation of the minority religion categories in CPRD (Table 2) compared to Census data[33], for example Muslim (3.1% in CPRD versus 1.3% in the Census), Hindu (1.6% versus 0.7%) and Sikh (1.1% versus 0.4%). When Muslim religion wasconsidered as a binary variable, using the entire study population as the denominator andassuming those without a code were non-Muslim, there was appreciable under-recording of Muslim status (n = 481, 0.1%) compared to English Census (1.3%).[33] Similarly, among those with data on immigrant status, there was marked over-representa- tion of immigrants (n = 7,866, ~81% of the total) among those with recorded data (Table 2),but under-representation when immigrant status was considered as a binary variable (1.3% of the total study population (Fig 3) compared to 9.9% non-UK born individuals in the EnglishCensus).[35] For living arrangements, amongst those with available data, the proportion of individuals recorded as living in a household (~50%, Table 2) was under-reported in CPRD compared to English Census data (in which ~96% of people aged \u001565 years were recorded as living in household) and living in a care home was over-reported (~48%) compared to Census (3.2%). [36, 37] However, once care home residence was categorised as a binary yes/no variable, repre- sentativeness improved markedly; in the total study population, 4.9% of individuals were cate- gorised care home residents compared to 3.2% in the English Census data (Fig 3).[37] The data from EHR for marital status amongst those with non-missing data were also not comparable to the Census data, [38\u00b140] with 68% being recorded as married or in a civil part-nership, compared to 55.9% in the Census data. Data were comparable for the sub-categories of: `single' (4.5% versus 5.5% in the Census) and `separated' (1.3% versus 1.2%), but there were Fig 1.

The number of individuals with a code indicating that they were homeless was also very small, representing just 0.02% (n = 92) of total study population.

Amongst those with available data, individuals categorised as those not living alone and as cohabiting were both over-represented in the data (96.7% and 88.6% respectively, Table 2). When considered as a binary variable using the entire study population as denominator, thesefactors were under-represented (28% and 19% respectively) compared to the Census data (68.5% and 58.6%, respectively).[39, 40] However, when information from family number was added, the percentage of those not living alone (68.9%) or cohabiting (52.2%) were fairly com- parable (68.5% and 58.6% respectively) to the Census data (Fig 3).[39, 40] For deprivation (Table 2), the data showed a slightly lower proportion of study population from the two most deprived quintiles of IMD status, suggesting that older patients in the prac-tices consenting for linkage with deprivation data tended to be from more affluent areas. This is in contrast to a previous study which suggested that overall, including patients of all ages,those in linked CPRD IMD data are comparable to the UK population.[42] Timeliness The recording of time-varying social factors in relation to the index date varied considerably(Fig 4). Amongst those who had information available, 34.7% of individuals had data on whether they lived alone recorded within 5 years of the index date if data from family number Fig 2.

The equivalent figures for timeliness when the entire study population (n = 591037) was considered, varied from 3.7% for cohabitation status to 14.2% for living alone data (includinguse of family number, S3 Fig). Discussion and conclusions This study presents the methodology for ascertaining social factors utilising one of the largest collections of primary care EHR in the world. This involved drawing up detailed code lists, uti- lising multiple files within CPRD and in the linked hospitalisation data to maximise ascertain-ment, and devising algorithms to time-update variables and to deal with discordant recording. Wide variation in the completeness of recording of social factors was noted, ranging from 1.6% for immigration status to ~82% for deprivation. Overall, the completeness for recordingwas better amongst females and older individuals, perhaps reflecting a higher consultation rates amongst this demographic group.[43] The influence of GP incentivisation on completeness of recording of social factors was evi- dent in the recording of ethnicity, an important factor for describing disease burden and forascertaining health inequities. In 2006 GPs were incentivised to record ethnicity for all newly registered patients[44] and in year 2008 this was extended for all registered patients includingthe recording of first language spoken.[45] However, this incentivisation was withdrawn on 31March 2011[25] and we found signs of a downward trend in ethnicity recording from 2011 onwards. The ethnicity data from the present study were available for 79% of the study popula- tion and when compared to Census data, were found to be representative of the English popu-lation. These results are comparable to an earlier study that reported ethnicity recording in CPRD and linked data for all age groups combined, which found completeness of recoding to be ~78% and ethnicity composition comparable to UK Census.[24] Fig 4. Timeliness of recording of living alone, cohabitation, marital status and place of residence. *data from family number analysis excluded https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0189038.g004 Identifying social factors amongst older individuals in electronic health records PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0189038 November 30, 2017 11 / 17 189Immigration status and religion were poorly recorded in these data, and living arrange- ments were also sub-optimally recorded. Among those with data, a higher than expected pro- portion were of minority religion, immigrant status or living in a care home, suggesting thatGPs are more likely to record these specific social characteristics. When these factors were con-sidered as binary variables (present or absent) in the entire study population, comparison with Census data suggested that care home status may indeed be well recorded. This is perhaps not surprising, as these individuals may be fragile and have higher healthcare needs, necessitatingmore attendances and interventions. In contrast, being of Muslim religion or an immigrant appeared to be under-recorded. However, our use of \u00aafirst language\u00ba codes may have preferen- tially captured immigrants from specific countries, whilst under-ascertaining English-speakingindividuals born in countries such as the Republic of Ireland, North America, Australasia and the Caribbean, who comprised of ~34% of non-UK born individuals in the 2011 Census.[35] This under-ascertainment may be exacerbated for individuals who moved to the UK manydecades previously. Thus, CPRD data may be better for capturing recent arrivals to the UK who are not native English speakers. Homelessness was also under-recorded in these datasets, representing just 0.02% (n = 92) of total study population. Although the proportion of home-less individuals registered with GP has increased (63% in 2002 to 90% in 2014), the poorrecording of homelessness status in these data is likely to reflect difficulties encountered by homeless individuals in accessing GP services.[46, 47] Our findings show that completeness of recording was enhanced by use of multiple sources within datasets, as well as use of linked data. Living in a care home was recorded by GPs inthe clinical, referral and test files, consultation data, additional clinical details and could be inferred from the family number, with additional information provided in the hospital data.Similarly, living arrangements such as cohabitation and living alone, the latter an important indicator of morbidity and mortality,[14, 48] were well captured for the study population (~60% and 70%, respectively) when Read code and family number data from CPRD and HES data were combined. Other studies have utilised family number to identify care home resi-dence[26] and cohabitation status.[27, 28,49] We found that addition of data from family number improved completeness and representativeness of recording of whether a patient livedalone or cohabited, but at the potential expense of timeliness of recording and misclassifica-tion. The family number variable is generated by the general practice software when a patient registers with a GP or moves address, assigning the same number to individuals with the same address (Personal communications via email CPRD Knowledge Centre). As the date of updat-ing family number is not captured directly, we took the patient's registration date as a conser- vative estimate of when these data were recorded. Patients can move in or out of households and this information may not be captured by the practice, and patients sharing householdsmay be registered at different practices, so that cohabitation status and living alone may be wrongly assigned. For this reason, we used family number to supplement information only when it was unavailable from other sources. Other social characteristics of patients may have been misclassified in these routinely col- lected medical records\u00b1either due to mis-recording or because patients' status changed over time and this was not updated. Even factors considered time-invariant in this study may not nec- essarily have been so; for example, individuals may change their religion. A further point is thatthe codes used for determining social factors in general practice have not been validated except for ethnicity.[50] We could not examine other social factors that may be associated with uptake of healthcare interventions and health inequities but that were not recorded in these data, suchas education, income, housing, social class, social relationships and cultural beliefs.[1, 51] The significance of determining social factors in assessing the quality of healthcare and value-based payments to healthcare providers have been recognised, for example in a 2017 Identifying social factors amongst older individuals in electronic health records PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0189038 November 30, 2017 12 / 17 190report published in the United States.[51, 52] A rise in multi-morbidity and frailty amongst older individuals due to population ageing will also increase the need for assessing social fac- tors for delivering equitable healthcare. The CPRD database is used internationally for a widerange of public health studies, and HES includes nation-wide data used extensively forNational Health Service (NHS) based research in the UK. Our methods will be thus of interest to researchers using these data. The underlying methods of this study could also be adapted for use in other UK primary care databases. The broader methodological approach utilised in thisstudy such as to investigate the timeliness and the representativeness of these factors in elec- tronic health data by comparing to a national standard such as Census data should be general- izable to other countries with EHR. Our study shows that linked general practice data can beused to ascertain individuals' ethnicity, deprivation status, care home residence, and whether they live alone. However, other factors such as religion and immigration status are incom- pletely captured and as mentioned earlier some relevant social characteristics are not recordedin these data. Improvement in completeness and quality of recording of these factors could be achieved by GP incentivisation and use of unambiguous codes. The effect of GP incentivisa- tion was evident in the recording of ethnicity in CPRD which increased from ~30% in theperiod prior to incentivisation to >80% during the period of incentivisation.[24] A similar approach could be used for other social factors that are currently poorly captured in these data. Increasing health care providers' awareness about the role of social factors in disease bur- den and uptake of interventions should also help to improve recording of these factors. Link-ages of general practice records with other population based data such as the Census could also greatly enhance the availability of information on social factors.

To increase the assessment of immigration status, I expanded the code list to include \"first language\" codes to identify individuals born in countries where English was not the first language. This was done because t he GPs were incentivised to record first language for all registered patients between 2008 -2011 .138, 139 When immigration status was determined based only on country of birth medical codes, information was available for only 0.7% (n= 4187) of the stu dy population (Table 6 -1). The completeness of recording of immigration status increased to 1.6% (n= 9713) with the additional use of first language codes with country of birth codes (Table 6 -1). As shown in Table 6 -1, among the 9713 individuals with infor mation on immigration status (using the wider definition comprising both country of birth and language codes), 7866 (81%) had a code for being an immigrant, while 19% (n=1847) had a code for being a non -immigrant. I considered that a GP was more likely to record that a patient was an immigrant than record that a patient was non -immigrant. Based on this assumption, as described in the published paper ( Section 6.2 ), immigration status was considered as a binary variable for the entire study population: indivi duals with a country of birth code as immigrants or with first language code for languages other than English were categorised as immigrants while the rest of the study population was categorised as non -immigrants. Based on this binary categorisation and u sing the entire study population as denominator, of the total study population of 591037 individuals: 7866 (1.3%) individuals were categorised as immigrants and remaining 583171 (98.7%) individuals were categorised as non -immigrants. 204 Table 6-1 Ascertainment of immigration status in CPRD GOLD data based on country of birth and language codes Age group (study participants) Total number of individuals Immigration status information based on only country of birth codes N (row %) Immigration status information based on country of birth and language codes N (row %) 65-70 years 183382 1333 (0.7) 109628 (0.7) (1.8) 80-85 years 84473 562 (0.7) 1349 (1.6) 85-90 years 51278 325 (0.6) 723 (1.4) >90 years 30724 151 (0.5) 299 (1) Total 591037 4187 (0.7)# 9713 * (1.6) As described in text: # Of these 4187 individuals with available information : 2336 (55.8%) and 1851 (44.2%) were coded as immigrants and non -immigrants, respectively *Of these 9713 individuals with available i nformation 7866 individuals (81 %) and 1847 (19%) were coded as immigrants and non -immigrants respectively As mentioned in the published paper ( Section 6.2), the proportion of individuals identified as immigrants (1.3%) in the study was lower compared to the 2011 English Census data in which 9.9% individuals aged 65 years were recorded as non -UK born.152 The use of language code s could have preferentially captured data from immigrants who moved to the UK from non -English speaking countries but captured fewer individuals who migrated to the UK in early childhood if these individuals considered English as their first language. The language codes could have also under -ascertained individuals born in countries other than UK where English is the first language such as the Republic of Ireland, United States of America, Canada or Australia, and those who registered with their GPs after 2 011 when incentivisation for first language recording was withdrawn. The effect of under ascertainment of immigration status on its association with zoster disease burden and zoster vaccine uptake are further discussed in Chapters 7 and 8. 6.5 Family number The use of family number (discussed in detail in Chapter 4 : Section 4. 3) contributed to the availability of data for living alone, cohabitation and marital status. This is illustrated in the supplementary material to the published paper (S4 Table): in comparison to data available from CPRD (excluding family number) and/or HES, the additional use of family number increased the completeness of recording for living alone (29% versus 70%), cohabitation 205 (22% versus 60%) and marital status (27% versus 59%). H owever, data obtained from using family number was less timely compared to the information obtained from using CPRD GOLD and HES data without family number. This is because it is unclear how often the family number is update d with changes in patient's addr ess as discussed previously in Section 4.4.3 . After including information from family number for determining whether individuals were living alone, their cohabitation status and marital status, 20.3%, 11.7% and 13.5% respectively of individuals with availa ble data had this information recorded within 5 years of the index date (S1 and S2 Fig. supplementary material to the published paper). These proportions were lower compared to those obtained from using only CPRD GOLD (without family number) and HES data: 34.7%, 16.8% and 19.5% of individuals with available data for living alone, cohabitation status and marital status respectively had information recorded within 5 years of the index date. The assessment of care home residence after including information fr om the family number resulted in ~5.6% of the total study population (n=591037) being defined as care home residents (S5 table supplementary material to the published paper). This proportion was higher compared to the proportion (4.9%) residing in care hom e, obtained from utilising only CPRD GOLD and HES data (i.e. not using information from family number). The latter data (4.9%) were more comparable (Figure 3 published paper Section 6.2) to the 2011 English census data, which reported 3.2% individuals aged 65 years residing in care home.147 Therefore, ascertainment of care home residence was based on information obtained from using only CPRD and HES data. 6.6 Chapter summary This chapter presented the application of methodology for ascertainment of socio - demographic factors in linked EHR, developed as a part of this thesis and detailed in Chapter 4 . This included an assessment of completeness of recording of socio - demographic factors, the ir representativeness, timeliness of recordings and additional information gained from linkages, which was the second objective of this thesis ( Section 1.5.2 ). In the next two chapters: Chapters 7 and 8, I describe the results of applying these 206 methods to assess the association of socio -demographic factors with zoster incidence and zoster vaccine uptake, respectively. 207 Chapter 7.

DOI 10.1111/bjd.16399Summary Background Zoster vaccination was introduced in England in 2013, where tackling health inequalities is a statutory requirement. However, specic population groups with higher zoster burden remain largely unidentied. Objectives To evaluate health inequalities in zoster disease burden prior to zoster vaccine introduction in England.Methods This population-based cohort study used anonymized U.K. primary care data linked to hospitalization and deprivation data. Individuals aged 65 years without prior zoster history ( N=862 470) were followed from 1 September 2003 to 31 August 2013. Poisson regression was used to obtain adjusted rate ratios (ARRs) for the association of sociodemographic factors (ethnicity, immi- gration status, individuals' area-level deprivation, care home residence, living arrangements) with rst zoster episode. Possible mediation by comorbidities and immunosuppressive medications was also assessed. Results There were 37 014 rst zoster episodes, with an incidence of 8 /C179 [95% condence interval (CI) 8 /C170-8/C188] per 1000 person-years at risk. In multivari- able analyses, factors associated with higher zoster rates included care home resi- dence (10% higher vs. those not in care homes), being a woman (16% higher vs. men), nonimmigrants ( ~30% higher than immigrants) and white ethnicity (for example, twice the rate compared with those of black ethnicity). Zoster inci-dence decreased slightly with increasing deprivation (ARR most vs. least deprived 0/C196 (95% CI 0 /C192-0/C199) and among those living alone (ARR 0 /C196, 95% CI 0/C194-0/C198). Mediating variables made little difference to the ARR of social factors but were themselves associated with increased zoster burden (ARR varied from 1/C111 to 3 /C184). Conclusions The burden of zoster was higher in specic sociodemographic groups. Further study is needed to ascertain whether these individuals are attending forzoster vaccination. What's already known about this topic? \u0081Monitoring and reducing health inequalities is a statutory requirement in the U.K. \u0081Incidence of herpes zoster is known to be higher among individuals with certain comorbidities and those taking immunosuppressive treatment. \u0081In contrast, little is known about the social determinants of zoster, which may con- tribute to the inequality of zoster disease burden in England. What does this study add? \u0081Older individuals at higher risk of zoster included women, those in care homes, those of white ethnicity and nonimmigrants. \u00a92018 The Authors British Journal of Dermatology published by John Wiley &Sons Ltd on behalf of British Association of DermatologistsBritish Journal of Dermatology (2018) 1 This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. 211\u0081Individuals with certain comorbidities and taking immunosuppressive therapies were at appreciable increased risk of zoster, but this explained little of theincreased risk in the specic demographic and social groups. \u0081The ndings should inform possible future use of the inactivated zoster vaccineamong those at higher risk, including care home residents. Herpes zoster is associated with appreciable morbidity, andpostherpetic precipi- tated by immunosenescence or suppression of cell-mediatedimmunity, and incidence increases with age, with rates vary-ing from 6 -8 per 1000 person-years to 8 -12 per 1000 per- son-years among those aged 60 and 80 years, respectively. 1-5 Antiviral medications may limit zoster symptoms but theireffect on PHN remains uncertain. 6A single-dose vaccine that is effective in preventing zoster and PHN was introduced inthe U.K. in 2013, targeting individuals aged 70 -79 years. 7-10 The effect of sociodemographic factors on zoster incidence has not been extensively investigated. Older individuals andthose of white ethnicity have been shown to be at higher risk of zoster. 4,11,12The association with other sociodemographic factors such as sex, country of birth, marital status and socio- economic status has been inconclusive.3-5,12 -14The unequal distribution of zoster between social groups could potentiallybe exacerbated by differential uptake of zoster vaccination,resulting in even higher disease burden among some olderindividuals. Identifying social groups at higher zoster risk istherefore essential for planning preventative interventions to mitigate inequalities of zoster burden and promote healthy ageing across the population. In England, zoster incidence trends are monitored using general practice data to assess the impact of the vaccinationprogramme, but apart from sex no other social factors arebeing evaluated. 15We have shown that some of these factors can be ascertained using routinely collected electronic healthrecords such as the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), 16one of the world's largest anonymized primary care data sources.17 The aim of this cohort study was to determine the associa- tion of sociodemographic factors with zoster incidence in Eng- land using linked CPRD data in the period immediately beforezoster vaccine introduction, to inform suitable targeted vacci-nation strategies. Patients and methods Data sources This study used anonymized CPRD data linked to hospitaliza- tion and deprivation data. CPRD provides quality-assured clini-cal, lifestyle, demographic and administrative data, for arepresentative sample of ~7% of the U.K. population. 17-19The validity of recorded diagnoses within the database is generallyhigh.18In England, CPRD provides linkages at an individual level with other data, including hospitalization [Hospital EpisodeStatistics (HES)] and deprivation data, for ~75% of practices. 17,18 The deprivation data were based on a patient's area of residenceand/or practice location [Index of Multiple Deprivation acomposite small area-level score]. 17,18 Study population and follow-up This cohort study spanned the 10-year period (1 September 2003 to 31 August 2013) prior to zoster vaccine introduction.The study population comprised patients aged 65 years who were registered with a CPRD practice in England during thestudy period and eligible for linkage. Patients with zoster or PHN codes prior to start of follow-up, or whose rst zoster code during follow-up was PHN, identied in [using for CPRD and International Classica-tion of Disease (ICD) 10th revision codes for HES,Appendix S1] and excluded. Follow-up started on the latest of the following: study start date (1 September 2003); 1 year after current registration date(to avoid retrospective recording of past zoster in rst few months of new registration); 20the date the practice met CPRD's quality criteria;18or individuals' 65th birthday. Fol- low-up ended on the earliest of the following: study end date (31 August 2013); zoster date; transfer-out date; last collec-tion date from the practice; or date of death. Outcome Incident zoster cases were dened as the rst diagnostic code for zoster during follow-up, using both CPRD and HES data(Appendix S1; see Supporting Information). In the HES data,patients with zoster codes in either the primary or the sec-ondary diagnosis elds were included, and the hospital epi-sode start date was used as the date of zoster. Exposures A conceptual framework (Appendix S2), based on the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants ofHealth framework, was hypothesized for the association ofindividual-level sociodemographic factors with zoster inci-dence. 21These factors included immigration status, religion, ethnicity, deprivation, care home residence, marital status,cohabitation (individuals living as a couple) and living alone. The latter three factors provided overlapping information \u00a92018 The Authors British Journal of Dermatology published by John Wiley &Sons Ltd on behalf of British Association of DermatologistsBritish Journal of Dermatology (2018)2Social determinants of zoster disease burden, A. Jain et al. 212about an individual's living arrangements. The code lists and details of how these factors were identied in linked CPRDdata are provided in Appendices S3 and S4. The following fac- tors were categorized as binary variables: being an immigrant to the U.K., care home residence, cohabitation and livingalone. Marital status had six categories: single, married, wid-owed, divorced, separated, and uncategorized/other partner.Religion and ethnicity had eight (Christian, Buddhist, Hindu,Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, other and no religion) and ve (white,south Asian, black, other and mixed) categories, respectively.Social factors that changed with time such as marital status, cohabitation, living alone and care home residence were time- updated over the study period. IMD data were available at both individual- and practice- small area-level as quintiles [1 (least deprived) to 5 missing IMD data were assignedtheir practice's IMD quintile. Other variables Based on previous data 22and the U.K. Green Book10guidance for immunosuppressive conditions considered to be a con- traindication to live zoster vaccination, certain predisposingconditions and immunosuppressive medications identied either CPRDor HES (Appendix S3) that were considered immunosuppressive from the time of recorded diagnosis included rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory boweldisease, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, chronicobstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, human immunode-ciency virus infection, other cellular immune deciency andsolid organ transplant. with and otherplasma cell dyscrasias were considered to be immunosuppressed for 24 months following each record. 22Information on immunosuppressive medications was extracted using previously described methodology.22Details for identifying immunosup- pressive conditions and treatments in these data are provided S4 -5. All putative mediating variables were catego- binary variables. Age was categorized in 5-yearly bandsfrom 65 to 84 years, with a nal category of 85 years. The study period was divided into ve approximately equal cate- gories to observe any temporal changes in zoster incidence. Analyses For all sociodemographic factors, the person-time at risk, number of rst zoster cases and missing values were tabulated.Zoster incidence rates for each factor were obtained by divid-ing the number of zoster cases by the person-time at risk. The demographic characteristics of individuals with a past history of zoster excluded from the study were compared with indi-viduals included in the study. Poisson regression was used to estimate incidence of the rst zoster episode and 95% condence intervals (CI). Hypothesistesting was conducted using likelihood ratio tests unless other-wise stated. Age, sex and calendar period were considered as apriori confounders; age and sex were also considered as risk factors in their own right. The effect estimates for all explana- tory and hypothesized mediating variables were rst examinedafter adjusting for the three a priori confounders in a mini-mally adjusted model. A hierarchical approach to causal mod-elling, based on the hypothesized causal framework betweenthe factors of interest, was then adopted for multivariable anal-yses (Appendix S6). 23The rst multivariable model included the confounders, ethnicity and immigration status (model 1); patient-level IMD was then added (model 2), fol- lowed by care home residence and living alone status (model3). The potential mediating effects of comorbidities and thera-peutic agents were examined in models 4 and 5, respectively.Collinearity between closely related factors (for example livingarrangements) was assessed by comparing measures of effectand log standard errors of the coefcient in minimally adjustedand multivariable models. For multivariable models, individu- covariate data were analysed. Data were anal- ysed using the Stata 14 software package (StataCorp, CollegeStation, TX, U.S.A.). Ethics The protocol for this research was approved by the Indepen- dent Scientic Advisory Committee (ISAC) for Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency Database Research (protocol number 16_168) and made available to the journaland reviewers during peer review. The study was alsoapproved by the Observational/Interventions Research EthicsCommittee of the London School of Hygiene and TropicalMedicine (Reference: 11910). Results The cohort initially included 931 830 individuals (Fig. 1)from 385 practices across England, of which 69 360 wereexcluded because of a prior history of zoster. The demo-graphic characteristics of patients with and without a priorzoster history (excluded and included, respectively, in thestudy) are presented in Appendix S7. Those with a previoushistory of zoster were likely to be older at the start of the study (1 September 2003), women, nonimmigrants and indi- viduals of white ethnicity, but were similar to included indi-viduals with respect to IMD quintiles. The median follow-up time for the eligible study cohort (N=862 470) was 4 /C133 [interquartile range (IQR)1 /C182-8 /C107] years. More than half of the eligible study population werewomen and were aged 65 -69 years at the start of follow-up (Table S1; see Supporting Information). Data were missing for four variables: religion (98% missing), marital status (47% missing), ethnicity (17/C1 5% missing) and sex ( <0/C101% missing) (Table S1). For <0/C11% of the study population ( n=849), the missing values of patient-level IMD were replaced by practice-level IMD (Table S1). \u00a92018 The Authors British Journal of Dermatology published by John Wiley &Sons Ltd on behalf of British Association of DermatologistsBritish Journal of Dermatology (2018)Social determinants of zoster disease burden, A. Jain et al. 3 213In total, 37 014 individuals experienced a rst zoster epi- sode during follow-up, the median age 75 /C17 years (IQR 70 /C12-81 /C18 years) the incidence 8/C179 (95% CI 8 /C170-8 /C188) per 1000 person-years at risk (Table S1). The unadjusted zoster rates for all sociodemo-graphic factors and mediating variables are presented inTable S1. A decision was made to drop the two variables with appre- ciable missing data (religion and marital status) from further analyses. Ethnicity and sex were retained in the analysis but individuals with missing data were dropped. The completecase analysis included 711 590 patients, after dropping partic-ipants with missing data on ethnicity ( n=150 878) and/or sex ( n=2) (Fig. 1). Demographic characteristics of individu- als with and without missing ethnicity data are provided inAppendix S8. Those without ethnicity data were similar tothose included in the analysis with only slightly lower zoster incidence and marginally fewer comorbidities (Appendix S8).In the minimally adjusted model (adjusted for age, sex and calendar period, Table S2), zoster rates increased linearly with age, the adjusted rate ratios (ARRs) in the oldest age groups(aged 85 years) being 40% higher than for those aged 65 -- 69 years. There was little evidence of changing incidence overthe study period. For the sociodemographic factors of interest,men, those who were of non-white ethnicity, immigrants,those living in more deprived areas (at the practice or patient-level) and those living alone had lower rates of zoster, with reduced rates of between 5% (for moderate deprivation at the patient-level) to 53% (for black ethnicity) (all P-values <0/C1001). Care home residents had higher zoster incidence (ARR 1 /C112, 95% CI 1 /C106-1 /C118) than non-care home residents. As expected, most of the comorbidities and all immunosup-pressive treatments were associated with higher zoster inci-dence (Table S2). After adjusting for immigration status in addition to the a priori confounders (model 1), the effect of ethnicity wasPatients aged 65 years during study period 01/09/2003-31/08/2013 registered with a CPRD practice and meeting the data quality assessment criteria N = 931 830 Total patients included in the study N = 862 470Patients with zoster code prior to start of follow-upaor with a first zoster code during follow up recorded as PHN N = 69 360 Multivariable analyses: complete case analysis with non-missing data for all exposure variables (except for religion and marital statusb) N = 711 590Patients with missing data for ethnicity and /or gender excluded N = 150 880 [Ethnicity ( n = 150878), gender ( n = 1) and both ethnicity and gender (n = 1)] Fig 1.

Jain et al. 214almost unchanged, with each non-white ethnic group remain- ing at lower risk of zoster [ranging from a 15% reduced rate(other ethnicity) to a 51% reduced rate (black ethnicity), Table S2]. In contrast, the effect estimate for immigration status was slightly attenuated after additionally adjusting for ethnicity,although immigrants remained at 23% lower risk of zoster. Practice- and patient-level deprivation were closely correlated, as were living alone and cohabitation status; thus, only patient-level IMD was added to model 2 and living alone to model 3.There were no appreciable changes in the effect estimates foreach factor with successive adjustment (Table S2). Those living in a care home had about a 10% higher rate of zoster, and those living alone a reduced rate of 4% (model 3, Table S2). None ofthe factors appeared to be mediated by comorbidities orimmunosuppressive therapies (models 4 and 5, Table S2). When analyses were repeated for those with missing ethni- city data, effect estimates in the minimally adjusted analysiswere all in the same direction of the main analysis(Appendix S9). In further sensitivity analyses, restriction to those of white ethnicity also showed no differences to the main analysis (Appendix S10). Substitution also did not change the ndings. Discussion In this large population-based cohort study, sociodemographic factors independently associated with higher zoster risk included age, female sex, white ethnicity and care home resi-dence. There was little evidence of increased incidence amongminority ethnic groups, those living alone or living indeprived areas. As in previous studies, increasing age, speciccomorbidities and immunosuppressive treatments were associ-ated with higher zoster incidence. This study used one of the world's largest quality-assured pri- mary care databases, linked to hospitalization and social depriva-tion data, and provided data for a wide range of social factors,including potential mediating variables for zoster risk. Theseresults could be potentially generalizable to older individualswithout prior history of zoster from countries with universalaccess to health care as in the U.K. Ascertainment of social factorsusing routinely collected electronic health records was achievedby using detailed coding algorithms and rigorous methodology. Causal modelling based on a predened conceptual framework ensured quantication of robust effect estimates. The limitations associated with use of routinely collected data included potential misclassication of both exposure andoutcome. Time-varying exposures such as living alone may bemisclassied in these data if not updated in a timely mannerin general practitioner records. Similarly, for binary variables,the assumption that absence of a code implies absence of the characteristic may not be true. However, the methods used in this study are based on our previously developed methodologyfor ascertainment of social factors among older individualsusing linked CPRD data, which found prevalence of factorssuch as ethnicity, living alone, cohabitation and care homeresidence comparable with the 2011 English Census, whereasbeing an immigrant was under-represented in these data. 16In the U.K., zoster is mainly diagnosed clinically;22however, a clinical diagnosis of zoster in primary care is reported to havea high (91%) positive predictive value among older individu-als. 24Any misclassication of exposure or outcome is likely to be nondifferential, tending to bias effect estimates towards thenull. Thus, the actual effect estimates may be even larger thanobserved here. Differential zoster ascertainment in different social groups is a consideration. For example, it is possible that those living alone or in more deprived areas may not seek care for zoster. Those seeking ongoing care for their comorbidities may havea higher opportunity of zoster diagnosis, although we foundno mediating effect of comorbidities for any of the social fac-tors examined. A previous U.S. study reported that 95% ofolder individuals were likely to consult for zoster, irrespectiveof sociodemographic characteristics such as income or maritalstatus. 25Unavailability of factors such as education, income and social class, and poor recording of religion (2%) and mar-ital status ( ~50%) in these data precluded the assessment of their association with zoster in this study. Finally, excludingindividuals with missing ethnicity data could have biased ourresults, but further multivariable and sensitivity analysesshowed no evidence for this. The rates in this study are comparable with previously reported zoster rates of 6 -8 per 1000 person-years and 8 -12 per 1000 person-years among individuals aged 60 and80 years, respectively. 2However, the overall incidence of rst zoster episodes in this study of individuals aged 65 years was slightly higher than a U.K.-based study of only immuno-competent individuals that reported zoster rates of 5/C1 96 (aged 65-69 years) to 6 /C122 (aged 85 years) per 1000 person- years. 26 Increasing age and female sex are both known to be associ- ated with higher zoster incidence owing to age- andsex-related immune differences and possible differences inhealth-seeking behaviour. 2-4The nding of lower zoster dis- ease burden among individuals of non-white ethnicity seen inthis study has been previously reported. 4,11 -14This effect of lower zoster incidence among individuals of non-white ethni-city could be explained by persisting immunity to zoster inlater years because of late-onset varicella in individuals born in the Caribbean or tropical countries, 3,14,27,28although immigrants represent a heterogeneous group in terms of their country of origin and age of arrival in the U.K. There was lit-tle evidence of collinearity between ethnicity and immigrationstatus, and the nding of lower zoster incidence among thoseof non-white ethnicity, independent of immigration status,could perhaps be explained by social mixing patterns inextended families leading to varicella contacts and boosting of zoster immunity among older individuals. 29It is also possible that zoster might be underdiagnosed if individuals of non-white ethnicity who developed zoster were less likely to consult or lesslikely to be diagnosed, but it seems implausible in view of thelarge effect seen. The association of care home residence with \u00a92018 The Authors British Journal of Dermatology published by John Wiley &Sons Ltd on behalf of British Association of DermatologistsBritish Journal of Dermatology (2018)Social determinants of zoster disease burden, A. Jain et al. 5 215higher zoster incidence was noted independent of age and comorbidities. The effect of malnutrition on immune functioncould also play an important role; previous research has sug- gested that nearly one in three care home residents could be at risk of malnutrition. 30-32The association of higher zoster inci- dence with certain comorbidities and taking immunosuppres-sive treatment has been previously reported. 2,3,5,22,33Similarly, as reported previously, we also did not nd any evidence of anassociation of diabetes with zoster disease burden. 22The associ- ation of social support, cohabitation or being married with zos-ter incidence is conflicting: some studies have reported no association with being married, 5,12,14individuals with a con- dant having lower12or no effect14on zoster incidence, whereas another study reported higher zoster risk among individuals not cohabiting.4The unexpected nding of an independent associa- tion of living alone and lower patient-level IMD with lowerincidence of rst zoster episode could perhaps be because of ahigher occurrence of zoster among these social groups beforethe age of 65 years and thus their exclusion from the current study. However, there was no evidence for any appreciable dif- ferences in patient-level IMD scores when the characteristics ofindividuals with/without prior zoster history were compared. In conclusion, this large population-based cohort study has identied social factors associated with zoster incidence amongan older population in the U.K. Typically, older patients withhigher level of deprivation, those of non-white ethnicity,immigrants and those living alone are at greater risk of infec- tious diseases; interestingly, our study found these groups were at lower risk of zoster. However, care home residence was asso-ciated with higher zoster burden and it may be worth consider-ing targeted vaccination of this group. Further research on therisk of PHN in these social groups would also help inform vac-cination policy. It will be interesting to determine in futurestudies whether these social groups with higher zoster inci-dence come forward for zoster vaccination. References 1 Hope-Simpson RE.

To assess the impact of missing data, I conducted some additional analyses, described in next section. 7.4.1 Additional analyses to assess the impact of missing data Additional analyses include those that were presented in the Appendices of the paper (Sections 7.2 and 7.3) and those conducted subsequently. Together, these extended analyses comprised: (1) A comparison of the baseline characteristics of patients included and excluded (owing to missing ethnicity data) from the complete case analysis was conducted. The re asons for start and end follow -up between the two groups were also compared. (2) As the group excluded from the main analyses had missing data for ethnicity, fully adjusted multivariable models (adjusted for other socio -demographic factors including ethnicity) could not be compared between the excluded group and the individuals included in the primary analyses. However, it was feasible to compare the association of socio -demographic factors except ethnicity with zoster disease incidence in minimally adjusted an alyses (adjusted for age, gender and calendar period) between the two groups. (3) Minimally adjusted analyses for the entire study population (N=862468), excluding only the two patients with missing gender data, and comparing the results to the minimally adju sted analysis for the individuals who were included in the complete case analysis. 7.4.2 Results of additional analyses Results of the three additional analyses conducted are summarised below. 232 (1) Individuals excluded from the complete case analysis because of miss ing ethnicity data (n=150878) had a slightly lower rate of zoster 6.88 -7.29) per 1000 person -years ) compared to the participants included in the main analysis with zoster incidence rate of 9.09 (95%CI 9.0 -9.20) per 1000 -years (Table 7 -1). Table 7-1 Comparison of zoster incidence between total study population, individuals included and excluded from the complete case analysis The baseline characteristics of patients included in the complete case analyses and excluded from these analyses owing to missing ethnicity data are also provided in Appendix 8 ( Section 7.3). Patients included in the analysis were slightly older at their current registration date with their GP: median age 57.8 years (IQR: 43.6 -67.7 years) compared to 54.5 Years (IQR: 40.7 -65.2 years) for excluded patients. Participants excluded from the analysis were also more likely to be from the two extreme age groups at the start of follow -up (65 -69 years: 56% versus 50%; 85 years: deprived patient -level IMD (~29% versus 22%) and slightly more likely to be living alone (~38% versus 34%). Excluded patients were less likely to have co -morbiditi es such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and COPD/asthma . In the excluded group, individuals were also less likely to be recorded as an immigrant (0.3% versus 1.3%) or to be residing in care home (~5% versus 8%). When, in further analyses, the criteria used for start and end of follow -up were compared for the two groups ( Table 7 -2), individuals included in the analysis were more likely to have joined the practice recently compared to the excluded group (entering the study one year after they registered with the practice), Zoster incidence per 1000 person -years at risk (95% confidence i nterval) Total study population N=862470 Outcome=37014 8.79 (8.70 -8.88) Patient s included in complete case analysis N=711590 Outcome=32459 9.09 (9.0 -9.20) Patient 4555 7.08 (6.88 -7.29) 233 perhaps explaining the better capture of ethnicity data in the included group. Individuals with missing ethnicity data were more likely to end follow -up because they had transferred out of the practice (22% compared to 15% of those with non- missing ethnicity data ).

Overall, the effect estimates were in the same d irection as those from the main analysis. Amongst the excluded group, the effect estimate for care home residence was greater than that in 234 the complete case analysis (RR: 1.31 versus 1.12), although the 95% CI overlapped. In contrast, there was evidence f rom the non -overlapping confidence intervals that the effect of living alone was stronger in the excluded group (RR: 0.85 versus 0.95). Some other difference s included: there was no evidence of linear trend of increasing zoster incidence with age, and the re was no evidence for the association of i mmigration status on zoster incidence (RR: 0.52 (95%CI: 0.22 -1.26) in the excluded group compared the main analysis (RR: 0.65 ( 95%CI: 0.57-0.74) ). Amongst the excluded individuals there was a strong inverse gra dient of decreasing zoster risk with increasing deprivation, with the most deprived individuals in the excluded groups having a lower zoster risk than those in the complete case analysis (RR: 0.74 versus 0.93). (3) The comparison of the minimally adjusted ana lysis for the entire study population with the minimally adjusted model of the complete case analysis is also presented in Table 7 -3 (final two columns). There were no appreciable differences in the effect estimates between these two groups for any of the factors examined. 235 Table 7-3 Socio -demographic factors associated with zoster burden in the minimally adjusted model: comparison of individuals excluded due to missing ethnicity data, those included in complete case analysis and total study population Exposures Individuals exclude d due to missing ethnicity data N=150878$ Outcome= 4555 Patient included in complete case analysis N=711,590 Outcome=32,459 Total study population N=862,468# Outcome=37,014 Minimally adjusted for age, gender and calendar period RR (95% CI) P value* Minimally adjusted for age, gender and calendar period RR (95% CI) P value* (PT) Minimally adjusted for age, gender and calendar period RR (95% CI) P value* (PT)) Age acquired during the study(years) 65-69 1 1 1 70-74 1.10 (1.02 1.36 (1.31 -1.41) (1.32 -1.41) 85 & above 1.19 (1.08 -1.31) 1.40 (1.35 -1.45) Calendar period 2003 -2005 1 1 1 2006 -2007 1.01 (0.92 -1.10) 0.63 immigrant 1 (0.86 -0.93) Care 1 1 1 Yes 1.31 (1.11 -1.54) 0.002 1.12 (1.06 -1.18) 0.0001 1.14 (1.08 -1.20) <0.0001 1.18 (1.12 1.07 (1.05 -1.09) <0.0001 1.09 (1.06 -1.11) <0.0001 $one patient with missing both gender & ethnicity information excluded from analysis # 2 patients with missing gender data excluded RR rate ratios CI confidence interval *likelihood ratio test PT P value for trend IMD index of multiple deprivation 236 7.4.3 Conclusions from additional analyses to assess the impact of missing data The socio -demographic characteristics of the individuals excluded (due to missing ethnicity data) and included in the complete case analysis were described . The minimally adjusted effect estimates for zoster incidence from the main analysis were also compared to (1) a minimally adjusted model restricted to individuals with missing ethnicity data and (2) a minimally adjusted model for the entire study population . Although it was not possible to compare the results of the fully adjusted RRs in those included and excluded from analyses (due to missing ethnicity data for those excluded), the results of minimally adjusted analyses suggest ed that the effect estimates for excluded individuals were generally in the same direction to that of main analysis. The lack of evidence for the effect of immigration status in the excluded group could be due to lack of power to detect an effect - the number of individuals identified as immigrants in excluded group who experienced a zoster episode during the follow -up period was relatively small (n=5; supplementary material to the published paper: Appendix 8). It is also feasible that excluded patients with missing ethnicity data migh t also have lower capture of immigration status recording. There was also no strong evidence of a difference in the effect of care home in the excluded and included groups on zoster incidence. However the effect of living alone in the excluded and included group, although in same direction of lower risk, had non -overlapping 95% confidence intervals indicating a difference between the two groups with regards to this factor. In contrast, the comparison of effect estimates from minimally adjusted analysis bet ween those included in the complete case analysis and those in the total study population were all very similar, including the estimate for living alone. Those excluded had a lower prevalence of co -morbidities, and therefore t he lack of recording of ethnicity in the excluded group may have been due to less GP visits. Given that those with co -morbidities are higher risk for zoster,46 this might explain the higher zoster incidence recorded amongst the individuals included in the main analysis (Table 7 -1). 237 As stated earlier it was not possible to compare fully adjusted models amongst those included and excluded from the analyses owing to missing ethnicity data in the excluded group. However , the effect estimates from the multivariable model (Model 3 in Table 2 of the published paper - adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, immigration status, patient -level deprivation, care home residence and living alone) in the main analysis were largely sim ilar to those of the minimally adjusted model. Therefore, based on the comparison of the minimally adjusted models, if those with missing ethnicity data could have been included in the main analyses, the effect of social factors such as care home residence are likely to have be en similar to the main analysis ; and there was no obvious evidence that missing data had biased the effect estimate for care home residence. For the effect of living alone and those residing in most deprived areas, it is possible tha t the complete case analyses might have underestimated the lower zoster risk in these social groups. 7.5 Chapter summary This chapter described the application of the methodology developed (thesis objective 2 ) for ascertaining socio -demographic factors in lin ked electronic health data by assessing the socio -demographic determinants of zoster disease burden in England. In the next chapter (Chapter 8 ), a further application of this methodology for the assessment of zoster vaccination inequalities in England is d escribed to assess whether specific socio - demographic groups with higher zoster burden are coming forward for zoster vaccination. 238 Chapter 8. A cohort study to investigate the role of social determinants and uptake of zoster vaccine 8.1 Introduction This cha pter is the last of the three chapters comprising the Results section of this thesis. Similar to the previous two Results chapters ( Chapter 6 and 7), this chapter is presented in journal paper format and details the work conducted to meet the fourth and th e final objective of this thesis: to determine the association of socio -demographic factors with zoster vaccine uptake in England. The paper is followed by supplementary material ( Section 8.3 ) to the submitted paper. The results of further investigation into the possible impact of missing data on the findings of the paper, the details of inadvertent zoster vaccination amongst immunosuppressed individuals (a secondary objective in the published paper) and potential misclassification of individuals eligible for zoster vaccination due to the lack of availability of month of birth in CPRD (Section 3.5.3 ) are described in Sections 8.4 , 8.5 and 8.6, respectively. Finally, as introduced previously in Section 1.3.4 , I identify different socio -demographic groups with potential double inequalities in Section 8.7. 239240241 8.2 Submitted paper: Zoster vaccination inequalities: a population based cohort study to identify the association of socio - demographic factors with uptake using linked data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink Anu Jain1*, Jemma L J van Hoek1, Sara L Thomas1 1 Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London , United Kingdom 2 Statistics, Modelling and Economics Department, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London United Kingdom * Corresponding author Email: Anu.Jain@lshtm.ac.uk (AJ) 242 Abstract Objective To quantify inequalities in zoster vaccine uptake by determining its association with socio - demographic factors: age, gender, ethnicity, immigration status, deprivatio n, care home residence and living arrangements. Method This population -based cohort study utilised anonymised primary care electronic health records ( Clinical Practice Research Datalink ) linked to deprivation and hospitalisation data . Data from 35,333 individuals from 277 general practices in England and eligible for zoster vaccination during the two -year period (2013 -2015) after vaccine introduction were analysed. Logistic regression was to obtain adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for the association of socio -demographic factors with zoster vaccine uptake for adults aged 70 years (main target group) and adults aged 79 years (catch -up group). Results Amongst those eligible for vaccination, 52.4% (n=18,499) received the vaccine. Socio - demographic factors independently associated with lower zoster vaccine uptake in multivariable analyses were: being older (catch -up group: aged 79 years) aOR=0.89 (95% confidence Uptake decreased with increasing levels of deprivation (p -value for trend<0.0001; aOR most ( 95%CI: 0.64-0.75) ). Uptake was also lower amongst those of non -White ethnicities (for example, Black versus White ethnicity: aOR=0.61 (95%CI: 0.49-0.75) ) but was not lower among immigrants after adjusting for ethnicity. Lower uptake was also seen amongst females in the cat ch-up group. 243 Conclusions Inequalities in zoster vaccine uptake exist in England ; with lower uptake among those of non-White ethnicities, and among those living alone, in a care home and in more deprived areas. Tailored intervention s to increase uptake in these social groups should assist in realising the aim of mitigating vaccination inequalities. As c are home residents are also at higher risk of zoster, improving the uptake of zoster vaccination in this group will also mitigate inequalities in zoster bur den. Introduction Zoster is cause d by reactivation of latent varicella -zoster virus infection and mainly affects older individuals. It is characterised by a painful dermatomal rash which may be followed by persisting pain called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN).[1] Amongst individuals aged 70 years in England and Wales , an estimated ~53,000 cases of zoster occur annually of which ~27% develop post -herpetic neuralgia. [2] To reduce zoster disease burden, the UK introduced a national zoster vaccination programme (using a live vaccine ) in 2013 , targeting individuals aged 70 years , with a catch -up programme targeting older age groups .[3-5] The programme comprise s vaccine administration to individuals aged 70 years on 1 September of the corresponding year ( the routine cohort). F or the catch -up programme , the vaccine was gradually rolled out in 2013/14 to individuals aged 79 years on 1 September 2013, and in 2014/15 to those aged 78 and 79 years on 1 September 2014. [6, 7] Additionally, eligible individuals who missed the vaccine in previous years were given the opportunity to get vaccin ated in subsequent years. At introduction, uptake of the programme was around ~62% in the routine cohort but has decreased to ~55% in 2015 -2016. [8] The reasons cited for this decline inc lude difficult ies experienced by general practice personnel who were busy with seasonal influenza vaccination, challenges in identifying individuals eligible for vaccin ation, insufficient follow -up of unvaccinated individuals and a potential decline in vaccine knowledge amongst the eligible cohor t.[6-8] Monitoring and reducing inequalities in healthcare services or interventions is a statutory requirement in the UK. [9] Inequalities in vaccine uptake, resulting in higher disease burden 244 in specific populati on groups, are well described. [10-13] Our 2017 systematic review and meta -analysis investigated vaccine uptake amongst individuals aged 65 years in Europe and reported lower seasonal influenza vaccine uptake amongst individuals living alone, those residin g in more deprived areas and amongst immigrants. [12] Currently the national zoster post -vaccination surveillance in England comprises collection of aggregated general practice level data with information only on gender and limited ethnicity data. [8] The na tional zoster vaccine u ptake for England was found generally to be higher amongst males , particularly in the catch -up cohort. [8] The aggregated national zoster uptake data were also utilised in a 2017 study , which reported lower zoster vaccine uptake in deprived areas and amongst most non -White ethnic groups. [14] However in this study, deprivation was assessed as an ecological factor and individuals were assigned ethnicity and vaccination status derived from the proportions reported only at an aggregated general practice level. [14] Ascertainment of the socio-demographic determinants of zoster vaccine uptake can provide important information to public health professional s to address vaccination -related inequalities and reduce zoster disease burden. We have recently shown that r outinely collected clinical and administrative information in the form of anonymised linked electronic health records are a useful resource to examine some of these socio -demographic factors, and these data can be used to suppleme nt the routine surveillance data. [15] The primary objective of this study was therefore to identify the socio-demographic determinants, relevant at an individual level , of zoster vaccine uptake in England , using one of the world's largest databases of gen eral practice electronic health records: the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), [16] with an overarching aim of mitigating vaccination inequalities amongst older individuals. The nine socio-demographic factors of interest included: age, gender, et hnicity , immigration status, deprivation (patient - and practice -level), marital status, cohabitation, living alone and care home residence. As a secondary objective, we also ascertained inadvertent zoster vaccination of individuals whilst they were immunos uppressed, to quantify possible violations of the inclusion criteria. 245 Methods Data source The CPRD provides quality -assured anonymised primary care patients' clinical, administrative and lifestyle data representative of and covering ~7% of the UK populati on.[16, 17] Additionally, CPRD data from ~75% general practices in England can be linked at an individual level to hospitalisation (Hospital Episode Statistics, HES) data, [18] which provides information on all admissions to NHS hospitals, and at lower laye r super output area (LSOA) level (which covers a population of 1000 -3000) [19] to deprivation data (Index of Multiple deprivation (IMD) score). [19, 20] The validity of various diagnoses recorded in CPRD w as reported as high in a systematic review spanning a 21 -year study period. [21] Study population This 2 -year cohort study from England spanned the period from 01/09/2013 to 31/08/2015 , the first two years after the zoster vaccine was introduced . To maintai n patient anonymity, CPRD data provide only year of birth for adult patients . This posed a problem in how to identify individuals who were eligible for zoster vaccination, which is determined by their age on a specific date. The common convention of using the mid -year (1st July) to assign study participants ' day and month of birth would wrongly classify some individuals as eligible for zoster vaccination. Importantly, the resulting unvaccinated group would comprise a mixture of individuals with possibly dif fering social factors: a) those eligible for vaccination who chose not to be vaccinated and b) those ineligible on the grounds of age , thus potentially resulting in biased effect estimates. To address this, we select ed all individuals born in 1943 (or 1934 for catch -up cohort), who would have been eligible for vaccination at some point during the 2 -year follow -up period as follows: those born in January -August 1943 would be eligible for the vaccine in 2013/14 or in 2014/15 if born September -December 1943 ; and determine d vaccine uptake for the 2 -year study period. The study population therefore comprised individuals born in 1943 ( the routine cohort) and in 1934 ( the catch -up cohort), who were alive and registered on 01/09/2013 (the start of the national progr amme) with a 246 CPRD general practice that had agreed to linkage to HES and I MD data and that met CPRD's quality assurance criteria. [20] Start of follow up was on 01/09/2013 and a minimum of five months of follow -up was required from then (i.e. from September until the end of January , coinciding with the main part of the seasonal influenza vaccination season), [22] to ensure that individuals had sufficient opportunity to receive zoster vaccination. Individuals who had any immunosuppressive conditions or therapi es at the start of follow up, that were contraindications to receiv ing the live zoster vaccine ,[4] were excluded from analyses of the socio -demographic determinants of vaccine uptake but included in descriptive analyses of inadvertent zoster vaccinations amongst immunosuppressed individuals . All individuals with zoster vaccine codes prior to the start of national programme and start of the study (01/09/2013) were also excluded. [23, 24] End of follow -up was defined as the earliest of : (a) the end of the stu dy (31/08/2015), (b) individuals ' transfer out date from the practice , (c) individuals' date of death, or (d) the date data were last collect ed from the practice .[20] Defining the outcome Zoster vaccination was determined in five different data files in CP RD: using product codes in patients' therapy files, immunisation codes in their immunisation file s and Read codes ( S1 Table ) in their clinical, referral and test files. [20] Additional immunisation and Read codes provided further information on whether the vaccine was advised, refused or administered. When vaccination data appeared in more than one file, we used an algorithm to assign vaccination date for each individual and handle conflicting information; details are provided in the S1 Text and S1 Fig. Expo sure variables The soci o-demographic factors of interest were i dentified based on our previously developed methodology of using CPRD linked to HES and IMD data .[15] The factors of interest , in addition to age and gender, included ethnicity , immigration sta tus, care home residence , marital status, cohabitation (defined as two individuals living as a couple) and living alone ; code lists are provided in S2 Table . The latter three social factors provided complementary information about an individual's living ar rangements. Religion was not examined as our previous work has shown it to be poorly recorded in CPRD data (<3% of older 247 individuals). [15] For binary socio -demographic variables, individuals without relevant codes were considered not to have that character istic. Ethnicity (five categories: White, South Asian, Black, Others and Mixed) and immigration status (binary) were defined as factors that did not vary with time. Time -varying factors included marital status (six categories: single, widow, married, divor ced, separated, partner uncategorised/other), cohabitation, living alone and care home residence ( binary variables). All the t ime-varying factors were determined at the start of follow up, with any changes by the end of the 2-year follow -up period quantified and described . Deprivation data (IMD quintile at LSOA level: 2015 ) for patient - and practice - level were both available. Practice -level IMD quintile s were used if individual -level data were unavailable . Other variables At the initiation of the z oster vaccination programme, GPs were encouraged to co -administer zoster with seasonal influenza vaccine (SIV). [25] We therefore investigated the concurrent administration of zoster vaccine with SIV . This was achieved by identifying specific product codes, immunisation type codes and Read codes in CPRD ( S3 Table ) during the SIV -March) [26] Individuals who received SIV or/and zoster vaccine were quantified. We also identified, throughout the study period, ind ividuals who had immunosuppressive conditions or treatments that were contraindications to receipt of zoster vaccine. This was done to identify those who were eligible to receive the live zoster vaccine for the main analysis, and to describe the extent of inadvertent administration of zoster vaccine to those with contraindications. The immunosuppressive conditions and drugs included were those listed in the UK Green Book; code lists (S2 Table) and algorithms used to identify these are described in the S4 Table. [4] A past history of zoster was also ascertained using zoster or PHN codes from both CPRD and HES (S5 Table ) occurring before the start of follow -up (01/09/2013), or a first zoster code of PHN occurring during fo llow-up. 248 Analyses A complete case a nalysis using multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association of soci o-demographic factors with zoster vaccine uptake , using adjusted odds ratios ( aOR) with 95% confidence interval s (CI). Logistic regression models were chosen to address the problem of potential misclassification of individuals for vaccine eligibility based on their date of birth and therefore the lack of information on person -time at risk for vaccination. The exposure and outcome characteristics of individuals exclu ded from complete case primary analysis because of missing data were described. Gender and being a part of the routine or catch -up cohort (born in 1943 and 1934, respectively) were considered to be a priori confounders of the socio -demographic factors of interest, as well as potential determinants of zoster vaccine uptake . An existing conceptual framework [27] was adapted to postulate the hierarch ical inter-relationships between distal and proximate social factors with the outcome (S6 Table) .[28] Using th is framework, socio - demographic factors were added sequentially, as long as data sparsity or multicollinearity were not encountered . Standard errors of the coefficient s were compared in successive analyses to assess mult icollinearity between socio -demographic factors . Likelihood ratio tests were conducted for hypothesis testing unless otherwise indicated. Linear trends, if appropriate, were also examined for ordered categorical variables such as patient - and practice -level IMD. Differences in the effects of social factors in the two age groups (routine and catch -up) were investigated by adding interaction terms to the models. In sensitivity analyses, we repeated multivariable analyses : 1) restricted to individuals who were followed up for the entire study period of two years; 2) adding the social factors that had been excluded due to multicollinearity issues; 3) replacing the status of the time-varying factors to that ascertained at the end of follow -up instead of at the st art of follow -up, and 4) including past history of zoster in the final multivariable model as a potential mediator of some of the socio -demographic factors. Additionally, inadvertent zoster vaccination amongst individuals with immunosuppressive conditions or therapies was also described. 249 Data were analysed using Stata 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Ethics Approval was sought and obtained from the Observational/I nterventions Research Ethics Committee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (Reference: 11910 ) and from the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC) of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (reference:16_168) . The ISAC protocol was made available to the reviewers of this paper. Results A total of 39,120 individuals born in 1943 or 1934 and with no evidence of prior zoster vaccination were registered with a CPRD practice, which had consented to linkages, on 01/09/2013 (Fig1). After excluding those who had contraindications to zoster vacci ne at the start of follow -up or less than 5 months follow -up, 35,333 individuals from 277 practices were considered for the primary analysis (Fig 1). 250 Fig.1 Zoster vaccine uptake study flow chart 251 Primary analysis A slight majority of the participants in the primary analysis (Table 1) were female. A higher proportion was born in the year 1943 (the main target group), were from a White ethnic background, and were cohabiting (living as a couple) and/or not living alone. Data for marital status were missing for ~37% participants (Table 1) and practice -level IMD was used to replace the missing patient -level IMD for 0.07% (n=26) participants. A past history of zoster was present for ~11% of participants (Table 1). 252 Table 1.

Uptake amongst the main target group (those born in 1943) was ~53% compared to ~51% amongst the catch -up cohort (individuals born in 1934). Nearly half (n= 17,527 ) of the participants received both zoster vaccine and SIV (Fig 2); of these, only ~37% (n=6455) got both vaccines on same date (Fig 2), however the majority (~87%, n=16,066) received zoster vaccination during the influenza campaign period -March) [26] of 2013/2014 and 2014/2015. Amongst who SIV, (n=20,685) received SIV in both while 2013/2014, and 4.2% (N=1 ,184) only in 2014/2015 season (data not shown). A decision was made to drop marital status from the multivariable analyses, due to a large proportion of individuals with missing data for this variable . Thus, in the subsequent complete case analysis, only patients with missing ethnicity data were excluded. This resulted in a final study population of 31,449 individuals, amongst whom the zoster vaccine uptake was 53.5% (Fig 1). Comparison of individuals included (n=31,449) and excluded (n=3884) from the complete case analysis due to missing ethnicity data is available in S7 Table. Briefly, excluded individuals were more likely to be in the main target cohort, and to be from less deprived patient - and pra ctice-level areas, and were less likely to be care home residents, to have evidence that they were an immigrant or to have past history of zoster. The e xcluded group was also less likely to be vaccinated for zoster . Time -varying exposures at the start and end of follow -up remained largely unchanged for ~99% individuals included in the complete case analysis (S8 Table). a) Minimally adjusted model In the analysis adjusted for a priori confounders (gender and year of birth), there was strong evidence of an a ssociation between higher zoster vaccine uptake and male gender, with uptake 10% higher compared to females (Table 2). There was also evidence of lower vaccine uptake amongst the catch -up cohort, immigrants, those of non -White ethnicity, care home residen ts, those living alone and those not cohabiting, with reduced odds of between 12% (being in the catch -up cohort) to 46% (Black ethnicity) (all p values <0.001, Table 2)). 255 There was also strong evidence for a linear trend (p for trend <0.0001) for decreasin g vaccine uptake with increasing patient -level deprivation (IMD) score, the most deprived group having 34% lower odds of uptake compared to the least deprived group. Non -linear decreases in uptake were seen for practices in more deprived areas (Table 2). 256 Table 2.

As patient - and practice -level IMD were considered to be correlated, and as social factors relevant at an individu al level were more of interest, only patient -level IMD was added to Model 2. No noticeable changes in effect estimates between Model 1 and Model 2 were observed, and the strong evidence of linear trend of lower uptake with increasing deprivation score seen in minimally adjusted analysis was still evident (p<0.001) in this model. Similarly, living alone status and cohabitation were closely correlated, and so living alone was added to the final multivariable model (Model 3), along with care home residence. Ag ain, the previously observed associations of lower uptake with living alone and residing in care home persisted in this model; individuals living alone and those residing in care home had 15% and 36% decreased odds of uptake, respectively (Table 2). The ef fect estimates for other variables were unchanged. There was evidence that the effect of male gender, patient -level IMD and care home residence varied with age (Table 3). Analyses showed that the increase in vaccine uptake among males was restricted to the catch -up cohort, and that the effects of care home status and (to a lesser extent) increasing deprivation on lower vaccine uptake were more marked in the catch -up cohort compared to the routine cohort. 258 Table 3 Interaction between age and social factors Gender Total N (column %) Zoster vaccinations N (row %) Stratum -specific adjusted# OR for zoster vaccination (95%CI) Immigration status Total N (column %) Zoster vaccinations N (row %) Stratum -specific adjusted# OR for zoster vaccination (95%CI) P-value Immigrant 186 (1.5%) 80 -1.29) Ethnicity Total N (column %) Zoster vaccinations N (row %) Stratum -specific adjusted# OR for zoster vaccination (95%CI) cohort IMD Total Zoster vaccinations N (row Stratum -specific adjusted# OR for zoster vaccination (95%CI) P-value group home residence Total N (column %) Zoster vaccinations N (row %) Stratum -specific adjusted# OR for zoster vaccination (95%CI) Yes 616 (4.8%) 230 (37.3%) 0.53 (0.45 -0.63) Living alone Total N (column %) Zoster vaccinations N (row %) Stratum -specific adjusted# OR for zoster vaccination (95%CI) P-value for group Not living alone 14005 (74.7%) 7860 0.89 (0.82 -0.96) # Final (Number of patients=31449 vaccine uptake= 16,838 (53.5%)) OR odds ratio CI confidence interval *likelihood ratio test 259 Sensitivity analyses There were no appreciable differences between the baseline characteristics of individuals with follow -up for the entire 2 -year study period and those included in primary analysis (follow -up period of 5 months) (Table 1). The results of multivariable analyses for those with longer follow up were similar to those from primary analysis except there was some attenuation in the association of ethnicity with vaccine uptake; individuals of Other ethnicities had 31% reduced odds (versus 39% in primary analysis) of uptake compar ed to those of White ethnicity in this model (Table 4). 260 Table 4 Sensitivity analyses: Social factors associated with zoster vaccine uptake complete case analysis (Model 3) Variables Primary analysis N=31,449 vaccine uptake: OR (95% CI) P value~ (PT) OR (95% CI) P value~ (PT) OR (95% CI) P value~ (PT) OR (95% CI) P value~ (PT) OR (95% CI) P value~ (PT) OR (95% CI) P value~ (PT) Gender Male 1.08 (1.04 -1.13) 0.0005 1.10 (1.03 - 1.16) 0.003 1.07 (1.02 1.08 (1.04 -1.13) 0.0005 1.09 (1.04 -1.14) 0.0003 Female 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Year of birth 1943 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Yes 0.94 (0.77 -1.14) Ethnicity White 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 South Asian IMD Least deprived 1 1 1 Not in model# 1 OR (95% CI) P value~ (PT) OR (95% CI) P value~ (PT) OR (95% CI) P value~ (PT) OR (95% CI) P value~ (PT) OR (95% CI) P value~ (PT) OR (95% CI) P value~ (PT) Practice - level IMD Least deprived Not in model# Not in model # Not in model# 1 Not in model# Not in model# -0.90) Care home* No 1 1 1 alone 1 1 Not in model# 1 1 1 1 Yes model# Not in model # 1 Not in model# Not in model# Not in model# Not in model# Yes 1.30 (1.25 -1.36) <0.0001 History of zoster* No Not in model Not in model Not in model Not in model Not in model Not in model 1 Yes 1.12 (1.04 -1.20) 0.002 OR odds ratio CI confidence interval PT P value for trend ~ likelihood ratio test a restricted to individuals with follow -up of 24 months b Including cohabitation instead of living alone in multivariable analysis c Including practice level IMD instead of patient level IMD d Excluding patients with immunosuppressing condition at end of follow -up (n=1835) instead of at start of follow -up and e xcluding those with follow -up <5months e Care home status at end of follow -up f includes history of zoster in the model *determined at start of follow -up IMD index of multiple deprivation # excluded due to multicollinearity issues262 Substitution of cohabitat ion status instead of living alone, practice -level IMD instead of patient -level IMD, excluding individuals with immunosuppressive conditions at the end as opposed to start of follow -up (S9 Table) and determining care home status at the end instead of start of follow -up (Table 4: sensitivity analyses) did not change the findings. Individuals with a past history of zoster had 12% higher odds of uptake (Table 4), but inclusion of past zoster in the multivariable model made little difference to the other effect estimates. To assess the impact of excluding individuals from the complete case analysis, a further exploratory analysis was conducted, by re -running the minimally adjusted analysis for the entire study population (N=35,333) with follow -up 5 months inclu ding those with missing data on ethnicity (S10 Table). Comparing the minimally adjusted model with that of primary analysis revealed no noticeable differences in effect estimates. Inadvertent zoster vaccinations Of the 19,330 in the total study population who received vaccination (Fig 1), 3% (n=596) received zoster vaccine whilst immunosuppressed. [4] Of these 596 patients, 28 (4.7%) patients had more than one immunosuppressive condition at the time of vaccination. The maximum number of immunosuppressive con ditions at time of vaccination was three. The most common immunosuppressive condition (n=445) during which the patients received zoster vaccine was cancer chemotherapy or radiotherapy, followed by patients taking other immunosuppressive medications (n=69), patients with leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, other plasma cell dyscrasias (n=49), treatment with immunosuppressive of oral corticosteroid (n=28), c ellular immune deficiency (n=25), solid organ transplant (n=9) and HIV (n=1). None of the patients receiv ed zoster vaccination during the immunosuppressive phase of a stem cell or bone marrow transplant. Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the inequalities in the uptake of zoster vaccine, administered in a national vac cination programme, using anonymised electronic health records. T his large 2-year population based study from England revealed 263 that lower zoster vaccine uptake was independently associated with being a part of the catch -up cohort, non -White ethnicity, r esiding in a care home, living alone, and not cohabiting (living as a couple). A graded inverse association of patient -level deprivation with vaccine uptake was also observed. Lower uptake was also seen amongst females in the catch -up cohort, and the effec ts of care home residence and deprivation were more marked among the older catch -up group. Strengths and limitations Strengths of the study include the large sample size, and linkages to hospitalisation data which provided additional information about so cio-demographic factors as well as zoster vaccine contraindications. Multivariable analysis, using a hierarchical causal modelling approach, enabled appropriate interpretation of effect estimates. The NHS zoster vaccination programme is administered via ge neral practice only and thus capture of vaccination is likely to be good. Additionally, our previous methodological study investigating ascertainment of soci o-demographic factors in linked CPRD data showed that the distribution of factors such as ethnicity , not living alone, cohabitation and care home residence for individuals aged 65 years was comparable to the distribution in the 2011 English Census. [15] The study limitations include potential misclassification of both socio -demographic factors and the z oster vaccination recording, despite our previous study showing good capture of socio -demographic factors in CPRD data. [15] If this misclassification was non -differential, this may have underestimated the effect estimates in this study . An additional issu e is that some individuals may have changed exposure status over time. Ideally, person -time at risk to estimate vaccination rates would have been preferable but unavailability of complete dates of birth in CPRD precluded this ascertainment. However, factors ascertained at start of follow -up remained unchanged for ~99% individuals at the end of follow -up and sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of the time -varying factors reassuringly revealed similar results to the primary analysis. Th ere was also potential for bias resulting from the complete case analysis (owing to missing ethnicity information) which led to exclusion of data from 11% of the study population. Further assessment of this revealed that effect estimates from 264 the minimally adjusted models for individuals for the entire study population (after dropping ethnicity) had no appreciable differences to those obtained from the complete case analysis. Lack of recording of marital status prevented investigation of its association wit h zoster vaccine uptake, but other closely related variables for living arrangements such as cohabitation and living alone were available. Comparison with other studies Our finding of higher uptake in the main target group compared to the catch -up cohort reflects the findings from the national annual zoster vaccine coverage data for England over the same time period, and vaccine coverage among the individuals in our study who were followed up for the entire study duration (and thus had fuller capture of up take of vaccination) is comparable to the coverage estimates in the national data. [6, 7] Higher uptake amongst males in the catch -up cohort observed in this study also was shown in the national data for 2013 -2015 for reasons that are currently unexplained. [6, 7] This is in contrast to findings from North America that have reported a higher zoster vaccine uptake amongst females .[29-31] The majority of zoster vaccinations (87%) in this study occurred during the influenza season, suggesting that opportunistic targeting of the eligible population for zoster vaccine during SIV programme might have played a role. The national annual zoster vaccination data also supports this finding. [6, 7] Our finding of a linear relationship between increasing level of deprivati on and lower zoster vaccine uptake also confirms the earlier analyses of the national data , which found a similar trend but was restricted to examining deprivation at the general practice -level;[14] studies from the US and Canada have also reported the lo wer zoster vaccine amongst individuals with lower income .[30-32] Higher zoster vaccine uptake amongst individuals of White ethnicity, as seen here, has been reported from other zoster vaccine studies from high income countries. [14, 30, 32 -35] Several of o ur findings are novel with respect to zoster vaccine uptake. These include lower uptake among individuals who were living alone or not cohabiting; this echoes studies showing lower uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine among those living alone in older Euro pean populations. [12] Our finding that i mmigration status was not independently associated with zoster vaccine uptake after adjusting for ethnicity is in contrast with previous 265 findings of lower uptake among immigrant populations for seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccine in Spain and Israel, although none of these studies adjusted additionally for ethnicity .[36-43] The lower uptake of zoster vaccine among care home residents adds to a number of studies investigating uptake of other vaccines such as influenza and pneumococcal vaccines which have reported higher and lower uptake respectively, amongst care home residents. [44-48] Interpretation of findings and implications This study demonstrates that in a public funded healthcare system, vaccination ine qualities exist during a crucial period of programme initiation, and identifies socio -demographic groups that could be targeted with t ailored interventions to increase zoster vaccine uptake . Of particular interest is the finding of lower uptake among care home residents; we have shown recently that individuals in care homes are at higher risk of developing zoster, [49] and so are a group with possible double health inequity (of both zoster burden and zoster vaccine uptake). Lower vaccine uptake among these residents could be due to lack of awareness amongst care home staff about the newly introduced programme and issues around getting consent. The reasons cited for differential (higher or lower) uptake of other vaccines among care home residents have included presence of vaccination polices in care homes, staff awareness, vaccination consent from the residents, location and care home ownership (public versus private). [44, 47, 48] The potential double health inequity amongst care home residents hig hlights a need for more rigorous targeting of these individuals to mitigate health inequality. Similarly, targeting of older individuals who live alone may be needed to encourage zoster vaccination. Individuals cohabiting or living with their relatives may be more motivated by their social networks to get vaccinated. Secondly, higher disease awareness amongst these individuals, by witnessing the debilitating effect of zoster in their relatives, may also increase uptake. This was examined in a US study that reported higher zoster vaccine uptake amongst individuals in the three months after occurrence of zoster in their partners, reflecting a short term effect o f disease awareness. [49] However, our finding that adjustment for a past personal history of zoste r made little difference to effect estimates of 266 social factors suggests that social networks may have a longer -lasting effect on encouraging vaccine uptake in older individuals, or that the occurrence of zoster in partners versus self may have a different effect on uptake. The lower uptake of vaccine among those of non - White ethnicity, but the attenuation of this association after restricting to individuals with longer follow up, suggests that there might be delay in uptake amongst some ethnic groups. There may be a lack of zoster disease awareness among some ethnic groups because of lower lifetime risk of zoster, which may be due to genetic causes, social mixing patterns that limit contacts with varicella and thus boosting of varicella -zoster virus immunit y, and late onset of varicella among those born overseas. [33, 49, 50] Alternatively, the lower uptake may reflect existing healthcare inequalities. The lack of association of i mmigration status with zoster vaccine uptake after adjusting for ethnicity could be due to confounding by ethnicity, or simply to lack of power to detect an effect - the number of individuals identified as immigrants in the study population was relatively small (1.4%; n=512) of which zoster vaccine uptake was observed amongst only 229 individuals . It is also feasible that in England, where national zoster vaccination programme is available free -of-charge, vaccination inequalities were not observed for older immigrant populations . Conclusions This population -based cohort study provid es evidence of inequalities in zoster vaccine uptake in the period immediately after the introduction of a national vaccination programme , identifying a wide range of socio -demographic determinants of uptake of zoster vaccine . This work should encourage effective planning and implementation of specific intervention s to target these socio -demographic groups to mitigate vaccination inequalities amongst older individuals. Factors that are currently poorly recorded in routinely collected data, such as religio n, education and income, should inform policy drivers such as the sustainability and transformation partnerships to incentivise better recording of these factors and/or facilitate other data linkages for comprehensive knowledge and future interventions to improve overall health and wellbeing of older populations. As care home residents are both less likely to receive zoster vaccine and are at higher risk of zoster, improving the uptake of zoster vaccination in this group will also mitigate inequalities in z oster burden . 267 Funding This research was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Immunisation at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in partnership with Public Health England (PHE) .

S1 Fig Decision flow chart for ascertaining zoster vaccine status Please see Figure 5 -1 of this thesis . 277 8.4 Further investigation of the likely impact of missing data Individuals with complete covariate data were included in multivariable analysis, and this led to the exclusion of 3884 (11%) study participants with missing ethnicity data (study flow chart: Figure 1 subm itted paper Section 8.2). As with the analyses of zoster burden presented in Chapter 7 , the complete case analyses of the socio -demographic determinants of zoster vaccine uptake could have resulted in biased effect estimates. To assess the impact of missi ng data, I utilised the same approach as for the zoster disease burden analyses and conducted three additional analyses, which are described in the next section. 8.4.1 Additional analyses to assess the impact of missing data Although the analyses were briefly discussed in the submitted paper, they are reported in detail here. These three analyses included: (1) The baseline characteristics of patients included and excluded from complete case analysis were compared. The start of fol low-up for all study participants was on the same date (01/09/2013; the start of the national zoster vaccination programme), but the reasons for end of follow -up in the two groups were also compared. (2) Comparison of minimally adjusted analyses (adjusted for age and gender) between those included and excluded from the complete case analyses. (3) As described above (2), minimally adjusted analyses for the association of all socio - demographic factors except ethnicity (the variable with missing data) with zoster vaccine uptake for the entire study population were also compared with the minimally adjusted estimates from the primary analysis. 8.4.2 Results of additional analyses A comparison of the baseline characteristics of the individuals excluded and included in complete case analysis is shown in Section 8.3 (Supplementary material: S7 Table of the submitted paper). Individuals excluded from analyses were less likely to be vaccinated (43% versus ~54% in the included group); they were also more likely (70% versus 60%) to b e from the main target group (those aged 70 years) and were slightly younger at the time of registration with their GP (median age 48.9 years versus 52.9 years for the included group). 278 Excluded individuals were also more likely to be from less -deprived pra ctice- and patient - level IMD, less likely to be care home residents (1.7% versus 3.6%) or to be recorded as an immigrant (0.6% versus 1.6%). The reasons for individuals' end of follow -up are shown in Table 8 -1. The main differences between the two groups was that the individuals excluded from the study were less likely to die during the follow -up (0.6% versus 2.9% in the included group).They were also more likely to end follow -up at the study end date of 31/08/2015 (64% versus 59% of those included in the main analysis). Table 8-1 Reasons for end of follow -up for patients excluded (due to missing ethnicity data) and included in complete case analysis Reason Patients excluded from complete case analysis due to missing data on ethnicity N=3884 Patients included in complete case analysis N=31449 End of follow -up* End of study 2468 (63.5%) from Transfer out date 22 (0.6%) 897 (2.9%) Transfer out date and death date 5 (0.1%) 163 (0.5%) End of study and death date - 2 (0%) * All study participants started follow -up at the start of national zoster vaccination programme: 01/09/2013 A comparison of the minimally adjusted models for the association of socio -demographic factors with zoster vaccine uptake for both analyses (2) and (3) is provided in Table 8 -2. The minimally adjusted effect estimates for deprivation, living alone and cohabitation from the excluded and included groups were in same direction (Table 8 -2). There was some evidence that the lower uptake amongst those living alone (OR:0.62 (95%CI: 0.54 -0.71)) in the excluded group was more marked compared to those included in the analysis (OR:0.85 (95%CI: 0.81 -0.89)).The main differences between the excluded and the included groups were for male gender, care home residence and immigration status . The odds of uptake were lower (OR: 0.85 (95%CI: 0.74-0.96)) amongst males in the excluded group versus t he slightly higher uptake (OR: 1.10 (95%CI: 1.05 -1.15)) amongst males in included group (Table 8 -2). There was no evidence for the association of care home residence with zoster vaccination (OR: 1.46 (95%CI: 0.89 -2.39)) in the excluded group compared to lo wer odds of 279 vaccine uptake in the included group (OR: 0.66 (95%CI: 0.58 -0.74)); however, the former analysis was based on only 65 individuals residing in a care home. Although the point estimates were very similar, there was also no evidence for an associa tion of immigration status (OR: 0.76 (95%CI: 0.32 -1.83) in the excluded compared to those included in analyses (OR: 0.71 (95%CI: 0.59 -0.85)); as with care home residence, this latter analysis was based on only 22 individuals coded as being an immigrant. In contrast, the minimally adjusted effect estimates for the entire study population were largely similar for all socio -demographic factors of interest to those from complete case analyses (Table 8 -2). 280 Table 8-2 Socio -demographic factors associated with zoster vaccine uptake in minimally adjusted model: comparison of individuals excluded due to missing ethnicity data, those included in complete case analysis and total study populatio n Exposures Individuals excluded due to missing ethnicity data N=3884, uptake=1661 (42.8%) Individuals included in primary complete case for age & gender OR (95% CI) P value~ (PT) Minimally adjusted for age & gender OR (95% CI) P value~ (PT) Minimally adjusted for age & gender OR (95% CI) P value~ (PT) Gender Male 0.85 (0.74 1.10 (1.05 -1.15) 0.0001 1.07 (1.02 -1.11) 0.002 Female 1 1 1 Year of birth 1943 (main target group) 1 1 1 1934 (catch -up alone* living alone 1 1 1 1 1 OR od ds ratio CI confidence interval PT P value for trend ~ likelihood ratio test IMD index of multiple deprivation *at start of f ollow -up 281 8.4.3 Conclusions from additional analyses to assess the impact of missing data As mentioned in Section 8.4.1 , owing to missing ethnicity data it was only possible to compare effect estimates adjusted for gender and age between the total study population and the groups excluded and included in the complete case analyses. Within the complete case analyses (Table 2 of the submitted paper, Section 8.2 ), the estimates for all socio - demographic factors (except for immigration status) remained largely unchanged from minimally adjusted estimates to those from the multivariable model (Model 3: adjusted for age, gender, ethnic ity, immigration, deprivation, care home residence and living alone). Further adjustment for other socio -demographic factors in the analyses for the excluded individuals, has this been possible, would not have altered appreciably the effect estimates repor ted in the minimally adjusted model for these individuals (other than immigration status). The minimally adjusted model including all (excluded and included) individuals provides effect estimates that are likely to be similar to those that could have been obtained in a fully adjusted model (data permitting). In the excluded group, there was no evidence for the effect of immigration status, unlike the included group, though the point estimates were very similar. However, this could have been due to lack of power and perhaps due to poorer capture of immigration status amongst these individuals who were missing ethnicity data. It was also not feasible to adjust the effect of immigration on uptake for ethnicity, which in the main analysis suggested that the eff ect of being an immigrant was confounded by ethnicity. Similarly, the differences in the minimally adjusted estimates for care home residence amongst the two groups could be explained due of lack of power in the excluded group. For the total study populat ion, on the other hand, there were no appreciable changes in the minimally adjusted effect estimates for these factors compared to those observed in the complete case analyses. The effect of gender (with lower odds of uptake amongst men) on vaccine uptake in the minimally adjusted analysis for the excluded group is interesting. As described in the submitted paper ( Section 8.2 ) the effect of gender on vaccination in the routine and catch - up cohort was examined by adding an interaction term to the main analys es (Table 4 of the 282 submitted paper, Section 8.2 ), the results of which are reproduced below as Table 8 -3 for comparative purposes. In the main analysis, there was strong evidence that the effect of gender was different in the two age groups, with higher va ccine uptake amongst males being restricted to the catch -up cohort. Table 8-3 Interaction between age and gender: complete case primary analysis Gender Total N (column %) Zoster vaccinations N (row %) Stratum -specific adjusted# OR for zoster vaccination (95%CI) (49.1%) 1 # Final Model 3 from Table 2 of the paper (Section 8.2) OR odds ratio CI confidence interval *likelihood ratio test As mentioned in Section 8.4.2 , the excluded group contained a higher proportion of individuals belonging to the routine cohort (70% versus 59.6% in the included group) . When further stratified by gender, the majority of excluded males were also from the routine cohort (1305/1788, 73%). Similar to the main analysis, I examined the effect of gender in the excluded cohort stratified by age by adding an interaction term to the minimally adjusted analysis ( Table 8 -4). Table 8-4 Interaction between age and gender amongst individuals excluded from analysis Total N (column %) Zoster vaccination N (row %) Stratum -specific OR for vaccine uptake P value of interaction Main target group Males 1305 (33.6) 530 (40.6) 0.83 (0.71 -0.96) 0.56 Females 1417 (36.5) 642 (45.3) 1 Catch -up cohort Males 483 (12.4) 196 (40.6) 0.90 (0.71 -1.14) Females Total 3884 (100) 1661 (42.8) As shown in Table 8 -3, in the main analysis , there was no evidence for an effect of gender on uptake in the routine cohort. However, a mongst the excluded individuals, the stratified analysis (Table 8 -4) revealed a lower uptake amongst men compared to women in the 283 younger (routine) group with little evidence of an effect of gender in the catch -up cohort, although assessment of the latter was limited by small numbers. As the excluded individuals included a higher proportion (73%) of males from the routine cohort (Table 8 -4), this may have explained why , overall, there was no increased odds of vaccination among males in the excluded group, i f the effect of increased uptake in older males was being diluted by a higher proportion of younger males . It is also possible that males excluded from the analyses because of missing ethnicity data could comprise those with low health -seeking behaviour, w ho were possibly less likely to come forward for vaccination. However, for the total study population, in keeping with the findings for other socio -demographic factors, there was no appreciable difference for the effect of gender in the minimally adjusted analysis to that observed in the complete case analyses. Moreover, the national surveillance data for 2013 -2015 , which captured coverage data from almost all practices in England, also found increased uptake amongst men in the catch -up cohort but very simi lar uptake among males versu s females in the routine cohort .68, 69 This is in keeping with the findings of my primary complete case analysis. 8.5 Inadvertent zoster vaccination amongst immunosuppressed individuals As discussed in previously in Section 1.2.6 , currently only live zoster vaccine is available in the UK, which is contraindicated for those with immunosuppressive conditions or taking immunosuppressive therapies. A secondary objective of this cohort study ( Section 8.2 ) was to assess inadvertent zoster vaccination amongst immunosuppressed individuals to quantify the magnitude of possible violations of the UK zoster vaccination guidelines.60 The methods to identify individuals who had an immunosuppressive condition/therapy that is a contraindica tion for the live zoster vaccine were described in Chapter 5 (Sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 ). Inadvertent zoster vaccination was discussed briefly in the submitted journal paper ( Section 8.2). Details about the number and the type of immunosuppressive condition s/therapy at the time zoster vaccination are provided here. The rationale for this further characterisation was that this information could be useful in increasing awareness of primary care healthcare providers about contraindications to zoster vaccination . 284 Of the 19,330 individuals in the total study population who received vaccination, 3% (n=596) received zoster vaccine whilst they were immunosuppressed. Of these 596 individuals, the majority (95%; n=568) had only one immunosuppressive condition and/or t herapy at th e time of vaccination (Table 8 -5). Amongst individuals with single immunosuppressive condition/ therapy, the commonest condition was a recent receipt of cancer radiotherapy or chemotherapy (n=425; 75% of the total) followed by use of other non -steroid immunos uppressive drugs (n=56; 10%). Table 8-5 Individuals at the time zoster vaccination Immunosuppressive condition/ therapy of (6.5%) Oral steroid (immunosuppressive doses) 25 (4.4%) Cellular immune deficiency 20 (3.5%) Solid organ transplant 4 (0.7%) HIV 1 (0.2%) Total 568 (100%) A further 26 individuals (4% of the total 596) had two immunosuppressive conditions and/or therapy at the time of vaccination, most of these individuals (n=18; 69% of the total) were also those who had recently received cancer chemoth erapy or radiotherapy (Table 8 -6). Table 8-6 Individuals with two immunosuppressive conditions at the time zoster vaccination Immunosuppressive condition/ therapy other immunosuppressive drugs 5 (19.2%) Cancer radio/chemotherapy & oral steroids 3 (11.5%) Cellular immune deficiency & other immunosuppressive drugs 3 (11.5%) Solid organ transplant & other immunosuppressive drugs 3 (11.5%) Cellular immune deficiency & haematological malignancies 2 (7.7%) Cancer radio/chemotherapy & solid organ transplant 1 (3.8%) Total 26 (100%) 285 Only two individuals (0.3% of the total 596) had three immunos uppressive conditions (Table 8-7). This indicates that the presence of more than one immunosuppressive conditions at the time zoster vaccination was less likely to lead to the breach of vaccination guide lines. The possibility of misclassification of immunosuppressive status resulting in overestimation of violations of vaccine policy is discussed in Chapter 9 . Table 8-7 Individuals with three immunosuppressive conditions at the time zoster vaccination Immunosuppressive condition/ therapy Number of individuals with zoster vaccinations Cancer radio/chemotherapy & other immunosuppressive drugs & solid organ transplant 1 (50%) Cancer radio/chemotherapy & other immunosuppressive drugs & haematological malignancies 1 (50%) Total 2 (100%) 8.6 Potential misclassification of individuals eligible for zoster vaccination As the month of birth for adults was unavailable in CPRD ( Section 3.5.3 ), individuals born in 1943 (or 1934 for the catch -up cohort), who would have been eligible for the vaccine in 2013/14 (if born between January -August) or in 2014/15 (if born between September - December) were selected (Figures 3 -9 and 3 -10). Fo r the primary analysis individuals included in the study were required to have a minimum follow -up of 5 months, while individuals who completed the follow -up for the entire study period i.e. 24 months were included in the secondary analysis (Figure 1 of th e submitted paper, Section 8.2 ). It is possible that some individuals born between September - December (Figures 3 -9 and 3 -10) were only followed up for the first 5 months of the study period (September 2013 - January 2014). These individuals would not have been eligible for zoster vaccination during the period (2013/14) that they contributed data for primary analysis. Inclusion of these ineligible individuals would have biased the ORs towards null. I examined this in a secondary analysis of individuals who w ere followed -up for the entire study period i.e. 24 months (Table 4 of the submitted paper, Section 8.2 ). The results of multivariable analyses were similar to those of 286 the primary analysis except the lower odds of uptake amongst non -White ethnicities were attenuated. This may indicate that the effect estimates from the primary analysis perhaps better capture early adopters of vaccination and that specific socio -demographic groups may come forward later. It is therefore important to repeat the analysis of v accine uptake as the campaign continues to observe temporal changes in the inequalities of vaccine uptake identified in the first two years of the vaccination programme. 8.7 Double inequalities Having completed investigations of socio -demographic determinants of both zoster disease burden and zoster vaccine uptake, it was possible to identify individuals from specific socio - demographic groups who were \"doubly disadvantaged\" ( Section 1.3.4 ) i.e. at increased risk of developing zoster and also having lower zoster vaccine uptake. The two s uch groups identified (Table 8 -8) included individuals residing in care homes and older females (Table 8 - 3). These individuals could be specifically targeted with more personalised interventions to reduce vaccination inequalities. This is discussed further in Section 9.4 .

The implication for future research and public health are also described. 288 Chapter 9. Overall discussion & conclusions The first section of this chapte r briefly recapitulates the overall aims and objectives of the thesis, provides a synopsis of the main results and discussion points from the more detailed description presented under the Results section and also describes the overall strengths and limitat ions of this work. The second section of this chapter explores the implications of this work for public health and future research. 9.1 Recapitulation of the aims and objectives of the thesis The overall aim of this thesis was to assess inequalities in vaccine -preventable disease burden and vaccine uptake in older individuals using routinely collected EHR and to contribute towards achieving the goal of health equality. The objectives of this thesis ( Table 1-2) were: to identify from the existing literature whic h socio -demographic factors were associated with vaccine uptake amongst older individuals ( objective 1 ); to develop methodology for the ascertainment of socio -demographic factors and to assess their recording in the linked UK EHR of older individuals ( objective 2 ), and then using the linked EHR t o describe socio -demographic factors associated with zoster disease incidence (objective 3 ) and zoster vaccine uptake in England ( objective 4). 9.2 Summary of main findings 9.2.1 Which socio -demographic factors are associated with uptake of routinely administered vaccines amongst older individuals in Europe? What was previously known ? A previous review described associations of social factors such as socio -economic level, education, marital status, urban or rural area of residence and ethnicity with uptake of a single vaccine: seasonal influenza vaccine.156 No overall effect estimates for the associations with vaccine uptake, or assessment of between -study heterogeneity, were provided. 289 What does this thesis add? The comprehensive systematic review (published paper: Chapter 2 ) conducted to meet the first objective of this thesis, examined the association of uptake of all routinely administered vaccines amongst older individuals with a wide range of socio -demographic factors: living alone, religion, immigration status, residence (rural/ urban), marital status, education, income, vaccination costs, social class and area -level deprivation. This was also the first review to quantify the association of these factors with vaccine uptake, using meta -analysis. Furthermo re, a detailed quality assessment of the published literature and exploration of the reasons for between -study heterogeneity using meta -regression were conducted. The review identified 35 eligible studies, which quantified the association of socio-demograp hic factors with seasonal influenza, pneumococcal, zoster and pandemic influenza vaccination. One key factor identified in this review to be associated with seasonal influenza vaccine uptake was living alone, which is emerging as a broader determinant of h ealthy ageing.15, 157 Higher seasonal influenza vaccine uptake was observed amongst individuals not liv ing alone while lower uptake of this vaccine was observed amongst individuals from more deprived areas and immigrants. The studies included in the review had low risk of bias due to exposure or outcome misclassification, but had a higher risk of confoundi ng bias. However, multivariable meta -regression analysis undertaken to investigate between -study heterogeneity for the effect of education (a social factor with sufficient studies to conduct meta -regression) with seasonal influenza vaccine uptake indicated that heterogeneity in study findings was partly explained by vaccination costs and by confounding bias. 9.2.2 To develop methodology for ascertainment of socio-demographic factors and to assess their availability in EHR amongst older individuals What was prev iously known ? Methodologies to improve ascertainment of social determinants of health in EHR are required to allow utilisation of these databases for researching health inequalities on an 290 ongoing basis and to also provide insights into improving data quali ty. The quality and completeness of recording for one social factor, ethnicity, had been assessed in linked CPRD data.137 However, data for the completeness of recording of ethnicity specifically for older individuals were unavailable and this previous evaluation was conducted mainly during the period when general practit ioners were incentivised to record ethnicity. Some other studies have utilised EHR in the UK to assess time -varying factors such as residence in a care home and cohabitation.136, 141, 143, 144 However, these studies did not did not report the timeliness or representativeness of recording of these factors and did not utilise primary care data linked to hospitalisation data. What does this thesis add? Methodology was developed for assessing the re cording of socio-demographic factors, which could potentially be determinants of health inequality, including disease burden and health care interventions. In addition to ethnicity and small area -level deprivation, six other socio-demographic factors were assessed: religion, immigration status, marital status, place of residence, living alone and cohabitation (living as a couple). The quality of recording of these factors was evaluated using four pre -set standards: completeness, representativeness, timelin ess (when appropriate) and the contribution made by linkages to EHR in addition to primary care data. The completeness of recording for these factors varied considerably from 2.6% (for religion) to 79.4% for ethnicity. The recording of ethnicity, care home residence, and living arrangements (living alone and cohabitation) was comparable to the 2011 English Census data. Despite using country of birth and \"first language\" codes, the number of individuals coded as immigrants was under -ascertained in these data compared to the 2011 English Census (as detailed in Chapter 6 ). Timeliness (recording within the last five years of date of interest) for time -varying factors ranged from ~35% to ~60%. Linkages to other datasets improved the availability of ethnicity data from ~55% in CPRD to ~79% using both CPRD an d HES; while deprivation data were only available as linkage. This thesis demonstrated that linked CPRD data can be successfully utilised for ascertainment of socio-demographic factors. Based on the analyses re ported in Chapter 6 , ethnicity, care home residence, living arrangements (living alone and cohabitation) and 291 deprivation can be assessed in these data as potential socio -demographic determinants of inequalities amongst older individuals. Some factors, such as religion and marital status, were found to be poorly captured in these data. GP incentivisation plays an important role in completeness of these records as was exemplified by the recording of ethnicity. Incentivisation of GPs for recording of other socio-demographic factors and linkages with other data sources may help to improve the completeness of these data. 9.2.3 Health inequalities and social determinants of zoster disease burden What is already known on this topic? The zoster vaccination programme was introduced in September 2013 in the UK. To make a comprehensive assessment of the impact of zoster vaccination on zoster disease burden, studies to identify any disparities in zoster burden in the pre -vaccination period are required. Although certain co -morbidities and immunosuppressive therapies are known to be associated with high risk of zoster, the social determinants for zoster disease burden in England, which may contribute to inequalities, are not well known. What this study adds Inequalities in zost er disease burden were seen amongst individuals aged 65 years in England during the ten -year period prior to vaccine introduction (2003 -2013). In multivariable analyses, older individuals identified at a higher risk of zoster burden included females (16% higher rate compared to males), non-immigrants (~30% higher rate than immigrants) and White ethnicity (for example, twice the rate compared to those of Black ethnicity). Individuals residing in a care home were also at a 10 % higher risk of zoster. Individu als living in the most deprived areas compared to least deprived were at a slightly (4%) lower zoster risk, as were the older individuals living alone versus those not living alone. Adjusting for certain co - morbidities, immunosuppressive conditions and the rapeutic agents (potential mediators of the effect of socio-demographic factors on zoster risk) made little difference to the effect estimates for any of the socio-demographic factors but were themselves associated with appreciable increased risk of zoster. Identification of the social determinants of zoster disease burden in the pre -zoster vaccination era amongst older individuals revealed an interesting picture. As anticipate d, older age, female gender and care home residence were associated with a higher zoster disease burden. However , individuals with a higher level of 292 deprivation, non -White ethnicity, immigrants and individuals living alone were at a lower risk of a first z oster episode, although these social groups are usually considered to be at higher risk for infectious diseases. The associations of older age, female gender, care home residence, White ethnicity, and being a non -immigrant with higher zoster incidence are biologically plausible, as discussed in Chapter 7 , and the appreciab ly increased risk s of zoster among individuals with immunosuppressive conditions or therapies have been shown in previous research . The slight decreased risk of zoster associated with both living alone and living in the most deprived areas was a surprising finding and one which is difficult to explain. It is feasible that these individuals might have had zoster episodes before the age of 65 years that were poorly captured in the historical GP data when these individuals registered with a new GP. 9.2.4 Health inequalities and social determinants of zoster vaccine uptake What is already known on this topic? The national zoster immunisation programme was introduced in England on 1 September 2013, wh ich targeted individuals aged 70 years (routine cohort) with a catch -up cohort of older individuals aged 79 years. Vaccine uptake during first year of introduction (2013 -2014) was ~61% and gradually reduced to ~55% (2015 -2016). The national data provide c overage information using aggregated GP data for gender with limited ethnicity data and coverage by deprivation at the general practice level (as an ecological factor). Uptake was reported to be lower amongst females for the period 2013 -2015, and for indiv iduals of most non -White ethnicities and those registered with general practices in more deprived areas (2014 -2015). What this study adds In multivariable analyses, 36% lower zoster vaccine uptake was observed amongst individuals residing in care homes, 15 % lower uptake amongst individuals living alone and 11% lower uptake amongst those in the catch -up cohort . In contrast to the national data, which utilised aggregated GP data, this study reported the association of social factors such as ethnicity and deprivation at an individual level. Lower vaccine uptake was observed amongst individuals of non-White ethnicity (for example, individuals of Black ethnicity had 39% lower uptake compared to individuals of White ethnicity) - confirming the findings of the previ ous analysis of national data. Conversely, immigration status was not associated with zoster vaccine uptake 293 after adjusting for ethnicity. Unlike the analysis of the national surveillance data that provided information on deprivation at the general practic e level, this study found decreasing vaccine uptake with increasing patient -level deprivation (p value for trend <0.0001) with 31% lower uptake amongst the most deprived patient -level IMD versus the least deprived IMD. Higher uptake (22%) was also observe d for males in the catch -up cohort. Using the results of zoster burden analysis, it was possible to identify individuals with double inequalities (lower uptake and higher disease burden); two such groups identified included individuals residing in care homes and older females. Inadvertent zoster vaccination amongst individuals whilst they were immunosuppressed was observed for ~3% of the study population. This finding should be useful for increasing awareness amongst health care professionals about contrain dications to the administration of this live vaccine. 9.3 Strength s and limitation s The strengths and weaknesses of the systematic review and of the three studies conducted to meet the other objectives of this thesis were comprehensively discussed in the spec ific chapter s: Chapter 2 and Chapters 6 -8, respectively. Here an overview of the strengths and limitations of this thesis are presented. 9.3.1 Strengths 9.3.1.1 Large primary care database linked to other data sources All three studies conducted to meet the study objectives utilised a primary care database: CPRD, which is one the world's largest quality -assured databases and is broadly representative of the UK population. The large sample sizes of these studies were fea sible owing to this large database, allowing reduction of random error with more accurate estimation of effect estimates. The use of CPRD also allowed for a good capture of zoster vaccination data, as the NHS zoster vaccination programme is delivered via p rimary care. There was sufficient power to study the association of multiple exposures with the outcome of interest and to include hypothesized mediating variables in the statistical models. 294 Using primary care data linked to hospitalisation data facilitat ed and improved assessment of socio-demographic factors, incident zoster (the outcome in the zoster burden analysis), co-morbidities and other covariates of interest. Similarly, linkage to deprivation data provided small area -level deprivation status for t he study participants. The availability of long -term data for participants also allowed the exposure and co -morbidities to be time -updated. 9.3.1.2 Conceptual frameworks and ascertainment of socio-demographic factors Pre-defined conceptual frameworks were used in all three observational studies and the systematic review, which facilitated the study of the inter -relationships between the main exposures, hypothesized mediating variables and the outcomes of interest. These frameworks were an adaptation of the conce ptual framework proposed by the WHO's Commission on Social Determinants of Health, which assesses the complex association of social determinants of health with health inequalities.4 Use of these pre -specified frameworks allowed hierarchical causal modelling, adjustment for confounding variables and appropriate interpretation of effect estimates. The details of the methodology developed to id entify socio-demographic factors amongst older individuals in EHR were provided in Chapter 6 . This methodology provides a resource for the research community for the assessment of inequalities amongst older individuals for different conditions and interven tions. The development of code lists for socio-demographic factors utilised in this thesis was an iterative process that also utilised the hospitalisation data. This involved extensive use of codes across data sources including innovative use of \"first lan guage\" codes to help identify immigration status. Time updating these factors, when appropriate, to minimise exposure misclassification and the comparison of recording of the socio -demographic factors in EHR with the standard national data (Census data) pr ovided reassurance about the representativeness of some of these data. 9.3.1.3 Study designs and analyses Suitable study designs, feasible in routinely collected data, were chosen to address the study objectives appropriately. To identify the social determinant s of zoster disease burden and zoster vaccine uptake ( objective s 3 and 4, respectively ) cohort studies were used. Use of a cohort study design for identifying inequalities in zoster disease burden permitted the 295 assessment of incidence rates and incidence r ate ratios. Similarly, a cross -sectional study design, which is an efficient way to assess the prevalence of social factors' recording in the EHR ( objective 2 ), was also utilised. The use of meta -analyses in the systematic review ( Chapter 2 ) made it feasi ble to quantify the association of socio -demographic factors with vaccine uptake amongst older individuals and provided summary effect estimates ( objective 1 ). For the zoster burden and vaccine uptake analyses, exposures of interest were mutually adjusted in multivariable analyses, for example inclusion of both ethnicity and immigration status in the models estimated the association of these two factors with the outcome of interest independent of each other. However, for other closely related socio -demograp hic factors, for example living alone and cohabitation (living as a couple), where collinearity issues precluded the simultaneous inclusion of these factors, sensitivity analyses with these individual factors allowed the ascertainment of their association with the outcome. It was also possible to study numerous hypothesized mediating variables (co -morbidities and immunosuppressive conditions/therapies in the burden study) and other covariates of interest (seasonal influenza vaccine uptake and past history o f zoster) in the uptake study. Although unavailability of complete date of birth in the EHR (discussed in Chapter 3 ) precluded the estimation of person -time at risk for the vaccine uptake analyses, sensitivity analyses allowed for the ascertainment of time varying factors at both the start and end of the follow -up of the study. 9.3.2 Limitations 9.3.2.1 Information bias and misclassification The possibility of both non -differential and differential misclassification of the socio - demographic factors and of the zoster ep isode or vaccination, and the implications of any misclassification, were discussed in detail in Chapters 6 -8. Misclassification of exposures, outcomes and other covariates may occur in a number of ways in routinely collected EHR. This may occur due to coding errors, incomplete capture of some factors by healthcare personnel or may also be due to misdiagnoses of zoster or co -morbidities. It is also possible to misclassify time -varying factors if they are not updated in a timely way in these data. 296 Misclas sification of the binary variables may also occur if the assumption that absence of codes indicate absence of those characteristics is incorrect. If the misclassification of these factors was non -differential with respect to vaccine uptake or zoster incid ence, this may have underestimated the effect estimates in this study. Although not investigated specifically for zoster, in general the validity of diagnostic codes in CPRD is reported to have a high positive predictive value;118 also as mentioned in the Introduction (Section 1.2.4 ) the positive predictive for the clinical diagnosis of zoster is reported to be high (91% -100%).50, 51 The use of these primary care data also maximises the ascertainment of zoster vaccination which is delivered through primary care. I will now highlight specific issues, previously discussed in Chapters 6-8, which are pertinent to the analyses conducted in this thesis. In the zoster burden analysis, ascertainment bias was feasible if zoster episodes were differentially assessed amongst individuals who might not come forward for clinical care, such as individuals from areas that are more deprived or those living alone. This differential misclassification could have led to underestimation of the zoster disease effect estimates in this thesis. It is also feasible that some milder cases of zoster are not captured in these data and the association re ported in this thesis are applicable to zoster cases severe enough to warrant a GP consultation. However, a previous US study has shown that older individuals with zoster are likely to seek medical advice irrespective of their social circumstances, minimis ing the possibility of differential misclassification.85 For both the zoster burden and vaccine uptake study, it was possible that individuals coming forward with zoster symptoms or for vaccination might be more likely to have their socio-demographic factors recorded, biasing the effect estimates for a factor for which an absence of code was treated as the absence of the characteristics (immigration status) or resulting in missing data and exclusion of the individual from multivariable analyses. Although in this thesis the recording of factors such as ethnicity, care home residence and living arrangements in the linked CPRD data were comparable to the prevalence recorded in the 2011 English Census data, factors such as immigration status, religion and marital status appeared to be under -ascertained. The effect of marital status could not be assessed for both burden and uptake analyses due to 297 missing data but results were available for other two closely related factors: living alone and cohabitation. The association of immigration with burden of zoster (aRR 0.77 (0.67 -0.88) versus non - immigrants) could be biased due to under -ascertainment of immigration status in these data. However, if such misclassification was non -differential with respect to zoster risk, this would not explain the protective effect. I also tried to captu re immigration status using the \"first language\" codes (as described in Section 6.4 ), which were included as GPs were incentivised to record first language spoken for all registered patients between 2008 - 2011 .138, 139 This could have led to preferential capture of immigrants who moved from non - English speaking countries, a heterogeneous group, with varying age of acquiring primary infection and zoster risk. For the zo ster vaccine uptake study, the lower odds of vaccine uptake in the minimally adjusted model amongst immigrants was attenuated after adjusting for other variables including ethnicity. As with the burden analyses, the lower uptake amongst immigrants observed in the minimally adjusted model could not be explained if the misclassification of immigration status was non -differential with respect to uptake. The attenuation after adjusting for ethnicity may have been due to confounding of the effect of immigration status by ethnicity, although the inability to detect an effect due to lack of power is also a possibility as there were only 1.4% (n=514) individuals were coded as immigrants for the primary analysis (Table 1 submitted paper Section 8.2 ). For defining t he immunosuppressive period, I included a period of three months prior to the appearance of first code for immunosuppressive therapies in CPRD to account for coding delays based on the assumptions that these therapies were initiated in hospitals. This assu mption may be incorrect for some individuals prescribed high doses of oral corticosteroids for conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which may be initiated by GPs. I could have therefore overestimated the proportion of individuals who w ere vaccinated during a period of immunosuppression. For the burden analyses, for which immunosuppressive agents were considered as potential mediators between socio - demographic factors and zoster inc idence, this misclassification c ould have resulted in attenuation of any mediating effect of immunosuppression on zoster incidence. Conversely , 298 for other immunosuppressive therapies given entirely in secondary care such as cancer radiotherapy, I might have underestimated periods of immun osuppression. Another li mitation of using these data was the potential misclassification of individuals eligible for zoster vaccination due to unavailability of month of birth for adults. As detailed earlier in Section 8.6 , it was possible that effect estimates in the primary ana lyses were under estimated due to the potential inclusion of some individuals born in the later part of 2013 -2014 and only followed -up for the first 5 months of the study period (September 2013 - January 2014) who would not have been eligible for vaccination in 2013 -2014. However, the secondary analysis of individuals who were followed -up for the entire study period (24 months) revealed similar results to the primary analysis except that the lower uptake amongst non -White ethnicities was attenuated. Similarly , the person -time at risk for vaccination could not be ascertained due to the lack of availability of date of birth . As person -time at risk for vaccination could not be determined, to determine study participants eligible to receive the live zoster vaccine and to ascertain the status of other time -varying factors of interest, I chose the option of using immunosuppressive status and time -varying social factors at the start of follow -up. I chose this option based on the assumption that in this older group of individuals the changes in their sociodemographic and immune status was likely to small during the two -year study period. This assumption might not have been correct for some factors such as living alone or cohabitation or some individuals might have initiated immunosuppressive treatment during follow -up. Therefore, to assess the impact of misclassification resulting from these variables not being time updated during the 2 -year study period, I reassessed effect estimates in sensitivity analyses based on the status of these factors at the end of follow -up (Table 3, submitted paper Section 8.2 ) . These sensitivity analyses did not reveal any appreciable differences from the main analysis. For defining individuals eligible for zoster vaccination, the other option that I could have used to reduce misclassification of immunosuppressive status was to exclude all individuals with immunosuppressive conditions/therapies code at any time during the follow -up to determine the number of people eligible for vaccinatio n. As shown in S9 Table (supplementary material to the published paper, Section 8.3 ) out of the total study population (N=39120), 2818 (7.2%) individuals had one or more code(s) for immunosuppressive condition(s) at some 299 time point during the follow -up. Of these 2818 participants, 1494 and 1835 individuals had one or more of these codes at start or end of follow -up, respectively. The number of individuals who had code(s) for these conditions only during the middle of follow -up was very small (n= 377). 9.3.2.2 Selection bias and missing data The study population selected for all the studies conducted to meet this thesis's objectives were derived from the CPRD, which is largely representative of the UK population.114 Although a ll individuals meeting the eligibi lity criteria were included in the cohort studies (inequalities in zoster incidence a nd zoster vaccine uptake) conducted in this thesis, selection bias could have resulted by excluding individuals with missing data. Complete case analyses were used for the two cohort studies after excluding participants with missing data for ethnicity. Thi s led to inclusion of ~83% (n= 711,590 ) and ~89% (n= 31,449) of study population in the primary analysis for the zoster burden study ( objective 3 , Chapter 7 ) and the zoster vaccine uptake study ( objective 4 , Chapter 8 ), respectively. The additional analyses conducted to assess the impact of missing data and the conclusions from these analyses were detailed for both burden a nd uptake cohort studies in Sections 7.4 and 8.4, respectively. Here I discuss some salient features of these analyses. For the burden analyses, it is feasible that complete case analyses might have under - estimated the effect of living alone on zoster disease burden. Amongst the excluded group with missing ethnicity data, the minimally adjusted model (adjusted for age, gender and time) (Section 7.4.2 ) for the effect of living alone on zoster incidence revealed a slightly larger protective effect (aRR 0.85 ( 95%CI: 0.80-0.90) compared to the similar model from the complete case analyses (aRR 0.95 ( 95%CI: 0.93-0.97) and that from the population (aRR 0.93 ( 95%CI: 0.91-0.95) . Similarly, in the zoster vaccine uptake study (as detailed in Section 8.4 ), there was evidence for lower uptake amongst men in the minimally adjusted model (adjusted for age) (Table 8 -2, Section 8.4.2 ) in the g roup excluded from analyses due to missing ethnicity data. The effect of gender between the routine and catch -up cohort was assessed by adding an interaction term to the primary analysis (Table 8 -3) which revealed that the higher uptake was confined 300 to men from the catch -up cohort with no effect in the routine cohort. The excluded group largely consisted of younger individuals from the routine cohort (70% versus 60% in the included group). The excluded group also had higher proportion (73%) of men from the routine cohort , who had lower uptake compared to women (Table 8 -4). However, t he finding of higher zoster vaccine uptake amongst older men (catch -up cohort) in the main analysis in this thesis also echo es the finding s of the national surveillance data , which did not suffer from missing data as discussed previously in Section 8.4 .3. Apart from the complete case analyses for dealing with missing data, I could have utilised multiple imputation. Imputing missing values is appropriate if the data are missing at random. However, I did not use this technique as the assumption of missing at random might not have been valid in these analyses, for example, lack of ethnicity recording could possibly be due to less health seeking behaviour with less contact with health services and thus less opportunity for vaccination. As an alternative to multiple imputation, I conducted series of sensitivit y analyses to examine the effect of missing data on effect estimates. Finally, the association of factors such as religion and marital status with zoster incidence and vaccine uptake could not be examined owing to missing data. As mentioned before, it was feasible to look at the association of other factors closely related t o marital status: cohabitation and living alone in both these analyses. 9.3.2.3 Other factors The association of vaccine uptake with o ther social factors relevant at an individual level , identified in the WHO's CSDH conceptual framework ( Section 1.1.1 ), that were examined in the systematic review ( Chapter 2 ) included education, income and social class . These social factors could not be assessed in the zoster vaccine uptake and burden analyses due to their unavailability in the linked CPRD data . Similarly, I could not examine the association of mediating behavioural factors (cultural factors, knowledge, beliefs and attitudes) with vaccination inequalities, as they were unavailable in these data. These factors are likely to play a role in vaccine uptake in older populations, as has been shown for influenza vaccination.156, 158 Identification of these factors would have provided a more comprehensive picture about the social determinants of 301 vaccination ineq ualities and would allow better implementation of specific int erventions. This would have also provided a better understanding of lower uptake amongst certain socio - demographic groups such as care home reside nce or individuals living alone . For care homes, mediating factors at both individual - and care -home level need exploration. Co- morbidities could also be potential mediators of the association between social characteristics and vaccine uptake or burden of disease. I examined certain co -morbidities, identified as risk factors for zoster in a previous study, as possible mediators for the association between socio -demographic factors with zoster burden, but they did not appear to explain the associations that were seen. Unlike influenza vaccine, there are c urrently no recommended clinical risk groups for targeting with the live zoster vaccine that would prompt GPs to offer the vaccine to individuals with specific co -morbidities. It is possible that, as individuals with co -morbidities are more likely to have repeated contacts with their GP s, this may have provided a window of opportunity for vaccinations. However, this seems unlikely to explain some of the associations seen, such as the higher uptake in males compared to females in the catch -up cohort . 9.3.2.4 Conf ounding Adjusted effect estimates could have residual confounding from misclassification of social factors that were acting as confounders of other factors - for example, as observed for the zoster vaccine uptake analyses, the association of immigration status (lower odds of uptake amongst immigrants) with zoster vaccine uptake observed in the minimally adjusted analysis (adjusted for age and gender, Section 8.2 , Table 2) was attenuated after adjusting for ethnicity. It is therefore feasible that association observed between immigration and uptake could potentially have residual confounding if ethnicity was misclassified. Residual confounding could have also occurred from unmeasured social fact ors such as religion, education, or an individual's income. 9.3.2.5 Reverse causality In the zoster disease burden study, it is possible that some exposures might have resulted from the outcome, for example if individuals develop PHN, this may affect their social life, ability to work and eventually determine their socio -economic status. However, in this thesis 302 first zoster episode was defined as the outcome of interest and individuals with a past history of zoster were excluded from the analyses. Secondly , this ma y also be less likely in view of the study population consisting of older individuals, many of whom would have already retired from work. 9.3.2.6 External validity The demographic group of interest for the aims and objectives of this thesis was the older UK popul ation and therefore all studies conducted in this thesis incorporated older age as an eligibility criterion. In this thesis, the social determinants of the burden of a first zoster episode and zoster vaccine uptake were ascertained for individuals from Eng land. The results are potentially generalizable to older individuals from countries with universal healthcare access and a national zoster vaccination programme as seen in the UK. The generalisability of equity -related outcomes is more likely if there is a biological basis for the association, as seen here for the burden analyses. For vaccine uptake, although knowledge and behavioural factors play a role, the findings from the vaccine uptake study are in keeping with the results from the systematic review ( Chapter 2 ) which presented summary estimates for the association of socio -demographic factors with vaccine uptake in Europe. Therefore, the results of the uptake study are likely to be generalizable to other high income countries offering a national zoster vaccination programme via primary care with vaccination provided free -of-charge. 9.4 Implications for public health and policy makers The rationale for using the socio-demographic factors identified from the systematic review of factors associated with vaccin e uptake was to establish the role of double inequalities (9.4.1 ) i.e. are the factors associated with lower vaccine uptake also associated with higher disease burden? It could be argued that another systematic review examining socio- demographic factors as sociated with vaccine -preventable disease burden could also have been undertaken. However, this thesis utilised the WHO's comprehensive conceptual framework for the social determinants of health,4 and gathered all social factors information available in the CPRD data relevant for older individuals for the burden analyses. 303 The vaccination inequalities found to be present in England within t he first two years of the introduction of the zoster immunisation programme should help public health professionals to target specific groups amongst older individuals to mitigate vaccination inequality, promote healthy ageing and ultimately contribute tow ards a higher and an equitable healthy life expectancy ( 1.1.2 ). Some social factors were poorly captured in the EHR and their association with zoster burden and vaccination could not be assessed in this thesis. Incentivisation of health care professional f or recoding these factors play a role in completeness of recordings as was shown for ethnicity recording this thesis and a prior study.137 This could guide policy makers such as the sustainability and transformation partnerships to incentivise primary care providers for better recording of these factors and to also facilit ate other data linkages for improving the health of older individuals by monitoring and striving towards health equality. 9.4.1 The role of double inequalities As described in Section 8.7 , the findings from this thesis should also help healthcare providers in identifying specific social groups with dou ble inequalities (Table 8 -8) i.e. individuals residing in care homes and older females. Specific interventions directed towards these groups can be implemented to reduce vaccination inequalities. 9.5 Implications for future research 9.5.1 Using electronic health records and future linkages This thesis provided the association of socio-demographic factors with first zoster episodes. Understanding about the social determinants of zoster could be further improved by also ascert aining the social determinants of PHN, an important sequela of zoster. This study question would be also helpful in informing the national zoster vaccination policy. Another important contribution of this thesis is the development of methodology for ascer tainment of socio-demographic factors using EHR. The methodology could be also adapted for use in other countries using EHR and could be potentially extrapolated for use in younger age groups, pregnant women and other individuals in clinical risk groups. I dentifying the social determinants of vaccine uptake amongst these population groups will also 304 enhance the understanding and provide a broad overview of health inequalities in the UK for appropriate interventions. The statistical methods developed as a par t of thesis will be available to other researchers using CPRD and HES data and studying other conditions amongst older individuals. These methods offer a significant opportunity in developing automated surveillance processes for generating ongoing cycle o f inequality assessment i.e. identifying socio-demographic factors for vaccine preventable diseases, other chronic conditions and interventions. This should contribute towards achieving health equalities. The feasibility of future data linkages between pr imary care data, social care data and census data could be explored with appropriate data permissions. Such linkages will not only enhance the availability of biological factors but other social, behavioural and psychological factors that could not be exam ined in this thesis. The establishment of a national health and bioinformatics institute by the Medical Research council, Health Data Research UK to harness different data and research expertise available in the UK is a positive step in this direction.159 9.5.2 Other research questions The asso ciation of social factors such as education, social class and income with zoster disease burden and vaccine uptake could be also examined in future research using primary data collection. The reasons for lower uptake amongst certain socio -demographic grou ps such as care home residents need further exploration for factors relevant at an individual level (for example, knowledge and attitude s towards vaccination ) and at the care home -level (for example, attitude s of staff, vaccination policy implementation). Additionally, as discussed in Section 8.6 , the social determinants of zoster vaccine uptake should be re -assessed as the vaccination programme continues to observe whether vaccination inequalities seen in the first two years of programme change. 9.6 Personal development Conducting different studies as a part of this thesis has been an eventful journey. I found the systematic review and meta -analysis to be one of the most challenging task of this thesis. The diversity of study designs and finding an effective a nd meaningful way to summarise the 305 evidence so they made sense to the readers was an iterative process. This has helped me to develop necessary skills of project management, to conduct meta -analyses and quality assessments. Using routinely collected data f or conducting three different observational studies not only improved my understanding of these data but has made me aware of some of the challenges in study design specific to these data sources. My data management skills, ability to use Stata \u00ae software, applying the principles of epidemiology that I learned during my MSc course to conduct well -designed studies and dealing with uncertainty have definitely improved during the course of this thesis. Presenting the findings of this research in vari ous conferences and writing peer -reviewed papers have also improved my communication skills. Another difficult but an important lesson that I learned during this doctorate was from my two doctorate supervisors: \"how to see the wood for the trees\", an expre ssion used on numerous occasions in our meetings. These skills will undoubtedly help in my future career in Public Health and Medical Microbiology. 306 References 1. World Health Organization. Health Impact Assessment (HIA) .
