The majority of us naturally fall into one of these categories, although it's also possible to have traits of two, or even all three. After we figure out which dosha or doshas dominate us, we can adopt lifestyles and diets that reflect the qualities of the dosha we're lacking. For example, somebody with a vata constitution will find harmony in eating warm, oily, kapha-based foods, rather than light, raw, vata-based foods that will send them further into imbalance. Since vata people also tend to be sporadic and all over the place, they will do well living a more kapha-based lifestyle, adopting a stable routine of sleeping and eating at the same times every day. In addition to balancing our individual dispositions, we should also harmonize with the seasons. For example, during the summer, when pitta predominates, we tend towards ailments such as sunburn, hot flashes, exhaustion, and impatience. In order to pacify the excess of pitta, we must eat foods that are vata and kapha in nature. For example, fruits are perfect for summer because they're sweet, juicy, and cold. Living an Ayurvedic Lifestyle To live an Ayurvedic life means to live a life of balance. In order to get an accurate assessment of your natural imbalances, it's best to schedule a [consultation with an Ayurvedic physician](https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=13263816&calendarID=1272156). After that, you'll know the foods, herbs, and lifestyle choices that will lead you towards harmony, happiness, and longevity. However, Ayurveda also recommends a few general self-care practices for everyone that you can start incorporating now. These include waking up before sunrise, saying a morning prayer, washing with and drinking water, practicing good oral hygiene, self-massaging with warm oils, putting on clean clothes, practicing yoga, breathing exercises, and meditation, and finally, eating a healthy breakfast.
