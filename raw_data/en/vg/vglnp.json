We were not disappointed. There were 14 participants in our group, all at the retreat for different reasons with different histories of psychedelic use. By the end of the week, all of us had transformative experiences that moved us forward in our life journeys and prepared us to take the next steps to move forward positively in our lives. The facilitation team was committed, caring, and skillful; they created a safe and supportive set and setting for our individual and collective experiences. The lodging and food was very good; the proximity to nature and the ocean added greatly to the overall positive experience. I highly recommend this experience to anyone interested in self-knowledge and healing. Hi Virginia, Thank you for your review and it's great to hear that you and your husband got what you hoped for when it came to healing, spiritual growth, and a deepening in your meditations. Much love! I came to Myco after 2 years of severe depression, PTSD, and trauma. I also was struggling with anxiety and panic attacks. Western medicine had made things much worse and it became apparent to me that they that were treating me had no education to actually understand mental illness as there is no understanding in the first place. As a last resort and having read many articles about the efficacy of mushrooms this seemed like the best place to give this a try. Mushrooms saved my life, and they continue to save my life. The quality of being alive is almost at 100 percent now and I'm getting better everyday. It's apparent that increased Neuro plasticity does take place, and this allows the mind to re expand beyond the trauma stepping out of the embedded neurologic freeze of looping thoughts, both conscious and unconscious that seemed for me to propagate this illness. Everything in my life has changed since my visit and I'm so deeply touched by the ability of this magical plant to heal others. I could relate to all of the staff, and the owners were folks that I had felt I'd known for years. The founder himself felt like a childhood friend, someone I had known my entire life, and I shared one of the most sacred and healing moments that I have ever had with him. The support he personally provided was filled with understanding and all of my needs were fully accommodated. The healing potential of this medicine actually dates back to before society became disconnected from it's spirituality and core of existence, back to indigenous tribes that provided simular support as myco does. I've seen 7 phychiatrists and 2 nuerologists and can honestly say they are too far behind the curve of lifes great mystery to help heal folks like myself, and so when working with this sort of medicine it is simply outside of their wheelhouse despite their PH.D. which absolutely proves irrelavent in regards to the facilitation of this plant medicine. It is however in the wheelhouse of the Myco team because that is what they do, and they proof lies in my wellness, a wellness in which there was little to no hope that I would ever reach. I cannot stress enough the bond that I felt with the founder as well as the other owners. My relationships still continue with these folks and lives are being saved through the use of this medicine, mine certainly was. Lastly a great bond has been created between not only the staff and myself but our entire group that was visiting. I have stayed in touch with many attendees and we are now all supporting each other with love, understanding and have now formed a collective thanks to attending Mycomeditations. This was a 100 start experience for me and has again, both saved and changed my life. Hey Garrett, You were so awesome to have on retreat, and you really do have a natural ability to connect with what the mushrooms are trying to show you. Hence, the results you experienced. So happy for you, and hope you continue to do well. I went to MycoMeditations interested in the possibilities of healing and a new perspective on my life. The experience far exceeded my expectations. I stayed in Doranja house (basic), run by the inimitable Doreen - warm, funny, smart, kind \u2014 who fed us amazing meals, made sure we had what we needed, and charmed us with her wit and wisdom. It was comfortable and the food was great. Her daughter Sidi is equally wonderful \u2014 she helped me during one of the sessions with her calm demeanor, humor, and ability to understand whatever is happening on a deep level. We were a group of 13, and Eric and his team took great care of us, handling logistics and unexpected needs with generosity and warmth. Eric's depth of experience with psilocybin is as useful/helpful as it is fascinating. He is also wise enough to say, when it is true, \"I don't know!\" - a refreshing and rare humility. He watched over all 13 of us during the trips, making the rounds in his calm and comforting way, or participating in post-peak conversation with a terrific sense of humor, and his love and enthusiasm for life and the people in it. He dealt with some of the more intense trippers during our second session, and the other facilitators were there for the rest of us. I felt completely safe and cared for by all of them. They understand what you're going through, and know just what to say and how to respond. Psilocybin can be a scary teacher at times, and I knew I was in good hands. It has now been almost three weeks since my trip, and I just had my follow-up integration call with Eric. Like many others, I underestimated the importance of integration sessions, in Jamaica and then back home. It really helps to review how one's life has been since- Eric remembered things I had said during integration sessions in Jamaica and asked about them. (I am impressed with Eric's ability to remember what 13 people said at different times during a very intense week.) I'm still feeling the benefits of the sessions: more connection with others, more clarity, more peacefulness. I highly recommend MycoMeditations to anyone who seeks freedom from the various ways we confine ourselves. Eric and his team are truly wonderful; I trust them completely. I hope to go back! Hello, thank you for sharing your review! We sincerely appreciate it, and we're excited to hear that your experience was warm, supportive, and helpful. Mushrooms are such powerful medicines and how they do their work on us is a mystery...we're happy you see that too :) We hope you have continued to do well in the time after your retreat, and still are able to look back on your experience at Myco to help you navigate challenging times that arise. Take care! I went to Mycomeditations as a last resort to improve my mental health, and I am immensely grateful for the experience. I have had a lifetime of bad experiences with mental health professionals who have been unable or unwilling to understand me or my life. Using the mushrooms in the space that Eric has created allowed me to feel deeply in the presence of others for the first time in my life. And it was easy! Painful sometimes, but easy. The facilitators were on hand if I needed help but did not otherwise interfere with, or judge, my experience. Initially, I had some concerns that some facilitators would also be taking the mushroom (low dose) but my concerns evaporated when I experienced how helpful this was; I can't explain it. I don't like the word \"intuition\" but can't think of an alternative to describe how Eric connected with me and helped me when I needed it most. He has helped me in ways that no psychologist ever has, and, in my opinion, it is his vast experience with the mushrooms that enabled him to do this. All the team at Mycomeditations are committed, professional, and care deeply about the work they are doing. Treasure Beach is awesome; super friendly, relaxed people. Doreen and her family made me feel welcome. I enjoyed the basic accommodation. The introduction of cotton sheets would lift the rating from basic to luxury, in my opinion. Hello Morgan, The title of your review says it all! And we agree :) Thank you for sharing, I'm a clinical psychologist, yoga instructor, and (semi) retired chiropractor practicing in Portland OR, and have a well established serious meditation practice. In addition, I'm a long standing member of the clinical advisory board of a large, behavioral health managed care organization in the US, and have occasion in that role to weigh in on setting clinical care standards for depression, anxiety, substance abuse issues and end of life concerns nationally. During January 2019 I attended a MycoMeditations (MM) retreat in rural Jamaica as one of 13 participants (11 of us were psychotherapy professionals), and 5-6 supportive facilitators. Overall I did benefit from the experience. The facilitators were generally supportive and caring. The setting was lovely. And the mother of one of the facilitators, Doreen, cooked some amazing food for us for our post tripping enjoyment. Our pre trip meetings were thorough, and our post trip debriefings usually helpful. However, there were at least two significant down sides to the experience: 1- There were regular, repeated instances in which belligerent, and/or highly extroverted behaviors, both physical and verbal, significantly impinged on those of us who were having intensely introverted experiences. This felt both intrusive and threatening to me, and occurred on several occasions. To their credit, the facilitators attempted to contain these events, and to an extent succeeded, but the overarching rule of 'trust the fungus' seemed to fuel these occasions. While these intrusions were addressed in our debriefing sessions the next day, they then would occur again during the next lengthy trip experience, of which we had three during our 8 day stay. 2- Drug use. During our late evening, post trip meal sessions it was common place for members to be drinking beer and smoking dope. This is the opposite of the vibe and atmosphere, or context, in which I want to \"hold\" psychedelic experience, which for me is sacred and an occasion for ecstatic dancing as embodied movement. When I brought up this issue, stating that I did not want to hang out in this atmosphere, the next day I was confronted and criticized as \"judgmental\". Eric, the MM leader, made negative comments about my stated interests in holding psilocybin therapy sessions through my practice in Oregon, a state in which a group of us are in the process of attempting to legalize the use of psilocybin mushrooms for this express purpose. Based upon these latter two issues I am unwilling to recommend MM for psychedelic experiences, at least at this time. Last evening here in Portland during an organizational meeting on the use of psychedelics for end of life care, I ran these issues past the man who is taking the lead on the legalization proposal here in Oregon, who is himself an experienced psychonaut and well regarded therapist. He simply said: \"Yup. That is their reputation.\" Hi there, We're sorry you didn't get a warmer impression of your experience at MycoMeditations. Sometimes, sessions can be pretty \"wild\" by most people's standards. We believe teaching people to embrace the unpredictable and possibly chaotic expression that comes from a psychedelic experience is necessary rather than trying to subdue it, as that is the human psyche at work trying to heal itself in the rawest form. We also believe that as adults, it's not our job to police people about a late-night drink with super, or a joint. However, you will never see people getting flat out drunk at Myco. Thank you for sharing about your experience, as we want to hear everybody's opinions about the retreat, whether positive or negative. I am a psychologist practicing in the US and traveled to Myco with a group of psychologists, therapists, and other professionals who are interested in using psychedelics in mainstream clinical practice. Overall, my experience was extremely positive. First, Eric and his team do a spectacular job of orienting you to the experience (as much as that is possible) and creating a safe, encouraging space to be open and vulnerable. It was quite a luxury to not have to worry about anything- housing, food, transportation etc are all taken care of. During the sessions, this allowed me to fully let go to the experience. I completely trusted Eric's team- they have significant experience and are skilled at facilitating this process. Most of all, I appreciated Eric's attitude that he brought to the team- a great balance of confidence in the process of using mushrooms for healing and humility towards the mystery of this practice and of life in general. There is not a rigid structure or ritual or ceremony before or after each sessions which I liked. There are some basic guidelines, but it did not feel like Myco was imposing any principles or values on the group- rather, it was a more open, flexible, and humble approach, with great respect and deference given to the mushrooms and their potential for growth and healing. Second, the focus on integration was extremely helpful. After each session, you listen to the experience of others and share your own. I actually found these sessions to be as helpful as the sessions! As someone with prior psychedelic experience, I know the importance of this part of the process and Myco does a great job at aiming to serve it. Third, the overall environment is ideal. I stayed in \"basic\" housing which was fine. I actually preferred to stay at the place where sessions were held. There was no hot water, but for me that became part of the fun of living a more simple lifestyle while in Jamaica. Doreen prepared meals for us which was a special treat- she and her family (who live on the property) are so loving and great at caretaking. Doreen was approachable about any issues I brought to her (ex. requesting an extra fan). Food was amazing! There were always sober sitters each session. I know that sitters taking mushrooms is controversial and I must admit I was initially a bit concerned about this. However, it became clear to me why this is actually helpful for sitters to be able to be attuned to the experience of the participants. All of the sitters were super experienced and you couldn't even tell who dosed and who didn't (those who did had very small doses). After the retreat, I actually now would prefer my sitters to be dosing along with me! Each person in our group had a very different set of experiences with the mushrooms, but based on integration sessions and talking with individuals, it seemed everyone from our group found it to be beneficial. For me, it was extremely healing. Sessions helped bring up personal issues to work through and made it very clear the ways in which I limit myself in being the person I am. I also reconnected with a sense of spirituality or greater connection that I have experienced in psychedelic sessions many years ago. I also learned so much through the experience of others- testament to the power of group psychedelic sessions. I would recommend Myco to anyone curious about psychedelic healing. There were really no significant negatives or complaints for me. I was anxious about the lack of access to food (based on recommendations to take snacks) though there are opportunities to visit the grocery store and local restaurants to explore for non-provided meals. Eric and his team are skilled, kind, caring, and passionate individuals doing something extraordinary. I feel extremely lucky to have been able to attend a Myco retreat and am committed to returning for future retreats! Hi Brian, Thanks for sharing about your experiences at Myco. We're proud that you and most members of the Contextual Science group had such a warm experience at the retreat. It means a lot to us to have your support. "}
