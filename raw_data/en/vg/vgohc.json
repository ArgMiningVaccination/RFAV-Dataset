She shares with us her daily flow and reflections during this time of personal space in quarantine that we all are experiencing together. Self-Care Flow My body has been craving gentle nourishment. The gentleness of receiving my breath has carried me in ways that I cannot describe. The peace that fills my vessel through breath is so healing. I adore the time I have to prepare my own foods that provide the deepest of nourishment to my cells and soul. I've wandered into new neighborhoods, listening to the spring birds on my morning walks. I stop and marvel at the droplets of dew on the grass and scent of soil. Feeling fresh air and wind on my body is a blessing that I appreciate every day. I have been exploring new audio meditations while taking long baths infused with birch leaves. This medicine has been used by Native Americans as their cure-all to relax the muscles, ease nervous tension and quiet the mind. Frankincense has been a beautiful ally, burned or ingested for its calming and healing properties. Movement In the mornings of seclusion, I wake up before dawn. I play music that relaxes my body and soothes my soul. I rely on breath to guide my physical movements as I relinquish bodily tension and control to the resonance of the music. This is followed by an intense physical workout until my body craves rest again. I lay on the floor full of life force and energy and then meditate again as the sunrises and the birds start chirping. I saw a dove fly over to my window today, and that brought me so much joy! Favorite Products I have so many favorite products, yet I notice that there are a few that I cannot live without. I cannot live without Live Spring Water or [Mountain Valley Spring Water.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTJ0IQ/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001HTJ0IQ&ie=UTF8&linkCode=as2&linkId=5dc74fa0f7e8ca9e939fdf210bbc6971&tag=houseofcitrin-20) I absolutely need fresh greens, and luckily, we have been able to have fresh greens almost every day. Spirulina has been a godsend, amplifying the nourishment of my foods. I have been really enjoying [B-CHILL honey](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZL3MK5R/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07ZL3MK5R&ie=UTF8&linkCode=as2&linkId=70ab28bccc02893c3e2be849bcf2615d&tag=houseofcitrin-20) from Beekeepers Naturals in my daily tea. I love applying Spikenard essential oil from Stillpoint Aromatics to my hands and feet, Female Balance Essential Oil blend by [Floracopeia](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/8968498011?_encoding=UTF8&field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=Floracopeia&productGridPageIndex=2&ref_=bl_dp_s_web_8968498011) applied to my pulse points and Frankincense oil from Young Living applied to my adrenals, chest, third eye and thyroid. I drink sips of Quinton Isotonics infused with scalar biofeedback energy and that feels so refreshing and cleansing to body, mind, heart and spirit. Mental and Spiritual Practice In times of great uncertainty, some of the deepest healing moments and self-realizations can manifest to life. I have found that in the space and time of the COVID-19 quarantine, I have been shown my deepest paralyzing fears and my eternal love for humanity. In waves throughout the day, I gently tell myself to quiet and slow down to the rhythm and pace of my body. I listen for hours on end to the whispers of my heart until they become louder. My heart becomes the only message I can hear. This and only this feeds my soul and body in ways that nothing else can. It centers and grounds me. Listening to my internal guiding system returns my mind and body to the path my soul can only choose to follow. I eagerly open to this seemly vast time of solitude to deepen my body's connection to earth and soul.
