This article presents an overview of the core features of Ru-dolf Steiner's conception of meditation and spirituality based on an anal-ysis of Steiner's work. The main aim of this form of meditation is to connect divinity and nature through the human being. This aim is real-ized through a three-step process of freedom, surrender, and unification. First the human being liberates itself from its dependence on material conditions, then it surrenders and connects with a greater reality beyond it, and finally it brings back the knowledge and capacities gained through the meditative practice to help inform scientific inquiry and to reshape the world. The emphasis on thought, nature, strengthening the self, and sociocultural renewal sets Steiner's conception of meditation apart from other contemplative traditions and current conceptions of meditation, which tend to have a different and even opposite focus. Hence the study of Steiner's conception of meditation provides a novel perspective on the significance of meditation and spiritual practice that challenges how meditation is conceived both traditionally and in contemporary culture and research. Research on meditation is currently focused on traditions and forms of medita-tion with an Asian origin, such as mindfulness meditation1 and its effects.2 Hardly any work is done on European traditions. Until this changes, our under-standing of meditation will remain incomplete. Though some work has been done on the cultural interaction between Asia and Europe in relation to medita- 1 Antoine Lutz et al., 'Investigating the mindfulness-related practi-ces from Peter meditation: A meta-analysis', Mindfulness, 3(3), 2012, 174-189.

Rudolf Steiner's conception of meditation has hardly received any atten-tion at all. One probable reason for this is that, unlike Asian traditions, anthro-posophy has not yet become part of mainstream culture. Furthermore, the work of Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925), which forms the foundation of anthro-posophy, is so extensive that it is hard to even get an initial overview that does justice to the richness, not to say mere quantity, of the textual material (more than 300 volumes). However, the academic research on different aspects of Steiner's work, including anthroposophic meditation, is currently being estab-lished. This is evidenced by the publication of a critical edition of Steiner's work4 as well as numerous academic books and articles appearing in recent years.5 Anthroposophy, and in particular anthroposophic meditation, represents something unique on the global scene of spiritual practice. It connects Europe-an spirituality and philosophy, which is characterized by a positive view of the self and of thinking, with various forms of concrete observation, such as intro-spective observation, the observation of nature, aesthetic observation, and the observation of human interaction. In addition, anthroposophy aims for social and cultural renewal, which has resulted in, to give a few examples, anthropo-sophic medicine, biodynamic farming, and Waldorf pedagogy. This article views Steiner's conception of meditation and spirituality in a philosophical perspective that will be set out in the following introduction, relying in particular on Charles Taylor's distinction between the 'porous' and 'buffered' self, and his concept of 'fullness'. Given that the field of anthroposo-phy is so extensive and that the research is in an early stage, what is presented here is an initial overview Steiner's conception of meditation based on around 60 of Steiner's texts that are either focused on meditation or contain vital in-formation about his view on it. This overview has the benefit of presenting a 3 David L.

RUDOLF STEINER'S CONCEPTION OF MEDITATION AND SPIRITUALITY 3 bird's eye view - it will give an impression of the whole - but many details will be missing. Though my intention is to not miss any essential aspect of Steiner's conception of meditation, there is no guarantee that further investigations into the details will not lead to a change in overall picture. What I propose, more specifically, is that meditation in the way Steiner con-ceived it can be made comprehensible by relating the human being, nature, and divinity to freedom, surrender and unification. To unpack this thesis I will start by describing both the cultural context in which anthroposophy arises and the view of history it represents (1). Then I will describe the more concrete aspects of Steiner's conception of meditation that can be subsumed under the headings of freedom, surrender, and unification (2). These three headings can be under-stood broadly as referring to stages of development in Steiner's conception of meditation; a development that connects the human being to deeper parts of itself, to nature and to divinity. Finally, I will indicate what topics need to be addressed by future research (3). Furthermore, this article is a continuation of earlier work that I have done on Steiner's idea of freedom.6 The triad of free-dom, surrender, and unification, corresponds to the three main aspects in Stei-ner's idea of freedom, which focuses on individualism, egolessness, and unity (or, using an expression from Hegel's philosophy, 'being-with-oneself in other-ness'). Steiner's conception of meditation and spirituality can hence be seen as a developing out of the philosophical idea of freedom that he developed initially. 1. MAN, NATURE, AND DIVINITY One of the most significant cultural events that has happened over the last thousand years of human development is the transition from a mythical and group-centred consciousness to one that is intellectual and individualistic. We can describe this, with Charles Taylor (1931-), as a process of secularization.7 Whereas in earlier times the existence and authority of divinity was taken for granted, today a religious life is just one among many other possibilities. As Taylor describes it, the self used to be 'porous'; much more open to the world, both divine, natural, and social.8 Now the self has become 'buffered'; closed off to the outside world, self-centered, but also self-directed. What happened, I suggest, is that during the course of history divinity is split in two: One part enters the human mind and becomes autonomy; the human being starts to prescribe moral laws to itself rather than receiving them from the outside. An- 6 Terje Sparby, 'Rudolf 7 Charles Taylor, A secular age, Cambridge (MA): Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2007. 8 Taylor, A secular age, 27. TERJE SPARBY 4 other part goes into nature, which then no longer needs an external creator; nature becomes imbued with an inherent creative potential, and is seen as giv-ing rise to biological life and the human mind. Some influential philosophical positions, like naturalism, materialism or physicalism, indeed propose that the human mind is really a creation of natural processes. This view can indeed be seen as a consummation of secularization: The only real creative force lies in nature, which not only brings about the human mind, but also everything that happens in the human mind; all ideas of the divine, gods, etc., are seen as being fully dependent on and originating in physical processes. However, certain dual-istic positions, like that of Immanuel Kant's philosophy, are still available. The-se view the human mind itself as in a sense divine (autonomous), but also claim that it is impossible to give an explanation of how the conscious mind, the self, which has the capacity of spontaneity, of thought and self-movement, can re-late to a universe that is ruled by natural laws. Hence the self is granted some space, but its connection to nature remains both mysterious and outside of rational understanding. The typical story of the 20th century has been that na-ture produces the conscious human being, and then the human being projects divinity. In other words, consciousness and divinity arise from nature and can in principle be reduced to it. Still, different forms of dualism, which afford reality to the mind as well as to nature, continue to be real possibilities, as ex-emplified by, for instance, the 'hard problem of consciousness'.9 The upshot of this process is 'man's emergence from his self-incurred imma-turity',10 a liberating heroic atheism,11 and modern science. Whereas the ancients watched the acts of the gods through divine intuition12 - theoria - theory is now about watching the 'acts' of nature. However, the process of secularization can also be seen to lead to estrangement; a lack of connection with nature, human community, and divinity. The buffered self is encapsulated. It can only experi-ence things in a partial way; it is cut off from a greater reality or sees itself (and even the sense of estrangement) as an illusion. What is really lacking for the buffered self, as Taylor conceives it, is a sense of fullness: We all see our lives, and/or the space wherein we live our lives, as having a cer-tain moral/spiritual shape. Somewhere, in some activity, or condition, lies a full-ness, a richness: that is, in that place (activity or condition), life is fuller, richer, deeper, more worth while, more admirable, more what it should be. This is per- 9 David J. Chalmers, 'Facing up to the problem of consciousness', in: Journal of Conscious Studies 2 (1995) no.3, 200-219. 10 Immanuel Kant, Political writings, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991, 54. 11 Karen Armstrong, A history of God: The 4000-year quest of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, New York: Knopf, 1993, 443. 12 Georg Picht, 'Der Sinn (1964), RUDOLF STEINER'S CONCEPTION OF MEDITATION AND SPIRITUALITY 5 haps a place of power: we often experience this as deeply moving, as inspiring. Perhaps this sense of fullness is something we just catch glimpses of from afar off; we have the powerful intuition of what fullness would be, were we to be in that condition, e.g., of peace or wholeness; or able to act on that level, of integri-ty or generosity or abandonment or self-forgetfulness. But sometimes there will be moments of experienced fullness, of joy and fulfillment, where we feel our-selves there.13 This mode of experience could be called religious. Often the object of religious experience is conceived of as transcendent. It does not have to be. Rather, na-ture can be experienced as 'a veil before the face of God'.14 Fullness can contain both immanence (nature) and transcendence (divinity) in one and the same experience. The metaphor of the veil indicates that the relation between the two cannot be adequately cast in terms of, for instance, 'supervenience', where the mental is seen to depend on the physical, while the physical is independent of the mental.15 If a veil is transparent or touches the veiled object, the shape of the veiled object can be gleaned. Even if the veil is not transparent or touching the object, the veil and the veiled object are nonetheless part of the same reali-ty. And because they are part of the same reality, the veil can be removed to reveal the full nature of that which it was hiding. The experience of fullness can be the ground of a radically altered way of experiencing nature and divinity; a form of experience that can be the foundation of a 'spiritual empiricism' that in principle can be on par with natural or empirical science when it comes to a systematic description and explanation of reality. This is the claim of anthro-posophy. Anthroposophy was described by Steiner as a path of knowledge that seeks to lead the divinity (or the spiritual, 'das Geistige') in man to the divinity of the world at large.16 In one place, Steiner uses a metaphor that is similar to Taylor's in order to describe the current condition of humanity and its relationship to divinity and the world: Throughout the centuries the human being of the civilized world has led the life of a mole. However, the reason for this was to bring about human freedom. Everything that is experienced as part of the progression of humanity has mean-ing. But one must penetrate into this meaning; one must not remain standing at one stage of development, but rather proceed along with the development. And today one must be conscious of this: After humanity has had the experience of 13 Taylor, A secular age, 5. 14 Ibidem. 15 Or more precisely: The mental (including that which appears in the mind as 'divine') cannot be altered in some respect without being altered in some physical respect, while the physical may indeed be altered without something mental being altered. See Donald Davidson, 'Essays on actions and events', in: Journal of Philosophy 1 16 SPARBY 6 freedom within its earthly mole existence, it must ascend again to a perception of divinity, the spiritual world, not only the mathematical world. [...] What is it that is our task today in relation to these things? It is our task to learn again to look out into the world and see spirit everywhere, not only by becoming ab-sorbed in ourselves, wanting to experience spirit there, but also by being able to experience spirit in all shapes of precisely the external cosmos.17 The mole-like existence has lead to an increase in freedom, but the time has come to re-connect with a spiritual world outside of the human being, which involves seeing spirit in nature. We can now return to the two options that we are usually presented with to-day when it comes to understanding the relationship between the human being and nature: We can choose either some form of materialistic monism or some form of dualism. The former sees all creative force as inherent exclusively in nature, while the latter allows for some self-directed moral action, i.e. spontane-ity, that is not reducible to interactions of matter. Anthroposophy is dependent upon making sense of the claim that there is a form of divinity that is neither simply identical to nature nor limited to moral autonomy, and that this divinity is both present within the human being as well as outside of it. Confronted with a materialist stance, the anthroposophist has to separate divinity from nature again (without completely disconnecting it); confronted with a dualist, such as Kant, the anthroposophist must show how the divine is not only inside the human being, but also present in the world at large (which includes nature). Furthermore, anthroposophy must show that divinity and nature can be con-nected in actual experience. This means that it is to be founded upon a real encounter with fullness. This is one of the main tasks of meditation as Steiner conceived it; making the theoretical possibility of spiritual knowledge into an actual practice of attaining such knowledge. There are many traditions that share the aim of connecting the divinity with-in the human being with the divinity outside it. Steiner sought to develop a way of realizing this aim in a way that was well suited for our intellectual, individual-ized, scientific, and secularized age.18 The culture of Steiner's time had been strongly influenced by Goethe and German idealism, in particular Fichte, Schel-ling, and Hegel. These figures have in common that they treat Kant's formula-tion of a divine or higher form of knowledge as something that the human being can attain, which Kant denied.19 The notion of higher knowledge has 17 Rudolf Steiner, Menschenfragen und Weltenantworten (GA 213), Dornach: Klostermann, 2011. RUDOLF STEINER'S CONCEPTION OF MEDITATION AND SPIRITUALITY 7 been part of the history of knowledge since Antiquity, but slowly exited as secu-larization entered the scene. Steiner defended the notion that higher knowledge is within the reach of the human being whilst idealism was on the decline. This decline gave much more room for atheism and naturalism. Steiner also goes through a period of deism, and possibly even atheism, something which reaches a climax in the article Der Egoismus in der Philosophie (later changed to Individual-ismus in der Philosophie).20 In this article God is declared to be a projection of the human self. Around 1900, Steiner had become part of the radical anarchist scene in Berlin and within those circles atheism and naturalism were a common world view. Not long after this Steiner emerged, surprisingly, as a theosophist; as someone who lays a strong claim to higher knowledge, in the form of super-sensible perception that reaches far beyond anything claimed by Goethe or the German idealists. It is contested whether Steiner's turn to theosophy is a matter of continuity or rupture.21 Considering this issue in-depth is beyond the scope of this article. However, as Steiner turns to theosophy, the idea of a systematic development of higher knowledge through spiritual practice, such as specific meditation techniques, becomes part of his work. This was lacking in the work of Goethe and the German idealists. The theosophists drew heavily on Asian sources, and as Steiner interacted with theosophy many terms of Asian origin entered into his writings and lectures. This led to a merger of elements from Asian spirituali-ty and European philosophy in Steiner's work. Later, Steiner gradually moved away from using terms from the Asian traditions, opting for such formulations as 'spiritual force of perception' ('geistige Wahrnehmungskraft') instead of 'kundalini'.22 However, words such as 'karma' persist throughout Steiner's later work. In Steiner's view anthroposophy differs from theosophy in that it centers more around the human perspective.23 Anthroposophy also contains some ideas that are unique to Steiner, such as the three-fold understanding of the human being,24 which is important in the development of Steiner's conception of meditation and will be briefly outlined. In anthroposophy, the human being is characterized as having three basic mental abilities, thinking, feeling, and willing. The idea of 'transforming consciousness' through a systematic devel-opment of these capacities remains fundamental to Steiner's main book on 20 Rudolf Steiner, Methodische Verlag, 1983. SPARBY 8 meditative practice, How to Know Higher Worlds.25 In the so-called subsidiary practices, 'Neben\u00fcbungen',26 which are thought to both provide grounding for the meditative practitioner and develop the organs of higher perception, think-ing, feeling, and willing are developed so as to manifest the virtues of openness, positivity and equanimity. The starting point of anthroposophy is that there is a divine ground of exist-ence that can be known by the human being.27 This can be seen as a further influence of German idealism. Like the German idealists, Steiner rejects the Kantian limits to knowledge. Even though Goethe spoke of higher senses, something Steiner explicitly refers to,28 systematic meditation probably plays no role in Goethe's work. For Steiner, it is meditation and spiritual practice in general that makes the divine ground of existence, the spiritual world, perceptu-ally accessible. Here, to a certain extent, anthroposophy differs from traditions that seek knowledge of divinity primarily as part of a path to liberation from the cyclical existence inside the illusory world of samsara.29 Anthroposophy repre-sents a different concept of liberation, or of freedom, focusing on establishing a connection between divinity, the natural world and the human being.30 Spiritual knowledge is seen as prerequisite for realizing such a form of freedom. As part of the meditative development, the practitioners come to know their higher or true self. The knowledge of the true self becomes the foundation of realizing positive freedom, of expressing one's true identity. However, the knowledge gained from spiritual perception is also to be made use of in order to benefit already existing human practices (pedagogy, religious life, medicine, art, etc.). We will go further into all of these issues in the following sections. What can be underlined here is that anthroposophy is a response to the potential pitfalls of modern life, such as loss of connection and meaning, self-centeredness, lack of fullness, apathy, nihilism, depression, and so on. Still, these are not only viewed in a negative light. Rather, they are seen as part of a process that enables a greater realization of freedom. However, they can grow too strong and this is to be avoided. In this light, what anthroposophy seeks is a way of balancing and positively interrelating immanence and transcendence, nature and divinity, self and other, through spiritual practice and meditation. In other words, though the negative aspects of modernity are ultimately to be overcome, its achieve-ments, such as autonomy and science, are to be retained and built upon. 25 Clement, 'Einleitung', cv. 26 Rudolf Steiner, Seelen\u00fcbungen I (GA Verlag, 2007, 38. 28 Ibid., 39. 29 Paul Williams, Anthony Tribe, Alexander Wynne, New York: Routledge, 2012, of freedom'. RUDOLF STEINER'S CONCEPTION OF MEDITATION AND SPIRITUALITY 9 2. FREEDOM, SURRENDER, AND UNITY In the following, I suggest that three overarching topics - freedom, surrender, and unity - can be found in Steiner's work on meditation, and that these can serve as a basis for considering more specific topics. For instance, the topic of freedom relates to the topic of being or having a spiritual teacher, in that the freedom is of central concern in the relationship between teacher and student. Furthermore, as it will be shown, freedom, surrender, and unity relate to Stei-ner's doctrine of the higher states of consciousness, imagination, inspiration, and intuition. It may certainly be possible to find other ways of ordering the relationship between overarching and subordinate topics in Steiner's concep-tion of meditation; the way suggested here primarily has the function of giving an overview. 2.1 Freedom Freedom is perhaps the most central concept of Steiner's work. His main philo-sophical work is The Philosophy of Freedom, and he repeatedly comes back to the topic of freedom in his later theosophic and anthroposophic period.31 Freedom in anthroposophy is inherently connected to intellectual activity and the self. As the mythical world withdraws from human consciousness, the human being's sense of self increases and its intellectual capacities begin to unfold.32 The eso-teric doctrines and divine experiences that were imparted in the mystery cul-tures of Antiquity are relegated to being an undercurrent of European culture (for instance within Christian mysticism). This retreat is understood to be part of the process of individualization of the human being; in order to attain au-tonomy, the human being must become inwardly active, and this in turn means that it has to be cut off from its surroundings. In fact, Steiner sees the history of philosophy as being more about the development of the human personality than the establishment of truth.33 However, it is Steiner's view that during this period of history the knowledge and spiritual practices of the mystery traditions, which were available only to a select few, should become publically available.34 We could call this the principle 31 Ibidem. 32 Steiner, Wahrheiten und Irrt\u00fcmer der 66-67. 'And the initiate that publically should never interfere with anyone's free TERJE SPARBY 10 of disclosure of esoteric theory and practice. This is one of the most important principles in anthroposophic spirituality. What used to take place in esoteric circles should, in Steiner's view, now become part of the public sphere, and there are deep spiritual reasons for this, connected to spiritual beings that guide human evolution.35 However, it is clear that this is just a guideline; in Steiner's view there were still restrictions on what can made publically available.36 None-theless, his general view is that esoteric knowledge and practices should be increasingly made accessible so that people can respond more adequately to the demands of life37 and to satisfy a growing longing for such knowledge.38 In the end, divine law is just as natural as any other law.39 Still, caution is necessary, since esoteric knowledge and meditative practices can destabilize the minds of those who are not ready.40 Indeed, Steiner was very aware of certain dangers that are connected with meditative practice and for this reason he believed some instructions should never be made public in their true character. Though the full justification for this can only be understood by the initiate,41 he also states that some 'secrets' are not to be revealed until the student is ready.42 Pre-sumably, this is connected to the potential danger inherent in spiritual practice. In any case, we see that the principle of disclosure has exceptions, and there is still a separation between those who know (the initiates) and those who do not. In other words, the principle of disclosure of esoteric knowledge has its lim-its, though the tendency is that Steiner increasingly follows the principle of disclosure throughout his life. On a whole it cannot be said that Steiner's stance is inherently authoritarian; indeed, authoritarianism and dogmatism are explicit-ly rejected.43 Additionally, Steiner underlines that everyone has potential Rudolf Steiner, Wie erlangt man Rudolf Verlag, Rudolf Steiner, Stunden I 37 Rudolf Menschen 16), Dornach: Steiner 38 Aus den I, der Geistesforschung, GA 69a:160. RUDOLF STEINER'S CONCEPTION OF MEDITATION AND SPIRITUALITY 11 developing the capacity of higher knowledge,44 regardless of external life cir-cumstances.45 In the meditative traditions it has traditionally been vital to have a spiritual teacher. In Steiner's view, this has changed. Whereas the principle of disclosure increases in importance, the teacher becomes less and less important;46 a per-sonal teacher can in principle be dispensed with.47 However, it is better to have a teacher,48 if only to receive support until definite progress is made49 and to ensure advancement within a reasonable amount of time.50 Guidance can be crucial during certain stages of development, such as when developing the higher capacity of imagination (more on this below) in a way that makes it use-able for spiritual knowledge,51 but even here the teacher is not afforded any more authority than a teacher within any other area of life.52 The teacher needs to weigh the need to let everything be known to the student against the need for certain things to remain hidden temporarily, because of issues such as the danger of mental instability mentioned above.53 Again, the freedom of the indi-vidual must be respected,54 but freedom is neither diminished by taking advice from someone who is experienced,55 nor by the teacher proposing certain con-ditions for practice.56 In any case, what the teacher can offer is really nothing 44 Steiner, Die Stufen der h\u00f6heren Erkenntnisse der h\u00f6heren Welten?, GA 10:222-223. At least there is no relation of dependency involved; see Steiner, Die Stufen der h\u00f6heren Erkenntnis, GA 12:49. It is also possible to receive teachings through non-physical means (Steiner, Die Stufen der h\u00f6heren Erkenntnis, GA 12:48); and even spiritual beings (Steiner, Aus den Inhalten der esoterischen Stunden I, der esoterischen Stunden I, GA 266a:453. However, trust in the teacher is required, see Steiner, Die Stufen der h\u00f6heren Erkenntnis, der esoterischen Stunden I, GA 266a:535. A questionable practice would be that the teacher influ-ences the meditative development in a way that the student remains unaware of: see Steiner, Die Geheimwissenschaft im Umriss, TERJE SPARBY 12 more than advice;57 a teacher can show the way, but the student must do the walking.58 Not only is spiritual perception in principle available to everyone and the in-structions for developing it something Steiner believes should be publicly avail-able, anthroposophic practice can also be undertaken by people belonging to any domination and even atheists.59 Anthroposophy is not conceived of as a religion, but intends to relate to the particular religions as mathematics relates to different books on mathematics.60 There is a strong tendency for pluralism and tolerance, of both accepting that there are differing views as well as that the differences can be integrated within a larger whole.61 Hence the individualism that anthroposophy represents is not egotistical. Rather, it can be considered to be an extension of the ethical individualism that Steiner developed in his phi-losophy. This form of individualism affirms, with Nietzsche, personality and personal strength (which includes self-discipline and 'Bildung'), but differs from Nietzschean individualism in that it does not take any given drive or instinct as fully belonging to the individual if it has not been reflectively investigated.62 Hence one could call it a tempered or reflexive individualism. In anthroposophy, the self is considered a real being,63 and although the theme of selflessness is important, Steiner's conception of meditation begins with addressing the individual self. The self is most consciously experienced in thinking. A scientific attitude, or at least common sense, is presupposed. Noth-ing is to be taken on the grounds of belief alone,64 and any material that is pre-sented by a teacher or someone else can be taken as hypotheses,65 or simply as experiential reports; as something someone has observed, which does not mean 57 Ibidem. 58 Rudolf Steiner, Aus den Inhalten (GA Stunden Rudolf Steiner Verlag, 65 Steiner, GA 69a:52-53. RUDOLF STEINER'S CONCEPTION OF MEDITATION AND SPIRITUALITY 13 that it cannot be challenged by arguments or further observation.66 Higher knowledge is gained via inner or introspective experimentation that demands more diligence, conscientiousness, devotion and methodical thoroughness than other forms of science.67 Still, the results of anthroposophy should be in har-mony with both the spirit and results of conventional science, though not nec-essariliy with all interpretations of empirical data.68 The scientific attitude, with its focus on clear thinking, is the proper starting point because it is imperative that no external influences enter into the meditative mind. Earlier in history, altered states of consciousness were dream-like.69 Today all meditative work should start from a clear everyday consciousness,70 which continues into the state where supersensible experience takes place.71 Indeed, the meditator should know the intended effects of the practices undertaken.72 Using external means of forcing someone into an altered state would fail to recognize the autonomy of the individual. Furthermore, dream-like states are also unreliable as a source of knowledge;73 they make conceptualization difficult74 and they can also poten-tially be harmful.75 Abstract thinking has little content; it does not contain anything more than what the thinker makes available to it and is aware of. In other words, it is easy to establish and maintain full consciousness of what is contained in abstract thinking. It is comparatively difficult to remain conscious of all parts of a sense impression at once. For Steiner it is thinking that brought the human being out of its mythical consciousness. He also understands abstract thinking as working against spiritual perception76 and he believes that this form of thinking has lim-its when it comes to gaining a true understanding of the forces that are at work in the universe.77 Though thinking is essential for the autonomy of the human 66 Steiner, Theosophie, GA9:173; Rudolf 67 Steiner, Welten (GA 79), GA 18:32. TERJE SPARBY 14 being, it lacks a connection to reality. As Steiner says: 'Inner life would become desolate, if it was only intelligence that was called upon to light up the inner life of the human being'.78 A central point in Steiner's conception of meditation is that thinking can be transformed without losing the strengths of analysis, de-duction, wakefulness, and clarity that is characteristic of it. An important stage of the process of transforming thought is the practice of pure or mathematical thinking. Such thinking stands between sense-bound thinking (thinking that gains its content or representations from the physical senses) and higher knowledge. The truth of pure thinking is independent of the physical world.79 But such thinking does not by itself bring supersensible reality with it.80 Only as we intuit or become aware of the experience of the self, the thinker, are we beginning to enter into a higher reality.81 This is an important instance where anthroposophy draws on German idealism, in particular Fichte, who proposed that the intellectual intuition of the I presents an instance where thinking and the will, or real existence, are one, and hence a kind of divine knowing.82 However, the capacity of thinking is to be further developed and trans-formed in anthroposophy through systematic meditative practice.83 This trans-formation is predicated upon a thorough strengthening of willpower.84 Medita-tion in anthroposophy is far from being a comfortable procedure; it is arduous and lengthy, though healthy and ethical.85 The meditator must become inwardly active and acquire a very high degree of concentration. The first state of con-sciousness that is reached through concentration practice is that of 'imagina-tion', a term Steiner uses in a technical sense. We can only consider a few of its characteristics here. Fundamental to the imaginative state is that the meditator is, in a certain sense, sleeping, whilst at the same time being more awake than in everyday consciousness.86 Something that is supposed to happen in imaginative consciousness is that the meditator is confronted with their true self, the being that has shaped the physical body and which exists beyond the single human life of the meditator.87 The form of knowledge in this state is saturated with 78 Steiner, Wahrheiten und Irrt\u00fcmer der Geistesforschung, GA 69a:83-84. RUDOLF STEINER'S CONCEPTION OF MEDITATION AND SPIRITUALITY 15 reality;88 it is an experience of the 'fullness' of the individual, but it is also the source of many dangerous illusions, such as grandeur.89 At all times, the medita-tor must retain control of their consciousness while in this state. This means, for instance, that the images that appear do not force consciousness in any way90 and the meditator must be able to enter91 and exit the state at any point.92 The imaginative consciousness stands between fantasy and dream. Fantasies are contingent, without reality, while (non-lucid) dreams pull the dreamer into their own reality. In fantasy there is too much autonomy; in dreams, there is too little. In the imaginative consciousness autonomy is preserved and a new level of reality is attained, one that is, in a sense, a creation of the meditator, but still potentially reveals deeper aspects of the meditating self. At a later point of de-velopment, the imaginative consciousness becomes a source of concrete spir-itual knowledge of that which lies beyond the subject. A condition for entering into the state of imaginative consciousness is that thinking in the normal sense comes to complete rest, that external impressions cease, and that body becomes paralyzed.93 In this sense the state externally re-sembles sleep. Although thoughts have come to a rest, the capacity of wakeful knowing is still active, which makes this state similar, if not the same as the states known in the Asian traditions as dhyana, jhana or samadhi. In this state, the mind is to a certain extent freed from its dependence on the body, but since the state also depends on regular thought having yielded, it is also a form of surren-der. This brings us to the next theme. 2.2 Surrender It might not be immediately obvious, but perception depends on (at least a partial) surrender, or 'Hingabe', as Steiner refers to it in German (which could also be translated as 'devotion'). If the perceiver does not become receptive, what appears would be a form of hallucination; the subject 'perceives' itself rather than something beyond it. A main aspect of developing the dormant capacities for higher perception is being able to let go of oneself and practice devotion and selflessness.94 Steiner connects these capacities with a rather elab- 88 Wahrheiten und Irrt\u00fcmer der SPARBY 16 orate doctrine of the subtle bodies of the human being, involving ideas such as the chakras,95 'wheels', or organs that are active and move as they perceive.96 The chakras become organs of perception through specific meditations where the practitioners dwell in certain ideas and sensations, as described in Steiner's main book on meditation, the aforementioned How to Know Higher Worlds. Additional-ly, the imaginative consciousness interacts with the so-called inspirational con-sciousness. While imagination corresponds to the dream state, inspiration is like the state of dreamless sleep.97 In order to reach this state, the meditator has to remove the entire content present in the imaginative state.98 Consciousness has to become completely empty. The inspirative consciousness brings perceptions of an objective spiritual re-ality.99 The practitioner learns to surrender their own self and become open to external influence. This is, to a certain extent, a reversal of the initial emphasis of freedom. Indeed, as inspirations happen, the self of the perceiver is tempo-rarily dampened so that new content can make its way into consciousness.100 These perceptions are said to happen 'lightning fast' and they are difficult to remember and reproduce.101 It is a form of transcendence, of entering the di-vine, timeless realm. By giving oneself up, one expands, and transforms, tempo-rarily, into something else.102 There is a tension here between freedom and surrender that is also character-istic of Steiner's work in general. Initially, the focus is on freedom and strength-ening the personality, and then there is an apparent full turn, where the empha-sis is on dissolving the personality. This tension is, I believe, representative of a fundamental dynamic that is part of Steiner's conception of meditation and spirituality in general. The focus on the self has the significance of becoming strong or independent enough to encounter the spiritual world. For someone who is not properly prepared it might very well be possible to enter into the spiritual world - and, according to Steiner, we do so every night, unconsciously, when we fall asleep103 - but we would not be able to perceive anything, since we 95 Steiner, Wie erlangt man Erkenntnisse der h\u00f6heren Welten?, GA 10 96 Rudolf Steiner, Vor dem Tore der Theosophie (GA 95), Dornach: Rudolf Verlag, 1990, Erhard soul: Steiner, Gerhard Wehr, Great Barrington, MA: Anthroposophic Press, 2002; Evan Thompson, Waking, dreaming, being, New York: Columbia University Press, 2015, 262-320. 98 Steiner, GA 17:50. RUDOLF STEINER'S CONCEPTION OF MEDITATION AND SPIRITUALITY 17 would simply be one with the environment. Again, there is also the danger of mental instability. Remembering one's physical existence, i.e. one's normal iden-tity, when one enters into the spiritual world is not only something that is chal-lenging, but it also helps maintain independence in relation to one's surround-ings within that realm.104 This is why Steiner says that egotism is justified in the spiritual world, while in the physical world, it puts the human being in shackles.105 This relates to the topic of asceticism, which is also found in many other spiritual traditions. Though Steiner indeed mentions asceticism occasionally, he does not have much to say about it. He stresses that there is a difference between opening up to the world through pleasure and indulging in pleasure; the latter leads to an encapsulation of consciousness and the dulling of the capacities for higher knowledge.106 What is important is not so much to restrict one's relation to physical pleasure, but rather to use it as a means of further revelation by re-stricting further indulgence. Furthermore, at a certain point in the meditative development the physical urges will cease, though this should not be forced; continence will become something one freely tends toward without having to curb desires or chastise oneself.107 The ideal is that one should come to the spiritual world through earthly life and not through asceticism,108 by contem-plating the magnificence of the sensory world rather than disregarding it.109 The general tendency is temperance,110 but in his esoteric school, which lasted until the outbreak of the first world war, Steiner prescribes that students drink no alcohol, and vegetarianism is advised.111 Still, all forms of renunciation that are unhealthy or lead to a distracted mind are definitely rejected.112 In fact, Steiner is well aware of the problem of subtle egotism that can sneak into spiritual prac-tice. Insofar as asceticism can become a means for seeking spiritual pleasure, it is useless.113 To a certain extent he sees an increase in egotism as unavoidable for those who do spiritual practice,114 but it is still something that needs to be rooted out. 104 Steiner, Die Schwelle GA 266b:145, 297. TERJE SPARBY 18 Indeed, an essential part of the meditative life is to become more and more aware of one's unconscious desires and egotism. A condition for spiritual per-ception is that egotism be conquered.115 Initiation into the spiritual world in-volves a meeting with the so-called guardian of the threshold,116 which brings into view all the hidden and unwelcome sides of oneself.117 Steiner also de-scribes this as experiencing oneself as complete mistake.118 One has separated oneself from the whole, a whole on which one really is dependent; living through the confrontation with all the consequences that this implies, all that one's egotism has lead to in one's life and the life of others, can be both very destabilizing and liberating. For Steiner, proper spiritual training cannot happen without such a confrontation. Through it the practitioner learns to remove all that belongs to one's own subjective nature, so that the spiritual world can be revealed objectively.119 Steiner claims that there are indeed cases of natural initiation, where some-one achieves the ability of supersensible perception without having undergone meditative training.120 However, it is more common that one must take respon-sibility for one's own spiritual development at a certain point in order for su-persensible perception to become available.121 Meditative training is a way of shortening a development that to a certain extent would happen naturally.122 Additionally, meditative training avoids the development going off course.123 Thus Steiner's conception of meditation, together with all systems of spiritual development, can be charged with representing a form of self-initiation, or self-liberation, where the human being makes itself into God. As Steiner states: 'The god that lets us act in a good and noble way is our archetype. Our archetype has made us into what are now. And we must again become an image of our arche-type'.124 Steiner underlines that development happens through surrender, and that there are indeed higher spiritual beings, such as Christ, which the human being is fully dependent on. As the German mystic Angelus Silesius (1624- 115 dem 95:119-120. Steiner, Weg Stunden esoterischen Stunden II, GA 266b:97-98. RUDOLF STEINER'S CONCEPTION OF MEDITATION AND SPIRITUALITY 19 1677) states, and Steiner often quotes,125 'If Christ is born a thousand times in Bethlehem but not in you; you will remain lost forever'.126 One can, however, prepare oneself for such events, and that is done through meditation. Whether a response comes 'is a matter of the spiritual world; it has to approach us'.127 The commitment to the active perfection of oneself, to do more for knowledge, moral and spiritual development, is what religious devotion consists of in anthroposophy.128 And such devotion must be seen as part of the paradox of self-surrender; on the one side, one becomes humble, and, on the other side, one ascends to the spirit - because one surrenders. Surrendering and suffering are deeply intertwined in the spiritual traditions of the world; they meet in the notion of purification that is common to these traditions. Steiner sees in suffering a potential for development; it is not neces-sarily something that should be avoided or something that one should ultimate-ly seek to be liberated from.129 Just as one can learn from pleasure, one can also learn from pain,130 and through pain one is strengthened.131 This sentiment makes Steiner's conception of meditation different from classical Asian doc-trines, like the traditional Buddhist one, which ultimately seeks liberation from suffering. A high point of the initiation process as it is understood in anthro-posophy is being offered the possibility of final liberation, of separating oneself completely from earthly development and experiencing eternal bliss.132 One can choose, however, to abstain from this and continue to take part in the evolution of the earth. This is implicitly the path of Steiner's conception of meditation and spiritualty in general. It can be noted that this bears a strong likeness to the ideas representative of Mahayana Buddhism,133 where the practitioner takes a vow to not reach nirvana, the final liberation through cessation of the ego, before all beings have been liberated.134 In any case, the notion that spiritual life 125 Rudolf Steiner, Spirituelle Seelenlehre und ed. Christian Clement, Stuttgart: Frommann-Holzboog, 2015., 330. 134 Possibly there is a link between anthroposophy and Mahayana Buddhism through Blavatsky's 'The Voice of Silence'. TERJE SPARBY 20 is realized in connection with earthly life, and not in separation from it, brings us to the final topic of unification. 2.3 Unification In the final chapter of The Riddles of Philosophy Steiner describes the transition from philosophy to anthroposophy, from everyday consciousness to supersen-sible consciousness, as happening through an 'unlimited intensification' of the capacity of concentration and loving devotion (surrender).135 These capacities become unified as the process of development continues. Love is the experi-ence of the other in one's own soul, while devotion is the experience of oneself in the other.136 In loving devotion then, one's own soul is no longer distinct from the other. Spiritual perception, which takes place within a world where everything is a being137, is dependent upon love, since love allows for the per-ceiver and the perceived to connect and unify. In the inspirative state, this happens through a dynamic where the self of the perceiver retreats for a short moment, making room for the other being to enter. However, for Steiner there is an even higher state that is possible, where two beings are unified to such a degree that the perceiving self becomes one with the essence of that which is perceived. This is the highest level of knowledge, the state of intuition. In contrast to what is commonly understood as 'intuition', i.e. something unclear and indefinite, the knowledge achieved in this state is 'full of the most illuminated clarity and indubitable certainty';138 the knower becomes one with the forces of creation that underlie material exist-ence.139 The practices that precede entering into this state relate to the will. For example, one does certain practices in reverse140 or one attempts to change one's habits; the more effort it takes, the more effective the practice will be.141 Hence, as Steiner conceives them, imagination, inspiration, and intuition relate to the three capacities of the soul, thinking, feeling, and willing, respectively. As imagination and inspiration correspond to the dream state and the state of dreamless sleep, the intuitive state goes even deeper. As such, these three states can be traced back to the classical Indian doctrine of the states of conscious- 135 Steiner, Die R\u00e4tsel der 20-21. RUDOLF STEINER'S CONCEPTION OF MEDITATION AND SPIRITUALITY 21 ness referred to in the Mandukya Upanishad.142 For Steiner, however, the three higher states of consciousness are transformations of three lower states of con-sciousness.143 The intuitive consciousness is, for example, a transformation of an omnipresent but trance-like state. What distinguishes the higher and lower states is the level of wakefulness that they involve. The expansion of consciousness that takes place in meditation does not only go upward towards divinity; it can also proceed downwards in a contracting gesture.144 Expansion is connected with leaving the body, and also with fear and bliss, while the contraction leads to a perception of one's moral shortcomings and errors, which elicits a sense of shame.145 'Higher states of consciousness' can therefore in a sense be properly said to be about going into the depths of the human being; though 'high' and 'deep' may be interchangeable metaphors, they may also be at times misleading when it comes to actual experience.146 The ultimate aim of practice is unification with the spiritual world,147 but al-so, which is equally important, service within the material and human world.148 Indeed, spiritual practice in general consists of maintaining a connection be-tween immanence and transcendence: Spirit can be known in the material world. (...) Anthroposophy therefore does not want to be something that leads humans away from the normal world in an ascetic way. Rather, anthroposophy wants to open the roads to spirit, to the su-persensible worlds, so that the human being can shape material and practical life again in accordance with spirit.149 This view also informs anthroposophic meditative practice. An important ele-ment of it is that natural objects and phenomena, such as seeds, plants, and animal sounds are used as the starting point of meditation, in particular in How to Know Higher Worlds. Such practices are said to lead to the development, for instance, of the ability to perceive the forces of growth and decay that rule in nature.150 In one place, Steiner states that what is unique to anthroposophy is that it takes sense perception as the model of supersensible perception; both are characterized by an intensity, vibrancy, vitality, wakefulness, objectivity, and 142 Patrick Olivelle, The early Upanisads, New York: Oxford University Press, 1998, 475. 143 Rudolf Steiner, Kosmogonie (GA 94), Dornach: Rudolf Steiner III, GA 266c:89. 145 Ibid., 89-95. 146 Her it can also be noted that Steiner states that in the end there is nothing that is 'low' or 'base' ('niedrig'): Steiner, Aus dat und Auferstandung (GA 211), Dornach: Rudolf Steiner 2006, SPARBY 22 so on.151 Additionally, the spiritual world is understood as being highly differen-tiated. In order to experience it as such, the capacity of imagination is vital. Without it, the spiritual world is dark, undifferentiated and shadowy.152 Due to this approach to the spiritual world, specific knowledge is gained that can be applied to practice. The main idea is that there are spiritual forces that rule over certain areas and inhabitants of the physical realm, such as the human being, in quite specific ways. Coming to know these forces lays the foundation of a spir-itual understanding of the human being, a spiritual anthropology, which then forms the basis of anthroposophic practices, such as medicine, pedagogy, psy-chology, and social theory. Furthermore, a spiritual cosmology, which is also based on meditatively acquired knowledge, becomes the foundation of anthro-posophic or Biodynamic agriculture, but is also related to anthroposophic med-icine, pedagogy, etc., to the extent that these involve aspects of reality beyond the human being - and understading the relationship between the human being and the cosmos are indeed one of the central tasks of anthroposophy. Finally, spiritual insight becomes the starting point for aesthetic renewal, exemplified by anthroposophic architecture and Eurythmy. There is an overarching notion that spiritual practice must be relevant for normal, human life, and monasticism is therefore rejected.153 Indeed, one of the first results of meditative practice happens within one's everyday life.154 There needs to be a harmony between one's meditative and normal existence. Slowly, the capacity to move between higher states and everyday consciousness like a pendulum is acquired.155 The practitioner becomes an inhabitant of two worlds.156 The human being has the mission157 of mediating between heavenly and earthly existence, between divinity and nature. This does not necessarily mean that the human being has its purpose outside of itself. Rather, the human being is very much a part of divinity, it carries divinity within itself; but divinity is also outside of it - human life is also one of separateness, which could also be regarded as a separateness from oneself. The human being has forgotten its origin. However, through meditative practice the buffered self can find the way to remembrance. What is experienced on the other side is not some indistinct unification with the source, but a plethora of spiritual beings and realms that constitute the hidden ground of human life and nature. Through correct prepa- 151 Rudolf Steiner, Die gesunde Entwickelung des Menschenwesens GA 69a:98. RUDOLF STEINER'S CONCEPTION OF MEDITATION AND SPIRITUALITY 23 ration and communion with this ground, it is possible to bring deep spiritual experience back into the human world and clothe it in concepts that everyone can understand, though such concepts are not always very accurate.158 In the distant future, the transformed human being is said to ascend and be-come one of the spiritual hierarchies, standing next to the realm of the Angels, Powers, etc., as a being that unifies freedom and love.159 The human being is thought to bring freedom into the cosmic order, but this is also a rupture of this order. There is the potential of the buffered self to become increasingly encapsulated and not wanting to have anything to do with the outside world, rejecting all forms of fullness beyond itself. There is a way, however, to unify the self with the world beyond it; in love, the self can equally experience the other within itself as become one with it. The force of love, which comes in addition to freedom, is one that can be accepted or rejected; if accepted, this does not imply that the freedom of the individual has to be given up. Rather, freedom and love can be unified; existence within a cosmic order ultimately does not negate individual freedom, even though at a certain stage of develop-ment a tension arises between them. 3. CONCLUSION Steiner's conception of meditation and spirituality can be understood by relat-ing the concepts of the human being, divinity and nature to freedom, surrender, and unification. As has become evident, love plays a key role in connecting them; love is a merger of freedom and surrender and unifies divinity and nature through the human being. Loving devotion brings out the connection of the spiritual in the human being with the divine, and the knowledge that results is thought to bring inspiration, health, and well-being, as well as social, scientific, and religious renewal. First the mind of the human being is unified in a way that leads to deeper self-knowledge; this is brought about through the practice of concentration meditation. Then the link to divinity in the outside world, includ-ing nature, is established through a deepening of the meditative procedure and accompanying development of new organs of perception. This enables a unifi-cation with the external world. The buffered self becomes porous again, but retains its intellect and individualized existence, so as to create a bridge between 158 Steiner, Wie erlangt man Erkenntnisse Verlag, 1991, 173. TERJE SPARBY 24 the spiritual and physical world. This is the basic gesture of Steiner's conception of meditation and spirituality. The combination of elements that seem to come from a pre-modern form of religiosity, such as a belief in spiritual beings, on the one hand, with individual-ism, science, and strands of atheism, on the other, may make anthroposophy seem like a strange child of certain parts of European culture around the turn of the 20th century. Even stranger, perhaps, is the lasting social impact of an-throposophy, in particular through the worldwide presence of the Steiner (Wal-dorf) schools. Little is known about the relation between anthroposophic spir-itual practice and the social institutions that grew out of the anthroposophic movement. Future research could address these and related issues. Further-more, very little is known about the particular effects of the form of meditation Steiner conceived, whether the path of development that Steiner laid out can be followed by others as well or not. When it comes to the investigation of Steiner's work, it is obvious that much more detailed studies on the areas covered here are necessary. These areas in-clude, among others, the genesis of Steiner's conception of meditation: What are the implicit shifts in emphasis throughout Steiner's life and what might be the reason behind them? Why, for instance, are the practices that use natural objects in How to Know Higher Worlds not part of Steiner's later esoteric school? Can these practices be traced back to European or Asian sources? Are they perhaps what is unique to Steiner's work? Additionally, Steiner's conception of meditation cannot be fully understood without situating it within his anthro-pology and cosmology; though some steps have been taken in this direction here, there are many more that need to be taken. Indeed, an extensive study of the whole of anthroposophy is necessary in order to make sense of the form of meditation it represents. A further issue is the relationship of anthroposophy to other traditions. Contemplative practice plays an essential role in most of the other spiritual traditions, and ascertaining the differences and similarities be-tween these traditions and anthroposophy is also an important area of study. Much care needs to be taken so that such study is sufficiently nuanced. And as it matures, this will possibly raise challenges to the initial overview presented here, which then has to be revisited.
