I e been having done IT band issues and when for a lower body massage. 60 minutes of cupping, massage and stretching provided a great start on the road to recovery. Will be back for a follow up soon!Thank you for this great review! IT bands are tight in most people and cupping is a great treatment for the area. We created the Lower Body Overhaul specifically for this kind of bodywork. I'm glad we were able to get you some on the road to recovery. Maggie is also a great educator and I'm sure she will have suggestions for services or home care that will continue you along this path of wellness.

Massage therapist was excellent! Very professional and did a fantastic job! Relaxing and clean facilities. And I didn't feel rushed to leave.... could relax in the reception area and drink plenty of cool water. Highly recommend.Renee, Thank you for this wonderful review! We have a fabulous team of providers that really want you to have an amazing experience at Elixir. We also love Denver and are always happy to share our favorites with out-of-town guests! Glad to hear you were drinking your water - it's something we suggest to everyone visiting because, between the altitude and the arid climate, you can get dehydrated and feel sick fast. We hope you'll return to see us again on your next visit to Colorado.

I've had quite a few massages over the years. And this had to be the BEST one yet! We were in town visiting and the spa did a great job following covid guidelines. Felt very comfortable and very relaxing!Thank you for this review! I agree Nathan is a skilled massage therapist! I'm happy to read we were able to make sure your visit felt safe and comfortable for you, especially right now. We have gone beyond recommended sanitation and safety procedures to protect our guests, team, and community. We hope to see you again at Elixir on your next visit to Denver!

Coming from two massage snobs, the entire experience was top of the line! From start to finish we were impressed. The ladies even helped us pick out a good massage oil for my husband's sore neck and it has really helped! Thanks for a great experience Elixer, we will be back!Visited December 2017Traveled as a coupleWritten December 18, 2017 - Simply the best.Believe me when I say I have paid more for lesser massages at spas around the world. They don't hold a candle to the consistency at Elixir. In my 8 years of getting Elixir massages, I have never had a disappointing experience, seriously no joke. All the therapists are great. Granted I like some more than others but have never walked out feeling like I got less than a great massage. Sandy has therapists that can handle ALL ranges of needs. Post hysterectomy massage? No problem, it's same protocol as pregnancy. Rollover car accident? No problem, they worked on my areas of concern and helped me coordinate care with my chiropractor & physical therapist and receipts for my insurance company. Last minute can't move my neck, they will fit you in. Have your mother/mother in law in town and they are stiff from travel, they will fit you in. The sheets, OMG the sheets. They are like butter! You instantly are sucked into them and sleep like a baby. I own at least 6 sets. People rave how comfortable our guest bed is. Hubby gets cranky sleeping on anything else. Yes they are a bit pricey but do the math; Comphy warranties them for 300 washes. You change your sheets once a week, that 5-3/4 years that a set will be used under warranty. $150 breaks down to 50 cents a week, 7 cents a night. They come out of the dryer wrinkle free, they fit over-sized mattresses perfectly and in great colors. How many so-so $35-$75 sheet sets have you donated to Goodwill or used as a paint dropcloth after they pilled and/or got sick of ironing them, or had them shrink and not cover your mattress or have the whimpy elastic give out and no longer stay tight on the mattress??? Do yourself a favor, invest in the Comphy sheets and you will be so happy. Member monthly specials are great. Discounts on additional services, new products, try it then buy it. Elixir events are a great opportunity to try other services and invite your friends so they can experience the Elixir difference. 10-8 daily is so convenient to fix a massage in your life monthly and be healthier for that hour you give yourself. Seriously for the cost of fueling your week of Starbucks addition, you will feel great after your Elixir experience. Just do it, it will be a decision you will not regret unlike that $200 ombre color job your friend said would look so great on you.Sandra, We appreciate you so much, and love that you allow us to continue caring for you! Our team here is great, and we will always accommodate your needs the best we can! Thank you for the awesome review and we look forward to seeing you soon!

I chose \"Serenity\" (or it chose me) ;) - Professional massage that is caring and attentive - The ability to choose the style of music/sounds! I chose \"Nature\" and \"New Age\" It was so relaxing I could barely make the 2 block walk back to my hotel. Kudos and many thanks to the staff at Elixir for giving me a little, peace, comfort and joy! :)Jenny, Sometimes the little details like personal attention, soft linens and organic Aromatherapy can make the difference between a good and a great massage experience. At Elixir Massage we strive daily to do those things that set us apart. We look forward to seeing you again on your next trip back to Denver! Take careWritten June 23, 2015This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.Visited July 2014Traveled soloWritten June 17, 2015 - Super disappointing $100 facialBooked the mineral magic facial and the add-on fit face lift and left thinking.... is that IT?? The description on their website reads as follows, and I had to look at it a couple of times after the facial to make sure I had not received the wrong treatment by mistake... \"Facial massage is adapted to the smaller muscles and thinner skin of the face with techniques that will plump, firm and stimulate circulation. Lymphatic drainage also reduces puffiness caused by excess fluids and specific targeted massage alleviates facial tension that not only improves aesthetics but also mitigates headaches. Elixir's Mineral skincare line, including the fabulous exfoliating mud mask, is naturally infused with over 80 trace minerals and elements to balance the skin and perfect radiant health.\" Basically it was someone cleaning off my face, putting a charcoal mask on and doing a very light head massage to eat up some time. When she cleaned the charcoal off my face she tried to explained that it was the exfoliation part of the facial. No targeted facial massage, definitely no lymphatic drainage. And I have never had a facial where they didn't put a headband on my face to keep my hair back away from the product - very odd! The rest of the time was spent doing the fit face lift with the \"microcurrent technology\". After they do one half of your face they give you a mirror to see how different it is from the untreated half. I could literally see no difference whatsoever and didn't see any difference in the mirror at home. And after she cleaned the gel from that off my face we were done. What... is that IT?? When the front desk asked me how it was I commented that it seemed very simple and no frills. That's when they told me they only had one aesthetician in the spa that day and sometimes the massage therapists fill in with the facials. So THAT's why it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing!! Totally not worth the $100 and can't say I will be back. If you book something just make sure you are getting the aesthetician and not someone \"just filling in\". Also, if you are looking for a true spa experience, be aware that between services you wait in the street-facing lobby, and sit in full view of the giant window, there are no robes and slippers to wear before/between, no relaxing quiet waiting room or shower/locker room. And you are offered water only, there are no snacks available of any kind, not even a cheap granola bar or cracker! Take your $$ elsewhere and pay a little extra for a full spa experience. This place is in not a \"retreat\" and you will not feel \"pampered\" as their website claims. Sorry!Visited July 2019Traveled soloWritten July 14, 2019 - Oh my goodness...The Elixir crew is absolutely amazing! I was suffering from the never ending migraine and was able to sneak in to see Miranda for an acupuncture treatment. From the second I walked in, both the atmosphere and staff were very welcoming and attentive. They took excellent care of me and I am ever appreciative! I will always return to Elixir in the future!I am so glad to know that you got some relief from your migraine. I know how disruptive they can be. Miranda is an excellent acupuncturist and we are proud to have her on the team. Please don't hesitate to let us know if we can be of help in the future.

From the ease of making the appointment to the friendly environment to the massage itself; it was an outstanding experience that most businesses can only hope to deliver. Was welcomed by Sandy with the offer of a hot neck wrap and water. While waiting for my appointment time, I also had an engaging conversation with her about Denver and it's wonderful restaurants. She is a great ambassador for the Mile High City. Hillary was my massage therapist and provided a wonderful deep tissue massage that was one of the best I've ever received that took the knots out and was relaxing as well. Bottom line is Elixir delivers!Doug, Thank you for taking the time to write this lovely review. It was great talking with you, I love sharing what makes Denver such a great city with visitors.

Guest feedback is essential to being able to provide the kind of service that is appreciated and enjoyed and also to be able to learn and grow when we missed the mark. The hot stone enhancement you received was from one of our more recent hires and we will be sure to take this service off her menu for now until we have time to review her training on both hot stones and consultations so that this doesn't happen again. I am very pleased to read that you had a great Signature Facial with Alyson and that you would return to Elixir again.

Jul 2018 Solo I'm not from Denver, but Elixir is one of my must-stops whenever I'm in town. Far and away my favorite spa. I usually stop by for a much-needed vacation massage, but tried out their facials this time. I LOVE Alyson!0 She listened to my current issues and skin care routine. Then I had the most relaxing and cleansing facial. The products used were amazing and did not irritate my skin. She also treated my neck and upper chest area and gave a great shoulder massage. After the facial, my skin was soft and glowing for the next week! She was able to identify my problem areas right away and offer great suggestions and products to update my daily skin care routine. I can't wait to go back! After the facial, my skin was soft and glowing for the next week!

Michelle, Thank you so much for taking the time to write this review. It is always a pleasure to see you when you are in Denver and I'm so glad you had a chance to receive a facial this time in, especially since it made you feel and look so good! We specifically chose to use ARCONA skincare line because they use organic ingredients with science based performance oriented formulations that work for all skin types. And of course they feel and smell amazing, too. Since you aren't local, if you ever need to stock up on any of the products you can always order them from our online Boutique at elixirinlodo.com.

Aug 2017 Solo We flew into Denver and I had the worse shoulder ache making me feel sick and miserable. After our hotel concierge couldn't find me a massage, I went to trip advisor and found Elixir. They had one appointment left. I was told the Chris is the best for shoulders. He was wonderful. He asked about pressure and told me from the beginning if it was too much to let him know. He really worked out my knots and even showed me a few things to hopefully help me not get into the same fix. Now, this message wasn't meant for pure relaxation and I'm thankful he talked during the entire thing. It helped me be distracted from the pain. I'm not sure if you went in for a relaxing message if it would be different. I would definitely schedule with him again given the opportunity.

To receive a great massage then enjoy your own private steam without ever having to move off the table is soooo soothing. The steam is great for your skin, too, especially in our dry climate.

Jun 2015 Solo My wife booked me a massage in celebration of our aniversary. Usually I'm not the biggest fan on spending money in spas but wow, I need to say I'm wrong. We should all spend money and time in these therapies and Elixir has been the best I have ever experinced. I have traveled all over the world, gotten masses and treatments alone and with my wife and we both agree this place has been the best. This was also the first time I got a massage from a male therapist and it was amazing. You guys are doing a great job and I recomend it fully.
