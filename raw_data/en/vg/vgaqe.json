In the contemporary world, with Divine Grace and Blessings, there are various tools and techniques available for Spiritual & Divine Energy healing... How effective are these or Have you ever experienced any adverse effect or negligible effect or simply no effect from Spiritual Healing?! If the answer is 'YES', Reasons are many... sharing few as below Firstly, to know this... it requires a vast practical study and understanding of the ENERGY WORLD... Most of us already know everything is energy and to lead a healthy life, sufficient and healthy energy is a must in our energy system (Chakras, Subtle Bodies & SOUL). There are various Energy layers and various types of Energies in the Energy World. These Energies are invoked by ENERGY HEALERS from different layers of the Earth, the Universe and rarely from beyond Universe as well, for the well-being of Humanity at various levels... Invocation of the Energy exclusively and most importantly depends on the eligibility and power of the HEALER himself or herself followed by the tools and techniques learnt. Healers' eligibility depends mainly on the number of years of their Past Life Spiritual Sadhana along with SOUL PURITY & QUALITY. And of course supported by their genuine Intent of helping others and various tools and techniques learnt. In fact all human beings do have HEALING POWERS, not only human beings but few plants/trees, animals & birds also radiate healing vibes. Human beings can easily learn and apply basic healing modalities on SELF & others but when it comes to ADVANCED HEALING, Past Life Spiritual Sadhana, regular practices, regular purification at various levels, tools and techniques knowledge along with SOUL ELIGIBILITY is a MUST. Not everyone can be ADVANCED HEALERS without meeting the above criteria. Please note, anything which is commonly and easily available to the public cannot be advanced Healing. In fact Advanced Healing cannot be learnt at all... It is an ATTAINMENT purely based on SOUL Eligibility & Spiritual Sadhana. It is nowhere connected to tools & techniques... Now coming to the RECEPTION criteria and Healee 'HEALING RECEPTIVITY' and intent of the Healing Receiver (client or patient) is massively critical. It depends on their SOUL Planning, Past life Karma baggage, curses carrying from previous births, time factor, openness, SOUL readiness and various levels of Energy blockages... to name a few... Based on the above factors results or outcomes can be expected from a HEALING PROCESS... HEALING is a two way process... between the Healer and the Receiver. Healing can never be pushed or forced into a person against his or her WILL. It will NOT work in such cases. At times, it is observed that due to greediness and lack of GRATITUDE, Healing receivers lose whatever Divine Healings would have been coming or supposed to come on their way. In some cases, receivers are NOT HUMBLE enough to extend their \"THANKFUL\" attitude for whatever little improvements they have experienced in their lives even after knowing their KARMIC balance is high, carried down from the past births. At the end, unfortunately they lose or miss the entire Divine blessing opportunity due to lack of inner purification. So, HUMBLENESS combined with GRATEFULNESS is a MUST requirement on the person who would be receiving the Healing Energies. Also, at times, it is being observed that people as per SOUL planning want to pay off their karmic baggage which they are carrying from any of the previous births, in terms of sufferings- be it at physical, financial, relationship or be it any other level. In such cases, extra force of Spiritual Healing would not help at all. Rather, Healing Energy should be diverted in such a way that the person completes his or her PAY-OFF at a lesser time than actually was planned. For example, if the SOUL has planned to suffer for 2 years, Divine Energy would never go against the law of KARMA and abolish or remove it completely. Rather it might reduce it to 6 months with increased intensity of suffering, so that the person experiences a brighter vibrant life much before his planned time. Again, this activity depends on the HEALER's eligibility and Receiver's acceptability criteria. Remember, Healing is NOT always for MIRACLES & POSITIVE MANIFESTATIONS but many times it also nullifies or neutralizes negative or unwanted future events. Still remains many other factors, which can be discussed later... Now something of Utmost importance worth sharing.... At this peak juncture of the Dark Age or Kali Yuga, dark & lower energy flow is intense & abundant all around. Unless one is purified & sensitive enough, one cannot differentiate between Divine & Dark Energies flow... Channels & all Spiritual practitioners may have to be careful here to know what is getting connected and downloaded to them... Dark (Black) Energies may give instant miracles & many material manifestations magically but ultimately lead towards Self Destruction. On Earthly terms some name it as Black Magic also. To sense this, Inner Purification is inevitable. Divine Energies may not give instant miracles but they lead towards steady, healthy overall growth & ultimately SOUL liberation.... Choice is on the RECEIVERS... whether they want instant miracles leading to darkness or steady & healthy SOUL growth with inner purification leading to peace and contentment. Divine and Spiritual Energy Healing work wonders if the proper balance is there between the Healer and the Receiver. It requires TIME, PATIENCE and HUMBLENESS, SELFLESS attitude, less expectations and immense GRATITUDE, RESPECT & FAITH towards the Divine Energies. If something bigger and higher needs to be achieved equal efforts should be poured in... Last but NOT the least... NOBODY is so rich on Earth to purchase the DIVINE ENERGIES. Never go to any healers with that attitude. It would be a waste of time, money and energy. What you pay is only for the healers' TIME, GENUINE EFFORT & PURE INTENT and NOT for the OUTCOME. HEALERS, HEALING and ENERGY WORLD are very interesting and vast topics which can be discussed later... With Divine Light "}
