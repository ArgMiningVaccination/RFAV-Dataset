The theory has been wildly successful in this respect, giving rise to the standard model of particle physics, as well as quantum cosmologies of the early universe. The applications of quantum field theory are not, however, restricted to high-energy physics. The theory is just as spectacular in the infrared as it is in the ultraviolet, and it serves as a mathematical nexus for physical processes spanning the energy spectrum. We will investigate two such connections in this work. In the first part, we will relate the analytic structure of the scattering amplitudes of scalar quantum field theories in the far infrared to unifying symmetries of their actions in the ultraviolet. In the sequel, we will study a system of two massive scalar fields coupled to the spacetime metric. Identifying the classical limit with the gravitational infrared, we will sift the classical dynamics of binary gravitational inspiral from the scattering amplitudes of canonical quantum gravity. In Chapter 1, we argue that symmetry and unification can emerge as byproducts of certain physical constraints on dynamical scattering. To accomplish this we parameterize a general Lorentz invariant, four-dimensional theory of massless and massive scalar fields coupled via arbitrary local interactions. Assuming perturbative unitarity and an Adler zero condition, we prove that any finite spectrum of massless and massive modes will necessarily unify at high energies into multiplets of a linearized symmetry. Certain generators of the symmetry algebra can be derived explicitly in terms of the spectrum and three-particle interactions. Furthermore, our assumptions imply that the coset space is symmetric. In Chapter 2, we introduce the gravitational inspiral problem.In Chapter 3, we review the Hamiltonian formulation of binary dynamics and outline the extraction of the effective Hamiltonian from scattering amplitudes. We then augment the equations of motion with a gravitational radiation reaction force, thus incorporating dissipation. In Chapter 4, we extend the setup of Kosower, Maybee, and O'Connell (KMOC), which expresses classical observables in terms of scattering amplitudes, to study the evolution of angular momentum during two-body scattering in gravity and electromagnetism. From the associated scattering amplitudes, we explicitly compute the total radiated angular momentum through the third Post-Minkowskian order (3PM) in general relativity and the third Post-Coulombic order (3PC) in electromagnetism. In Chapter 5, starting with the classical expressions for radiated energy and angular momentum, we compute the corresponding instantaneous radiative fluxes in isotropic gauge. We then use these fluxes to derive the relative radiation reaction force associated to a gravitational binary system at third post-Minkowskian order by imposing flux balance. Together with the conservative Hamiltonian, this force provides a complete equation of motion for the relative degree of freedom of a (bound or unbound) gravitational binary at 3PM. Finally, in Chapter 6 we compare our results with the post-Newtonian literature, finding agreement to G\u00b3, 3PN (relative) order.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Cheung, Clifford W.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/h0w0-1d25, author = {Shimozono, Alexander Mitsuo}, title = {The Development of Ni-Catalyzed Methods for Application in Total Synthesis}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/h0w0-1d25}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:11032022-004822338}, abstract = { The total synthesis of complex natural products often requires the development of mild, selective transformations.

In addition to finding application toward the synthesis of talatisamine, this reaction found further use in an attempted route toward enmein-type ent-kauranoid natural products.

The subsequent characterization and reactivity studies of such clusters provide insight into how cluster structural properties, including ligand identity, metal identity, and cluster composition and geometry affect cluster electronic properties and reactivity. Chapter II describes the synthesis of an unprecedented WFe3S3(\u00b53-carbyne) cluster and comparisons with a WFe3S3(\u00b53-S) cluster provide insight into the role of the bridging carbide in FeMco. The generality of the developed method for synthesis of MFe3S3(\u00b53-carbyne) clusters is also demonstrated. Characterization of the various carbyne clusters are discussed.

The development of such systems requires collaborative, interdisciplinary approaches that translate diverse sources of raw information into accessible scientific insight. For example, we need to monitor species in real time and in greater detail to quickly understand which conservation efforts are most effective and take corrective action. Current ecological monitoring systems generate data far faster than researchers can analyze it, making scaling up impossible without automated data processing. However, ecological data collected in the field presents a number of challenges that current methods, like deep learning, are not designed to tackle. These include strong spatiotemporal correlations, imperfect data quality, fine-grained categories, and long-tailed distributions. Our work seeks to overcome these challenges, and this thesis includes methods which can learn from imperfect data, systematic frameworks and benchmarks for measuring and overcoming performance drops due to domain shift, and the development and deployment of efficient human-AI systems that have made significant real-world conservation impact.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Perona, Pietro}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/k66v-1c93, author = {Barth, Alexandra Teresa}, title = {Electronic Structure and Reactivity of Metal Complexes}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/k66v-1c93}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:12282022-061839565}, abstract = { Transition metals are at the core of addressing global energy needs.

Employing infrared, visible, ultraviolet, and x-ray spectroscopy, chemists are afforded insight into the electronic structures of transition metal complexes, investigating ligand field strengths and metal-ligand interactions. Addition of time-resolved techniques affords resolution of dynamic processes in molecular species, such as electron transfer pathways. Chapter 1 reviews the electronic structure and reactivity of homoleptic tungsten(0) arylisocyanides W(CNAr) to provide the foundation for much of this work. In Chapter 2, application of W(CNAr) species for one- and two-photon photoredox catalysis are explored. The two-photon absorption cross-sections of W(CNAr) are remarkably large ( = 180-1900 GM) and enable these photocatalysts to operate under excitation from visible or near infrared light. Photoredox activity is evaluated via base-promoted homolytic aromatic substitution (BHAS) reaction of thermodynamically challenging substrates. In Chapter 3, solvent perturbations enhance visible light-activated BHAS catalysis from W(CNAr). Increased solvent dielectric (benzene and solvated electrolyte combine to increase *W(CNAr) quenching rates up to one order of magnitude with greater cage-escape yields.

In our study of black hole spectroscopy, we develop a novel framework for identifying quasinormal modes in ringdown signals. We apply this method to numerical-relativity waveforms of binary black hole systems and find second-order and retrograde quasinormal modes in the ringdown regime. We also apply this method to GW150915, resulting in new insights into the existence of the first overtone. On the other hand, we explore how the excitation of quasinormal modes encodes information about binaries' parameters. Focusing on superkick configurations, we find universal dependence of the mode amplitudes and phases on the binary's configurations. Tidal effects have significant imprints on gravitational waves emitted during the final stage of the coalescence of binaries involving neutron stars. We examine how dynamical tides can be significant when neutron stars' characteristic oscillations become resonant with orbital motion, and we investigate their impact on measuring neutron-star parameters with gravitational waves. Specifically, we conduct systematic studies on the tidal excitation of fundamental and Rossby modes of spinning neutron stars and find that their effects may be significant and detectable in the era of third-generation gravitational-wave detectors, which in turn could lead to more stringent constraints on the properties of neutron stars. Regarding numerical relativity, we implement a fully relativistic three-dimensional Cauchy-characteristic matching algorithm to establish a more accurate boundary condition for numerical-relativity simulations. We justify the correctness of the algorithm by nonlinearly propagating gravitational-wave pluses and find that the new boundary condition does reduce spurious numerical reflection at outer boundaries and improves the accuracy of the generated waveforms. The second part focuses on the initial data of binary black holes for numerical simulations. We extend the superposed harmonic initial data, which breaks down for high-spin black holes, to higher spins by introducing a new spatial coordinate system: superposed modified harmonic. We find that the new initial data preserves a nice property of the superposed harmonic system: the suppression of junk radiation. Furthermore, we find that the volume-weighted constraint violations for the new initial data converge with numerical resolution during the junk stage, which means there are fewer high-frequency components at outer spacetime regions. Finally, we investigate the features of gravitational waves within theories beyond general relativity, focusing on two specific aspects. First, we present a numerical-relativity simulation of a black hole-neutron star merger in scalar-tensor gravity with binary parameters consistent with the gravitational wave event GW200115. We consider the Damour-Esposito-Far\u00e8se extension to Brans-Dicke theory and find that the scalar-tensor system evolves faster than its general-relativity counterpart due to dipole radiation, merging a full gravitational-wave cycle before the GR counterpart. We also compare the numerical waveforms with post-Newtonian theory and find good agreement during the inspiral. Second, we propose a new approach, based on numerical-relativity waveforms, for reconstructing the late-time near-horizon geometry of merging binary black holes and computing gravitational-wave echoes from exotic compact objects. We use a physically-motivated way to impose boundary conditions near the horizon and apply the Boltzmann reflectivity to compute the quasinormal modes of non-rotating ECOs, as well as gravitational-wave echoes. Additionally, we investigate the detectability of these echoes in current and future detectors and prospects for parameter estimation.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Chen, Yanbei}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/wget-ws64, author = {Tan Teck Keng, Adrian}, title = {Digital Quantum Simulation of Physical Systems on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Computers}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/wget-ws64}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05072023-204014466}, abstract = { Current quantum computers are characterized as having the order of 5-100 qubits, with limited connectivity restricting two-qubit operations to nearest neighbors, and with too much noise to achieve fault-tolerance. Such devices, called noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, have been demonstrated to have sufficient coherent lifetime to perform interesting experiments motivated by quantum information sciences. This motivates the question of whether such devices can be utilized to study physical systems commonly encountered in condensed matter and quantum chemistry. In this thesis, we address the open problem of identifying approaches to perform quantum simulations of physical systems on NISQ devices. We begin our study by considering the Hamiltonian ground state problem, a task routinely solved in numerical studies of materials and molecules. We provided a new quantum primitive, the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE), that provides a practical approach to solve the Hamiltonian ground state problem. In addition, the QITE subroutine can be used in a Lanczos scheme to speed up convergence time. Next, we consider the problem of performing finite temperature simulations and demonstrate how QITE can be used as a subroutine to develop scalable and feasible approaches to perform such calculations on a quantum computer. More specifically, we develop routines to obtain thermal averages by sampling minimally entangled thermal states, and also free energy by evaluating the partition function directly. In our final study, we consider the study of topological states of matter, which do not fit within the Landau paradigm of local order parameters associated with symmetry breaking, and have been shown to exhibit unusual behavior. We show how a specific class of topological states of matter, the symmetry-protected topological states can be feasibly realized on present NISQ devices and their unusual behavior experimentally validated.

Data assimilation (DA) offers a well-established and successful paradigm for blending such models with noisy observational data. However, traditional DA-based inference often fails when available data are insufficiently informative. Chapter 2 copes with this challenge by introducing constraints into Ensemble Kalman Filtering, which is shown to improve forecasting of glucose dynamics in real patient-level clinical data. Chapter 3 addresses this identifiability challenge by instead developing a simplified, reduced-order stochastic model for glucose dynamics that is more easily identified from patient data. Despite these successes, the forecasting performance of the methods are fundamentally limited by the fidelity of the employed model, which is often not fully understood a priori. Chapter 4 presents a general picture of how noisy, partially-observed time-series data can be used to learn flexible (e.g., neural network-based) corrections to a pre-specified mechanistic model. In Chapter 5, the proposed methodology is then validated in simulated settings for glucose-insulin models. Chapter 6 provides further perspective on learning flexible model corrections, comparing approaches that use i) gradient-based or gradient-free optimization, ii) temporal or time-averaged data, iii) different model parameterizations, iv) deterministic and stochastic corrections, and v) physical conservation laws to constrain inference. Chapter 7 studies how these perspectives on machine learning and dynamical systems can help us understand the roles of biochemical networks. In particular, it considers protein dimerization networks from the lens of approximation theory and evaluates how the equilibria of these networks can be fine-tuned to perform a variety of biological computations.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Stuart, Andrew M.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/7x3a-g504, author David Gerald}, title = {Expanding Adeno-Associated Viral Capsid Engineering to Multiple Variable Regions for Diversified Tropism}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/7x3a-g504}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05172023-011031610}, abstract = { Adeno-associated virus research is critical for the advancement of gene therapy and treatment of myriad debilitating genetic disorders.

Ultrasound, on the other hand, is a noninvasive imaging modality that stands out for its universal availability, cost-effectiveness, and safety. However, harnessing the benefits of nanomaterials for ultrasound has been challenging due to the size and stability constraints of typical ultrasound contrast agents. Recently, an innovative solution has emerged in the form of gas vesicles (GVs), a class of air-filled protein nanostructures found in certain aquatic microbes. These promising next-generation ultrasound contrast agents offer a crucial bridge between nanotechnology and ultrasonography. In this thesis, we investigate the in vivo behavior of GVs, explore their potential applications as nanodiagnostic agents, and consider key factors for their future clinical deployment. In Chapter 2, we examine the interactions of GVs with blood components, focusing on imaging performance and immunogenicity. In Chapter 3, we show that intravenously injected GVs are cleared by liver-resident macrophages and subsequently undergo lysosomal degradation. We leverage this finding to develop an ultrasound-based method for visualizing cellular degradative processes and demonstrate its potential as a liver disease diagnostic. In Chapter 4, we introduce bicone GVs, the smallest known ultrasound contrast agent. We show that these sub-80 nm particles can penetrate tumors, deliver potent ultrasound-induced mechanical effects, and are readily engineered for molecular targeting, extended circulation time, and payload conjugation.

Though it has been pursued for decades, the catalyst performance (e.g. activity, thermal stability) is still far below practical thresholds. The major issue is the \"polar monomer problem\": coordination of the polar group in the comonomer to the metal center competes with vinyl coordination, a prerequisite for the monomer enchainment (chain propagation).

The design of numerical algorithms usually encompasses a spectrum that ranges from specialization to generality. Classical approaches, such as finite element methods, and contemporary scientific machine learning approaches, like neural nets, can be viewed as lying at relatively opposite ends of this spectrum. Throughout this thesis, we tackle mathematical challenges associated with both ends by advancing rigorous multiscale and statistical numerical methods. Regarding the multiscale numerical methods, we present an exponentially convergent multiscale finite element method for solving high-frequency Helmholtz's equation with rough coefficients. To achieve this, we first identify the local low-complexity structure of Helmholtz's equations when the resolution is smaller than the wavelength. Then, we construct local basis functions by solving local spectral problems and couple them globally through non-overlapped domain decomposition and Galerkin's method. This results in a numerical method that achieves nearly exponentially convergent accuracy regarding the number of local basis functions, even when the solution is highly non-smooth. We also analyze the role of a subsampled lengthscale in variational multiscale methods, characterizing the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency in the numerical upscaling of heterogeneous PDEs and scattered data approximation. As for the statistical numerical methods, we discuss using Gaussian processes and kernel methods to solve nonlinear PDEs and inverse problems. This framework incorporates the flavor of scientific machine learning automation and extends classical meshless solvers. It transforms general PDE problems into quadratic optimization with nonlinear constraints. We present the theoretical underpinning of the methodology. For the scalability of the method, we develop state-of-the-art algorithms to handle dense kernel matrices in both low and high-dimensional scientific problems. For adaptivity, we analyze the convergence and consistency of hierarchical learning algorithms that adaptively select kernel functions.

However, state-of-the-art intercalation-based LIBs are beginning to mature and reach their theoretical capacity limits. To further improve the electrochemical performance of batteries and meet growing demands of energy storage applications, there have been growing efforts to increase the energy density beyond the limits of conventional LIBs. In this thesis, we examine two examples of multi-electron systems-Mg electrolytes and Li-rich sulfide cathode materials-to gain insights and establish design principles. First, we explore the magnesium aluminum chloride complex (MACC) electrolyte to study the role of the electrode-electrolyte interface in Mg charge transfer. We demonstrate that MACC electrolyte which normally requires electrolytic conditioning can be chemically activated by the small addition of Mg(HMDS). Solution-phase characterization reveals that Mg(HMDS) helps prevent the formation of passivating film on the Mg surface by scavenging trace amounts of HO. Mg(HMDS) also reacts with MACC to form free Cl which decorates the Mg surface which facilitates Mg electrodeposition and stripping.

Given this design, an LSC describes a planar concentrating technology that i) maintains low system costs by using small amounts of high-efficiency PV material and ii) enables concentration of both direct and diffuse irradiation. The underlying structure of an LSC\u2014including flexibility, material versatility, and variable transparency\u2014facilitates application areas that span utility, building integrated, and space-based solar power.

We begin by examining photovoltaic device considerations for LSC integration, including device form factor, luminophore pairing, and microcell fabrication. We outline ideal component parameters for optimal LSC performance and fabricate a silicon heterojunction microcell with a record VOC of 588mV. Next, we design and fabricate single-junction LSCs for two application areas: building-integrated PV and space-based solar power. Through simulations and technoeconomic analyses, we find that such designs are able to achieve 7% efficiency with a forecasted cost as low as 2.22 $/W for the building-integrated application, and a specific power up to 11.55 kW/kg with an associated cost as low as 0.24 $/W for the space-based application.

We demonstrate that hybridization of luminescent concentrators with certain conventional designs has the potential to boost PV performance in both direct and diffuse lighting.

The state-of-the-art thermal sensing elements are made of rigid and costly inorganic materials, such as vanadium oxide and platinum. These materials have limitations for emerging applications such as wearable devices and prosthetic devices. Ideal temperature sensing materials for such applications need to be flexible, reliable under mechanical deformation, and suitable for large-area production. Electrical conductive polymers were found to be a promising solution because of their flexibility and solution processability. However, they often lag in temperature resolution compared to their inorganic counterparts. A recent discovery revealed that the ionic conductivity of crosslinked pectin, a biopolymer extracted from plant cell walls, has a record-high temperature response. It is biocompatible, flexible when hydrated, and solution-processable, making it a strong candidate for wearable temperature sensing and conformal temperature mapping. However, open questions remain about the origin of its temperature sensitivity and the principles governing its ion transport. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of the complex molecular structure of pectin presents challenges to its integration in sensing devices. In this thesis, we study the origin of the high thermal sensitivity in pectin and develop a synthetic polyelectrolyte that mimics its key structure and properties. In Chapter 3, we focus on the ion transport mechanism in crosslinked pectin. We show that the binding between multivalent ions and certain chemical functional groups of pectin plays a critical role in its temperature sensitivity. In Chapter 4, the impact of water content on the ion transport and dielectric processes in crosslinked pectin is also investigated. In the following chapter, we present a novel synthetic polyelectrolyte designed to mimic pectin with a simpler structure. It has superior flexibility, high temperature sensitivity, and is stable under mechanical deformation. To further study this new material, we examine its ion transport dynamics under varying humidity and temperature conditions in Chapter 7. We discover that temperature and humidity have a similar effect on ion transport. Overall, we showed a biomimetic approach to design temperature sensitive polymers where the strong ion-polymer binding is the key to the ultrahigh temperature response.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Daraio, Chiara}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/yxa0-6884, author = {Ning, Honglie}, title = {Ultrafast Optical Control of Order Parameters in Quantum Materials}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/yxa0-6884}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:08292022-044824279}, abstract = { Developing protocols to realize quantum phases that are not accessible thermally and to manipulate material properties on demand is one of the central problems of modern condensed matter physics. Impulsive electromagnetic stimulus provides an extensive playground not only to exert desired control over the material macroscopic properties but also to optically detect the underlying microscopic mechanisms. Two indispensable components form the cornerstone to realize these goals: a meticulous comprehension of light-induced phenomena and a suitable and versatile platform. Abundant photoinduced phenomena emerge upon light irradiation. A collective oscillation of order parameter can be launched and probed in the weak perturbation regime; further increasing light intensity can transiently modulate the free-energy landscape, inducing a suppression, enhancement, reversal, and switch of order parameters; in the strong non-perturbative excitation regime, the system can be driven nonlinearly with microscopic coupling parameters modified. Understanding these light driven emergent phenomena lays the foundation of optical control and novel functionalities. Quantum materials, embodying a large portfolio of topological and strongly correlated compounds, afford an exceptional venue to realize optical control. Owing to the complex interplay between the charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom, a rich phase diagram can be generated with various phases that are selectively and independently accessible via optical perturbations. They hence offer a wealth of opportunities to not only improve our comprehension of the underlying physics but also develop the next generation of ultrafast technologies. In Chapter I of this thesis, I will first cover a multitude of light-induced emergent phenomena in quantum materials under the framework of time-dependent Landau theory, Keldysh theory, and Floquet theory, and then introduce several canonical microscopic models to quantitatively rationalize the intra- and interactions between different degrees of freedom in quantum materials. As the necessary theoretical background is established, three main experimental techniques that have been extensively utilized in my research: time-resolved reflectivity and Kerr effect, time-resolved second harmonic generation rotational anisotropy, and coherent phonon spectroscopy will be introduced in Chapter II. In Chapter III, I will demonstrate that a light-induced topological phase transition can be engendered concomitant with an inverse-Peierls structural phase transition in elemental Te. In Chapter IV, I will describe signatures of ultrafast reversal of excitonic order in excitonic insulator candidate Ta2NiSe5 and substantiate a manipulation of the reversal as well as the Higgs mode with tailored light pulses. In Chapter V, a light-induced switch of spin-orbit-coupled quadrupolar order in multiband Mott insulator Ca2RuO4 will be introduced.

In each chapter, I aim to understand an observed political behavior using data or methodologies previously unused in their contexts. The subject matter ranges from protest activity and vote choice to theoretical opinion models and re-examining how socioeconomic class is understood in quantitative work. In the first two chapters I employ novel datasets to understand phenomena where popular theories differ from empirical observations. In Chapter 1 I examine protest behavior, which is not the equilibrium prediction of models of collective action. I investigate what aspects of published language can predict protest participation and how these change leading up to and following protests. Specifically, I collect and, using natural language processing methods, analyze 4 million tweets of individuals who participated in the Black Lives Matter protests during the summer of 2020. Using geographical and temporal variation to isolate results, I find evidence that interest in the subject, measured as percentage of online time discussing the matter, is correlated with protest behavior. However, I also find that collective identity, measured through pronoun use, does not have a strong relationship with protest behavior. Next, in Chapter 2, I use a survey\u2014which I helped to develop and field\u2014to understand the 2020 midterm elections' surprising results. While most accepted models of midterm elections predicted massive Democratic losses (averaging around 40 seats in the House), these predictions were not met. In fact, the Democratic party did well\u2014they did not lose a single state legislature, expanded some majorities, and lost only 9 seats in the House of Representatives. Testing various models of midterm elections, I show that the 2020 midterms were issue-based elections, where views on abortion had a large impact on vote choice. In the second half of the thesis I focus on methodologies. Specifically, in Chapter 3, I expanded on mathematical models of consensus building to better mimic reality. Bounded confidence models have historically been used to explain convergence of opinions. In this chapter I add a repulsive element, modeling the inclination to differentiate oneself from someone who otherwise has similar beliefs. With this added component, convergence is no longer assumed. I explore both analytical and simulated numerical results to understand the dynamics of opinions in this new context. Finally, in Chapter 4, I introduce a method for operationalizing socioeconomic class as a latent variable in regression models. While there has been a plethora of research which shows that class affects opinions, views, and actions, the definition of class is nebulous. I argue that this is a result of the nature of class, which is context dependent. Therefore, rather than explicitly determining class, I present using class within a mixture model framework. This allows for the exact definition of class to change within the context being analyzed and enables researchers to use class within their work. Following the theoretical arguments, I present the efficacy of the approach using the American National Election Studies survey from 2020 to show how class differs when related to views of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and the Black Lives Matter movement.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Alvarez, R.

The supersymmetry (SUSY) search focus on the production of at least one Higgs boson that decays into two photons in the decay chains of pair-produced SUSY particles. The data used has an integrated luminosity of 77.5 fb\u00b9. The events are classified into different search regions based on charged leptons, Higgs boson candidates, and kinematic variables to make them sensitive to different SUSY scenarios. The results reveal no statistically significant excess of events compared to the standard model predictions. The searches exclude bottom squark pair production for bottom squark masses below 510 GeV and a lightest SUSY particle mass of 1 GeV. The wino-like chargino-neutralino production in gauge-mediated SUSY breaking (GMSB) is excluded for chargino and neutralino masses below 235 GeV, with a gravitino mass of 1 GeV. Furthermore, the higgsino-like chargino-neutralino production in GMSB, where the neutralino decays exclusively to a Higgs boson and a gravitino, is excluded for neutralino masses below 290 GeV. The thesis also reports a search for long-lived particles that decay in the outer regions of the CMS silicon tracker or in the calorimeters. The search uses data with an integrated luminosity of 138 fb\u00b9. The identification of long-lived particle decays utilizes a novel technique that combines nearly trackless and out-of-time jet information into a deep neural network discriminator. The results are interpreted using a simplified GMSB model of chargino-neutralino production, where the neutralino is the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle that decays to a gravitino and either a Higgs or Z boson. The search achieves the highest sensitivity for neutralino proper decay lengths of approximately 0.5 meters and excludes masses up to 1.18 TeV at a 95% confidence level.

While most examples of directed evolution of new-to-nature chemistry have been applied in a synthetic direction, enzymatic biodegradation typically relies on wild-type enzymes. This thesis posits that directed evolution can generate enzymes capable of degrading non-biodegradable anthropogenic compounds, focusing on efforts to break silicon-carbon bonds, which are not known to be cleaved by enzymes in Nature. Chapter I establishes background on how enzymes evolve to catalyze degradation of compounds over long timescales in Nature, highlighting the enzymatic depolymerization of lignocellulosic biomass. This sets the stage for a case study of rapid enzyme evolution in response to anthropogenic molecules such as plastics and agrochemicals. With this background, directed evolution of new-to-nature synthetic activities is presented to demonstrate how new enzymatic activities can be evolved in the laboratory. In Chapter II, the state of the art for biocatalytic reactions involving organosilicon compounds is reviewed, starting with a description of how biology uses silicon and concluding with a perspective on future opportunities in this nascent field. Finally, Chapter III describes the engineering of a novel siloxane oxidase based on a cytochrome P450, which conducts two reaction steps in tandem to cleave silicon-carbon bonds. First, it hydroxylates the C-H bonds of siloxanes\u2014the anthropogenic building blocks of silicone polymers\u2014to yield a carbinol species, an activity reminiscent of the parent enzyme's native hydroxylation of fatty acids. Via a function entirely different than its native activity, the enzyme converts this carbinol to a silanol species. In performing both of these steps, this is the first known enzyme that can cleave Si-C bonds, an activity which is the first step toward enzymatic degradation of these persistent, man-made compounds. In sum, this thesis demonstrates that directed evolution can reveal enzymatic degradation chemistries that are not known in Nature by establishing new-to-nature Si-C cleavage of siloxanes.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Arnold, Frances Hamilton}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/a9e9-he45, author = {Yavas, Recep Can}, title = {Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Single-Receiver Channels with Limited Feedback}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/a9e9-he45}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06012023-003751035}, abstract = { Emerging Internet of Things, machine-type communication, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication in 5G demand codes that operate at short blocklengths, have low error probability and low energy consumption, and can handle the random activity of a large number of communicating devices. Since many of the applications have a single central device, e.g., a base station, that resolves the communication and a varying number of users, these requirements on the code design motivate interest in the non-asymptotic analysis of codes in a variety of single-receiver channels. This thesis investigates three channel coding problems with the goals of understanding the fundamental limits of channel coding under stringent requirements on reliability, delay, and power, and proposes novel coding architectures that employ constrained feedback to attain those limits. In the first part, we consider point-to-point channels without feedback, and analyze the non-asymptotic limits in the moderate deviations regime in probability theory. The moderate deviations regime is suitable for accurately approximating the maximum achievable coding rate in the operational regimes of practical interest because it simultaneously considers high rates and low error probabilities. We propose a new quantity, channel skewness, which governs the fundamental limit at short blocklengths and low error probabilities. Our approximation is the tightest among the state-of-the-art approximations for most error probability and latency constraints of interest. In the second part, we investigate rateless channel coding with limited feedback. Here, rateless means that decoding can occur at multiple decoding times. In our code design, feedback is limited both in frequency and content; it is sparse, meaning that it is available only at a few instants throughout the communication epoch; and it is stop-feedback, meaning that the receiver informs the transmitters only about whether decoding has occurred rather than what symbols it has received. Our results demonstrate that sporadically sending a few bits is almost as efficient as sending feedback at every time instant. In the third part, we focus on rateless random access channel codes, where the number of active transmitters is unknown to both the transmitters and the receiver. Our rateless code design that reserves a decoding time for each possible number of active transmitters achieves the same first two terms in the asymptotic expansion of the achievable rate as codes where the transmitter activity is known a priori. This means that, remarkably, the random transmitter activity has almost no effect on achievable rates. To obtain tight channel coding bounds, we analyze some non-asymptotic and asymptotic state-of-the-art bounds on the probability of the sum of independent and identical random variables, whose applications extend to source coding, hypothesis testing, and many others. In the scenarios where these tools are not directly applicable such as for the Gaussian channel, we propose new techniques to overcome that difficulty.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/34d6-nj32, author = {He, Liyin}, title = {Agriculture and Its Role in the Global Carbon Cycle}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/34d6-nj32}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:04152023-232107829}, abstract = { Crops not only feed the world's human population and livestock but also impact the global carbon cycle. The intensification of agriculture has allowed much greater crop yields by hybridization, irrigation, and fertilization in the five most recent decades. However, the increased frequency and severity of extreme weathers (e.g., heat wave, drought, flood) caused by global warming have led to large yield and economic losses. Thus, the monitoring of crop growth in a changing climate is of paramount importance to improve food security and alleviate poverty. It is via photosynthesis that crops use the energy of sunlight to reduce carbon dioxide (CO) into carbohydrates. An accurate quantification of plant photosynthesis is a key step towards estimating crop yield and understanding the carbon exchange between the biosphere and atmosphere. Satellite remote sensing has emerged as one promising solution for measuring photosynthesis from regional to global scales. In the thesis, first, we show the potential of solar-induced chlorophyll (SIF) signals emitted by the chlorophyll a of plants to track photosynthesis. Compared to traditional reflectance-based vegetation indices (VIs), SIF can better capture photosynthetic down-regulation under drought and heat stresses due to its physiological linkages with photosynthetic processes. Second, we demonstrate that SIF can be used to estimate crop yield. At field sites, we find a high correlation between SIF and crop photosynthesis measurements. Scaling up this relationship to the large scale, we show that crop yield estimates using satellite-derived SIF agree well with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported annual crop yield. Third, we examine how crops respond to climate change and air quality in China. We develop a crop yield prediction model, based on a large volume of historical crop data, as well as climate and pollution records. Our finding demonstrates the co-benefit of the recent air pollution control policy from an agriculture and food perspective. However, such a benefit will be significantly offset or even outweighed by continuing global warming. Fourth, we focus on how different ecosystems, especially intensified agriculture, has reshaped the seasonality of atmospheric CO. Our satellite-derived global terrestrial carbon fluxes capture the observed CO seasonal cycle amplitude (SCA) trends at surface sites very well. We further find that CO SCA trends at mid latitude sites around the Midwest United States are mainly impacted by intensified agriculture, whereas high latitude sites are mainly driven by increasingly productive natural ecosystems.

Previous high-resolution X-ray crystal structures have provided pictures of the nitrogenase proteins and revealed the geometry of their metalloclusters. In this thesis, we study MoFe protein crystal isoforms and their crystal pathologies to classify isomorphous candidates suitable for crystallographic merging. We then leverage this classification to determine a high-resolution structure of the MoFe protein with improved geometric accuracy and lower coordinate error than currently available models. The reduced states of the MoFe protein are challenging to capture and therefore have been minimally characterized. We explore the structural consequences of introducing reductants and oxidants into MoFe protein crystals and study the effects of X-ray induced photoreduction on the metalloclusters. Further, we determine the radiation damage-free X-ray crystal structure of MoFe protein. The Fe protein adopts various conformational states as it functions in ATP-coupled electron transfer to the MoFe protein. We examine a set of proteins that are evolutionarily related to the Fe protein and have diverse functionalities, but retain similarity in their ATP-dependent function and allostery as a result of their conserved structural features.

Even though the temperature of the plasma jet is around 2 eV, 6 keV X-rays and 20-60 eV extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation were detected when the plasma jet was perturbed by magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. How charged particles in a plasma are accelerated to suprathermal energy has been a key question in plasma physics, solar physics, and astrophysics. Studying these surprisingly energetic radiations from Caltech's plasma jet can help answer this question. Toward this goal, this thesis contains an experimental study of the X-rays and a theoretical study of the EUV radiation. In the experimental study, a PIN-diode-based 1D X-ray camera has been developed to spatially, temporally, and spectrally resolve the transient, low-intensity, and suprathermal X-rays detected to be simultaneous with magnetohydrodynamic instabilities that disrupt the plasma jet. This X-ray camera has high detection efficiency over the 5-10 keV X-ray band, an over 20-degree field of view (FOV), and the capability to produce more than 50 time-resolved frames with a submicrosecond time resolution. The X-ray images are formed by a pinhole or by a coded aperture placed outside the vacuum chamber in which the plasma jet is launched. The 1D imaging shows that the location of the X-ray source is either a few centimeters away from an inner disk electrode or near a spatially translatable metal frame that is 30-40 cm away from the electrode. In the theoretical study, we propose a collisional two-fluid model which involves a novel two-stream instability that is indifferent to collisions, even though collisions have been traditionally presumed to damp the two-stream instability. This model is used to explain previously observed localized dimming of visible light and a simultaneous, localized burst of EUV radiation from a plasma jet the cross section of which is constricted by a kink-instigated Rayleigh-Taylor instability. On being triggered by the constriction of the plasma cross section, the proposed two-stream instability produces a region of low density where an electric double layer leads to localized electron heating. The low-density region is consistent with and so likely explains the visible light dimming, and the localized electron heating is consistent with and likely explains the EUV radiation.

Several lignocellulose-derived growth inhibitors commonly found in industrial feedstocks for fermentation were used to grow a panel of yeast knockouts for several efflux pumps and detoxifying enzymes. Some specific knockout strains showed slowed growth on specific growth inhibitors, while other knockout strains showed the same growth rate as the wild-type. One efflux pump was identified for vanillin, YHK8, and was overexpressed in yeast. The overexpression strain did not show an improved tolerance to vanillin, and grew more slowly than the wild-type. To regulate the expression of the vanillin pump, a sensor for vanillin was created. The starting enzyme was the wild-type qacR transcription factor, and several variants were generated using computational protein design. The designs were synthesized and tested using in vitro transcription-translation (TX-TL) as part of a rapid prototyping process. This rapid prototyping considerably sped up the design-build-test against the same lignocellulose growth inhibitors. The Pseudomonas spp. show an improved tolerance to the growth inhibitors. We then develop some ability to engineer and prototype in all three species. A panel of promoter parts were integrated into the P. synxantha genome to produce a collection of test strains. These same promoter parts were also used as DNA templates for TX-TL reactions. The in vivo measurements of promoter strength and in vitro measurements show similar relative strengths between the parts, showing the Pseudomonas-based TX-TL systems can be used for design-build-test activities in these non-model organisms.

These include implantable medical devices, soft-robotic actuators, wearable haptic devices, mechanical protection, and energy storage or conversion devices. However, the full realization of the potential of these emerging techniques requires a robust, reliable, and systematic design approach. This thesis explores this through optimal design methods. By investigating pressing engineering problems which exploit these advances in materials and manufacturing, we develop optimal design methods to realize next-generation structures. We begin by reviewing classical optimal design methods, the mathematical difficulties they raise, and the practical approaches of overcoming these difficulties. We introduce the canonical problem of compliance minimization of a linear elastic structure. After illustrating the intricacies of this seemingly simple problem, we detail contemporary methods used to address the underlying mathematical issues. We then turn to extending these classical methods for emerging materials and technologies. We must incorporate optimal design with rich physical models, develop computational approaches for efficient numerics, and study mathematical regularization to obtain well-posed optimization problems. Additionally, care must be taken when selecting an application-tailored objective function which captures the desired behavior. Finally, we must also take into account manufacturing constraints in scenarios where the fabrication pathway affects the structural layout. We address these issues by exploring model optimal design problems. While these serve to ground the fundamental study, they are also relevant, pressing engineering problems. The first application we consider is the design of responsive structures. Recent developments in material synthesis and 3D printing of anisotropic materials, such as liquid crystal elastomers (LCE), have facilitated the realization of structures with arbitrary morphology and tailored material orientation. These methods may also produce integrated structures of passive and active material. This creates a trade-off between stiffness and actuation flexibility when designing such structures. Thus, we turn to optimal design. This is complicated by anisotropic behavior and finite deformations, manufacturing constraints, and choice of objective function. Like many optimal design problems, the naive formulations are ill-posed giving rise to mesh dependence, lack of convergence, and other numerical deficiencies. So, starting with a simple setting using linear kinematics and working all the way to finite deformation, we develop a systematic mathematical theory that motivates, and then rigorously proves, an alternate well-posed formulation. We examine suitable objective functions, before studying a series of examples in both small and finite deformation. However, the manufacturing process constrains the design as extrusion-based 3D printing aligns nematic directors along the print path. We extended the formulation with these considerations to produce print-aware designs while also recovering the fabrication pathway. We demonstrate the formulation by designing and producing physical realizations of these actuators. Next, we explore optimal design of impact resistant structures. The complex physics and numerous failure modes of structural impact creates challenges when designing for impact resistance. Here, we apply gradient-based topology optimization to the design of such structures. We start by constructing a variational model of an elastic-plastic material enriched with gradient phase-field damage, and present a novel method to accurately and efficiently compute its transient dynamic time evolution. Sensitivities over this trajectory are computed through the adjoint method, and we develop a numerical method to solve the resulting adjoint dynamical system. We demonstrate this formulation by studying the optimal design of 2D solid-void structures undergoing blast loading. Then, we explore the trade-offs between strength and toughness in the design of a spall-resistant structure composed of two materials of differing properties undergoing dynamic impact. We conclude by summarizing the presented work and discuss the contribution towards the overarching goal of optimal design for emerging materials technologies. From our study, key issues have arose which must be addressed to further progress the field. We examine these and lay a pathway for future studies which will allow optimal design to tackle complicated, pressing engineering problems.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Bhattacharya, Kaushik}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/7sv2-gj10, author = Alexander}, title Role of Context-Dependent Metabolic Interactions in Organizing Microbial Communities}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/7sv2-gj10}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06122023-184806431}, abstract = {We can image the strikingly beautiful compositions of natural microbial communities, but we still lack an understanding of the factors that shape their organization.

In this thesis, I developed quantitative image analysis pipelines for uncovering the spatiotemporal growth of aggregate biofilms within a developing oxygen gradient by expanding upon the Agar Block Biofilm Assay (ABBA). I then developed the Agar Disk Biofilm Assay (ADBA) for improved imaging resolution. These tools push the bounders of laboratory experiments to better capture the complexity of natural environments. Next, I built a synthetic microbial community reflecting a metabolic pathway often partitioned between members found in nature: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) strains with a denitrification pathway genetically split at the nitric oxide (NO) node. I characterized the growth of a strict consumer and a strict producer of NO and found that PA metabolizes NO in a manner that supports growth, a previously underappreciated energy conservation strategy. Local oxygen flips this interaction from beneficial to detrimental by increasing toxicity. I found these principles drive context-dependent cellular organization.

As millimeter-wave telescopes gain sensitivity and angular resolution over multiple frequency bands, high signal-to-noise imaging of the kSZ effect in large samples of galaxy clusters will become increasingly feasible. However, maximizing the science reach of these upcoming data will require more sophisticated analysis methods to characterize and remove contamination from a range of unwanted signals, such as the emission from dusty star forming galaxies. Current predictions of kSZ-derived constraints do not account for these effects in sufficient detail. Moreover, they typically rely on Fisher matrix analyses, which cannot fully capture the degeneracies among the physical parameters describing the cluster. We present a mock observation and analysis pipeline to determine the science reach of kSZ galaxy cluster observations that employs more detailed noise models and more sophisticated analysis methods. From our mock observations, we derive new forecasts of the constraining power of next-generation telescopes on cluster peculiar velocities for several instrument configurations from the 10-m, 30-m, and 50-m classes. These forecasts will inform the designs of next-generation telescopes targeting kSZ observations and will indicate the optimal instrumentation for both cosmological and cluster-scale constraints. The software pipeline we develop will also be directly usable as an analysis tool once observations from such telescopes become available. Part 2: Silicon optics can greatly benefit future millimeter and submillimeter astronomical instruments thanks to silicon's useful properties such as low loss, high refractive index, and high strength. However, silicon's high index (n = 3.4) necessitates antireflection (AR) treatment, which has proven a major challenge, especially for the multilayer treatments required for wide spectral bandwidths. We present our approach to this challenge, in which we develop a wide-bandwidth integral AR structure for silicon optics that uses a novel fabrication technique that combines deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) and wafer bonding. We have previously demonstrated a two-layer AR structure for windows over a 1.6:1 bandwidth and are currently fabricating a four-layer coating for a 4:1 bandwidth. Here, we focus on a design for a six-layer structure optimized to give -20 dB reflection between 80 and 420 GHz (5.25:1 bandwidth), which will be useful for future multicolor SZ observations.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Golwala, Sunil}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/x271-r088, author = {Dorobantu, Victor David}, title = {Geometry and Dynamical Systems in Machine Learning and Control}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/x271-r088}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06012023-194820518}, abstract = {For many problems of interest in machine learning and control, we have access to rich information about underlying geometry and dynamics; we can leverage this information to build robust and performant solutions in new algorithms, optimizations, and designs.

By expanding the capabilities of model-based stochastic control and estimation, there is potential for artificial intelligence to be implemented as a supplement to theory-influenced design instead of being used end-to-end. We begin by deriving sufficient conditions for stochastic incremental stability for nonlinear systems perturbed by two types of non-Gaussian noise: 1) shot noise processes represented as compound Poisson processes, and 2) finite-measure L\u00e9vy processes constructed as affine combinations of Gaussian white and Poisson shot noise processes. We then present a controller architecture based on a concept we call pattern-learning for prediction (PLP) for discrete-time/discrete-event systems, in which we can take advantage of the fact that the underlying jump process is a sequence of random variables that occurs as repeated patterns of interest. Finally, we demonstrate control and estimation for JSSs in three real-world applications. First, we consider the control of networks with dynamic topology (e.g., power grid with fault-tolerance to downed lines), for which PLP is integrated with variations of the novel system-level synthesis framework for disturbance-rejection. Second, we perform congestion control of vehicle traffic flow over metropolitan intersection networks, for which PLP is extended to pattern-learning with memory and prediction (PLMP) via the inclusion of episodic control, designed to reduce memory consumption by exploiting structural symmetries and temporal repetition in the network. Third, we perform estimation and forecasting (the dual problem to control) for epidemic spread throughout a population network under jump phenomena such as superspreader effects and the emergence of variant viruses. Our results indicate that learning patterns in the jump process makes controller/observer design efficient in data-consumption and computation time, which suggests that it can potentially be used for other JSSs in the real world.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/zay2-1v59, author = {Schulze, Benjamin Christopher}, title = {Insights into the Sources of Atmospheric Aerosols and Greenhouse Gases in California}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/zay2-1v59}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06012023-202236185}, abstract = { A substantial fraction of atmospheric science research is motivated by uncertainties in the sources of urban particulate matter and greenhouse gases. Such a focus is justified, as particulate matter exposure is responsible for up to nine million annual premature deaths globally, while climate change is rapidly altering ecosystems across the world. Recognizing the urgency of these interrelated problems, regulatory agencies in the U.S. and elsewhere have sought to limit emissions contributing to air quality degradation and global warming. In this dissertation, we use a combination of ambient measurements, statistical models, and computational models to identify the sources of urban particulate matter and methane in multiple locations in California. In Los Angeles, we investigated the effects of reductions in mobile source pollutant emissions (i.e., on-road and off-road vehicles) on ambient aerosol concentrations. Mobile sources have historically accounted for the dominant fraction of urban particulate matter in Los Angeles, but despite notable reductions in their emissions over the last decade, ambient aerosol concentrations have not declined appreciably. Measurements using an Aerosol Mass Spectrometer demonstrate the complex interplay of direct (i.e., intended) and indirect effects of simultaneous reductions in organic aerosol (OA) precursor and nitrogen oxide emissions from these sources. Mobile sources are found to account for a modest and declining fraction of the total aerosol burden, while the contributions of non-traditional sources such as volatile chemical products (e.g., paints and coatings, cleaning products, adhesives and sealants) have increased. Simulations of organic and inorganic aerosol formation informed by in-situ measurements are developed to identify possible targets of future regulatory efforts. In the San Joaquin Valley, we used airborne measurements of methane fluxes to evaluate dairy emissions inventories used by state regulatory agencies for policy development. Dairy operations currently account for nearly half of the state's methane emissions, and recent legislation has mandated a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030. Observed methane fluxes align well with emission inventory predictions and demonstrate the utility of airborne flux measurements to track emission reduction progress in the future. Factor analysis of a combined dataset of greenhouse gas and volatile organic compound concentrations indicates dairy operations account for ~65% of total methane emissions in the southern San Joaquin Valley, with the remainder attributed to fugitive oil and gas emissions.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Seinfeld, John H.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/0461-g107, author = {Wandelt, Sarah Kim}, title = {Grasp, Speech, and Internal Speech Representation in the Human Cortical Grasp Circuit}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/0461-g107}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05122023-085319625}, abstract = {The ability to move freely and to connect with others through communication is invaluable for human independence. In this thesis, we explore how brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can help patients affected by movement or speech deficits to recover lost human experiences. This work builds on previous findings indicating that premotor and posterior parietal areas are involved in movement generation and language processes. These higher-level brain areas do not only engage in movement execution, but also during planning, representing rich behavioral patterns that can be leveraged for BMI applications. In this work, we investigated how represent and speech processes at a single-neuron level. Using multielectrode Utah arrays, neuronal populations were recorded in tetraplegic human participants. We found that the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), PMv and S1 significantly encode motor imagery of grasping. By studying the cognitive processes underlying neural activity during the cue phase of grasping, we found a transition from cue-modality dependent to cue-modality independent grasp representation in SMG, the anterior intraparietal cortex (AIP) and PMv. Our findings suggest SMG integrates audio, written, and image cue modalities, but more similarly represents audio and written cues, indicating language involvement. We confirmed this hypothesis by demonstrating that SMG encodes spoken words, engaging different motor plans for speech compared to grasping even when the semantic content remained unchanged. These results suggest a BMI could be trained to decode both grasp motor imagery and speech from one brain area. Lastly, we showed that SMG is highly involved in language processes, modulating for written word recognition, auditory tones, vocalized speech, and internal speech. As a proof-of-concept, we built a real-time internal speech BMI from signals recorded in SMG that can decode eight words with high accuracy. This work is the first of its kind, demonstrating internal speech can be robustly decoded from an implant in a single brain area. We find high neural SMG generalization between seeing a written word, saying it internally and vocalizing the word, suggesting shared cognitive functions between different language processes. Furthermore, words in different languages are represented in SMG. This thesis advances the BMI field by providing a better understanding of the neural processes that underly grasp motor imagery and language.

These approaches are designed to tackle specific issues that multi-rotor drones face during operation, such as near-ground trajectory control, high-speed wind disturbances, actuation delays, and motor failures. The thesis is organized into four main chapters, plus an introduction and conclusion. Each of the main chapters focuses on a unique approach to address a particular challenge of deep-learning-based control methods. Chapter 2 presents Neural-Lander, a deep-learning-based robust nonlinear controller that significantly improves quadrotor control performance during landing by accounting for complex aerodynamic effects. This chapter addresses key challenges to incorporating learned residual dynamics into a control architecture, laying the groundwork for the subsequent chapters. Chapters 3 and 4 introduce Neural-Fly, a learning-based approach that uses Domain Adversarially Invariant Meta-Learning (DAIML) and adaptive control to enable rapid online learning and precise flight control under a wide range of wind conditions. Chapter 5 proposes a lightweight augmentation method that enhances trajectory tracking performance for UAVs by effectively compensating for motor dynamics and digital transport delays. This method is extensible to a range of control methods, including learning-based approaches. Chapter 6 explores a novel sparse failure identification method for detecting and compensating for motor failures in over-actuated UAVs, contributing to the development of robust fault detection and compensation strategies for a safer and more reliable operation. This method builds on the Neural-Fly online learning framework and extends it to handle a wider range of conditions, including complete actuator failures.

A better fundamental understanding of these effects can help inform vehicle design, leading to lower power consumption and improved performance. This thesis will cover a selection of topics to gain a better understanding of the expected rotor aerodynamics associated with use in this class of vehicle, as well as the development of tools to aid in the studies and an analysis of the impact of the effects. To consider special effects on a rotor in hover on such a vehicle, Chapter 2 is the study of obstructions in the upstream of a propeller, representing the effects of a wing or fuselage blocking a propeller's inlet. The next is the effect of forward flight on the forces produced by a rotor. Lifting rotors are often used in eVTOL aircraft as the craft transitions to forward flight, so a study of their performance in forward flight as well as a model are presented in Chapter 3. Having examined rotor-wing interactions in hover and isolated rotor performance in forward flight, the next step is to examine rotor-wing interactions in forward flight. Chapter 6 shows the design of an integrated test stand for studying the aerodynamic interactions between lifting propellers and a wing in low-speed, transitional forward flight, as well as the subsequent results. This thesis also describes the development and implementation of two tools to aid in the work herein. The first (Chapter 4) is a rapid, low-cost method of extracting the geometry of a propeller using photogrammetry which is subsequently used in simulations. The second (Chapter 5) is low-cost and accessible multi-axis force sensor used in the integrated test stand for propeller-wing interaction studies.

Conventional methods for modeling and controlling fluid flows are limited in their ability to mitigate these aerodynamic forces in real-time. By applying modern machine learning techniques in an experimental setting, this thesis demonstrates the utility of machine learning in addressing these important problems. We follow two complementary approaches towards this goal. First, we find an end-to-end solution for control in a gusty environment with model-free reinforcement learning. We deploy state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms on a generalized aerodynamic test-bed consisting of an airfoil with motorized trailing edge flaps. The system features embedded flow sensors, enabling the inclusion of flow measurements in state observations. We place this system in a highly irregular wake behind a bluff-body, dynamically mounted on elastic bands and therefore free to oscillate, and train reinforcement learning agents to minimize the net lifting force on the system by controlling the position of the trailing edge flaps. We find that model-free reinforcement learning agents can outperform basic linear controllers in this gusty, turbulent environment. We also show that augmenting state observations with flow measurements can lead to more consistent learning of the system dynamics. Next, we explore Fourier neural operators (FNOs) as a method for forecasting the time evolution of turbulent fluid flows. FNOs are capable of learning underlying operator solutions to families of partial differential equations and can be evaluated in just milliseconds. We specifically focus on training FNOs with experimentally measured velocity fields of bluff body wakes in the subcritical regime. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of operator learning for fluid mechanics that features experimental measurements. We find that FNOs can accurately predict the evolution of these turbulent wakes even when trained with imperfect measurements. We then show that FNOs can quickly adapt to unseen conditions with minimal data and training through transfer learning. Finally, we consider the performance of FNOs over longer prediction horizons.

Some prokaryotic have been shown to mediate nucleic acid-guided of DNA targets, reminiscent of the nucleic acid-guided DNase activity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. It has been postulated that pAgo variants might be used as a novel genome-editing tool. However, genome manipulation induced by pAgo-mediated DNA cleavage has never been established. To demonstrate that pAgo-mediated DNA cleavage can introduce genomic mutations in Escherichia coli, we first created a recombination system and showed that CbAgo, a pAgo from Clostridium butyricum, can be directed by plasmid-encoded guide sequences to cleave the genome target site and induce chromosome recombination between downstream direct repeat sequences. Results from testing different pAgo variants suggest that the recombination rate correlates well with pAgo DNA cleavage activity, and the mechanistic study suggests the recombination involves DSB generation and RecBCD processing. In RecA-deficient E. coli strain, guide-directed CbAgo cleavage on chromosomes severely impairs cell growth, which can be utilized as counter-selection to assist Lambda-Red recombineering. These findings demonstrate the guide-directed cleavage of pAgo on the host genome is mutagenic and can lead to different outcomes according to the function of the host DNA repair machinery. Furthermore, we created a dCbAgo-based deaminase and showed that it can not only act as a random mutagen in vivo but also has the potential to be directed by plasmid-encoded guide sequences.

Small-scale decentralized treatment represents an attractive alternative that can provide necessary water treatment in many parts of the developing world where centralized wastewater treatment facilities are not practical owing to financial, geographical, or political constraints. Electrochemical oxidation (EO) is a suitable technique for decentralized treatment settings since it does not require the addition of auxiliary chemicals and offers fast reaction kinetics and modular treatment capacity. EO is considered a versatile technology since it can degrade a wide array of contaminants and inactivate waterborne pathogens. The chemical composition of the anode, where EO takes place, is a key factor that controls reactive species production and thus treatment efficiency and energy consumption. Ideal anodes for wastewater treatment should have high overpotential for oxygen evolution (\"nonactive\" anodes) and favor complete organics oxidation through direct electron transfer and/or reactions with potent oxidants such as hydroxyl radical and ozone. Common nonactive anodes including antimony-doped tin oxide (Sb-SnO), lead oxide (PbO), and boron-doped diamond (BDD) have attracted wide research interests. The work presented in this thesis centered around a newly designed heterojunction Ni-Sb-SnO2-based anode (NAT/AT) and its various applications in decentralized water and wastewater treatment. Direct treatment using NAT/AT has proved to be efficient for chemical oxygen demand removal, trace organic compound degradation, and microbial disinfection. Detailed investigation into pharmaceutical degradation kinetics and transformation products further established NAT/AT as a potential treatment alternative for the control of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in hospital wastewaters. NAT/AT is also capable of synthesizing ferrates (e.g., FeO\u00b2) in circumneutral conditions, the high oxidation state iron species that represents another group of powerful oxidants well-suited for decentralized treatment purposes.

Realizing these goals relies on the advancement of physical platforms, among which superconducting circuits have been one of the leading candidates offering complete control and read-out over individual qubits and the potential to scale up. However, most circuit-based multi-qubit architectures only include nearest-neighbor (NN) coupling between qubits, which limits the efficient implementation of low-overhead quantum error correction and access to a wide range of physical models using analog quantum simulation. This challenge can be overcome by introducing non-local degrees of freedom. For example, photons in a shared channel between qubits can mediate long-range qubit-qubit coupling arising from light-matter interaction. In addition, constructing a scalable architecture requires this channel to be intrinsically extensible, in which case a one-dimensional waveguide is an ideal structure providing the extensible direction as well as strong light-matter interaction. In this thesis, we explore superconducting circuit architectures based on light-matter interactions in waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems. These architectures in return allow us to study light-matter interaction, demonstrating strong coupling in the open environment of a waveguide by employing sub-radiant states resulting from collective effects. We further engineer the waveguide dispersion to enter the topological photonics regime, exploring interactions between qubits that are mediated by photons with topological properties. Finally, towards the goals of quantum information processing and simulation, we settle into a multi-qubit architecture where the photon-mediated interaction between qubits exhibits tunable range and strength. We use this multi-qubit architecture to construct a lattice with tunable connectivity for strongly interacting microwave photons, synthesizing a quantum many-body model to explore chaotic dynamics.

The interpretation of these measurements is still challenging, as the core-hole created following a core-level transition distorts the measured spectrum. This thesis aims to develop complementary experimental and computational techniques to measure and interpret transient X-ray spectra.

Building on the foundations of the OCEAN code, we incorporate photoexcited states for a range of transition metal oxides and demonstrate the method's ability to simulate the effects of state filling, isotropic thermal expansion and polaron states on XUV absorption spectra. Importantly, our method is also able to fully decompose the calculated spectra into the constituent components of the X-ray transition Hamiltonian, providing further insight into the origins and nature of spectral features. The XUV absorption spectra for the ground, photoexcited, and polaron states of -FeO, as well as for the ground, photoexcited, and thermally expanded states of other first row transition metal oxides - TiO, -CrO, -MnO, CoO, NiO, CuO, and ZnO - are calculated to demonstrate the accuracy of our approach. This method is easily generalized to K, L, M, and N edges to provide a general approach for analyzing transient X-ray absorption or reflection data.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Cushing, Scott K.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/8ghx-2b24, James = Microbiota Modulation of Host Feeding Behavior}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/8ghx-2b24}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:11112022-203906821}, abstract = { The rich, diverse community of microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract of animals, or gut microbiota, regulates aspects of host metabolism, immunity, and neural function, with resulting effects on the expression of complex behaviors, including feeding. In this thesis, we sought to characterize gut microbiota influences on the behavioral response to palatable foods in mice. We discover that binge-like consumption of palatable foods, including high-sucrose pellets and a high-fat diet, is exacerbated in mice in the absence of a gut microbiota. Furthermore, using automated feeding dispensers and video analysis, we find that microbiota depletion with oral antibiotics results in elongated feeding bouts and conserved changes in the dynamics of palatable food intake. We show the hyperphagic phenotype of antibiotic-treated mice is reversible upon microbiota reconstitution via fecal microbiota transplant. Operant conditioning tests reveal that the motivation to pursue high-sucrose rewards is augmented in microbiota-depleted mice. The mesolimbic brain region activity induced upon high-sucrose pellet consumption is elevated in antibiotic-treated mice. Gut bacteria from the family S24-7 and genus Lactobacillus were identified by differential antibiotic treatment and fecal microbiota transplants as correlating with reduction of high-sucrose pellet consumption. Indeed, colonization of vancomycin-treated mice with a mixture of S24-7 and Lactobacillus johnsonii reduces overconsumption of high-sucrose pellets in a limited-access binge-eating model. The work in this thesis comprehensively demonstrates that the gut microbiota regulates feeding induced in response to palatable foods in mice.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Mazmanian, Sarkis K.}, Noncanonical Amino Acid Tagging for Understanding Bacterial Persistence}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/q6bx-kt39}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:08272022-063655097}, abstract = { Phenotypic heterogeneity in populations of isogenic bacterial cells includes variations in metabolic rates and responses to antibiotic treatment. In particular, sub-populations of \"persister\" cells exhibit increased antibiotic tolerance. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie bacterial persistence would constitute an important step toward preventing and treating chronic infections. On the other hand, bacteria often have multiple molecular mechanisms to adapt to fluctuating environments. Understanding these mechanisms, and their redundancy, requires examinations in depth at the molecular level. This thesis describes a time- and cell state-selective proteome-labeling approach that enables researchers to investigate heterogeneous systems and molecular redundancy. In Chapter 1, we review the concept of bacterial persistence. The definition of bacterial persistence is introduced. Both the differences and connections between bacterial persistence and resistance are covered. In particular, we discuss research related to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), an important opportunistic pathogen found in many cystic fibrosis patients. State-of-the-art technologies to investigate bacterial persistence are discussed, and we conclude that advanced tools are needed to advance research on bacterial persistence further. In Chapter 2, we highlight the concept of bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT). BONCAT is a powerful tool developed in the Tirrell and Schuman laboratories allowing the incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAA) into newly-synthesized proteins. We review established strategies for proteomics, especially cell-selective proteomics. We introduce the concept and mechanism of BONCAT and address the advantages of BONCAT in the investigation of phenotypic heterogeneity and bacterial persistence. In Chapter 3, we describe our work using BONCAT for understanding bacterial persistence. In particular, we investigated the process of persister resuscitation, as it is closely related to the reoccurrence of P. aeruginosa infections. The characteristics of the heterogeneity of persister cells during persister awakening were examined by survival assays and by ScanLag, an automated colony-based system allowing high-throughput acquisition of time-lapse images, quantification, and analysis of growth of bacterial colonies. Two BONCAT methods were developed in the P. aeruginosa strain PA14 by treating cells either with L-azidohomoalanine (Aha), which avoids extensive usage of antibiotic markers and allows direct integration with PA14 transposon insertion library, or with L-azidonorleucine (Anl), which has the advantage of specificity, as well as direct application in nutrition-rich medium. Through BONCAT enrichment experiments, we found proteins involved in the biosynthesis of pyochelin, a secondary siderophore involved in bacterial iron acquisition, were up-regulated in the regrowth phase. We further explored whether the up-regulation was a result of the modulation of HigB-HigA toxin-antitoxin system. In Chapter 4, we describe our work for understanding molecular redundancy. The chapter follows up on our observation of up-regulation of pyochelin-related proteins during persister regrowth. We discuss the hypothesis that pyochelin confers a growth advantage in persister cells subject to carbon-limited conditions. In addition, we discuss the potential role of Fur, a ferric uptake regulator, in bacterial persistence.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Tirrell, David A.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/4mta-xt79, author = {Behmard, Aida}, title = {Planet Host Star Properties as Probes of Planet Formation and Evolution}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/4mta-xt79}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05162023-173813482}, abstract = {Over the past three decades, we have discovered over 5000 exoplanets that exhibit sizes, orbital architectures, and other properties that are often dramatically different from those of planets in our own Solar System.

In the first project of my thesis, I modified a machine learning framework that models stellar spectra (The Cannon, Ness et al. 2015) to measure iron abundances for M dwarfs - small, cool stars that dominate the stellar population of our galaxy. Next, I combined Bayesian statistical methods and astrometric data that tracks the movements of stars to examine orbital alignment between planet host stars and their stellar companions. I discovered that close-in gas giant planet systems tend to be misaligned, which suggests that their dynamical histories include obliquity excitation through interactions with e.g., the protoplanetary disk and/or nearby stars. I then used Keck-HIRES spectroscopic observations and MESA stellar evolution models to uncover planet formation signatures encoded in host star elemental abundance patterns. I found that abundance differences between stars in binary systems may increase as a function of their separation, which has important implications for studies that rely on binary star chemistry. Most recently, I extended my abundance methodology to large spectroscopic samples to examine abundance patterns in planet host versus non-planet host stars, and thus explore planet formation signatures on a galactic scale.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Knutson, Heather A.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/cajs-d417, Conditional Guide RNAs for Cell-Selective Regulation of CRISPR/Cas9}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/cajs-d417}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:12022022-010002116}, abstract = { CRISPR/Cas9 is a versatile platform for implementing diverse modes of genetic perturbation such as gene silencing, induction, deletion, or replacement. This technology is popularly used in developmental biology to probe genetic circuitry via constitutive gene knockdown. Global gene silencing could introduce artifacts in the study of developmental regulatory pathways, and this motivates the development of cell-selective gene editing. Our lab has recently created conditional guide RNAs (cgRNA) that enable CRISPR/Cas9 systems to silence a desired gene Y conditioned on the detection of an RNA transcript X inside of a cell. cgRNA systems were discovered via insertion and deletion mutations that systematically explored the structure function of the guide RNA. Nucleic acid engineering software (NUPACK) was used to generate orthogonal libraries of cgRNA molecules that executed both ON OFF logic (conditional inactivation by an RNA trigger) and OFF ON logic (conditional activation by an RNA trigger). A dCas9-based RFP silencing assay in bacteria was developed and used to show these cgRNA sequences were functional and could detect short exogenous trigger sequences in an orthogonal and doseresponsive manner. Subsequent studies on cgRNA structure and function enabled us to engineer next-generation systems that have fewer constraints on the trigger sequence or structure. These next-generation cgRNAs were tested against short synthetic Synthetic mRNA transcripts were used to study the effect of protein translation on trigger RNA binding. cgRNAs were capable of detecting synthetic sequences embedded in the 3 UTR of fluorescent protein mRNAs. cgRNAs could also mRNAs or truncated subsequences from endogenous mRNAs. However, the detection of native full-length endogenous mRNAs remained challenging because we cannot reliably predict the local structure of sub-sequences within a long RNA transcript. High-throughput cgRNAscreening may prove necessary for finding accessible binding sites onmRNA transcripts. Nevertheless, cgRNA functionalities could be useful in developmental biology by enabling precision perturbation of regulatory events, linking guide RNA activity to an RNA marker X correlated to a specific cell type or temporal expression pattern.

The established Standard Model accurately predicts most of the observations, but several compelling reasons motivate a need for an extension of the current theory. In this thesis, I focus my research on facing the current situation of the field in a diversified threefold manner. First, I develop methods based on physics-driven machine learning algorithms, with a particular focus on developing a model-independent tagger for unexpected events using artificial neural networks. This study shows how model-independent new physics triggers, possibly trained on real data, can select a low rate stream of events able to explore new physics processes up to a 10-100 pb cross section and can create a special dataset of rare unexpected events. Other important results from this body of work include the first application of the proposed anomaly detection strategy to real data, the use of graph neural networks to improve current pileup mitigation algorithms, the development of jet taggers based on the interaction network, and analysis-specific fast simulation. Second, I focus on the methodological and hardware development of the MIP Timing Layer that is expected to upgrade CMS in preparation for HL-LHC. My seminal study demonstrates the possibility of using time-of-flight information to perform particle identification, which has a significant impact on heavy stable charged particle searches. This work introduces how to measure time-of-flight at CMS, a strategy for particle identification, and an algorithm to locate vertices in space and time. I also participated in the sensor testing and test beam operation. In particular, I conducted a study about the design and prototype of the detector modules' thermal behavior that shows how different geometries could lead to cooling differences of a few K. Last, I direct my attention towards CMS's first lepton flavor universality tests with B meson decays. Using a dataset acquired thanks to a custom design trigger, I independently develop the measurement of the R(D*) ratio, a parameter whose tensions between the predictions and observation have drawn remarkable attentions. I oversaw the complete mature state of the analysis, from the Monte Carlo simulation to the fitting procedure.

The behavior in this inelastic regime is a coupling of physics across several length scales: from initiating as defects at the atomic scale, interacting with crystal defects, and finally spanning multiple grains and influencing macroscopic stress behavior. These length-scale interactions make predicting material response an open challenge and an avenue for leveraging microscale physics for material design. This thesis examines developing physics-based and data-driven computational models to capture complex inelastic behavior at appropriate length scales. First, we present a mesoscale model for capturing deformation twinning physics at the polycrystal scale. Mechanical twinning is a form of inelastic deformation observed in low-symmetry crystals, such as magnesium and other hexagonal close-packed (hcp) metals. Twinning, unlike slip, forms as bands collectively across grains with complex local morphology propagating into bulk behavior, drastically affecting strength and ductility. We, thus, propose a model where twinning is treated using a phase-field approach, while dislocation slip is considered using crystal plasticity. Lattice reorientation, length-scale effects, interactions between dislocations and twin boundaries, and twin and slip interactions with grain boundaries are all carefully considered. We first outline the model and its implementation using a novel approach of accelerated computational micromechanics in a two-dimensional, single twin-slip system, polycrystal case to demonstrate its capabilities. Finally, we consider multiple twin-slip systems and conduct three-dimensional simulations of polycrystalline magnesium. We summarize the insights gained from these studies and the implications on the macroscale behavior of hcp materials. The second part of the thesis focuses on data-driven models for capturing microscopic history-dependent phenomena for multiscale modeling applications. The multiscale modeling framework has seen increased usage over the last few decades for its ability to capture complex material behavior over a range of time/length scales by solving a macroscale problem directly with a constitutive relation defined implicitly by the solution of a microscale problem. However, this implementation is computationally expensive - needing to solve a microscale problem at each point and time of the macroscopic calculation. In this study, we examine the use of machine learning by utilizing data generated through repeated solutions of a microscale problem to: (i) gain insights into the history dependent macroscopic internal variables that govern the response and (ii) create a computationally efficient surrogate. We do so by introducing a recurrent neural operator, which can provide accurate approximations of the stress response and insights into the physics of the macroscopic problem. We illustrate these capabilities on a laminate composite and polycrystal made of elasto-viscoplastic materials, summarize insights on the learned internal variables, and accuracy of stress predictions.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Bhattacharya, Kaushik}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/px5z-aj53, author = {Overholts, Camille}, title = {A Novel Platform for Mechanochemical Multicolor Lithography and Models for Solution-Phase Mechanophore Activation}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/px5z-aj53}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05182023-163804024}, abstract = {The use of mechanical force to trigger chemical reactions has generated many exciting applications in stimuli-responsive materials.

This work describes the derivation of this resonance-based model, its in vitro validation, and its in vivo testing on 60 subjects. This testing resulted in robust resonance detection and accurate calculation of BP in the large majority of evaluated subjects, representing very promising performance for the first test of a new biomedical technology. The second study changes focus to the measurement of blood pressure in the right atrium of the heart, an important clinical indicator in heart disease patients. Rather than developing a new physical approach, this project used machine learning to model the existing assessments made by cardiologists.

This thesis consists of two parts. The first part explores the singularity formation of the axisymmetric incompressible Euler equations with no swirl in , which is closely related to the Millennium Prize Problem on the global singularity of the Navier-Stokes equations. In this part, the high dimensionality contributes to the singularity formation in finite time by enhancing the strength of the vortex stretching term. The second part focuses on sampling from a high-dimensional distribution using deep generative networks, which has wide applications in the Bayesian inverse problem and the image synthesis task. The high dimensionality in this part becomes a significant challenge to the numerical algorithms, known as the curse of dimensionality. In the first part of this thesis, we consider the singularity formation in two scenarios. In the first scenario, for the axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl, we consider the case when the initial condition for the angular vorticity is C H\u00f6lder continuous. We provide convincing numerical examples where the solutions develop potential self-similar blow-up in finite time when the H\u00f6lder exponent < , and this upper bound can asymptotically approach 1 - 2/n. This result supports a conjecture from Drivas and Elgindi [37], and generalizes it to the high-dimensional case. This potential blow-up is insensitive to the perturbation of initial data. Based on assumptions summarized from numerical experiments, we study a limiting case of the Euler equations, and obtain * = 1 - 2/n which agrees with the numerical result. For the general case, we propose a relatively simple one-dimensional model and numerically verify its approximation to the Euler equations. This one-dimensional model might suggest a possible way to show this finite-time blow-up scenario analytically. Compared to the first proved blow-up result of the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl and H\u00f6lder continuous initial data by Elgindi in [40], our potential blow-up scenario has completely different scaling behavior and regularity of the initial condition. In the second scenario, we consider using smooth initial data, but modify the Euler equations by adding a factor as the coefficient of the convection terms to weaken the convection effect. The new model is called the weak convection model. We provide convincing numerical examples of the weak convection model where the solutions develop potential self-similar blow-up in finite time when the convection strength < , and this upper bound should be close to 1 - 2/n. This result is closely related to the infinite-dimensional case of an open question [37] stated by Drivas and Elgindi. Our numerical observations also inspire us to approximate the weak convection model with a one-dimensional model. We give a rigorous proof that the one-dimensional model will develop finite-time blow-up if < 1 - 2/n, and study the approximation quality of the one-dimensional model to the weak convection model numerically, which could be beneficial to a rigorous proof of the potential finite-time blow-up. In the second part of the thesis, we propose the Multiscale Invertible Generative Network (MsIGN) to sample from high-dimensional distributions by exploring the low-dimensional structure in the target distribution. The MsIGN models a transport map from a known reference distribution to the target distribution, and thus is very efficient in generating uncorrelated samples compared to MCMC-type methods. The MsIGN captures multiple modes in the target distribution by generating new samples hierarchically from a coarse scale to a fine scale with the help of a novel prior conditioning layer. The hierarchical structure of the MsIGN also allows training in a coarse-to-fine scale manner. The Jeffreys divergence is used as the objective function in training to avoid mode collapse. Importance sampling based on the prior conditioning layer is leveraged to estimate the Jeffreys divergence, which is intractable in previous deep generative networks. Numerically, when applied to two Bayesian inverse problems, the MsIGN clearly captures multiple modes in the high-dimensional posterior and approximates the posterior accurately, demonstrating its superior performance compared with previous methods. We also provide an ablation study to show the necessity of our proposed network architecture and training algorithm for the good numerical performance. Moreover, we also apply the MsIGN to the image synthesis task, where it achieves superior performance in terms of bits-per-dimension value over other flow-based generative models and yields very good interpretability of its neurons in intermediate layers.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Hou, Thomas Y.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/ghvz-q712, author = {Wu, Chun-Wei Vince}, title = {Freeze Casting - from Battery Separators to Ceramic Scaffolds}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/ghvz-q712}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06092023-230729474}, abstract = { Freeze casting is a versatile pore-forming technique which allows tunability of pore structures including pore size, size distribution, morphology, and alignment in various material systems. It is that versatility that makes freeze casting a prospective candidate for fabrication of porous components used in a wide range of fields, ranging from biomaterials to supercapacitors. This work explores freeze casting as the processing route to fabricate battery separators and ceramic scaffolds. The first part of this study assesses the feasibility of tape/freeze casting, a combination of tape casting and freeze casting, in fabricating battery separators for sodium-ion batteries. Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) is chosen as the separator material due to its chemical inertness in battery environments, and dioxane is selected as the solvent for PVDF-HFP owing to its dendritic crystal structure and the absence of demixing upon freezing the solution. PVDF-HFP membranes fabricated by a bi-directional tape/freeze casting with dioxane exhibit through-thickness, directionally aligned pore structures. Although PVDF-HFP is shown to surpass reference separators in electrolyte affinity and electrochemical performance, composite strategies are designed to provide enhanced mechanical and electrochemical properties. Firstly, the effects of alumina, a reinforcing agent introduced via ball milling with dioxane to form suspensions prior to tape/freeze casting, are examined. Composite PVDF- HFP/Al2O3 membranes show similar microstructures to their polymer counterpart, with enhanced resistance to thermal shrinkage, elastic modulus, electrolyte uptake, and ionic conductivity. Moreover, coin cells made with composite membranes deliver better rate performance and cycling stability than those with polymer membranes and filter paper reference materials. Secondly, an alternative route to incorporate inorganic reinforcing elements into PVDF- HFP membranes is found through a co-solvent process. Silica particles from a sol-gel reaction of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) are introduced into PVDF-HFP membranes via a co- solvent method in conjunction with sulfoxide (DMSO). The tape/freeze-cast PVDF-HFP membranes fabricated with directionally aligned pores, while a hierarchical pore morphology with circular pores on the aligned pore walls is observed in composite membranes fabricated with TEOS, and hence, silica additions. Composite PVDF-HFP/SiO membranes outperform their unreinforced polymer counterpart in terms of elastic modulus, thermal stability, electrolyte affinity, and ionic conductivity, along with capacity retention and cycling performance when assembled into coin cells. The final portion of this study evaluates the capability of freeze casting for highly permeable ceramic scaffolds using a polymethylsiloxane preceramic polymer with tert- butyl alcohol (TBA), a solvent creating prismatic pores without side arms that affords high permeability. A double-sided freeze-casting configuration results in more controlled freezing of the polymer solutions in comparison with the conventional single-sided counterpart, and hence a more aligned pore structure is obtained.

The data in such real-time systems arrive at the encoder progressively in a streaming fashion. An intriguing question is: what codes can transmit streaming data with both high reliability and low latency? Classical non-causal (block) encoding schemes can transmit data reliably but under the assumption that the encoder knows the entire data block before the transmission. While this is a realistic assumption in delay-tolerant systems, it is ill-suited to real-time systems due to the delay introduced by collecting data into a block. This thesis studies causal encoding: the encoder transmits information based on the causally received data while the data is still streaming in and immediately incorporates the newly received data into a continuing transmission on the fly. This thesis investigates causal encoding of streaming data in three scenarios: causal sampling, causal lossy compressing, and causal joint source-channel coding (JSCC). In the causal sampling scenario, a sampler observes a continuous-time source process and causally decides when to transmit real-valued samples of it under a constraint on the average number of samples per second; an estimator uses the causally received samples to approximate the source process in real time. We propose a causal sampling policy that achieves the best tradeoff between the sampling frequency and the end-to-end real-time estimation distortion for a class of continuous Markov processes. In the causal lossy compressing scenario, the sampling frequency constraint in the causal sampling scenario is replaced by a rate constraint on the average number of bits per second. We propose a causal code that achieves the best causal distortion-rate tradeoff for the same class of processes. In the causal JSCC scenario, the noiseless channel and the continuous-time process in the previous scenarios are replaced by a discrete memoryless channel with feedback and a sequence of streaming symbols, respectively. We propose a causal joint sourcechannel code that achieves the maximum exponentially decaying rate of the error probability compatible with a given rate. Remarkably, the fundamental limits in the causal lossy compressing and the causal JSCC scenarios achieved by our causal codes are no worse than those achieved by the best non-causal codes. In addition to deriving the fundamental limits and presenting the causal codes that achieve the limits, we also show that our codes apply to control systems, are resilient to system deficiencies such as channel delay and noise, and have low complexities.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Kostina, Victoria}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/1exn-0t72, Covalent of Semiconductor school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/1exn-0t72}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:04252023-051729803}, abstract = {Semiconducting materials are those with a band gap across which electrons can be excited when the material absorbs photons with sufficient energy. Surface functionalization of semiconductors involves manipulation of the properties of the material by attaching organic small molecules through a surficial covalent bond. By controlling the surface properties of the material, functionalization has enabled the application of semiconductors in a myriad of fields, prompting a highly active field of research. To aid in this effort, we explore a new reaction methodology based on redox-mediated surface functionalization, where an outer-sphere, one-electron metallocene reductant or oxidant is added to the solution medium containing the semiconductor and the small molecule to be added to its surface. Using density functional theory, we elucidated the thermodynamic and kinetic factors that limit the experimentally observed upper coverage bound of reductant-activated methylation of 1T-molybdenum disulfide by determining two governing factors: 1) sulfur sites with longer Mo-S bonds are more thermodynamically favorable for methyl addition, and 2) sulfur sites with fewer adjacent methylated sulfur sites are preferentially functionalized due to steric hindrance. We then expanded this reductant-activated reaction methodology to silicon(111) surfaces and demonstrated that the reductant solution potential must lie near or above the silicon(111) conduction band edge to observe reactivity. By extending this study to silicon nanocrystals of different sized diameters and different conduction band edges, we found that the extent of surface reactivity relied heavily on reductant strength, but the energy difference between the conduction band edges was too small to observe a distinct dependency on nanocrystal size. The work encompassed in this thesis expanded our understanding of redox-mediated reactions on semiconductor surfaces, providing a new avenue for attaining atomic-level control of the surficial properties of the material using mild reaction conditions and no specialized equipment. Furthermore, redox-activated addition enables the use of new functional groups that would otherwise be reactive in other functionalization methods, promoting an abundance of opportunities to explore new applications of semiconductor materials.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Lewis, Nathan Saul}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/3gnn-sy17, author = {Cheng, Rui}, title = {Remotely Evaluating the Seasonality of Gross Primary Production at High Latitudes}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/3gnn-sy17}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:08112022-214313625}, abstract = { A warming trend larger than the global average is changing high-latitude terrestrial ecosystems. The impact of climate change at high latitudes is especially notable on the seasonality of vegetation photosynthesis, such as the Arctic greening, lengthened growing season, and increased peak production in the growing season. As a critical component of the global carbon cycle and land carbon sink, continuously monitoring the seasonal trajectory of ecosystem-level photosynthesis, Gross Primary Production (GPP), is much needed to better understand the climate change impacts and the sensitivity of high-latitude plant communities under global climate change. GPP has been estimated from both ground and space. However, sparsely distributed ground-level measurements are not representative of heterogeneous land cover and complex terrain in high latitudes. Remote sensing techniques provide extensive spatial coverage for comparing GPP at the regional scale. In this thesis, I carefully examine the advances in remote sensing for monitoring GPP at high latitudes, including using hyperspectral reflectance and Solar-Induced Fluorescence (SIF). We near 531 nm can track the seasonality of Light Use Efficiency (LUE), complementing conventional normalized difference vegetation index which is only a proxy of Absorbed Photosynthetic Active Radiation (APAR). Tracking both LUE and APAR is critical for improving GPP estimation, especially in evergreen forests with photosynthetic phenology but sustained canopy color - a typical land cover type at high latitudes. Satellite-measured SIF can also track both LUE and APAR. Here, it is shown that the empirical model predicting GPP using SIF is land cover dependent. The presence of snow and surface, heterogeneous land cover, and complex terrains in the high latitudes further complicate the interpretation of the SIF-GPP relationship. To improve the accuracy of interpreting SIF in complex terrain, a geometric model is developed to account for variations in APAR on tilted slopes. The results of this thesis enhance the use of both reflectance and SIF to help improve terrestrial biosphere models simulating GPP and cope with model-data uncertainties. The results are also a useful reference for future satellite missions designing instruments and correcting topographic impacts.

In Drosophila, the majority of piRNAs are produced from heterochromatic genomic loci, called piRNA clusters, that act as repositories of information about genome invaders. piRNA generation by dual-strand clusters depends on the chromatin-bound Rhino-Deadlock-Cutoff (RDC) complex, a complex specifically enriched on a dual-strand cluster, which is deposited on clusters guided by piRNAs, forming a feed-forward loop in which piRNAs promote their own biogenesis. However, this rises a fundamental question about how piRNA clusters are formed initially before cognate piRNAs are present. Here we report the spontaneous de novo formation of a Rhino-dependent piRNA cluster from repetitive transgenic sequences. We show that cluster formation occurs gradually over several generations and requires continuous trans-generational transmission of small RNAs from mothers to their progeny. Importantly, we discovered that maternally-supplied siRNAs are responsible for triggering de novo cluster activation in progeny. In contrast, the siRNA pathway is dispensable for piRNA cluster function and maintenance after its establishment. These results revealed an unexpected cross-talk between the siRNA and piRNA pathways and suggested a mechanism for de novo formation of piRNA clusters triggered by production of siRNAs.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Aravin, Alexei A.}, Excitations in van der Waals Materials for Active Nanophotonics}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/tz4z-ed06}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:04032023-062047194}, abstract = { van der Waals materials are emerging due to their unique properties such as atomic thickness, diverse quasiparticle optical resonances, and no requirement for lattice matching. While there is a vast variety of materials, semiconductors hold a special place for opto-electronic and linear/non-linear optical studies. Black phosphorus (BP), a 2D quantum-well with direct bandgap and puckered crystal structure, is a compelling platform for this research direction. In this thesis, we investigate fundamental optical excitations in novel low-dimensional quantum materials to achieve strong light-matter interaction and integrate with nanophotonic motifs for low-footprint, reconfigurable optical technology, focusing primarily on black phosphorus and transition metal dichalcogenides. The thesis begins with the 'thin film limit' of van der Waals materials, between 5 and 20 nm thickness range. Chapters 2 and 3 explore how few-layer black phosphorus hosts interband and intraband optical excitations that can be strongly modified with gate-controlled doping and electric field, displaying epsilon near zero and hyperbolic behavior in the mid and far-infrared. In atomic thickness, strongly bound excitonic quasiparticles dominate the optical response. In Chapter 4, we investigate electrically tunable excitons in tri-layer black phosphorus, demonstrating a reconfigurable birefringent material that, when coupled with a Fabry-Perot cavity, enables the realization of a versatile and broadband polarization modulator. In Chapter 5, we examine the ultimate limit of a monolayer, studying MoTe2 via photoluminescence measurements and first-principles GW+BSE calculations, highlighting the Rydberg series associated with the exciton and its gate-tunability to understand strong electron-exciton interactions. In Chapter 6, we show how such excitons in monolayer black phosphorus can be strongly quantum confined at natural edges of exfoliated flakes, leading to highly temporally coherent emission. This emission is gate-tunable and understood via transmission electron microscopy and first-principles GW+BSE calculations of phosphorene nanoribbons to be originating from atomic reconstructions of the edge coupled with strain and screening effects.

This knowledge gap poses a grand challenge when deploying machine learning methods in critical decision-making tasks, where incorrect decisions can have catastrophic consequences. To effectively utilize these learning-based methods in such contexts, it is crucial to explicitly characterize their performance. Over the years, significant research efforts have been dedicated to learning and control of dynamical systems where the underlying dynamics are unknown or only partially known a priori, and must be inferred from collected data. However, much of these classical results have focused on asymptotic guarantees, providing limited insights into the amount of data required to achieve desired control performance while satisfying operational constraints such as safety and stability, especially in the presence of statistical noise. In this thesis, we study the statistical complexity of learning and control of unknown dynamical systems. By utilizing recent advances in statistical learning theory, high-dimensional statistics, and control theoretic tools, we aim to establish a fundamental understanding of the number of samples required to achieve desired (i) accuracy in learning the unknown dynamics, (ii) performance in the control of the underlying system, and (iii) satisfaction of the operational constraints such as safety and stability. We provide finite-sample guarantees for these objectives and propose efficient learning and control algorithms that achieve the desired performance at these statistical limits in various dynamical systems. Our investigation covers a broad range of dynamical systems, starting from fully observable linear dynamical systems to partially observable linear dynamical systems, and ultimately, nonlinear systems. We deploy our learning and control algorithms in various adaptive control tasks in real-world control systems and demonstrate their strong empirical performance along with their learning, robustness, and stability guarantees. In particular, we implement one of our proposed methods, Fourier Adaptive Learning and Control (FALCON), on an experimental aerodynamic testbed under extreme turbulent flow dynamics in a wind tunnel. The results show that FALCON achieves state-of-the-art stabilization performance and consistently outperforms conventional and other learning-based methods by at least 37%, despite using 8 times less data. The superior performance of FALCON arises from its physically and theoretically accurate modeling of the underlying nonlinear turbulent dynamics, which yields rigorous finite-sample learning and performance guarantees. These findings underscore the importance of characterizing the statistical complexity of learning and control of unknown dynamical systems.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Anandkumar, Anima}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/teej-tb66, author = {Melis, Johan Matthijs}, title = {A Neural Network Model of an Insect's Wing Hinge Reveals How Steering Muscles Control Flight}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/teej-tb66}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:02272023-213525351}, abstract = { The flight system of the fly is remarkable. A fly can execute an escape maneuver in milliseconds, compensate for wing damage when half of the wing is missing, fly in turbulent conditions, and migrate over large distances. While there are many factors that contribute to the robustness and versatility of insect flight, it is the mechanical encoding of wing motion in the wing hinge that allows flies to rapidly and accurately change wing motion over a large dynamic range. The wing hinge consists of several hardened skeletal elements, named sclerites, and a set of twelve steering muscles are attached to some of these components within the exoskeleton. Due to the anatomical complexity and minute size of the sclerites, the way in which the steering muscles alter the mechanical encoding of wing motion in the hinge is poorly understood. Using genetically encoded calcium indicators and high-speed videography, is is possible to simultaneously image steering muscle activity and wing motion. In order to extract wing pose from the high-speed video frames, an automated tracking algorithm was developed, that used a neural network and model fitting to accurately reconstruct the wing kinematics. The synchronous recordings of wing motion and steering muscle activity were used to train a convolutional neural network that learned to accurately predict the wing kinematics from muscle activity patterns. After training, the convolutional neural network was used to perform virtual experiments, revealing how the steering muscles regulate wing motion. Correlation analysis revealed that the 12 steering muscles have highly correlated activity. The correlation of muscle activity can be approximated well by a 12D-plane, in which all activity has to reside. To study the function of the sclerites, a bottleneck was introduced in the convolutional neural network. The bottleneck consists of five neurons, or latent parameters, four parameters corresponding to the state of the different sclerites, on which the steering muscles act, and one parameter representing the wingbeat frequency. This so called latent network predicts both the changes in wing motion and muscle activity patterns as a function of sclerite state. The predicted wing motion as a function of sclerite state matches with previous anatomy and electrophysiology studies for the basalare, first axillary and third axillary sclerites. The fourth axillary sclerite has not been studied before, but shows an antagonistic relationship between the hg1,2 and hg3,4 muscles, resulting in a strong decrease and increase, respectively, of stroke amplitude, deviation and wing pitch angles. By replaying the wing kinematics of the virtual experiments on a dynamically scaled robotic fly, a model of the aerodynamic and inertial control forces as a function of steering muscle activity was constructed. This control force model was subsequently integrated in a state-space system of fly flight, which in turn was integrated in a model predictive control simulation that was used to simulate free flight maneuvers. The body motion, steering muscle activity, and wing kinematics of the model predictive control simulations were strikingly similar to the recorded maneuvers of free-flying flies. The integrative, multi-disciplinary approach that was used to reveal the mechanical logic of the wing hinge, and the control problem that a fly needs to solve to stay airborne, are both unprecedented in prior literature.

While researchers have looked across diverse classes, insects have been extensively studied for their rich diversity of life histories and abilities to perform at spatial and temporal scales difficult for engineered systems. Within insects, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a particularly well-studied organism because of its experimental tractability and status as a genetic model organism, providing both detailed descriptions of a broad suite of behaviors and access to and control over specific sets of tissue. In this work, we make use of these tools to study two behaviors in Drosophila, local search, the behavior in which walking flies will search the area around a food site in search of other food sources nearby, and the optomotor response, wherein they will stabilize in response to visual motion during flight. In these studies, we will use modern techniques from both biology and engineering, to exhaustively characterize and describe the observed behaviors and attempt to untangle the underlying algorithms and their neuronal implementation. First, we explore the algorithmic structure of local search in fruit flies. When flies encounter a piece of food, they will often perform walking searches nearby; as food tends to be patchy in natural settings, searches may allow flies to locate other food sites in the area. We induce local search using optogenetic stimulation of sugar-sensing neurons and constrain the flies to a dark, annular arena. These experimental details result in a simplified behavior, as the fly has access to a limited sensory environment, so that the search can be interpreted as an example of idiothetic path integration, and the search itself is one-dimensionalized and therefore more easily analyzed. Our experiments, in tandem with complementary modeling using a state transition diagram formalization of the behaviors, generate two principle findings. First, flies can integrate their location in two dimensions-after the optogenetic activation is disabled and the flies can no longer receive the food stimulus, they will continue to search over the former food site even after completing a full revolution of the annular arena. Second, when multiple food sites are present, they search over a center of the food sites, rather than over one distinct food site. These results both provide insights into the algorithmic structure of local search and an experimental and descriptive paradigm for further inquiries into the behavior. Second, we investigate the role of a population of neurons, the DNg02s, in the optomotor response. In response to visual patterns of wide-field motion, such that the entire world is moving in the fly-centric reference frame, the animal will attempt to steer to cancel the visual motion, as the most parsimonious explanation of the motion is that the fly itself is moving in the global reference frame. We demonstrate that the DNg02 neurons are a required component in the neural circuitry underlying the optomotor response, but that they are insufficient to induce steering behaviors. We conclude with a set of models that fully recapitulate the collected dataset. With current techniques, distinguishing between the two possible models of the downstream connectivity from the DNg02s to the motor neurons associated with wing motor output is not possible. However, as new datasets become available, particularly complete connectomes of the Drosophila nervous system, the neuronal pathways from the DNg02s to the motor systems may be elucidated.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Dickinson, Michael H.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/4xty-8711, author Tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) via Iridium-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation and Progress Toward the Total Synthesis of (+)-Cyanocycline A}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/4xty-8711}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06022023-190747966}, abstract = { Described herein are two reviews and three projects related to the asymmetric syntheses of tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQs) alkaloids, and the progress toward the total synthesis of (+)-cyanocycline A.

Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) offers a fundamentally different paradigm: distributed instead of point sensing. DAS converts fiber-optic cables into dense arrays of broadband, linear strainmeters, with spatial resolution as fine as one meter and temporal resolution up to several thousand samples per second. The first four chapters of this thesis concern ocean-bottom DAS, repurposing pre-existing telecommunications and power cables as distributed seafloor sensing networks for seismology and physical oceanography. In Chapter 2, we analyze one of the first ocean-bottom DAS datasets, demonstrating that seismic and ocean waves observed on the same array are related by a classic theory of double-frequency microseism generation. We also extract the principal body-wave phases of a M8.2 deep earthquake, demonstrating the earthquake detection capabilities of DAS even in a shallow water environment. In Chapter 3, we apply ambient noise interferometry to a one-hour of ocean-bottom DAS data and derive a shallow shear-wave velocity model. We also isolate spurious arrivals in noise cross-correlations associated with nearby offshore wind turbines, suggesting potential for remote monitoring. In Chapter 4, we adapt ambient noise interferometry to the ocean surface gravity wavefield, and estimate the tidal current velocity along a short cable segment in the Strait of Gibraltar with a waveform stretching method. In Chapter 5, we explore the application of DAS as a temperature sensor at long periods, documenting temperature signals up to 4 K associated with internal wave and boundary layer dynamics.

In the oceans, sulfate is the most important electron acceptor for the remineralization of organic matter after oxygen has been depleted, and sulfate reduction is particularly relevant in coastal environments and in marine and freshwater sediments. The opposite process, reduced sulfur oxidation, allows autotrophic microorganisms to fix carbon in environments where oxygen is scarce. Organic sulfur is also a relevant component of the sulfur cycle, since sulfur is the sixth most abundant element in biomass, it can protect organic matter from degradation, and it is composed of hundreds of molecules that are produced mainly by microorganisms, with potentially relevant ecological roles. This work has been divided into two parts. In the first one, we attempt to expand our understanding on different aspects of the sulfur cycle. In Chapter 2, published in Limnology and Oceanography, we focus on dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), the most abundant organic sulfur compound in the oceans with roles of UV, cryo, and osmoprotection, and involved in the formation of sulfate aerosols. We propose a framework to differentiate between the microbial degradation pathways of DMSP based on the sulfur isotope fractionations imprinted by each one of them. In Chapter 3, we perform a survey of sulfate, sulfide, and reduced sulfur intermediates, as well as redox-sensitive elements, in porewaters of a ~40 cm core from the San Clemente Basin (California) and three 1.2-2 m cores near Cocos Ridge (Costa Rica). We correlate these concentrations with the sediment microbial community composition to unveil the specifics of organic matter and sulfur cycling at these localities. In Chapter 4, we explore the utility of sulfur isotope fractionations to characterize different pathways involved in microbial sulfur oxidation (MSO), and examine the role of nutrient limitation and growth rates on the magnitude of the fractionation. In the second part of this thesis, we aim at understanding biomineralization by consortia between anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing (SRB), which comprise more than 90% of the microbial biomass in deep sea sediments around hydrocarbon seeps. In Chapter 5 (in review at Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences) we establish that modern ANME-SRB aggregates precipitate amorphous silica in undersaturated solutions in sediments and carbonates, often in the form of rims, which pinpoints to a potentially new microbial biomineralization mechanism. In Chapter 6, we posit the use of this proxy, together with distinctive spectral and isotopic signals, to find potential microfossils of ANME-SRB aggregates in the rock record of the Earth and other planetary bodies where methane seepage has occurred throughout geologic time.

Can we use the power of quantum states to address fundamental limitations in the world of classical cryptography, such as the intricate problem of revoking'' information from an untrusted party? This thesis undertakes a systematic study of how to delegate and revoke privileges in a world in which quantum computers become widely available. As part of a single framework we call revocable cryptography, we show how to revoke programs, encrypted data, and even cryptographic keys under standard assumptions.</p> <p>In the first part of this thesis, we focus on the following question: can we use the no-cloning principle of quantum mechanics and encode a program in such a way that it can be evaluated, yet it cannot be pirated? Naturally, we would also like to ensure that, once the program isreturned,'' the recipient loses its ability to evaluate it. While this quantum notion of secure software leasing (SSL) was shown to be impossible for general programs by Ananth and La Placa (Eurocrypt 2021), their work left open the possibility that it is achievable for more primitive classes of programs. We construct an SSL scheme for a large class of evasive functions known as compute-and-compare programs\u2014a more expressive generalization of point functions. Our scheme can be instantiated with any cryptographic hash function, and we prove its security in the quantum random oracle model. As a complementary result, we also construct a quantum copy-protection scheme for multi-bit point functions, which achieves a related but stronger notion of software protection previously introduced by Aaronson (CCC 2009). In the second part of this thesis, we ask: is it possible to provably delete information by leveraging the laws of quantum mechanics? We revisit a cryptographic notion called certified deletion, which was proposed by Broadbent and Islam (TCC 2020). While this remarkable notion allows a classical verifier to be convinced that quantum ciphertext has been deleted by an untrusted party, it offers no additional layer of functionality. We use Gaussian superpositions over lattices to construct the first fully homomorphic encryption scheme with certified deletion - a protocol which allows an untrusted quantum server to compute on encrypted data and to also prove data deletion to a client. Our scheme has the desirable property that verification of a deletion certificate is public; meaning anyone can verify whether deletion has taken place. Assuming the quantum subexponential hardness of the learning with errors problem (Regev, STOC 2005), we can prove that our scheme achieves a particularly strong information-theoretic deletion guarantee; namely, once a valid deletion certificate is presented, the plaintext remains hidden even if the adversary is subsequently allowed to run in unbounded time. In the final part of this thesis, we ask: is it possible to revoke a crytographic key by using the power of quantum information? We give an affirmative answer to this question and design cryptosystems with key-revocation capabilities; specifically, we consider schemes with the guarantee that, once the secret key (represented as a quantum state) is successfully revoked from a user, they no longer have the ability to perform the same functionality as before. We define and construct several fundamental cryptographic primitives with key-revocation capabilities, namely pseudorandom functions, secret-key and encryption, and even fully homomorphic encryption, assuming the subexponential hardness of the learning with errors problem. Central to all our constructions is our approach for making the Dual-Regev encryption scheme (Gentry, Peikert and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2008) revocable.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Vidick, Thomas Georges Pierre}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/j9hk-xa17, author Assistive Devices Hybrid System and Preference-Based Learning}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/j9hk-xa17}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:04292023-003436131}, abstract = { Practical robotic assistive devices have the potential to transform many aspects of our society, from enabling locomotive autonomy to facilitating rehabilitation. However, as is typically the case when having autonomous systems interact closely with humans, one must simultaneously solve multiple grand challenges. My work focuses specifically on 1) leveraging hybrid system theory to achieve stable and robust walking that generalizes well across various human models and environmental conditions, and 2) developing an online learning strategy to customize the experimental walking for individual user comfort. The presented methodology is grounded in realizing lower-body exoskeleton locomotion for subjects with motor complete paraplegia, with extensions to other robotic applications. The contributions are broken down as follows. First, by leveraging tools from nonlinear control theory, I propose techniques for systematically addressing locomotive robustness. These techniques include: using saltation matrices to generate robust gaits with experimental demonstrations on the Atalante lower-body exoskeleton; and developing an input-to-state stability perspective to certify robustness to uncertain impact events. Importantly, these methods aim to better understand the mathematical conditions underlying robust locomotion - a necessary step towards realizing safe locomotion across varying human models and environmental conditions. Second, I develop a preference-based learning framework to explicitly optimize user comfort during exoskeleton locomotion (achieved using the aforementioned nonlinear control methodology) by learning directly from subjective feedback. This framework is implemented in real-world settings, including the clinical realization of user-preferred locomotion for two subjects with motor complete paraplegia.Third, the extensibility of this framework is demonstrated through three general robotic applications: tuning constraints of the gait generation optimization problem with demonstrations on a planar biped; tuning Lyapunov-based controller gains on a 3D biped; and tuning control barrier function parameters for performant yet safe exploration on a quadrupedal platform.

Regional-scale chemical transport models predict the formation of these pollutants by representing natural and human emissions of hundreds of species and their subsequent chemical and physical processing in the atmosphere. These models are useful in the absence of detailed measurements and allow researchers to investigate the impact of changing emissions and weather. Los Angeles has unique meteorology and anthropogenic emissions which lead to dangerous pollution events and make this region an important area to study SOA, PM, and O formation. As vehicles have become cleaner and their emissions have declined, other sources of emissions have become increasingly important. One important category of emissions is volatile chemical products (VCPs), which are consumer and industrial products that have high volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions that have not been well-constrained or studied in relation to their SOA and O formation potential. In this dissertation, I use the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to represent the air quality of the Los Angeles Basin. First, a new chemical mechanism is developed to represent the formation of SOA from VCPs, implemented in the CMAQ model to simulate 2010 California, and the impact of VCPs on atmospheric pollutants is quantified. Next, we created contemporary inputs to CMAQ by simulating the meteorology, emissions, and land surface of the Los Angeles Basin in 2020. Lastly, the new inputs and chemistry are applied to CMAQ to understand current air quality issues in Los Angeles. We quantify the impact of VCPs on SOA, PM, O, and other pollutants in both 2010 and 2020. The apportionment of other emission sources and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are investigated, and pollutant concentrations are compared to measurements made throughout the Basin and specifically in Pasadena.

The IFGF strategy capitalizes on slow variations inherent in a certain Green function analytic factor, which is analytic up to and including infinity, and which therefore allows for accelerated evaluation of fields produced by groups of sources on the basis of a recursive application of classical interpolation methods. Unlike other approaches, the IFGF method does not utilize the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and it is thus better suited than other methods for efficient parallelization in distributed-memory computer systems. In fact, a (hybrid MPI-OpenMP) parallel implementation of the IFGF algorithm is proposed in this thesis which results in highly efficient data communication, and which exhibits in practice excellent parallel scaling up to large numbers of cores - without any hard limitations on the number of cores concurrently employed with high efficiency. Moreover, on any given number of cores, the proposed parallel approach preserves the linearithmic (O(N log N)) computing cost inherent in the sequential version of the IFGF algorithm. This thesis additionally introduces a complete acoustic scattering solver that incorporates the IFGF method in conjunction with a suitable singular integration scheme. A variety of numerical results presented in this thesis illustrate the character of the proposed parallel IFGF-accelerated acoustic solver. These results include applications to several highly relevant engineering problems, e.g., problems concerning acoustic scattering by structures such as a submarine and an aircraft-nacelle geometry, thus establishing the suitability of the IFGF method in the context of real-world engineering problems. The theoretical properties of the IFGF method, finally, are demonstrated by means of a variety of numerical experiments which display the method's serial and parallel linearithmic scaling as well as its excellent weak and strong parallel scaling - for problems of up to 4,096 wavelengths in acoustic size, and scaling tests spanning from 1 compute core to all 1,680 cores available in the High Performance Computing cluster used.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Bruno, Oscar P.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/c610-za20, author = {McGehee, James Mitchell}, title = {Optogenetic Approaches for Determining the Temporal Role of Morphogen Inputs on Target Gene Expression}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/c610-za20}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05302023-162053583}, abstract = {The Dorsal transcription factor and morphogen is for patterning the Dorsal- Ventral axis of Drosophila melanogaster and while it has been extensively studied, the temporal dynamics of Dorsal are not well understood. There are many processes that contribute to Dorsal nuclear concentration levels, including Toll signaling and Cactus degradation, interactions with other proteins, shuttling of Dorsal to the ventral side, DNA binding, and nuclear spacing. Dorsal nuclear levels are known to activate or repress target gene expression in a concentration or threshold dependent manner. To test how Dorsal dynamics and changes to the Dorsal gradient over time affect target gene expression, we added two optogenetic tags to Dorsal at the endogenous locus to control Dorsal nuclear levels: Blue Light Inducible Degradation (BLID) and Light Inducible Nuclear Export System (LEXY). We found that upon degradation of Dorsal using blue light and BLID that a downstream ratchet was able to maintain the expression of high threshold target genes. Using blue light and LEXY to export Dorsal, we identified an important window where Dorsal activity is required to allow activation of high threshold target genes at later stages. In comparing BLID and LEXY in conjunction with mutations to a nuclear export sequence, we also identified how rapid nuclear import and export of Dorsal is sufficient for low threshold target gene expression but actively disrupts high threshold target gene expression. We conclude that not only are final concentration levels, but also the dynamics leading to those levels are important for proper gene expression.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Stathopoulos, Angelike}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/xwy9-tc17, author = {Dong, Dillon Zhejun}, title = {Shocks, Jets, and Emerging Nebulae: Direct Detection and Characterization of Extragalactic Radio Transients in the VLA Sky Survey}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/xwy9-tc17}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:04042023-210926442}, abstract = { For most of their lives, massive stars and supermassive black holes evolve steadily, changing only gradually on human timescales. But on occasion, these cosmic engines erupt, lighting up their surroundings like flashes in the dark. Under the right conditions, the eruptions can manifest as slow radio transients, rising and fading on timescales of weeks to decades. By finding these transients and observing their evolution, we can study otherwise inaccessible aspects of the engines' lives, and piece together their influence on their surroundings. Until recently, most of our knowledge of slow radio transients came from follow-up observations of explosions first discovered as optical and high-energy transients. This avenue of discovery, while illuminating, provides an indelibly incomplete picture of the radio transient landscape. Moreover, each successful follow-up detection typically comes at the cost of many unsuccessful attempts (measured in both telescope and human time). My thesis helps address these issues by finding and characterizing transients directly in radio surveys. By applying novel transient detection techniques to data from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS), I produced the first uniformly selected sample of radio transients associated with local universe galaxies. The 64 transients in my sample have roughly doubled the total number of directly detected slow radio transients in the literature. This sample has enabled the first volume-limited characterization of the demographics of extragalactic slow radio transients. It has also facilitated the discovery of two previously unseen transient types: the merger of a compact object with a massive star and a decades-old emerging pulsar wind nebula. These early results used only ~15% of the currently available data from VLASS and focused only on extragalactic transients at low redshift. By applying the same techniques to the full survey, I have found ~2000 new transients, increasing the number of known slow radio transients (detected by any means) by a further order of magnitude. With this new sample, my collaborators and I are beginning to shift the study of slow radio transients from the domain of single-object deep-dives to the domain of statistical samples.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Hallinan, Gregg W.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/9v5k-1157, author = {Weeks, John Stephen IV}, title = {Mechanical Response of Lattice Structures under High Strain-Rate and Shock Loading}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/9v5k-1157}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:09152022-195715025}, abstract = { Lattice structures are a class of architected cellular materials composed of similar unit cells with structural components of rods, plates, or sheets. Current additive manufacturing (AM) techniques allow control and tunability of unit cell geometries, which enable lattice structures to demonstrate exceptional mechanical properties such as high stiffness- and strength-to-mass ratios and energy absorption. Lattice structures exist on two length scales corresponding to the unit cell and continuum material, and therefore demonstrate mechanical behavior dependent on structural geometry and base material. These effects extend to the dynamic regime where lattice structures demonstrate distinct deformation modes under varying strain-rate loading. Experimental investigation of the dynamic and shock compression behavior of lattice structures remains largely unstudied and is the central focus of this thesis where the high strain-rate, transient dynamic, and shock compression behaviors of different topologies of lattice materials are explored. The first part of this thesis investigates the high strain-rate behavior of lattice structures via polymeric Kelvin lattices with rod- and plate-based geometries and relative densities of 15-30%. High strain-rate behavior is characterized by deformation modes similar to that of low strain-rate behavior. High strain-rate experiments (1000/s) are performed and validated using a viscoelastic polycarbonate split-Hopkinson (Kolsky) pressure bar system coupled with high-speed imaging. Both low and high strain-rate experiments show the formation of a localized deformation band which initiates in the middle of the specimen. Strain-rate effects of lattice specimens are observed to correlate with effects of the base polymer material and mechanical properties depend strongly on the relative density of the lattice specimen and exhibit distinct scaling with geometry type (rod, plate) and loading rate despite a similar unit cell shape. Explicit finite element simulations with a tensile failure material model are then used to validate deformation modes and scaling/property trends, and match those observed in experiments. The second part of this thesis explores the transient dynamic and transition to shock compression behavior of lattice structures using polymeric lattices with cubic, Kelvin, and octet-truss topologies with relative densities of about 8%. Transient dynamic behavior is characterized by a compaction wave initiating at an impact surface and additional deformation bands with modes similar to low strain-rate modes of deformation. Dynamic testing is conducted through gas gun direct impact experiments (25 - 70 m/s) with high-speed imaging coupled with digital image correlation (DIC) and a polycarbonate Hopkinson pressure bar. Full-field DIC measurements are used to characterize distinct mechanical behaviors induced by topology such as elastic wave speeds, deformation modes, and particle velocities. At lower impact velocities, a transient dynamic response is observed. At higher impact velocities, shock compression behavior occurs and is characterized by a sole compaction wave initiating and propagating from the impact surface of the lattice. One-dimensional continuum shock theory with Eulerian forms of the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions is used with full-field measurements to quantify a non-steady shock response and the varied effect of topology on material behaviors. The final part of this thesis examines the steady-state shock compression behavior of lattice structures through stainless steel 316L (SS316L) octet-truss lattices with relative densities of 10-30%. Powder gun plate impact experiments (270 - 390 m/s) with high-speed imaging and DIC are conducted and reveal a two-wave structure consisting of an elastic precursor wave and a planar compaction (shock) wave. Local shock parameters of lattice structures are defined using full-field DIC measurements and a linear shock velocity (us) versus particle velocity (up) relation is found to approximate measurements with a unit slope and linear fit constant equal to the crushing speed. One-dimensional continuum shock analysis is again performed using Eulerian forms of the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions to extract relevant mechanical quantities. Explicit finite element simulations of the lattice specimens using the Johnson-Cook constitutive model exhibit similar shock behavior to experiments. The simulations reveal a linear us-up relation and corresponding Hugoniot calculations agree with experimental trends. Notably, 1D shock theory is applied to simulations without resorting to a us-up relation for the base material, which characterizes this deformation regime and compaction wave as a `structural shock.' Major contributions of this thesis include experimental demonstration of ranged strain-rate behaviors for lattice structures of various base materials and topologies including low strain-rate, high strain-rate, transient dynamic, and shock compression regimes; use of full-field quantitative visualization techniques for local mechanical behavior and shock analysis; and finally, characterization of a 'structural' shock compression regime in lattice structures.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Ravichandran, Guruswami}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/x61p-vf31, author = {Hsieh, Hao-Hsuan}, title Between Mammalian Nascent Protein Targeting and Cotranslational Chaperones}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/x61p-vf31}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:07252022-075028264}, abstract = { biogenesis starts with ribosome synthesizing nascent polypeptide chain. Ribosome is a major hub for multiple pathways including membrane targeting, chaperones, chemical modification, and quality control. All these pathways need to coordinate with each other spatially on the ribosomal surface and temporally within the translation elongation window. Accumulating data start to point to more intricate interaction and coordination between different pathways beyond the simple competition traditionally presumed. In Chapter 1, I demonstrate the coordination between a cotranslational chaperone, NAC, and the ER targeting machinery, SRP. NAC and SRP can bind to the same ribosome simultaneously despite overlapping binding sites, allowing NAC to change conformation of SRP specifically to the NC sequences. This allostery enhances the specificity of SRP-SR association, explaining the long-observed effect of NAC modulating ER targeting specificity. In Chapter 2, I dig deeper into the mechanism of NAC regulating SRP. Based on cryo-EM structures, NAC domain sits on top of the ribosomal tunnel exit, potentially sensing the identity of NC, and is anchored by positively charged NAC N-terminal tail. NAC-UBA domain is the key to recruiting SRP and coordinating the substrate handover to SRP. In Chapter 3, I focus on the cotranslational HSP40/HSP70 system of RAC. Ribosome binding of RAC stimulates its cochaperone activity to activate HSP70 ATP hydrolysis. Ribosome sensing by RAC is related to the NBD of HSPA14. RAC-stimulated HSP70 engagement to NC keeps it in a folding-competent unfolded state before HSP70 dissociation. Taken together, this study advances the experimental and theoretical tools to studying cotranslational pathways associated with the mammalian ribosome and demonstrates the interesting question of coordination between cotranslational pathways.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Shan, Shu-ou}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/8qa5-kn97, author = {De Rose, Luc\u00eda Bel\u00e9n}, {Nanoscale Field Emission Devices for High-Temperature and High-Frequency Operation}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/8qa5-kn97}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:03312023-192646665}, abstract = { Field emission\u2014the quantum-mechanical tunneling of electrons from the surface of a material into vacuum by means of a strong electric field\u2014has been studied for over a century. However, the usage of devices based on this mechanism has been limited to a handful of niche applications such as high-power RF systems and field emission displays. The preference for solid-state devices relies on their low cost, long lifetimes, reduced power consumption, ease of integrability, and simple and scalable fabrication. Nonetheless, with the advent of modern fabrication techniques, it has been possible to build field emission devices with nanoscale dimensions that offer several advantages over traditional semiconductor devices. The use of vacuum allows ballistic transport with no lattice scattering. As device capacitance can be engineered by tuning the geometry, these devices are appealing for high-frequency operation. Vacuum is also inherently immune to harsh operating conditions such as high temperature and radiation, which is desirable for aerospace, nuclear, and military applications. In addition, even though field emission requires substantial electric fields, by exploiting the nanoscale gaps that can be easily fabricated with state-of-the-art lithographic capabilities, we can expect operating voltages comparable to CMOS. Thus, vacuum emission devices have the potential to greatly improve upon the limitations of current technologies. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate various design paradigms to develop nanoscale field emission devices for high-temperature environments and high-frequency operation. First, we propose suspended lateral two- and four-terminal devices. By removing the underlying solid substrate, we aim to increase the resistance of the leakage current pathways that emerge at elevated temperatures. Tungsten is the chosen electrode material due to its low work function and ability to withstand high temperatures. Our next architecture consists of a multi-tip two-terminal array, which exclusively relies on the inherent fast response of field emission. Due to the strong non-linearity in the emission characteristic, frequency mixing is measured. Lastly, we combine field emission with plasmonics to conceive devices that can be modulated both electrically and optically at telecommunication wavelength. By taking advantage of the strong confinement and significant optical field enhancement of surface plasmon polaritons, we seek to minimize the applied voltages required for field emission as well as the necessary laser powers for photoemission towards the development of high-speed, low-power, nanoscale optoelectronic systems.}, address = {1200 California 91125}, advisor = {Scherer, Axel}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/wwp6-xq35, Ryan}, title = {Developing Dalotia coriaria, the Greenhouse Rove Beetle, as a Novel Model Organism}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/wwp6-xq35}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:08172022-204326931}, abstract = { This thesis deals with the development of Dalotia coriaria, the greenhouse rove beetle, as a novel model organism.

Chapter 1 explores why there is a need for Dalotia as a new model organism to study these interspecies interactions in ways that are intractable with current established models. It also explores the life history characteristics of Dalotia that make it amenable to development as a novel model organism as well as the need for genetic access in order to successfully make Dalotia an established laboratory model organism. Chapter 2 explores how I have solved the husbandry techniques required for genetic manipulations in Dalotia. These include the ability to collect large amounts of early embryos, mount embryos on slides, micro inject embryos, raise single housed larvae to adulthood, and set up one-on-one adult crosses.

It also shows how I have developed fast and accurate genotyping techniques for producing and maintaining homozygous stocks of mutant Dalotia for long periods of time.

First, I collected a database of spatial transcriptomics literature and analyzed the data on trends and sociology in this field. Based on the database and data analyses, I wrote a comprehensive book both qualitatively and quantitatively documenting the history of the field since the 1960s and reviewing more recent developments, which informed the software and methods I later developed.

I present analyses of three X-ray binaries in particular, probing different luminosities with the goal of investigating accreting neutron stars at different ac- cretion rates. At high accretion rates, approaching and moderately exceeding the Eddington limit, I performed a timing and spectral analysis of the neutron star su- pergiant X-ray binary SMC X-1. I tracked the transient pulsations of this source at different apparent luminiosities and analyzed the source spectrum as pulsations evolved in order to infer that the mechanism leading to pulsation transience is likely related to periodic obscuration by a warped accretion disk. At lower accretion rates, I studied the low-mass X-ray binary GRS 1741.9-2853. I proposed for NuSTAR observations of this source in outburst, and as a result I observed two type-I X- ray bursts originating from the source. I performed a time-resolved spectroscopic study of each of these bursts, and I used the results of this analysis to determine the composition of the burning material and the distance to the source from Earth. The third X-ray binary I present is MAXI J1848-015. This source was discovered by the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) in winter 2020 at which point its luminosity was abnormally low for an accreting compact object in outburst, making it a good candidate for the study of neutron star X-ray binaries at low accretion rates. I performed rapid follow-up of the source with NuSTAR, and I performed a detailed spectroscopic study of the NuSTAR observations, utilizing relativistic disk reflec- tion models in order to determine that the source is in fact a black hole rather than a neutron star. Complementing these observational astrophysics projects, I character- ized Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) detectors procured from Redlen Technologies in order to determine their usefulness for future hard X-ray observatories. Using Python, I produced an adaptable calibration and analysis pipeline with which to analyze noise, leakage current, spectral, and other data which I obtained in the lab.

At the same time, there have been several tragic failures that reveal potential risks with the expansion of autonomous systems into everyday life, and indicate that it is vital for safety to be accounted for in the design of control systems. This thesis seeks to develop a theory of robust safety-critical control for autonomous systems. This theory will be built upon the foundational tools of Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), which provide a powerful paradigm for the design of model-based safety-critical controllers. The dependence of CLF and CBF-based controllers on a system model makes them susceptible to modeling inaccuracies, potentially resulting in unsafe behavior when deploying these controllers on real-world systems. In this thesis I present methods for resolving four classes of model inaccuracies referred to as model error, disturbances, measurement error, and input sampling, which are commonly faced challenges when designing controllers for robotic systems. The proposed methods are unified by their shared use of CLFs and CBFs to produce controllers possessing rigorous and robust safety guarantees that can be demonstrated in simulation or experimentally. A hallmark of these methods is a focus on enabling control synthesis through convex optimization, which ensures that controllers can be efficiently computed on real-world robotic hardware platforms. In addressing model error, I consider both data-driven learning approaches and adaptive control approaches. I present three episodic learning frameworks that iteratively augment existing CLF and CBF-based controllers specified via convex optimization problems to improve the stability and safety properties of a system, which I demonstrate in simulation and experimentally. I also establish a relationship between the degradation of stability and safety properties with the magnitude of residual learning error through the perspective of Input-to-State Stability (ISS) and Input-to-State Safety (ISSf). Lastly, I develop an adaptive safety-critical control framework for systems with parametric model error through the notion of adaptive CBFs. In addressing disturbances, I resolve challenges in balancing performance and robustness with ISSf-based controllers through the notion of Tunable Input-to-State Safety (TISSf), which permits prioritizing robustness to disturbances only when safety requirements are close to being violated. I demonstrate the capabilities of TISSf-based control design experimentally on an autonomous semi-trailer truck system that is subject to input disturbances due to complex unmodeled actuator dynamics. Lastly, I develop a framework for achieving ISSf-like finite-time safety guarantees for discrete-time systems subject to stochastic disturbances through the use of CBFs and convex optimization. In addressing measurement error, I develop the notion of Measurement-Robust CBFs (MR-CBFs), which permit control synthesis through convex optimization in the presence of imperfect measurements. I demonstrate the capability of MR-CBFs on an experimental Segway system using a vision-based measurement system, validating the tractability of using controllers specified through increasingly complex classes of convex optimization problems on real-world systems. Lastly, I present an application of Preference Based Learning (PBL) in tuning the robustness parameters of a CBF-based controller, demonstrating the first use of PBL with CBFs and providing a tool for tuning the safety and performance of the robust controllers proposed in this thesis. In addressing input sampling, I consider both sampled-data and event-triggered paradigms for modeling input sampling. I provide a method for synthesizing CLF-based controllers for sampled-data systems by integrating feedback linearization with approximate discrete-time models, leading to a significant improvement over continuous-time CLF-based controllers implemented with input sampling. I then develop a framework for achieving safety of sampled-data systems through approximate discrete-time models through the notion of practical safety and Sampled-Data CBFs (SD-CBFs), which I demonstrate with convex-optimization based controllers in simulation. Lastly, I develop a method for event-triggered safety-critical control that uses ISSf to achieve safety while satisfying the requirement of a minimum interevent time. Collectively, these contributions constitute a significant advance in the theory of robust safety-critical control by establishing a framework, unified by the use of CLFs and CBFs in conjunction with convex optimization, that addresses a wide class of challenges faced in the design of safety-critical control systems.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Ames, Aaron D.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/97qy-1m35, author = {Goel, Sumit}, title = {Essays in Mechanism Design and Contest Theory}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/97qy-1m35}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05292023-003412487}, abstract = { This dissertation contains three essays. They offer contributions to the fields of mechanism design (Chapters 1 and 2) and contest theory (Chapter 3). Chapter 1, co-authored with Wade Hann-Caruthers, studies the problem of aggregating privately-held preferences for a facility to be located on a plane. We show that for a large class of social cost functions, the mechanism that locates the facility at the coordinate-wise median of the agent's ideal points is quantitatively optimal (in the sense that it has the smallest worst-case approximation ratio) among all deterministic, anonymous, and incentive-compatible mechanisms. We also obtain bounds on the worst-case approximation ratio of the coordinate-wise median mechanism for an important subclass of social cost functions. Chapter 2, co-authored with Wade Hann-Caruthers, studies a principal-agent project selection problem with asymmetric information and demonstrates the value for the principal in inducing partial verifiability constraints, such as no-overselling, on the agent. We consider a setting where the principal has to choose one among a set of available projects but the relevant information, such as each project's profitability, is held by a self-interested agent who might also have its own preference over the projects. If the agent is unconstrained in its ability to manipulate its private information, the principal can do no better than randomly choosing a project. But if the agent cannot oversell any of the projects, maybe because it must support its claims with evidence, we show that a simple cutoff mechanism (agent's favorite project is chosen among those that meet a cutoff profit level and a default project) is optimal for the principal. We also find evidence in support of the well-known ally-principle which says that principal delegates more authority to an agent with more aligned preferences. Chapter 3 studies the effect of increasing the value of prizes and competitiveness of contests on the effort exerted by participants in an incomplete information environment. We identify two natural sufficient conditions on the distribution of abilities in the population under which the interventions have opposite effects on effort. We also discuss applications to the design of optimal contests in three different environments, including the design of grading contests. Assuming that the value of a grade is determined by the information it reveals about the agent's ability, we establish a link between the informativeness of a grading scheme and the effort induced by it.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Echenique, Federico}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/6724-6e14, Prosthesis Control}, school = Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/6724-6e14}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:01072023-214003146}, abstract = { While there are over 600,000 lower-limb amputees in the US, commercially available prostheses remain limited to mostly passive devices. People that walk with a passive prosthesis experience an increase in energy expenditure, a decrease in comfortable walking speed, and gait asymmetry which leads to degenerative conditions. To address these limitations, researchers have developed powered prostheses with the aim of replicating the net positive energy biological limbs supply to humans in walking. These active devices have been shown to decrease users' metabolic cost and increase their comfortable walking speed. However, the control methods to achieve these results typically require hours of heuristic tuning for every user and every behavior. This motivates developing more formal prosthesis control methods that generalize between users. Formal nonlinear control methods have been developed to realize energy efficient, human-like walking on bipedal robots. These model-based approaches provide a systematic approach to generate and realize provably stable walking gaits. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to prostheses since they depend on a dynamic model of the entire system, and in the case of the prosthesis, the human dynamics are unknown. To address this challenge, we develop a theoretical framework to translate model-based bipedal control methods to prostheses with the aim of realizing a generalizable prosthesis control method. We separate the prosthesis subsystem from the remaining human portion of the system and model the human's impact on the prosthesis dynamics with a measure of the interaction forces between the human and the prosthesis. We theoretically prove that a model-based controller developed in this separable subsystem framework is equivalent to one developed with knowledge of the full-order human-prosthesis system. With control Lyapunov functions, we develop a wider class of subsystem controllers that solely depend on local information but provide full-order system guarantees, even in the presence of force estimate errors. This work bridges the gap between bipedal control methods and prostheses, allowing us to leverage the benefits of model-based approaches on prostheses. We demonstrated a controller of this class through an online optimization-based approach on a powered knee-ankle prosthesis, realizing the first model-dependent lower-limb prosthesis controller that accounts for the interaction force between the human and the prosthesis. For a first pass, a force-estimation method was used that yields improved tracking of the desired trajectories over model-independent prosthesis control methods. Then, we incorporated a load cell into the prosthesis platform at the human-prosthesis attachment point to measure the interaction forces, and an inertial measurement to measure the rotation and velocity of the human's thigh. These two sensors completed the prosthesis dynamics model. A pressure sensor incorporated into the prosthesis' shoe measured the ground reaction forces, enabling the prosthesis to respond to its real-world environment, proving robust to 4 different terrains. We extended this controller to a multi-domain hybrid system approach to model the changing contact points occurring in human heel-toe roll. By allowing the prosthesis to sense the human's large varying dynamic load and respond accordingly, this model-based prosthesis controller emulated subject-specific human kinematic trends on a knee-ankle prosthesis for two subjects with no tuning in between, suggesting this approach could yield a method that generalizes between users.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Ames, Aaron D.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/qhvg-7q92, author = Eric Jer-Jiun}, = {A Novel, Rapid Phenotypic Assay for a Beta-Lactam Antibiotic Susceptibility and an Analysis of its Theoretical Limits}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/qhvg-7q92}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05112023-130637882}, abstract = { Current management of bacterial infections is limited by the slow turnaround time of culture-based antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST). Culture-free phenotypic AST methods, though faster, are limited not only by analytical sensitivity but also by the low number, density, and purity of live pathogens present in clinical specimens before culturing. Separating and concentrating pathogens from clinical specimen matrices and improving the analytic sensitivity of phenotypic measurement technologies remain active areas of research. However, to date, the literature lacks consensus over what is a reasonable goal for the minimum number of pathogens in a clinical specimen needed to accurately perform phenotypic AST. I describe \"bulk filtration AST\" and \"digital filtration AST,\" two new filtration-based AST methods that improve an AST method previously published by others and myself. These methods use nucleic acid quantification to assess the activity of antibiotic classes (and only those classes) targeting peptidoglycan turnover, specifically the beta-lactams, which are the most frequently prescribed class of antibiotics. I use filtration AST to quantify the in vitro pharmacodynamics of beta-lactam antibiotics over time scales shorter than two hours, and I simultaneously validate the methods' accuracies on clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. To analyze filtration AST results, either for fitting parameter values or for predicting susceptibility, I derive probabilistic models for the outcomes of each of the two filtration AST methods, then perform Bayesian parameter inference from my data. I then propose a general mathematical framework for defining the concepts of the phenotypic assay and the ideal phenotypic assay. Within this framework, I calculate the ideal filtration AST performance as a function of the number of cells assayed, my fitted pharmacodynamic parameters, and other variables. Interestingly, the observed performance of my implementation of digital filtration AST is consistent with the implementation's approaching the ideal performance. I hope my demonstration of these new methods and my theoretical framework will help guide future research into rapid phenotypic AST.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = F.}, {Shock Compression Body-Centered Cubic from the Atomistic to Continuum Scale: Iron and Molybdenum}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/kwf1-7y79}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05052023-185856720}, abstract = { Fundamental understanding of material behavior under extreme conditions is crucial for designing high strength, light weight, and high temperature resistance materials, and for modeling planetary physics problems such as behavior of the core and impact phenomena. Under extreme conditions, materials not only exhibit a different mechanical, thermal, and failure response but can also undergo structural changes, such as phase transformations, which significantly alters their material properties. This motivates studying their dynamic response and developing constitutive models for applications such as hypersonics, high speed manufacturing, impact and blast of structures, aircraft and spacecraft shielding, meteorite impact, and collision of planets. Despite the importance, experimental investigations of shock induced phase transitions, inelastic material behavior, and elastic-plastic anisotropy under multi-axial stress states and at microscopic length scales of metals still remains largely unexplored. Thus, the focus of this thesis is on the shock compression behavior of body-centered cubic (BCC) metals, specifically iron and molybdenum, under compression-shear loading and at the atomistic-continuum spatial scales. In particular, the role of solid-solid phase transformation of body-centered cubic (BCC) iron on material strength and the orientation dependence of single crystal molybdenum on its elastic-plastic transition is investigated. Iron in its high pressure hexagonal close-packed (HCP) -phase is critical in geological and planetary applications such as inner cores of rocky planets and hypervelocity impacts of asteroids, and meteorites. Thus, understanding plasticity behavior of iron under these condensed matter states is important to develop more accurate models for such applications and to understand deformation mechanisms of inner planetary cores. Because the -phase is unstable, iron reverts to its ambient -phase (BCC) upon release making it difficult to probe the strength behavior using conventional methods. Additionally, solid-solid phase transformations provide a unique opportunity to study material strength as they are crucial for expanding the design space for various load-bearing applications. In the first part of the thesis, the pressure dependent dynamic strength behavior of both the ambient BCC -phase and high-pressure HCP -phase of iron at strain rates on the order of 1 X 10 s\u00b9 and pressures up to 42 GPa is investigated. Pressure shear plate impact experiments are conducted using a sandwich configuration to decouple the effect of pressure and shear thereby allowing to probe shear strength once the sample reaches an equilibrated state of pressure but prior to release. The strength of the -phase is observed to be more than double the strength of -phase possibly due to microstructural evolution during phase transformation. Additionally, the evolution of yield properties with pressure, temperature, and strain is presented for the first time, enabling more accurate modeling of extreme deformation phenomena associated with iron-rich celestial bodies such as planetary collisions. Molybdenum, its alloys, and other body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory metals are critical in geological and planetary applications such as structural properties of terrestrial planetary composition, formation of the earth-moon system, and hypervelocity impacts of rocky planets. Additionally, the high temperature specific strength, creep resistance, and ductility of BCC refractory metals make them ideal for aerospace and armor/anti-armor applications. Under high strain-rate inelastic loadings, the macroscopic response of these metals is often influenced by the atomistic mechanisms including dislocation motion and deformation twinning. Current material models rely on investigations that involve continuum measurements followed by postmortem microstructural analysis of recovered samples. However, these may not reflect the material behavior during the passage of the shock wave and, thus, requires real-time in-situ atomistic characterization to link the microstructure to macroscopic response. In the second part of the thesis, plate impact experiments coupled with both laser interferometry continuum measurements and in-situ dynamic Laue x-ray diffraction (XRD), at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), are conducted on single crystal molybdenum. Here, the role of crystal orientation, either [100] or [111], on deformation mechanisms during the elastic-plastic transition and the steady state response is explored at pressures ranging from 9-19 GPa. Complementary simulation methodology is developed to analyze the evolution of the Laue diffraction spots captured during impact. By extracting the lattice strain and stresses from XRD images, dislocation slip along [110]111 and [112]111 is found to be the probable deformation mechanism during compression with negligible anisotropy observed at the Hugoniot state. For the first time, real-time evidence of molybdenum undergoing deformation twinning along [112]111 during shock release beyond a critical pressure of 16 GPa irrespective of the loading orientation is presented.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Ravichandran, Guruswami}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/cg5p-kr27, author = {Gupta, Anchal}, title = {Next-Generation Technologies for Gravitational Wave Detectors}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/cg5p-kr27}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06012023-001004673}, abstract = {Since the first detection of gravitational waves (GW) in 2015, gravitational wave detectors have continually been improved.

This thesis describes research on a collection of projects aimed at developing next-generation of technologies for future gravitational wave detectors. In the first part, I describe my research on directly measuring the coatings Brownian noise of high-reflectivity coatings made out of crystalline AlGaAs. It is a part of the larger effort to reduce the classical noise limit in the 30 Hz to 300 Hz band in the current generation of detectors.

Nonetheless, the theoretical understanding of their microscopic properties remains unclear with substantial difficulties in linking the observed phenomena to material composition and structures. This thesis aims to establish a theoretical hierarchy (from lattice models to realistic materials) for faithful simulations of high temperature superconductivity. We start with the lattice models of superconductors by using quantum embedding theory, whose self-consistency allows magnetic and superconducting phases to emerge. We extended the density matrix embedding theory (DMET) with improved self-consistency algorithms and determined the ground-state phase diagrams for [Chap. 3] the models [Chap. 4]. In particular, in the three-band model, we explored the atomic-scale nature of the antiferromagnetic and superconducting orders for different model parametrizations, and highlighted the role of the oxygen degrees of freedom beyond the one-band picture. To go beyond the models, we therefore extended the original theory [DMET and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)] to ab [Chap. 5]. The methods, namely the full-cell quantum embedding, are distinct from other embedding schemes in three aspects: (i) all local orbitals in a unit cell are included in the embedding problem whereas the bath orbitals are truncated according the atomic valence characters; (ii) The embedding Hamiltonian is of full quartic fermionic form rather simplified Hubbard like Hamiltonians; (iii) Many-body quantum chemistry solvers such as coupled cluster (CC) are used to generate embedding density matrix and Green's functions. As demonstrated across a variety of semiconducting and insulating materials, the full-cell quantum embedding provides accurate energy, equation of state, spin-spin correlation functions and excited-state band structures. We then applied our ab initio quantum embedding methods to the parent state of a series of cuprate superconductors [Chap. 6]. We uncovered microscopic trends in the electron correlations and revealed the link between the material composition and magnetic energy scales via a many-body picture of excitation processes involving the buffer layers. We found the competition between the in-plane superexchange and the CuO-buffer layer excitations, which explains the magnetic coupling difference among a series of superconducting materials. Finally, we investigated the doped cuprates, where the superconducting orders enter into the phase diagram [Chap. 7]. We generalized our ab initio framework to allow the particle-number symmetry breaking states such that the superconducting orders can spontaneously emerge during the self-consistency. We showed that the d-wave superconducting magnitude increases with the pressure applied to crystals and the trend connects to the superexchange coupling J . Furthermore, we also studied the layer effect on superconductivity. Unlike the pressure effect, the layer effect between different compounds is affected by more factors - both magnetic coupling J and charge distribution matters. The work provides a promising route to study the material-specific physics in high-temperature superconductivity. The aforementioned applications also relied on (i) the development and adaptation of many-body solvers, including the CC singles and doubles (CCSD) with Newton-Krylov method for better numerical convergence, and active-space quantum chemistry techniques with large-scale density matrix renormalization group. (ii) projection-based orbital localizations for metallic systems, frozen core techniques and symmetry adaptations. These contents are discussed in Chap. 2 and Appendices, including their efficient implementation and parallelization. In the concluding remarks [Chap. 8], we summarized the current status and limitations of the high-temperature superconductivity studies. In addition, we proposed several possible directions to address the challenges in electronic correlation and atomic modelling of other exotic phases from an ab initio perspective.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Chan, Garnet K.}, Run 2 Low-Mass Dark Matter Search, Highly Multiplexed Phonon-Mediated Particle Detector with Kinetic Inductance Detector, and the Blackbody Radiation in Cryogenic Experiments}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/jswx-ad33}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05212023-152144355}, abstract = { There is ample evidence of dark matter (DM), a phenomenon responsible for 85% of the matter content of the Universe that cannot be explained by the Standard Model (SM). One of the most compelling hypotheses is that DM consists of beyond-SM particle(s) that are nonluminous and nonbaryonic. So far, numerous efforts have been made to search for particle DM, and yet none has yielded an unambiguous observation of DM particles. We present in Chapter 2 the SuperCDMS HVeV Run 2 experiment, where we search for DM in the mass ranges of 0.5-10 MeV/c\u00b2 for the electron-recoil DM and 1.2-50 eV/c\u00b2 photon and the Axion-like particle (ALP). SuperCDMS utilizes cryogenic crystals as detectors to search for DM interaction with the crystal atoms. The interaction is detected in the form of recoil energy mediated by phonons. In the HVeV project, we look for electron recoil, where we enhance the signal by the Neganov-Trofimov-Luke effect under high-voltage biases. The technique enabled us to detect quantized eh creation at a 3% ionization energy resolution. Our work is the first DM search analysis considering charge trapping and impact ionization effects for solid-state detectors. We report our results as upper limits for the assumed particle models as functions of DM mass. Our results exclude the DM-electron scattering cross section, the dark photon kinetic mixing parameter, and the ALP axioelectric coupling above 8.4 x 10\u00b3 cm\u00b2, 3.3 x 10\u00b9, and 1.0 x 10, respectively. Currently every SuperCDMS detector is equipped with a few phonon sensors based on the transition-edge sensor (TES) technology. In order to improve phonon-mediated particle detectors' background rejection performance, we are developing highly multiplexed detectors utilizing kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) as phonon sensors. This work is detailed in chapter 3 and chapter 4. We have improved our previous KID and readout line designs, which enabled us to produce our first \u00f83\" detector with 80 phonon sensors. The detector yielded a frequency placement accuracy of 0.07%, indicating our capability of implementing hundreds of phonon sensors in a typical SuperCDMS-style detector. We detail our fabrication technique for simultaneously employing Al and Nb for the KID circuit. We explain our signal model that includes extracting the RF signal, calibrating the RF signal into pair-breaking energy, and then the pulse detection. We summarize our noise condition and develop models for different noise sources. We combine the signal and the noise models to be an energy resolution model for KID-based phonon-mediated detectors. From this model, we propose strategies to further improve future detectors' energy resolution and introduce our ongoing implementations. Blackbody (BB) radiation is one of the plausible background sources responsible for the low-energy background currently preventing low-threshold DM experiments to search for lower DM mass ranges. In Chapter 5, we present our study for such background for cryogenic experiments. We have developed physical models and, based on the models, simulation tools for BB radiation propagation as photons or waves. We have also developed a theoretical model for BB photons' interaction with semiconductor impurities, which is one of the possible channels for generating the leakage current background in SuperCDMS-style detectors. We have planned for an experiment to calibrate our simulation and leakage current generation model. For the experiment, we have developed a specialized ``mesh TES'' photon detector inspired by cosmic microwave background experiments. We present its sensitivity model, the radiation source developed for the calibration, and the general plan of the experiment.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Golwala, Sunil}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/zgtx-0582, author = {Xiao, Liting}, title = {Searching for Gravitational Waves from Compact Binary Coalescences and Stochastic Backgrounds in the LIGO-Virgo Detector Network}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/zgtx-0582}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:10202022-200320341}, abstract = { Gravitational waves (GWs) are ripples in spacetime generated by accelerating masses, carrying away information about the underlying processes. There are four main astrophysical sources detectable in the sensitive band of the LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA (LVK) GW detector network: compact binary coalescences, burst sources, continuous waves and stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds. This thesis focuses on the detection methods of two of these categories, coalescing compact binaries and stochastic backgrounds, and their search results across LIGO-Virgo's first three observing runs spanning from 2015 to 2020. Compact binary coalescences of black holes and/or neutron stars are the only type of GW sources detected so far in the LVK frequency band. Such binary systems lose orbital energy via GW emission and are compact enough to merge within the age of the Universe. PyCBC is a matched-filter, all-sky pipeline for GW signals from compact binary mergers using a bank of modeled gravitational waveform templates. We describe the methods employed in PyCBC and present the developmental updates both in its archival and low-latency configurations for LIGO-Virgo's third observing run. Using PyCBC to analyze the data from LIGO-Virgo's first three observing runs, we summarize our results of the searches in gravitational-wave transient catalogs and characterize some exceptional events. A stochastic gravitational-wave background consists of a large number of weak, independent and uncorrelated events of astrophysical or cosmological origin. The GW power on the sky is assumed to contain anisotropies on top of an isotropic component, i.e., the angular monopole. Complementary to the LVK searches, we develop an efficient analysis pipeline to compute the maximum-likelihood anisotropic sky maps in stochastic backgrounds directly in the sky pixel domain using data folded over one sidereal day. We invert the full pixel-pixel correlation matrix in map-making of the GW sky, up to an optimal eigenmode cutoff decided systematically using simulations. In addition to modeled mapping, we implement a model-independent method to probe spectral shapes of stochastic backgrounds. Using data from LIGO-Virgo's first three observing runs, we obtain upper limits on anisotropies as well as the isotropic monopole as a limiting case, consistent with the LVK results. We also set constraints on the spectral shape of the stochastic background using this novel model-independent method.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Weinstein, Alan Jay}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/ve4j-tw63, author = {Dibrell, Sara Elise}, title = {Development of Oxidation and Transition Metal-Mediated Reactions and Application to Natural Product Synthesis}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/ve4j-tw63}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:04282023-211208336}, abstract = { Expedient access to complex molecules via chemical synthesis is important for assessing their biological activity and medicinal properties.

We disclose efforts to address these aims by developing broadly useful chemical tools and applying them to the preparation of bioactive natural products. Toward the first aim, we investigated unusual oxidative reactivity mediated by selenium dioxide. To address the second aim, we developed nickel-catalyzed reductive cross-coupling reactions to study: catalyst-controlled enantioselectivity medicinally relevant small molecules, substrate-controlled stereoselectivity, and selectivity for ring formation.

The first project (Chap 2, Retina as Probe) was conceived to tackle the problem that there hasn't been a reliable model system for system-level neuropharmacology. We introduce a testbed for this: the mammalian retina. The retina involves many of the known neurotransmitters and modulators. Yet its synaptic wiring is well understood, and quantitative models exist to explain its input-output functions. One can connect the systems-level effects to the underlying cellular and molecular causes. To demonstrate the retina's use, we explored the effects of a range of general anesthetics on the light responses of the mouse retina. At sub-anesthetic doses, we found that certain anesthetics exert a paradoxical effect: they increase the light response of some retinal neurons and suppress the response of others. Notably, this occurred for alcohols and ketamine but not for isoflurane. We traced these effects to transmitter release at a specific synapse and, in one case, to a specific presynaptic ion channel. All the anesthetics silenced the output of the retina completely at concentrations similar to their effective dose for anesthesia in humans. Sedatives reduced retinal sensitivity but did not silence it. Finally, we used specific drugs that target hypothesized molecular mechanisms to probe how much they each contribute to anesthesia of the retina. The second project which attempted to probe the principles of autism (Chap 3) was conceptually a direct extension of the retina as a testbed. Similar to the situation in seeking for what the mechanism of general anesthesia is, the field of autism research also lacks a good testbed but for systemically comparing gene mutation - circuit defect - behavior outcomes. Similarly, we utilized the retina as a platform to identify circuit defects in four different autism model mice and followed through the different mouse line's behavior readouts using our lab's maze navigation paradigm. We discovered that the different autism mouse lines varied in the retinal circuits and varied in their navigation preferences. Nevertheless, unlike the anesthetic project, there wasn't a simple mechanism to explain why or how these differences are coupled together. The last project, Electrode Pooling, (Chap 4) aimed to boost the yield of extracellular recording electrode arrays with a novel method we named electrode pooling. The per-implant yield of extracellular recording leaped significantly from the order of tens to the order of hundreds when engineers built multiple electrode arrays based on silicon technology to replace tetrode wires. Unfortunately, this yield-per-site is already maxed out with modern silicon technology. The constraint of the yield is mainly biological, as explained in the chapter, and thus could not be further advanced by improving the manufacturing processes of semiconductors. Our solution utilized an approach that multiplexed the array recording sites (not the bottleneck) onto the readout wires with accompanying filters (the actual bottleneck). Specifically, the method proposes intelligently choosing many recording sites that carry signals and connecting them to a single wire via manipulating the switches and later un-mixed with a spike-sorting algorithm. We demonstrated the first proof-of-principle study that shows that one could get more single-neuron recordings per implant site with electrode pooling, and made recommendations on the hardware design that could facilitate the advancement of probes that use pooling algorithms.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Meister, Markus}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/2jry-1s28, author = {Jadbabaie, title = Fundamental Symmetry Violation in Polyatomic Molecules}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/2jry-1s28}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06022023-203550284}, abstract = { Open questions in fundamental physics, such as the cosmological origins of the observed imbalance of matter and antimatter, motivate the search for fundamental symmetry violating physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM).

The power of existing molecular measurements motivates us to pursue the next-generation of searches for symmetry violation. By adopting polyatomic molecules as an experimental platform, we can generically combine laser-cooling and trapping, BSM sensitivity, and exquisite quantum control over P and/or T violating energy shifts. These improvements are projected to increase the sensitivity of measurements to the PeV energy scale. In this thesis, we develop the foundations for new physics searches using cold and ultracold, linear triatomic molecules. These molecules have long-lived vibrational bending modes with closely spaced, opposite parity doublets, a key structure that aids polarizability, molecule control, state engineering, and systematic suppression. We produce a cryogenic buffer gas beam of cold YbOH molecules, using laser-enhanced chemical reactions to increase molecular yield by an order of magnitude. As a prerequisite for precision measurements, we perform high-resolution spectroscopic characterization of both the ground and excited bending modes of YbOH.

Significant advances have been made over the past few decades to yield highly miniaturized and low-power medical devices that are suitable for implantable, ingestible, or wearable applications. A key feature of medical devices that is central to their use in many applications is the capability to locate them precisely inside the body, and quite a lot of research effort has been expended in this direction. Location sensing is crucial for several applications: tracking pills in the GI tract, navigation during precision surgeries, endovascular procedures, robotic and minimally invasive surgery, and targeted therapy. The current gold-standard solutions for these procedures include invasive techniques such as endoscopy, or procedures that require repeated use of potentially harmful X-ray radiation such as CT scans. These techniques also require repeated evaluation in a hospital setting and are not conducive for non-clinical environments. While there are several alternative non-ionizing methods for imaging and localization based on electromagnetic tracking, radio-frequency, ultrasound, and optical tracking, none of them are able to simultaneously achieve a high field-of-view of tracking, high spatiotemporal resolution, fully wireless operation and miniaturization of the sensing devices, and system scalability with the number of devices. In this dissertation, we present a radiation-free system for high-precision localization and tracking of miniaturized wireless devices in vivo, using harmless magnetic field gradients. First, we demonstrate our system for precision surgery applications. We designed highly miniaturized, wireless and battery-less microdevices, capable of measuring and transmitting their local magnetic field. One such device can be attached to an implant inside the body and another to a surgical tool, such that both can simultaneously measure and communicate the magnetic field at their respective locations to an external receiver. The relative location of the two devices on a real-time display can enable precise surgical navigation without using X-ray fluoroscopy. The prototype device consists of a micro-chip fabricated in 65nm CMOS technology, a 3D magnetic sensor and an inductor-coil. The chip performs wireless power management, wireless bi-directional data-telemetry, and I2C communication with the sensor. Planar electromagnetic coils are designed for creating monotonically varying magnetic fields in the X, Y, and Z directions, resulting in field gradients that encode each spatial point with a unique magnetic field value. The concept of gradient-based spatial encoding is inspired by MRI. The system is tested in vitro to demonstrate a localization accuracy of <100\u00b5m in 3D, the highest reported to the best of our knowledge. Second, we demonstrate our system for localization and tracking of ingestible microdevices in the GI tract, which is valuable for the diagnosis and treatment of GI disorders. We designed highly miniaturized, low-power, and wireless ingestible devices to sense and transmit their local magnetic field as they travel through the GI tract. These devices consist of a 3D magnetic sensor, a Bluetooth microprocessor and a 2.4GHz Bluetooth antenna for wireless communication, all packaged into a 000-size capsule. The magnetic field sensed by the devices is created by using high-efficiency planar electromagnetic coils that encode each spatial point with a distinct magnetic field magnitude, allowing us to track the location of the devices unambiguously. The system functionality is demonstrated in vivo in large animals under different chronic conditions and disease models to show 3D localization and tracking in real time and in non-clinical settings, with mm-scale spatial resolution, and without using any X-ray radiation. This has the potential for significant clinical benefit for quantitative assessment of GI transit-time, motility disorders, constipation, incontinence, medication adherence monitoring, anatomic targeting for drug delivery, and targeted stimulation therapy. Third, in order to further miniaturize the devices developed for the above two applications and to make them even more low-power, we present a monolithic 3D magnetic sensor in 65nm CMOS technology that measures <5mm\u00b2 in area and consumes 14.8\u00b5W in power while achieving <10Trms noise. Our novel 3D magnetic sensor overcomes the challenges faced by traditional magnetic sensors by being fully CMOS compatible and achieving high sensitivity with only \u00b5W-level power, which is in sharp contrast with Hall and Fluxgate sensors. The sensor is comprised of three orthogonal and highly dense metal coils implemented in the 65nm node, which generate a voltage signal in response to AC magnetic fields by electromagnetic induction. The EMF voltage signal is processed by on-chip circuitry that performs low-noise amplification, filtering, peak detection, and 12-bit digitization. Though the sensor can be used for a variety of applications that require AC field sensing, it is particularly useful for biomedical applications\u2014tracking catheters and guidewires during endovascular procedures, minimally invasive surgeries, targeted radiotherapy, and for use as fiducial markers during preoperative planning.

Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can be transformative for these people, enabling them to control computers, robots, and more with only thought. State-of-the-art BMIs have already made this future a reality in limited clinical trials. However, these state-of-the-art BMIs have shortcomings that limit user adoption; high-performance BMIs currently require highly invasive electrodes above or in the brain; device degradation limits longevity to about 5 years; and their field of view is small, restricting the number, and type, of applications possible. This illustrates the need for a new generation of BMIs with a brain recording modality that is longer lasting, less invasive, and scalable to sense activity from large regions of the brain. Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) is a recently developed technique that meets these criteria. fUSI measures cerebral hemodynamics with exceptional spatiotemporal resolution (<100 \u00b5m; ~100 ms) and a large field of view (several cm)\u2014specifications ideally suited to recording detailed activity of entire cortical regions in parallel. In a series of novel results, we work towards developing the first high-performance ultrasonic BMI for human use. We first demonstrate that posterior parietal cortex (PPC), an area important for sensorimotor transformation, contains mesoscopic populations tuned to the intended movement direction. Using offline recorded data from several rhesus macaque monkeys, we can decode intended movement direction, task state, and expected action reward magnitude on a single trial basis. Having demonstrated that we could decode a variety of motor and cognitive variables using offline data, we developed a real-time, closed-loop ultrasonic BMI capable of decoding up to eight directions of intended movement with high accuracy. Finally, we began to translate these results into human applications and demonstrate the ability to measure changes in cerebral hemodynamics with high sensitivity through an acoustically transparent skull replacement in human subjects. Taken together, our work is a novel characterization of how functional ultrasound neuroimaging may enable a new generation of BMIs. Additionally, this work reinforces the validity of fUSI as a robust and accessible neuroimaging technique for future neuroscience questions about mesoscopic populations and their interrelationships throughout the brain.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Andersen, Richard A.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/m1t7-tm48, author Sepand = of Dewar Heterocycles and Vinyl Carbocations in Organic Synthesis}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/m1t7-tm48}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06072023-204031343}, abstract = { High-energy molecules are frequently employed in the construction of organic molecules and materials in both academic and industrial settings.

In this thesis, I focus on three main projects. First, utilizing computational structural biology techniques, I investigate the molecular mechanism that enables engineered adeno-associated viral (AAV) capsids to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). I develop a pipeline to model the vast and dynamic complex between engineered AAV capsids and their BBB receptors. I also apply a tool, recently developed by myself and discussed in Chapter 3, to distinguish capsids that bind to different receptors. The findings of this study can lead to novel approaches for developing chemicals and biologicals that can penetrate the human brain (Chapter 2). Second, I describe the development of Automated Pairwise Peptide-Receptor AnalysIs for Screening Engineered proteins (APPRAISE). This computational pipeline predicts the receptor binding propensity of engineered proteins based on competitive modeling and physics-grounded analysis. I show that APPRAISE is capable of distinguishing between receptor-dependent and receptor-independent adeno-associated viral vectors and ranking various engineered proteins, such as miniproteins binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nanobodies binding to a G-protein-coupled receptor. A top performer in an in silico screening using APPRAISE was validated experimentally (Chapter 3). Third, I show an example to engineer a genetically encoded transmitter indicator (GETI), which may eventually be a cargo delivered to the brain. The GETI has a novel scaffold based on bacterial repressors, a class of transcriptional regulators that are critical for bacteria to respond to environmental chemicals. I repurposed an antibiotic-sensing repressor protein to bind a neurotransmitter, melatonin, using machine-learning-guided directed evolution. A melatonin indicator was then created by integrating the repurposed receptor with a fluorescent protein.

Optical interconnects and the employment of high order modulation formats are considered as the solutions to fulfilling the envisioned speed and power efficiency of future interconnects. One area of growing importance in optical interconnects is the design and optimization of energy-efficient transmitters with superior power efficiency. Enhancing the electro-optical bandwidth density while keeping the power efficiency optimized, requires improvement in the optical power penalty of photonic integrated circuits. Moreover, co-optimization of electronics and photonics enables a path towards sub-pJ/b transmission efficiency. In this dissertation, architectural and circuit-level energy-efficient techniques serving these goals are presented. First, an integrated DAC-less PAM-4 transmitter in a multi-micron silicon photonics platform using 2 binary-driven uneven-length SiGe EAMs in an unbalanced MZI is presented. The optical transmitter exhibits 5.5dB ER at 100 Gb/s with 2.1dB SNR improvement compared to single EAMs driven by PAM-4 signals. Also, A DAC-less 200Gb/s QAM-16 silicon-photonics platform using 4 binary-driven SiGe EAMs in an unbalanced MZI is presented. The transmitter exhibits bit-error rates of 3\u00d710-4 and 2.8\u00d710-4 for square and hexagonal constellations. Second, a 100Gb/s PAM4 optical transmitter system implemented in a 3D-integrated Silicon Photonics-CMOS platform is presented. The photonics chip includes a push-pull segmented Mach-Zehnder Modulator (MZM) structure using highly modulators. Two segments with effective lengths of 170\u00b5m and 450\u00b5m are driven at 50 Gbaud by a dual-channel 28nm CMOS driver, which is flip-chip bonded to the photonics chip. The driver cores utilize digitally controllable pre-distortion and inductive peaking to achieve sufficient electro-optical bandwidth. The drivers deliver 1.2Vppd swing to modulators using a 0.9V supply and on-chip serializers that generate 50Gb/s data streams. The electronics chip consumes 240mW achieving 2.4pJ/bit energy efficiency. The overall electro-optical bandwidth (EOBW), without any pre-distortion, is increased by approximately 56% and 48% for the 170\u00b5m and 450\u00b5m segments, respectively, when compared to their EOBW measured by 65GHz 50-Ohm terminated probes. The optical input power to the photonics chip is +10dBm and an erbium-doped fiber amplifier amplifies output signals by 11dB. The 50Gb/s NRZ optical raw eye diagram exhibits 4.3dB extinction ratio (ER) and 1.2dBm of optical modulation amplitude (OMA). The 100Gb/s PAM4 optical raw eye diagram shows 4.3dB ER and 1.4dBm OMA with a transmitter dispersion eye closure quaternary (TDECQ) of 1.53dB after a (FFE) filter. The PAM4 TDECQ changes by 53% when the temperature is increased from 30\u00baC to 90 \u00baC at the optimum forward bias voltage of 1V. Third, an efficient cold-starting energy harvester system, fabricated in 65nm CMOS is presented. The proposed harvester uses no external electrical components and is compatible with biofuel-cell voltage and power ranges. A power-efficient system architecture is proposed to keep the internal circuitry operating at 0.4V while regulating the output voltage at 1V using switched-capacitor DC-DC converters and a hysteretic controller. A startup enhancement block is presented to facilitate cold startup with any arbitrary input voltage. A real-time on-chip 2D maximum power point tracking with source degradation tracing is also implemented to maintain power efficiency maximized over time. The system performs cold startup with a minimum input voltage of 0.39V and continues its operation if the input voltage degrades to as low as 0.25V. Peak power efficiency of 86% is achieved at 0.39V of input voltage and 1.34W of output power with 220nW of average power consumption of the chip. The end-to-end power efficiency is kept above 70% for a wide range of loading powers from 1W to 12W. The chip is integrated with a pair of lactate biofuel-cell electrodes with 2mm of diameter on a prototype printed circuit board (PCB). Integrated operation of the chip with the electrodes and a lactate solution is demonstrated.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Emami, Azita}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/7a55-p606, author = {Kefeli, Sinan}, title = {Constraints on the Polarized Dust and the Cosmic Microwave Background Using BICEP / Keck Array Series of Telescopes}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/7a55-p606}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05142023-053312973}, abstract = { BK18 data consists of all the data taken by the Bicep2, Keck Array, and Bicep3 CMB polarization experiments, as well as publicly available WMAP and Planck maps.

Spectral index for dust emission no longer requires a prior taken from measurements on other regions of the sky. In the BK papers, EE spectra are not used to derive the model, however the spectra agree well with the assumption that EE/BB = 2 for dust. In this thesis we expand on this assumption, sharing the results for the EE/BB estimate for dust when this is a free parameter in the likelihood calculation. We use the map-based and spectral-based band difference approaches to include E-modes in the likelihood analysis. In the BK papers, dust parameters are assumed to be constant over the sky.

Thermal ignition is the name given to the particular case where the initiation energy is supplied via thermal heating of a gas. The critical conditions leading to thermal ignition are in general highly configuration dependent and require a broad set of experimentation to investigate the influence of wide ranging physical processes on ignition. To aid this effort the present work comprises three main experiments covering a range of thermal ignition hazards. First, a heated atmosphere test with fuel injection (ASTM-E659) was implemented to enable the study of heavy hydrocarbon fuels such as Jet A and multicomponent surrogates. This approach showed the existence of cool flame ignition modes near the ignition thresholds for most fuels. The autoignition temperature (AIT) of commodity Jet A was found to be reasonably reproducible by most alkane fuels including n-hexane. Multicomponent surrogates were also able to match the cool flame ignition regimes reasonably well. Next, ignition using a vertical heated surface in a cold reactive atmosphere was studied in the laminar flow regime. The effects of dilution with nitrogen and reduced pressure were explored for n-hexane/oxygen/nitrogen mixtures. Results found a modest dependence of minimum ignition temperatures on pressure and nitrogen fraction however, with a significant reduction in explosion severity as measured by the maximum overpressure and transient duration. At sufficiently reduced oxygen concentrations, localized weakly propagating flames were found to form in the thermal layer near the surface and produce sustained puffing flame instabilities. One-dimensional flame simulations with detailed kinetics were conducted to supplement and aid in interpretation of the experimental measurements for diluted mixtures. Correlation of ignition thresholds were found to be possible using simplified flame properties and laminar natural convection boundary layer theory. Finally, a novel experiment was designed to explore the effects of turbulent transition and confinement of large heated surfaces on ignition thresholds. Modeling of the energy balance for resistive heating showed that cylinders up to 36 in. long could be heated using modest power supplies. Six cylinder sizes of varying length were chosen based on this analysis to explore laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow regimes. A large scale flow visualization system was created to study these flow regimes and found that turbulent transition occurred for cylinders as small as 10 in. long for wall temperatures of 1000 K. A study of the transitional dependence on temperatures for large temperature difference (T = 555-1140 K), highly non-Boussinesq conditions found that the transitional Rayleigh number decreased by two orders of magnitude in this regime. The thermal layer thickness at the transition height was estimated in order to obtain a relevant length scale to the boundary layer transition problem. Using this a more consistent transition criteria was obtained (Ra using the thermal thickness length scale) and found to vary by only a factor of two in the high temperature cases studied. The implementation of these cylinders in ignition testing revealed that there was a strong influence of heating rate due to confinement. The use of absorption spectroscopy showed that for low heating rates the fuel was mostly consumed in low temperature reactions prior to or in place of rapid ignition. This resulted in larger ignition temperatures and weak flames which propagate only in the thermal boundary layer. This effect was explained as a consequence of reduced flow recirculation times due to confinement. A strong influence of turbulence was also found for ignition thresholds when compared with other data for ignition by vertical hot surfaces in the laminar regime. Turbulence was also found to strongly influence the explosion properties due to turbulent flame acceleration. This resulted in larger explosion pressures, shorter transients, and faster flames.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Shepherd, Joseph E.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/6pje-yd82, author = {Amo Alonso, Carmen}, title = {Distributed and Localized Model Predictive Control}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/6pje-yd82}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06012023-203113987}, abstract = {The increasing presence of large-scale distributed systems highlights the need for scalable control strategies where only local communication is required. Moreover, in safety-critical systems it is imperative that such control strategies handle constraints in the presence of disturbances and enjoy theoretical and performance guarantees. In response to this need, we present the Distributed and Localized Model Predictive Control (DLMPC) algorithm for large-scale linear systems. DLMPC is a distributed closed-loop model predictive control (MPC) scheme wherein only local state and model information needs to be exchanged between subsystems for the computation and implementation of control actions. The resulting distributed algorithms tackle various types of additive disturbances and enjoy recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability guarantees that introduce minimal conservatism and can be computed in an offline fashion without adding to the computational burden. We also provide analysis and guarantees on the global performance of DLMPC, and demonstrate that in cases where the underlying topology of the system is sparse (as is the case in most large-scale networks), the inclusion of local communication constraints does not result in a suboptimal solution. Moreover, we show that when no noise is present, this algorithm can be extended to the purely data-driven case where all previous guarantees hold and the need for a model is fully replaced by past-trajectory data. We show that the amount of data needed for our synthesis problem is independent of the size of the global system. Lastly, we explore the potential of DLMPC for hardware accelerated implementation in GPU by exploiting the fact that the structure of the DLMPC problem captures some of the limitations of GPU computations. In all algorithmic and theoretical results presented in this thesis, only local information exchange is necessary, and computational complexity is independent of the global system size. DLMPC is the first MPC algorithm that allows for the scalable, efficient and data-driven computation and implementation of distributed closed-loop control policies and enjoys theoretical guarantees.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Doyle, John Comstock}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/jn6n-x368, author = Gennady}, title {Stochastic Foundations for Single-Cell RNA Sequencing}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/jn6n-x368}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06022023-194724728}, abstract = { Single-cell RNA sequencing, which quantifies cell transcriptomes, has seen widespread adoption, accompanied by proliferation of analysis methods.

Adopting a synthetic biology approach, we aim to unravel the core principles of multicellular spatial patterning by designing and reconstituting it in tissue-cultured cell lines. The reaction-diffusion mechanism, as an established paradigm, has successfully elucidated and forecasted pattern formation across varying scales and species. However, the potential for reconstituting synthetic reaction-diffusion patterns using unconventional reaction-diffusion elements within mammalian cell cultures has been insufficiently explored, thus leaving a gap in our comprehension of how spatial periodic patterns could be generated. The simplest reaction-diffusion systems are thought to necessitate a minimum of two morphogens to generate periodic patterns. In contrast, with the help of mathematical modeling, we illustrate that a simpler circuit, comprising only a single diffusible morphogen, can adequately produce long-range, spatially periodic patterns. These patterns propagate outward from transient initiating perturbations and remain stable after the disturbance is removed. Moreover, introducing an additional bistable intracellular feedback or operation on a growing cell lattice can enhance the robustness of the patterning against noise. Concurrently, we reconstruct the Turing pattern in mammalian cell culture utilizing a bottom-up approach. We construct a synthetic circuit based on two signaling pathways. After validation of each circuit component, we exhibit the spatial pattern formation driven by a synthetic reaction-diffusion circuit within the mammalian cell line. This adaptable circuit facilitates us to adjust circuit parameters or implement various boundary conditions, thereby revealing the impact of these alterations on patterning dynamics.

However, since the early 1980s, there have been numerous attempts to construct quantum field theories where time evolution is non-unitary. Some of these endeavors aimed to address the issue of black hole information loss, as non-unitary evolution does not necessarily require information preservation. Some wanted to use it as a modification of quantum mechanics to allow objective collapse. Some wanted to construct classical-quantum gravity which could serve as an alternative to quantum gravity. I embarked on a similar path, attempting to construct a Lorentz covariant non-unitary quantum field theory. At a certain point, I believed we were making significant progress. However, I gradually realized that our construction faced serious problems. We took a lot of assumptions and results from unitary quantum field theory for granted, and used them without justification. After struggling with it for a long time, I decide to make a complete reversal and prove that non-unitary quantum field theories fundamentally conflict with Lorentz covariance. There are three approaches to constructing a Lorentz covariant non-unitary QFT. The first approach involves constructing a theory based on unitary quantum field theory, where a system is coupled to an environment. If we only consider the system and trace out the environment, the resulting equation of motion appears non-unitary. In this case, unitarity emerges as an emergent property. The second approach is to propose a theory from scratch where the time evolution is fundamentally non-unitary, described by the Lindblad master equation. Both in the emergent and fundamentally non-unitary theories, the dynamics are intended to be Lorentz covariant. The third approach employs the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism to construct a path integral, and examines the symmetry of the Keldysh action within the path integral. It is assumed that, similar to quantum field theory, the non-unitary theory will possess the same symmetry as the Keldysh action. Regrettably, none of these three classes of theories prove successful. This thesis thoroughly analyzes the issues associated with these three constructions. The most significant problems include: 1, The fundamental assumption that the quantum fields (and their excitations) form a unitary representation of the Lorentz group is invalid, and they cannot form a non-unitary representation either. 2, The system Hamiltonian in the Lindblad equation is ill-defined and does not transform as the first component of a Lorentz four-vector. 3, Even if we overlook the aforementioned inconsistencies, the dynamics fail to produce expected results when applied to phenomena such as particle decay, as they exhibit a preferred reference frame. 4, The symmetry of the Keldysh action does not guarantee the corresponding symmetry in the dynamics. Invariant Keldysh actions can correspond to non-covariant equations of motion. In conclusion, the Lorentz symmetry is incompatible with non-unitary quantum field theories.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Preskill, John P.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/thmn-7h07, author = {Shi, Yanlong}, title = {Assembly of Intermediate-Mass Black Holes Along Star Formation}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/thmn-7h07}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06072023-051240339}, abstract = { Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are poorly observed and not as well understood as stellar-mass black holes (BHs) and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, they can be important to complement the formation scenario of massive BHs other than stellar-mass ones and reconcile the existence of some high-energy sources in the Universe. The thesis studies the assembly of IMBHs in star-forming giant molecular clouds (GMCs) of 5 - 500 pc and 10 - 10\u00b9 M_, which are realistic environments for some scenarios of IMBH formation, including runaway collisions in dense star clusters and super-Eddington accretion onto 100 M_ BH seeds like remnants of massive stars. We first inspect the runaway-collision scenario where IMBHs form as remnants of \"quasi-stars\" after stellar collisions. Density profiles of young massive clusters can be important for this scenario but are missing observational hints. We measure density profiles of cluster populations in star-formation simulations in GMCs and conduct both analytic derivations and Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate the mass of the quasi-star in different clusters. The analytic expression is in approximate agreement with observations. The following three chapters are about the super-Eddington accretion scenario. The first question to solve is the availability of super-Eddington accretion in turbulent and star-forming environments. We run simulations of BH accretion in GMCs with star formation based on FIRE-2 physics. We find that dense clumps generated by stellar feedback and turbulence can feed BHs at high accretion rates. We also conclude that GMCs with high surface densities are favored for super- or hyper-Eddington accretion, in which self-gravity dominates over stellar feedback. After convincing the availability of super-Eddington accretion in dense GMCs, we study the self-regulation of BH accretion through its feedback. We construct a sub-grid model of BH accretion and feedback, including radiation, winds/jets, and relativistic diffusive cosmic rays. We find that super-Eddington accretion is still achievable with proper radiative feedback models but is challenged by BH mechanical feedback. We also quantify BH feedback effects and find that they can be analytically explained with momentum-driven arguments. Moreover, we study the effects of multiple sub-grid parameters and BH feedback's impact on star formation in GMCs. Finally, we study another mode of accretion due to steady gas inflow towards BHs. This complements the missing interaction between stars and BHs in previous studies. Along with star formation, star clusters form and merge hierarchically, creating deep potential wells to capture BHs. At the late stage of the simulation, a 10 pc disk structures form.

I further found that most of the PCA oxidation activi-ty depends on electron flux through the quinone/quinol pool but can be driven by certain terminal reductase complexes when no quinones are available, particularly in the case of ni-trate reductases. Every bacterial strain I tested catalyzed PCA oxidation when provided the appropriate TEA. My described mechanism for bacterial PCA oxidation is generalizable and implies that this previously undocumented phenomenon should occur wherever PCA is produced in rhizosphere environments.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Newman, Dianne K.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/fpmm-a552, author = {Hirokawa, Soichi}, title = {Dynamics of Protein-Mediated Polymer Coupling and their Implications in Antibody Production and Emergent Patterning}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/fpmm-a552}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:08252022-153300158}, abstract = { Proteins serve a wide range of functions in and out of the cell, from signaling and gene regulation to transport and structural reinforcement. These functions are usually carried out from interactions with other molecules in the surrounding medium such as other proteins, small molecules, or DNA. One such class of proteins are what I will call polymer-coupling proteins: these proteins intentionally link identical polymers or two regions of the same polymer together so that their coupled interactions critically affect the state of the biological system. A vast array of such proteins exist in nature with roles such as the looping of DNA to physically inhibit the expression of a gene or the formation of the cytoskeleton which provides a cell with its shape. In this thesis, I use in vitro experimental methods to explore two cases of coupling proteins and understand their roles not only in reorganizing their complementary polymers but influencing the final state of their respective systems. In Chapter 2, I examine the starting process for the assembly of an antibody-encoding gene in developing immune cells. Motivated by data suggesting that some antibodies are less likely to be made than others, I explore how the early steps of constructing an antibody-encoding gene affect this uneven frequency of assembly. To initiate recombination, the recombination-activating gene (RAG) protein complex simultaneously binds and cuts two well-recognized sequences neighboring two antibody-encoding gene segments in order to allow other proteins to combine these exposed segments together. The sequences to which the RAG protein performs its binding and cutting functions have certain identifiable sequence patterns but can still vary. Through a single-molecule experimental method known as tethered particle motion (TPM) I show how changes to the binding site sequence can enhance or diminish the propensity of the RAG protein to bind and cut the DNA and thus explore the consequences of these altered interactions in the unequal selection for certain antibody gene segments over others. In Chapter 3, I turn to questions of the emergence of order from self-organization in biological systems. From the molecular to the population scale, biology constantly demonstrates that with an injection of energy, systems can be driven out of equilibrium and allow for the organization of its constituents. A case of such organization in cells is the coupling of microtubules by motor proteins to create and maintain the mitotic spindle, a critical biological architecture for ensuring that each cell obtains a copy of the genome during division. In vitro experiments that exploit similar motor-microtubule interactions have become a convenient way to identify the effects of perturbing a key player such as motor properties or boundary conditions of the system on the spatiotemporal extent of organization. However, in many instances, the dynamics under which such cytoskeletal systems reduce their entropy over the course of creating order have not been carefully examined in experimental systems. Here, I use engineered light-dimerizable motors that can give rise to the formation of a highly connected network that compacts to form a dense, organized structure, and through the use of a noninvasive imaging technique observe how the polymers that make up the network continually reorganize in the bulk during a global contraction of the network.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Phillips, Robert B.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/xz1z-zw28, author = {Guth, Daniel Robert}, title = {Essays in Health Economics}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/xz1z-zw28}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05242023-072837100}, abstract = { This thesis consists of three health economics papers, two studying the effectiveness of policy interventions on the opioid epidemic, and one on the effects of air pollution on school absences. The first two chapters were coauthored with Shiyu Zhang, a former Caltech graduate student. The first chapter examines the market for prescription opioids following the OxyContin Reformulation, an event that made OxyContin harder to misuse. Using detailed prescription opioid sales data from 2006 to 2014, we show that event did not reduce overdose deaths but led individuals to switch to generic oxycodone as a substitute for OxyContin. The second chapter examines geographic spillover effects from state prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs). We show that these policies reduce prescription opioid sales and opioid overdose deaths in the state they are enacted in. However, because they only track opioids sold locally, these programs induce individuals to drive across state lines to purchase opioids and avoid these regulations. The final chapter examines the effects of air pollution on NYC school absences using daily changes in wind direction. I show that PM2.5 and Ozone concentrations are strongly influenced by wind patterns, and exposure to these two pollutants causes detectable increases in absences over the following two days. Reductions in PM2.5 pollution over time have prevented approximately 381,000 absences annually in NYC which increases school funding by $19 million.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Rosenthal, Jean-Laurent}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/ks5c-zn93, author = {Li, Xiang}, title = {Topics in Gravitational Wave Physics: Quantum Theory for Detector Improvement and High-Precision Modeling of Binary Black Hole Ringdown Waveform}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/ks5c-zn93}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:11022022-054918241}, abstract = { This thesis covers topics in gravitational wave physics, including optomechanical measurement theory, novel detection schemes (PT-symmetric interferometer, matter-wave interferometer), and modeling of binary black hole ringdown waveform. Measurements are accomplished through the interaction between signal and measurement devices. Identifying the nature of couplings is an important step in designing setups for specific applications. In Chapter II, we develop a general framework based on the system Hamiltonian to unambiguously classify optomechanical couplings. We add the new type, ``coherent coupling'', where the mechanical oscillation couples several non-degenerate optical modes supported in the cavity. We give examples of different couplings, discuss in detail one particular case of the coherent coupling, and demonstrate its benefits in optomechanical experiments. Our general framework allows the design of optomechanical systems in a methodological way, to precisely exploit the strengths of some particular optomechanical couplings. Conventional resonant detectors are subject to bandwidth-peak sensitivity trade-off, which can be traced back to the quantum Cramer-Rao Bound. Chapters III and IV in this thesis are devoted to the study of PT-symmetric amplifier, which is a stable quantum amplification scheme enabled by two-mode non-degenerate parametric amplification. In Chapter III, we study stability and sensitivity improvements for laser-interferometric gravitational-wave detectors and microwave cavity axion detectors, under Hamiltonian formalism adopting single-mode and resolved-sideband approximations. In Chapter IV, we go beyond these approximations and consider realistic parameters in the optomechanical realization of PT-symmetric interferometer for gravitational detection. We show that the main conclusion concerning stability remains intact using Nyquist analysis and a detailed time-domain simulation. The detection method of gravitational waves is developed with linear quantum measurement theory. In Chapter V, we extend the usage of this theory to another kind of measurement device \u2014 matter-wave interferometers, which have been widely discussed as an important platform for many high-precision measurements. This theory allows us to consider fluctuations from both atoms and light and leads to a detailed analysis of back-action (of light back onto the atoms) and its effect on dynamics and measurement noise in atom interferometry. From this analysis, we obtain a Standard Quantum Limit for matter-wave interferometry. We also give a comparison between the LIGO detector and matter-wave interferometer from the perspective of quantum measurement. In Chapter VI, we switch focus from measurement to gravitational wave sources. Specifically, we study high-frequency gravitational radiation from the ringdown of a binary black hole merger. We study the high-precision modeling on both temporal and spatial features of ringdown wave to propose a more complete test of General Relativity. We show that spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics, rather than spin-weighted spherical harmonics, better represent ringdown angular patterns. We also study the correlation between progenitor binary properties and the excitation of quasinormal modes, including higher-order angular modes, overtones, prograde and retrograde modes.

When this regulation breaks down in diseases, genetic access to the nervous system is critical for therapeutic intervention. However, access to the nervous system remains difficult, reflecting the critical need for development of effective and non-invasive gene delivery vectors across species. By applying directed evolution approach, we identified 2 capsids, AAV-MaCPNS1 and AAV-MaCPNS2, which efficiently transduced the PNS in rodents following intravenous administration. Combining with rational optimization, we also identified AAV-X1 capsid family, which transduce brain endothelial cells specifically and efficiently following systemic administration in wild-type mice with diverse genetic backgrounds and rats. Some previously-engineered AAVs that target the nervous system fail to translate across non-human primate (NHP). We thus also further tested our novel vectors across species and showed that AAV-MaCPNS1/2 efficiently transduced both the PNS and CNS in NHPs. superior the CNS in rhesus macaques and ex vivo human brain slices although the endothelial tropism is not conserved across species. With these enhanced systemic AAVs, we wanted to explore whether they could enable neuronal recording and modulation which has been challenging with the nature AAV serotypes. We used AAV-MaCPNS1 to systemically deliver the neuronal sensor jGCaMP8s to record calcium signal dynamics in nodose ganglia. We observed specific nodose neuronal response to physiological modulation in the gut. Furthermore, neuronal actuator neuronal modulation and create a model of pain. The functional utility of the novel systemic vectors demonstrated here provide a non-invasive approach to better explore the nervous system, which would lead to better therapeutic intervention. To this end, we also demonstrated that the X1 capsids can be used to genetically engineer the blood-brain barrier by transforming the mouse brain vasculature into a functional biofactory for production of therapeutic agents for CNS. We showed that vasculature-secreted Hevin (a synaptogenic protein), whose coding sequence is delivered by X1 vectors, rescued synaptic deficits in a mouse model. AAV repeated dosing could be favorable for certain therapeutic applications, however, neutralizing antibody generated following the first injection creates major obstacle for second injection. We explored whether serotype switching with 2 AAV capsids that have a distinguished neutralizing antibody profile could be a potential solution. To this end, we firstly showed that the X1 capsid modifications translate from AAV9 to other serotypes such as AAV1 and AAV-DJ. We then combined the different engineered serotype to enable serotype switching for sequential AAV administration in mice, showing the first AAV-delivered receptor for the second AAV could boost its CNS targeting.

The early part of the thesis focuses on understanding the link between cage size/dimension and acidity (i.e., acid site density and strength) in the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) reaction. This relationship between cage size and acidity, once identified and investigated, is exploited in the latter parts of the thesis to rationally design materials that are able to steer the light olefins product distribution toward either more ethylene or propylene in a significant improvement over SAPO-34 (CHA), the commercial catalyst. In Chapters 2, 44 zeolites and silicoaluminophosphates (SAPOs) belonging to five frameworks (AEI, CHE, LEV, SWY, and ERI) with a wide range of Si/Al=4-31 and Si/(Al+P)=0.04-0.3, are synthesized and characterized using a myriad of techniques. Their MTO behavior is then systematically investigated to rationalize the effect of cage dimensions on the olefins product distribution as a function of acid site density and strength. The results from this study show that changes in acid site density and strength play a secondary role to the dominating influence of cage architecture on product distribution in AEI- and CHA-type molecular sieves. Decreasing the cage size, in going from AEI and CHA to LEV, SWY, and ERI, however, results in substantial changes in the ethylene-to-propylene ratio (E/P) as a function of acidity. These changes are attributed to differences in the identity and concentration of the hydrocarbon-pool (HP) species that form, particularly in early stages of the reaction. In Chapters 3 and 4, ERI-type molecular sieves (e.g., SSZ-98, UZM-12, ERI-type zeolites, and SAPO-17) are thoroughly investigated as promising methanol-to-ethylene materials due to their narrow cage size. Specifically, numerous ERI-type molecular sieves are synthesized using several organic structure-directing agents (OSDAs) with varied Si/Al or Si/T-atoms ratios. The list of ERI-related materials synthesized and tested in MTO included a new disordered SAPO, denoted as CIT-16P, which upon thermal treatment in air transforms to SAPO-17 (ERI). The reaction results show that decreasing the Si/Al (or increasing the Si/T) ratio, irrespective of other material properties, improves the E/P of ERI-type molecular in reveal that the rapid formation of cyclic intermediates and the shift in their composition toward less-methylated methylbenzenes and methylnaphthalenes are found to be key to enhancing the ethylene selectivity in ERI-type molecular sieves. In Chapter 5, several SAT-type molecular sieves are investigated as promising methanol-to-propylene catalysts. This effort entails the synthesis of CIT-17, an SAT SAPO-type molecular sieve, which is isostructural to STA-2 (MgAPO-SAT). Following the successful synthesis of CIT-17, MTO of several SAT-type molecular sieves (MgAPO, CoAPO, and SAPO) are investigated in MTO. The combination of low acidity of CIT-17 and unique structural features of the narrow SAT-cage lead to a catalytic pathway and mechanism that predominantly favors propylene (propylene-to-ethylene ratios (P/E) of 2-4.2; propylene selectivity of 40-50%). Indeed, CIT-17 achieves one of the highest P/E ratio values reported for this class of materials.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Davis, Mark E.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/9rvr-rr55, Riley}, of the piRNA Pathway to Regulate Neural Crest Specification}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/9rvr-rr55}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:01232023-192745187}, abstract = { The piRNA pathway has persisted throughout evolution as an essential regulatory pathway to protect genomic integrity in the metazoan germline. It achieves this through the repression of transposable elements, or \"selfish genes,\" which would otherwise jump throughout the genome unchecked, causing genomic instability and infertility. While transposable elements are generally deleterious in nature, their persistence in our genome remains an important driver of evolution, both as an agent of mutation and source of raw genetic material. Thus, a delicate balance must be struck to both maintain genomic integrity for the next generation but still enable enough mutation to allow for adaptation. The arms race between the ever-adapting piRNA pathway and its transposon targets provides this balance, and for a long time the piRNA pathway was considered to be germline specific, since that is where both transposon and piRNA pathway activity is highest. It has since become clear that the piRNA pathway is also active in somatic tissue of several invertebrate species, and may even target host genes in some. Whether the piRNA pathway plays a role outside of the germline in vertebrates, however, has remained elusive. In this thesis, we demonstrate that the piRNA pathway is active in a vertebrate somatic cell type, the chick neural crest, where it has been co-opted into the gene regulatory network to repress the transposon-derived gene, ERNI. ERNI, in turn, supresses protein is downregulated upon neural crest specification. Thus, the piRNA pathway functions to maintain Sox2 expression in the neural plate border stem cell niche, protecting its proliferative abilities and setting the timing of neural crest specification. We also provide preliminary evidence that the neural crest piRNA pathway might be conserved in other vertebrate species, and that two highly conserved transcription factors regulate its expression in the chick neural crest. Our work provides mechanistic insight into a novel function of the piRNA pathway as a regulator of somatic development in vertebrates, and raises the possibility that this ancient pathway may play a more significant role in evolution and transposon co-option by host genomes than previously thought.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/zkpd-bq33, author = {Learsch, Robert Whitson}, title = Control in Aqueous and Hydrocarbon Fluids: Long, End-Associative Polymers Dictate Fluid Behavior Under Elongational Flows}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/zkpd-bq33}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05102023-041835603}, abstract = { Modifying elongational flows seen in sprayed mists, turbulent flows, and droplet spreading and retraction following impact, is of interest in diverse industries, including agriculture and aviation. Long flexible polymers (with fully extended lengths 1 to 10 \u00b5m) modify the elongational flow behavior of a fluid to which they are added. At low concentrations (1 to 10% of their overlap concentrations), their effect is mild under shear flow (shear viscosity increases < 50%), but dramatic under elongational flows (extensional viscosity increases 300). These long polymers are not widely used in practice because they degrade under strong flows, such as passing through pumps and filters, that typically precede spray. Pairwise end-associative polymers can overcome this limitation. Pulling apart non-covalent associative bonds under such strong flow conditions relieves the tension along the polymer backbone. The pairwise end-associative polymers that are effective in mist control and drag reduction are individually short enough to avoid chain scission in flows that would break long covalent polymers, yet long enough that 6 to 8 associative polymers connected end-to-end create supermolecules that are as effective as their long covalent counterparts. This thesis systematically compares the effect of long covalent and long end-associative polymers on the fluid's extensional flow properties and the polymers' performance in controlling droplet impact and spray breakup. To measure the elongational flow properties, I implemented and enhanced the Dripping onto Substrate Extensional Rheometry (DoSER) technique (Chapter 2) and applied it to long covalent polymers (Chapter 3) and to end-to-end associative polymers (Chapter 4). Preparing solutions in which the polymers negligibly affect the interfacial tension (< 10%) allows us to explore the relationship between extensional flow properties and droplet impact (Chapter 5) and spray (Chapter 6). By combining the quantitative measurements of extensional viscosity and extensional relaxation time with the corresponding behavior in impact and spray, I correlate the structure of polymers to the solution behavior in droplet rebound and spray breakup.

The macroscopic behavior of such systems is governed by the behavior at the grain-scale, including force transfer between adjacent grains. The correlation between continuum behavior and interparticle forces in granular systems is yet to be fully understood. For a saturated or unsaturated granular system under external load, it is important to decode stress partition and transfer in the solid, fluid, and gas phases. In the meantime, the presence of the fluid phase and gas phase greatly increases the difficulty of measuring interparticle forces in opaque granular systems. This thesis describes the theoretical and experimental works on interparticle forces and effective stresses in two types of granular systems: i) fully saturated granular media, and ii) unsaturated granular media. The first part of the thesis focuses on the direct measurement of interparticle forces and the experimental validation of the concept of effective stress introduced by Karl Terzaghi. The grain-scale expression of Terzaghi's effective stress for saturated granular media under small deformation and quasi-static state is derived using stress decomposition and balance of forces and moments. For the experimental validation of the analytical solution, an experimental setup was designed to study 2D saturated rubber rod packing under classic 1D consolidation. A hybrid optical-mechanical method based on the Granular element method (GEM) and Digital image correlation (DIC) is applied. The interparticle forces are directly computed from 2D strain distribution of the grains, and the effective stress is calculated using the grain-scale forces. With pore water pressure measured by a pressure sensor, the summation of the effective stress and the pore water pressure is then compared with the external load applied in the 1D consolidation experiment, which is the core of Terzaghi's principle. The 1D consolidation experiment is also compared with the 1D consolidation model and matches the results from Discrete element simulations (DEM). The second part of the thesis investigates the measurement of interparticle forces in more complex unsaturated granular systems consisting of solid, pore fluid, and pore air phases. In the case of quasi-static, point contact, and low saturation, an expression for the partition of stress is derived as a function of interparticle forces. To simplify the expression of the stress partition equation, capillary bridges, which are integral parts of unsaturated systems under low saturation condition, are simulated numerically using 2D finite element method (FEM) to further understand the influence of gravity on pore fluid clusters. As the original GEM for fully saturated systems focuses on interparticle interactions, the GEM is further developed for unsaturated systems based on the original GEM and considering capillary forces. Finally, a hybrid optical-mechanical approach combined with the granular element method (GEM) is developed to extract interparticle forces in a classic 1D consolidation experiment. The partition of stresses is determined by experimental results and compared with the analytical results. The major contributions of this thesis are the theoretical derivation and experimental validation of the link between the grain-scale properties (interparticle forces, branch vectors, etc.) and the stress transfer in fully saturated and unsaturated systems.

To construct touch percepts, the brain integrates information from tactile mechanoreceptors with inputs from other senses and top-down variables such as attention and task context. In this thesis, we investigate how these factors influence neural activity within the somatosensory system at different stages of tactile processing, using electrophysiological and behavioral data from a human tetraplegic participant implanted with microelectrode arrays. First, we find that neural responses to imagined touches of different types are decodable in the primary somatosensory cortex, ventral premotor cortex, and the supra-marginal gyrus, and these responses remain stable over many months. Following this analysis, the primary somatosensory cortex is explored in greater depth to better characterize early-stage cortical tactile processing. Touches to the arm and finger are examined during a passive task, in a variety of conditions including visually observed physical touches, physical touches without vision, and visual touches without physical contact. Analysis of the two touch locations suggests that touch encoding in primary somatosensory cortex may be less rigid than in the classical topographic view. Additionally, this experiment uncovers a modulatory effect of vision in the primary somatosensory cortex when it is paired with a physical touch, but no effect of vision alone. Finally, we investigate how visual information impacts artificial tactile sensations, which can be elicited using intra-cortical microstimulation to the primary somatosensory cortex. The ability to elicit reliable, naturalistic artificial touch sensations is vital to the implementation of a tactile brain-machine interface, which would benefit patients with spinal cord injury and others with somatosensory impairments. We find that visual information biases the qualitative percept of artificial stimulation towards an interpretation that is visually plausible. The temporal binding window between vision and stimulation is found to be larger when visual information is biologically relevant, suggesting that the brain's ability to causally relate artificial stimulation to visual cues depends on visual context. Additionally, recordings from the primary somatosensory cortex indicate that visual information relevant to artificial stimulation is represented across contexts, during an active task. The effect of task on the responsiveness of the primary somatosensory cortex to visual information points to a role of attention in mediating early cortical tactile processing. In combination, the findings presented in this thesis provide insight into the basic neuroscience of how tactile experiences are constructed by the brain, suggesting that early tactile processing is influenced by multisensory, contextual factors.

In recent years, modern wide-field time domain sky surveys, such as the optical Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) X-ray satellite, have opened up the discovery space of fast-evolving transients and enabled population analysis. In this thesis, I conducted a series of observational studies to understand the inner workings, environments, and demographics of high-energy transients powered by black holes. The first part of my thesis presents detailed studies on AT2019wey and AT2020mrf \u2014 two transients discovered by SRG. First, I established that AT2019wey is a Galactic XRB with a low-mass companion star, and provided evidence that its central compact object is a black hole. Next, I demonstrated that AT2020mrf is a massive star explosion likely powered by fall-back accretion onto a newly formed black hole (with a rapidly spinning magnetar as an alternative power source). My work supports the idea that luminous fast blue optical transients form a rare class of engine-driven stellar explosions. The second part of my thesis concerns TDEs.

In both objects, using the NuSTAR and NICER X-ray telescopes, I identified novel TDE spectral features, which probe massive black hole accretion and jet launching. Additionally, using ZTF, I constructed the largest flux-limited sample of 33 TDEs, which enabled robust estimates of the optical TDE luminosity functions, host galaxy preference, and the black hole mass function. The emerging functional forms resulting from the large sample size represent significant advancements. My work lays a foundation for both TDE population studies with future sky surveys and theoretical inquiries.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = R.}, {Animal Regeneration and its Loss: the Mouse as a Model of Limited Regeneration}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/wedb-2f55}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05292023-182121722}, abstract = { In this dissertation, we explore animal regeneration through a comparative evolutionary-developmental framework. In Chapter 1, we review animal regeneration and its loss through examining broad developmental and physiological factors that correlate with regenerative ability. We also highlight the mouse as a model of regeneration loss, examining the limited regeneration of the digit tip and the heart. For each context, we discuss how these regenerative processes occur, the physiological and molecular factors involved, and previous attempts to induce or improve the regenerative response. In Chapter 2, we explore the possibility of inducing regeneration in non-regenerating systems. Along with experiments in the jellyfish Aurelia coerulea, (formerly A. aurita sp. 1 strain) and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, we find that supplementation with the amino acid L-leucine and sucrose induce appendage regeneration across these highly evolutionarily-diverged organisms. We discuss how this intervention highlights the conserved role of energetic parameters in regeneration, and how surpassing nutrient-based limitations may unlock regenerative responses in diverse contexts. In Chapter 3, we characterize the derivatives of cardiac neural crest cells (CNCCs) in the hearts of neonatal mice at P1 and >P7. We confirm previous work on the diverse cardiac derivatives resulting from CNCCs, and provide additional evidence for CNCC-derived cardiomyocytes, a contribution still contested in current literature. We also demonstrate how CNCC derivatives form a distinct age-related developmental trajectory in the heart, and discuss how these changes may affect cardiac physiology and relate to the loss of neonatal heart regeneration. Finally, in Chapter 4, we propose future directions based on the work carried out in Chapter 3. While CNCCs have explicitly been studied in the context of heart regeneration in zebrafish, their role in neonatal mouse heart regeneration has not been explored. First, we suggest further investigation into the differences between CNCC-derived and non-CNCC derived CMs, to see if their proliferative ability and molecular profile show different temporal dynamics over the course of embryonic and early postnatal stages. Then, to examine all CNCC-derived cell types in regenerating P1 and non-regenerating P8 hearts, we propose a single-nuclei RNA-sequencing experiment to better resolve questions about how the myocardial lineage interacts with nonmyocytes, and to capture the full extent of potential cardiomyocyte decline postnatally. Lastly, to understand how CNCC derivatives influence endogenous heart regeneration, we design a dual Cre and (r)tTA driver system in transgenic mice to perform a conditional ablation experiment of CNCCs in a cryoinjury model of neonatal heart regeneration.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Bronner, Marianne E.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/qs6v-5d67, author = {Hurt, Robert Cooper}, title = {Engineering of Second-Generation Acoustic Reporter Genes}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/qs6v-5d67}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05192023-001330664}, abstract = { A major outstanding challenge in the fields of biological research, synthetic biology, and cell-based medicine is visualizing the functions of natural and engineered cells noninvasively inside opaque organisms. Ultrasound imaging has the potential to address this challenge as a widely available technique with a tissue penetration of several centimeters and spatial resolution below 100 \u00b5m. Recently, the first genetically encoded acoustic reporters were developed based on bacterial gas vesicles (GVs) to link ultrasound signals to molecular and cellular function. However, the properties of these first-generation acoustic reporter genes (ARGs) resulted in limited sensitivity and specificity for imaging gene expression in vivo. The goal of my thesis work has been to engineer second-generation ARGs with improved acoustic and expression phenotypes compared to the existing first-generation constructs. I took two complementary engineering approaches to developing these constructs: homolog screening and directed evolution, sometimes referred to as the \"nature and nurture\" of protein engineering. The resulting constructs offer major qualitative and quantitative improvements, including much stronger ultrasound contrast, the ability to produce nonlinear signals distinguishable from background tissue in vivo, stable long-term expression, and compatibility with in vitro multiplexed imaging. In collaboration with others in the lab, we demonstrate the capabilities of these next-generation ARGs by imaging in situ gene expression in mouse models of breast cancer and tumor-homing therapeutic bacteria, noninvasively revealing the unique spatial distributions of tumor growth and colonization by therapeutic cells in living subjects and providing real-time guidance for interventions such as needle biopsies. This thesis is organized as follows: in the first two chapters, I introduce the key background needed to understand both the importance and properties of ARGS, and how they have been and could be engineered. In the next two chapters, I detail specific efforts to engineer them\u2014one involving the construction of a high-throughput, semi-automated setup for acoustic phenotyping of cells and its application to ARG directed evolution, and another involving the screening of several GV cluster homologs to identify ones suitable for use as improved ARGs. Finally, I conclude with insights gleaned from these two ARG engineering projects and suggestions for future ones. The approaches, results, and ideas presented in this thesis represent the current state-of-the-art in ARG engineering and application. While recent technology development in this field has unlocked exciting new use cases for ARGs in noninvasive biological imaging, most of their potential for basic science and disease diagnosis and treatment has yet to be realized.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Shapiro, Mikhail G.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/yhws-0f08, author year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/yhws-0f08}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:01052023-230400021}, abstract = { Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) near the magic angle exhibits a wide variety of correlated and topological phases such as superconductivity, correlated insulators, and orbital ferromagnetism. We show using electrical transport measurements that adding a layer of tungsten diselenide in proximity to twisted bilayer graphene stabilizes superconductivity to twist angles significantly below the magic angle despite the disappearance of correlated insulators and insulators at full moir\u00e9 filling. These findings-along with our report of a relationship between superconductivity and symmetry breaking Fermi surface reconstruction-suggest constraints on theories of the origin of superconductivity in TBG. In the context of this TBG-tungsten diselenide system, we study how the correlated phases evolve over a wide twist angle range and classify them into a hierarchy based on where they occur relative to the magic angle (or where bands have been maximally flattened). While effects such as orbital ferromagnetism near one electron per moir\u00e9 unit cell and gapped correlated insulators only exist in close proximity to the magic angle, superconductivity and high-temperature cascade transitions survive in a wider twist angle range. We also analyze the structures of twisted trilayer, quadrilayer, and pentalayer graphene (and all proximitized to tungsten diselenide) near their respective theoretical magic angles, revealing robust electron- and hole-side superconductivity in each heterostructure. We additionally find previously unreported insulating states in twisted trilayer and quadrilayer graphene along with an enlarged filling range of superconductivity in pentalayer. Our studies on twisted graphene multilayers beyond two layers allow us to generalize the correlated physics found in TBG and consider the role of the additional bands introduced. In the last part of this thesis, we measure the two-dimensional topological insulator candidate system InAs/GaSb with added stoichiometric impurities. Previous studies in pure InAs/GaSb structures have revealed low bulk resistivity and edge states that arise from trivial effects which can be easily mistaken for topological effects. Due, in part, to the strain effects of Indium impurities added to GaSb, our results show high bulk resistivity. We also, due to the wide gate-tunability in our devices, are able to measure the expected spin-orbit-split valence band structure. Our development of highly tunable InAs/GaSb-derivative structures paves the way for another look at two-dimensional topological insulator behavior in these systems and for their integration into superconducting devices.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Nadj-Perge, Stevan}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/h50w-p058, author = {Marken, John Paul}, title = {Experimental and Theoretical Frameworks for Enabling Environmental Synthetic Biology}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/h50w-p058}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05292023-181810775}, abstract = { Although the field of synthetic biology has made great advances toward becoming a mature engineering discipline over its first quarter-century, the vast majority of these efforts have focused on improving the design and performance of genetic circuits intended to operate in well-controlled, laboratory settings. The goal of safely deploying engineered microbes to reliably perform their programmed functions in natural, uncontrolled environments begets its own set of foundational challenges that will require new frameworks that shift our existing mindsets about the way we engineer biological systems. These frameworks, because they focus on enabling system properties that were not priorities for conventional synthetic biology research, can constitute a new field of research which I refer to as environmental synthetic biology. The central priorities of environmental synthetic biology include (1) developing and characterizing effective ways to introduce engineered biological systems into natural environments, (2) ensuring that the performance of these systems can remain robust and predictable in the face of environmental variability, (3) developing and characterizing ways to control and monitor the behavior of an engineered system after deployment in an inaccessible environment, and (4) developing fundamental architectures to enable autonomous system operation and adaptation within environmental contexts. In this thesis, I present the initial steps towards the development of three frame- works that address these priorities of environmental synthetic biology. The first framework, described in Chapter 2, demonstrates the potential of using DNA as the substrate for addressable and adaptable intercellular communication in engineered populations. This enables the ability to one day create multicellular systems that can autonomously reconfigure their own architecture in the face of changing environmental conditions. The second framework, described in Chapters 3 and 4, presents a new mathematical representation of biomolecular reaction systems that enables geometric bounds on the space of possible behaviors under all possible configurations for a particular system architecture. The third, ongoing framework emphasizes the importance of explicitly incorporating the physiological state of the host cell into the assessment of a genetic circuit's behavior by exploring the impact of cellular growth arrest on transcriptional response curves.

This photoelectrochemical deposition process, generates highly anisotropic, periodic lamellar features resulting in the capability to fabricate nanostructured features over macroscopic areas. The process is lithography-free and uses no templates or directing agents of any kind and relies solely on the incident illumination to direct semiconductor growth. In this thesis, the nanophotonic phenomena and emergent synergistic absorption that drives the inorganic phototropic growth process was investigated using unconstrained and confined susbtrates.

Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a surveillance pathway responsible for detecting PTC containing transcripts. While the molecular mechanisms governing mRNA degradation have been extensively studied, the fate of the nascent protein product remains largely uncharacterized. In part 1 of this thesis, we use a fluorescent reporter system in mammalian cells to reveal a selective degradation pathway specifically targeting the protein product of an NMD mRNA. We show that this process is post-translational, and dependent on the ubiquitin proteasome system. To systematically uncover factors involved in NMD-linked protein quality control, we conducted genome-wide flow cytometry-based screens. Our screens recovered known NMD factors, but suggested protein degradation did not depend on the canonical ribosome-quality control (RQC) pathway. A subsequent arrayed screen demonstrated that protein and mRNA branches of NMD rely on a shared recognition event. Our results establish the existence of a targeted pathway for nascent protein degradation from PTC containing mRNAs, and provides a reference for the field to identify and characterize required factors. Part 2: The Commons Cell Atlas Current cell atlas projects aim to curate representative datasets, cell-types, and marker genes for tissues across an organism. Despite their ubiquity, atlas projects rely on duplicated and manual effort to curate marker genes and annotate cell-types. Importantly, the lack of data-compatible tools and a fixed representation of the atlas make their reanalysis near-impossible. To overcome these challenges, we present a collection of data, algorithms, and tools to automate cataloging and analyzing cell-types across all tissues in an organism. We leveraged this work to build a Human Commons Cell Atlas comprising 2.9 million cells across 27 tissues that can be easily updated and that is structured to facilitate custom analyses. To showcase the flexibility of the atlas, we demonstrate that it can be used for isoform analyses. In particular, we study cell-type specificity of isoforms of OAS1, which has recently been shown to offer SARS-CoV-2 protection in certain individuals that display higher expression of the p46 isoform. Using our Commons Cell Atlas, we localize the OAS1 p44b isoform to the testis, and find that it is specific to germ line cells. By virtue of enabling customized analyses via a modular and dynamic atlas structure, the Commons Cell Atlas should be useful for exploratory analyses that are intractable within the rigid framework of current gene-centric static atlases.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/hdx3-fe49, author = {Shiau, Angela Ann}, title = {Tetranuclear CaMnO and MnO Complexes as Spectroscopic Models of the Oxygen Evolving Complex of Photosystem II}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/hdx3-fe49}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06012023-232619718}, abstract = { This thesis describes a series of studies focused on tetranuclear model complexes of the Oxygen Evolving Complex (OEC) of Photosystem II (PSII). The OEC is a unique CaMn4O4 metallocofactor responsible for biological water oxidation, producing the dioxygen in the atmosphere required for aerobic life. Advances in spectroscopic and structural studies have deepened our understanding of the mechanism and S-state intermediates of the OEC, but details regarding the (1) role of Ca2+, (2) location of substrate waters, (3) (electronic) structures of the S-states, and (4) precise mechanism of the OO bond formation remain debated. It is proposed that synthetic model complexes, due to tunability in aspects such as metal composition, oxidation state, geometry, and ligand environment, can provide important structure-function and structure-property relationships applicable to the OEC. However, due to synthetic challenges, series of complexes suitable for such comparisons remain rare in the literature. In Chapter 1, a brief introduction to the OEC and recent advances in the characterization of the S-state intermediates is discussed. Relationships between synthetic model complexes and how they influence mechanistic proposals for the biological system are highlighted. While it is clear spin state and cluster geometry are strongly correlated, it is important to also consider the effects of smaller, systematic changes in structure and ligand environment on the spectroscopic properties of multimetallic model complexes. Chapter 2 presents a magnetometry and spectroscopic study of a series of related CaMnIV3O4 complexes varying in the symmetry of the cluster core, ligand environment, and protonation state of the bridging oxo groups. These complexes serve as models of the CaMnIV3 cuboidal subsite, where cluster spin state has been previously proposed to be indicative of cluster geometry. Results from our study show that intact CaMnIV3O4 cubane structures can possess spin states of S = 3/2, 5/2, and 9/2, with spin state changes attributed to minor distortions within the cluster core and, importantly, from protonation state of bridging oxo moieties. Thus, interpretation of and structural assignments based on the assumption of a S = 9/2 CaMnIV3O4 subsite must be done cautiously. Chapter 3 presents a series of MnIIIMnIV3 cuboidal complexes as spectroscopic models of the S2 state of the OEC. Though not in the same geometric arrangement of Mn ions as in the OEC, these model complexes bear remarkably similar EPR spectroscopic features to the low-spin multiline signal of the S2 state. Importantly, differences within this series of essentially isostructural complexes emphasize how the electronic structures of tetranuclear Mn complexes are highly sensitive to changes in ligand environment. Specifically, the energy gap between the ground S = 1/2 spin state and higher spin excited states can be tuned based on ligand electronics, resulting in complexes where both high-spin and low-spin features can be observed by EPR spectroscopy. In Chapter 4, we expand upon our previous series of MnIIIMnIV3 model complexes utilizing a new synthetic approach to access complexes varying in Mn coordination numbers of five and six. Importantly, both proposed structures of the S2 state contain a five-coordinate MnIII poised for binding an additional aquo or hydroxide ligand in the S2 to S3 transition. Results from this study demonstrate that Mn coordination number can significantly affect the spin state and observed spectroscopy of tetramanganese-oxo clusters. The complex featuring a five coordinate MnIII possesses a ground spin state of SG = 5/2 and reactivity with water generates a MnIIIMnIV3O4 complex with all pseudo-octahedral Mn centers displaying a S = 1/2 ground state. Chapter 5 details ligand design strategies in accessing higher oxidation state clusters beyond MnIIIMnIV3. The S3-state is the last observable intermediate prior to OO bond formation and assigned as S = 3. Previous studies from our group demonstrated the first synthetic example corroborating this spin state, concurrent with a change from antiferromagnetic coupling within the cluster core to overall ferromagnetic coupling upon oxidation to the MnIV4 oxidation state. Synthetic challenges remain in accessing related, isolable clusters. Utilizing aspects of ligand charge and basicity of a disiloxide ligand, a room temperature stable MnIV4O4 cluster was isolated and studied via magnetometry and EPR spectroscopy. Results provide a second example of a MnIV4 cluster assigned as S = 3. While unfinished, Appendix 1 presents spectroscopic studies of model MnIIIMnIV3 complexes putatively bound to biologically relevant substrates such as water, hydroxide, methanol, and ammonia. Such chemical alterations and the spectroscopic effects arising from them have been widely studied in the biological system, providing information on the electronic structure of the OEC as well as, importantly, ruling out potential substrate water binding sites. As reactivity with small molecules typically requires an open-coordination site, such studies have been rare in the literature due to the difficulty in accessing lower-coordinate Mn sites within multimetallic Mn clusters. Thus, the ongoing characterization of these reaction products are proposed to be invaluable as benchmarking tools for future mechanistic work.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Agapie, Theodor}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/715e-q184, author Invariants of Gapped Quantum Lattice Systems}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/715e-q184}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06032023-021309617}, abstract = { In the first part of the thesis, a systematic way to construct topological invariants of gapped states of quantum lattices systems is proposed.

For a smooth family of gapped ground states in d dimensions, it gives a closed (d + 2)-form on the parameter space which generalizes the curvature of the Berry connection. Its cohomology class is a topological invariant of the family. When the family is equivariant under the action of a compact Lie group G, topological invariants take values in the equivariant cohomology of the parameter space. These invariants unify and generalize the Hall conductance and the Thouless pump. We prove quantization properties of the invariants for low-dimensional invertible systems. In the second part, we discuss the properties of the invariant associated with the Hall conductance for 2d lattice systems with U(1)-symmetry. We define anyonic states associated with the flux insertions and relate their statistics to this invariant. We also provide the construction of states realizing chiral topological order with a non-trivial value of this invariant.

Recently, augmenting classical methods in real-world cyber-physical systems such as smart grids with black-box AI tools, forecasts, and ML algorithms has attracted a lot of growing interest. Integrating AI techniques into smart grids, on the one hand, provides a new approach to handle the uncertainties caused by renewable resources and human behaviors, but on the other hand, creates practical issues such as reliability, stability, privacy, and scalability, etc. to the AI-integrated algorithms. This dissertation focuses on solving problems raised in designing learning-augmented control and decision-making algorithms. The results presented in this dissertation are three-fold. We first study a problem in linear quadratic control, where imperfect/untrusted AI predictions of system perturbations are available. We show that it is possible to design a learning-augmented algorithm with performance guarantees that is aggressive if the predictions are accurate and conservative if they are imperfect. Machine-learned black-box policies are ubiquitous for nonlinear control problems. Meanwhile, crude model information is often available for these problems from, e.g., linear approximations of nonlinear dynamics. We next study the problem of equipping a black-box control policy with model-based advice for nonlinear control on a single trajectory. We first show a general negative result that a naive convex combination of a black-box policy and a linear model-based policy can lead to instability, even if the two policies are both stabilizing. We then propose an adaptive -confident policy, with a coefficient indicating the confidence in a black-box policy, and prove its stability. With bounded nonlinearity, in addition, we show that the adaptive -confident policy achieves a bounded competitive ratio when a black-box policy is near-optimal. Finally, we propose an online learning approach to implement the adaptive -confident policy and verify its efficacy in case studies about the Cart-Pole problem and a real-world electric vehicle (EV) charging problem with data bias due to COVID-19. Aggregators have emerged as crucial tools for the coordination of distributed, controllable loads. To be used effectively, an aggregator must be able to communicate the available flexibility of the loads they control, known as the aggregate flexibility to a system operator. However, most existing aggregate flexibility measures often are slow-timescale estimations and much less attention has been paid to real-time coordination between an aggregator and an operator. In the second part of this dissertation, we consider solving an online decision-making problem in a closed-loop system and present a design of real-time aggregate flexibility feedback, termed the maximum entropy feedback (MEF). In addition to deriving analytic properties of the MEF, combining learning and control, we show that it can be approximated using reinforcement learning and used as a penalty term in a novel control algorithm-the penalized predictive control (PPC) that enables efficient communication, fast computation, and lower costs. We illustrate the efficacy of the PPC using a dataset from an adaptive electric vehicle charging network and show that PPC outperforms classical MPC. We show that under certain regularity assumptions, the PPC is optimal. We illustrate the efficacy of the PPC using a dataset from an adaptive electric vehicle charging network and show that PPC outperforms classical model predictive control (MPC). In a theoretical perspective, a two-controller problem is formulated. A central controller chooses an action from a feasible set that is determined by time-varying and coupling constraints, which depend on all past actions and states. The central controller's goal is to minimize the cumulative cost; however, the controller has access to neither the feasible set nor the dynamics directly, which are determined by a remote local controller. Instead, the central controller receives only an aggregate summary of the feasibility information from the local controller, which does not know the system costs. We show that it is possible for an online algorithm using feasibility information to nearly match the dynamic regret of an online algorithm using perfect information whenever the feasible sets satisfy some criterion, which is satisfied by inventory and tracking constraints. The third part of this dissertation consists of examples of learning, inference, and data analysis methods for power system identification and electric charging. We present a power system identification problem with noisy nodal measurements and efficient algorithms, based on fundamental trade-offs between the number of measurements, the complexity of the graph class, and the probability of error. Next, we specifically consider prediction and unsupervised learning tasks in EV charging.

From the nearby universe to the epochs of cosmic dawn and reionization, by mapping the large-scale structure traced by a certain intensity field, IM provides an economical and a holistic view of the formation and evolution of galaxies in the cosmological text, in a way that is highly complementary to traditional methods based on individual galaxy detections. In this thesis, I present a number of theoretical perspectives on how the IM technique, especially line intensity mapping (LIM), can help us better understand the cosmological evolution of galaxies \u2014 all the way to the intriguing era of first galaxy formation. In the first part of this thesis, I use the Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME), a pathfinder for LIM observations of the 158-micron [CII] line emission from the epoch of reionization (EoR), as an example to demonstrate the aspects of high-redshift star-forming galaxies that can be practically studied with LIM. In Chapter 2, I elaborate the science cases of TIME for the investigations of the EoR using the redshifted [CII] line as a star formation rate tracer, and the cosmic molecular gas content near cosmic noon using CO rotational lines redshifted into the same observing bandpass. The results also guide the design of future phases of TIME. In Chapter 3, I introduce and demonstrate an effective masking strategy for the cleaning of line interlopers such as CO from the [CII] data TIME will measure. Using proxies of CO emitters built from stacking analysis of deep, near-infrared selected galaxies, it provides a practical solution to the notoriously challenging line confusion problem for LIM data analysis. The second part of this thesis focuses on the concept of multi-tracer LIM, namely the synergies among LIM observations of multiple distinct tracers. Forward modeling and inference tools based on semi-analytic models and semi-numerical simulations are developed to explore and showcase the scientific potential of multi-tracer LIM. In Chapter 4, I describe a self-consistent, semi-analytic framework for modeling a variety of LIM signals from the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies, and use it to illustrate the potential application of LIM to shed light on mean ISM properties of galaxies. In Chapters 5 and 6, I present a new semi-numerical simulation called LIMFAST that is developed for efficiently and self-consistently simulating a plethora of IM signals in the high-redshift universe. The LIMFAST code is particularly tailored for revealing the connection between the EoR and the first galaxy formation with multiple cosmological probes. Finally, in the last part of thesis, I show two example case studies where the IM technique is applied to investigate the astrophysics of star formation in galaxies. In Chapter 7, I present an updated analysis of the contributions from star-forming galaxies at z5 to the observed cosmic near-infrared background. Imprints that reveal the formation histories of first stars, including the prospects for detecting them with the forthcoming space missions, are also studied. In Chapter 8, I describe a novel way to constrain the global star formation law of galaxies using LIM measurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillations. As an emerging technique in observational cosmology, IM is no doubt still in its early days, promising exciting scientific returns while facing various practical challenges.

Around the same time, robotics and autonomy research has advanced significantly, resulting in a plethora of new mission concepts employing autonomy, such as on-orbit inspection, mission extension, space structure assembly, and orbital debris removal becoming within the realm of possibility. Two of the key autonomous technologies that are critical to the success of these missions are (1) advanced coordination of multi-agent systems and (2) robust vision-based navigation for on-orbit servicing in close proximity. However, there are challenges to simply applying the existing technology to space systems. First, there are domain-specific challenges that are unique to space, such as orbital mechanics and harsh lighting conditions. Second, even at a theoretical level, previous works in the controls and robotics literature are limited when applied to large-scale, locally coupled systems such as spacecraft swarms. To this end, this thesis develops novel algorithms for addressing these gaps. In the first part of the thesis, we present a decentralized, scalable algorithm for swarm localization, called the Decentralized Pose Estimation (DPE) algorithm. With the DPE algorithm, each spacecraft computes relative navigation estimates with respect to others in the swarm but achieves higher performance through the benefit of multi-agent coordination. The DPE algorithm considers both communication and relative sensing graphs and defines an observable local formation. Each spacecraft jointly localizes its local subset of spacecraft using direct and communicated measurements. Since the algorithm is local, the algorithm complexity does not grow with the number of spacecraft in the swarm. As part of the DPE, we present the Swarm Reference Frame Estimation (SRFE) algorithm, a distributed consensus algorithm to co-estimate a common Local-Vertical, Local-Horizontal frame. The DPE combined with the SRFE provides a scalable, fully-decentralized navigation solution that improves the estimation accuracy compared to when without multi-agent coordination. Numerical simulations and experiments using Caltech's robotic spacecraft simulators are presented to validate the effectiveness and scalability of the DPE algorithm. We show that DPE has much higher accuracy than the best possible estimate without any coordination, while simultaneously being scalable to an arbitrarily large number of agents. In the second part of the thesis, we propose a novel computer vision algorithm to track the pose of an unknown and uncooperative target using multiple decentralized observers. Vision-based pose determination of an unknown target is challenging due to factors such as lack of cooperative visual markers and harsh lighting conditions of space, and the problem is even harder for distributed observers. To address this challenge, we develop the algorithm called the Multi-Spacecraft Simultaneous Estimation of Pose and Shape algorithm or MSEPS. Within MSEPS, a team of chaser spacecraft, each equipped with a monocular camera, exchange information over a local network to jointly estimate the relative kinematic state of the target and its sparse shape landmarks. In this approach, each spacecraft processes its images and extracts its own set of visual keypoints in parallel. Then, the team uses the local network to jointly estimate the target pose and shape in a distributed fashion by applying the consensus algorithm over the inter-spacecraft communication links. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first cooperative vision-based algorithm for estimating the pose and shape of a space object by means of an arbitrary number of spacecraft. We validate our algorithm using simulations of relative orbits and observations captured by each chaser spacecraft and show the multiple observers successfully agree on a consistent estimate and track the target pose accurately. In the third part of the thesis, we develop some new simulation tools that bridge the gap between robotics and space technology. When developing robotics algorithms for on-orbit systems such as DPE and MSEPS, we identified a need for new simulation tools that tightly integrate robotics algorithms with high-fidelity models of space environments such as astrodynamics effects and visual conditions. To this end, we first develop a ROS2-compatible software interface for Basilisk, the open-source astrodynamics simulation software. This tool allows running Basilisk in parallel with ROS2 in real-time and translates messages between Basilisk modules and ROS2 modules, such that control algorithms implemented in ROS2 can interact with the high-fidelity dynamics within Basilisk in a closed-loop fashion. Second, we develop a ROS2-compatible camera simulation module that uses the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to rapidly generate novel images. These synthetic images are used as inputs to validate the vision-based navigation algorithm in a closed-loop fashion. To validate these simulation tools, we also developed a set of autonomous algorithms for on-orbit inspection and use the simulated measurements as inputs to the algorithm. The real-time numerical simulations demonstrate that our tools can be integrated with autonomy algorithms implemented in ROS2 in a closed-loop fashion to validate the feasibility of the mission. In the process of addressing some lessons learned from DPE and MSEPS works, we identified that there is a gap in general frameworks for solving the optimal estimation problems for probabilistic inference of large-scale problems involving networked systems. This gap is not just applicable to spacecraft swarms, but also to a general class of large-scale, multi-agent problems in robotics and controls such as localization and mapping, wireless sensor networks, and electrical power grids. Therefore, in the fourth part of the thesis, we address this fundamental gap by developing novel algorithms for Distributed Factor Graph Optimization (DFGO) problems that arise in large-scale networked systems. We develop algorithms for both batch and real-time problems. First, for the batch DFGO problem, we derive a type of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm called the Local Consensus ADMM (LC-ADMM). fully localized; therefore, the computational effort, communication bandwidth, and memory for each agent scale like O(1) with respect to the network size. We establish two new theoretical results for LC-ADMM: (1) exponential convergence when the objective is strongly convex and has a Lipschitz continuous subdifferential, and (2) o(1/k) when the objective is convex and has a unique solution. We also show that LC-ADMM allows the use of non-quadratic loss functions, such as l1-norm and Huber loss. Second, we also develop the Incremental DFGO algorithm (iDFGO) for real-time problems by combining the ideas from LC-ADMM and the Bayes tree. To derive a time-scalable algorithm, we exploit the temporal sparsity of the real-time factor graph and the convergence of the augmented factors of LC-ADMM. The iDFGO algorithm incrementally recomputes estimates when new factors are added to the graph and is scalable with respect to both network size and time. We validate LC-ADMM and iDFGO in simulations with examples from multi-agent Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and power grids.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Chung, Soon-Jo}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/fpcj-w268, author = {Oshima, Emile Kazuo}, title = {Experimental Studies of Flow Control Techniques for Future Aircraft}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/fpcj-w268}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:02042023-015312785}, abstract = { From the signing of the Paris Agreement to the COVID-19 outbreak, the past decade has truly challenged the aviation industry to adapt. New technologies need to be developed constantly to meet the increasing commercial and defense demands for more efficient, quiet, safe, and agile aircraft. To keep up with these rapidly changing times, an approach that marries a fundamental understanding of aerodynamics with systems design and optimization is necessary. This thesis explores two promising concepts for controlling flow over next-generation aircraft: active control on a swept wing for airplane applications, and passive control on a rotating blade for drone applications. In each, force measurements are combined with advanced flow visualization techniques to create a research framework that is both data-driven and physics-informed. In Part I, a comprehensive wind tunnel campaign is carried out on a swept wing model of modular geometry equipped with an array of sweeping jet actuators, which have demonstrated tremendous promise for flow control authority in both laboratory settings and full-scale flight tests. The flow physics and performance of the wing is investigated first without actuation, revealing separation behaviors at both the leading and trailing edges that are crucial to consider when flow control is applied. This paves the way for an optimization study in a newly proposed framework that relies on fluid power coefficients rather than the momentum coefficient that has been the accepted parameter of choice for characterizing blowing systems over the past seven decades of active flow control research. Part II explores the feasibility of a \"prop-shroud\" concept for small-scale aerial vehicles, in which the shroud is directly attached to the blade tips and thus co-rotates with the propeller. Such a configuration has the potential to provide the various aerodynamic and engineering benefits of a shrouded propeller without the associated costs and complexities of its installation. The hover efficiency of a prop-shroud is shown to be comparable to commercially available drone propellers, even without a rigorous optimization of its geometry. The effect of the co-rotating shroud is then analyzed in detail on the time-averaged, phase-averaged, and unsteady features of the flow field.

This leads to using several lasers when several wavelengths are required. Nonlinear photonic devices pose a solution to this problem by transferring energy from single lasers to vast regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. But, despite more than 60 years of development in nonlinear photonics, most nonlinear devices remain large, expensive, and confined to research laboratories. In this dissertation, we demonstrate a new generation of integrated nonlinear photonic devices based on the quadratic (2) nonlinearity. Using the up-and-coming thin-film lithium niobate platform, we demonstrate ultrafast optical parametric amplifiers, parametric generation of ultrashort mid-infrared pulses, long pulses and frequency combs tunable over an octave bandwidth, and the first (2) CW parametric oscillator directly pumped by a single commercial diode laser.

Various systems have been proposed for PACT and they are described by different mathematical models to reconstruct from detected ultrasonic signals the photon-absorption-induced initial pressure, the main contrast in PACT. Accurate image reconstruction has high requirements for the system and the mathematical model, which is often imperfect in practice due to multiple factors, e.g., limited transducer bandwidth, finite transducer element size, sparse spatial sampling, partial-view detection, and tissue motion. The focus of this dissertation is on using computational methods to compensate for these model imperfections. First, for a human breast imaging system based on a full-ring transducer array, we incorporate the limited transducer bandwidth into the model for spatiotemporal analysis to clarify the aliasing due to sparse spatial sampling and propose (1) two methods (radius-dependent spatiotemporal antialiasing and location-dependent spatiotemporal antialiasing) to mitigate these artifacts. Second, for an isotropic-resolution 3D PACT system formed by four arc arrays, we consider both the limited transducer bandwidth and the finite transducer element size and (2) compress the system matrix through singular value decomposition and fast Fourier transform for its efficient explicit expression. Enabled by this expression, we then propose (3) fast sparsely sampling functional imaging by incorporating a densely sampled prior image into the system matrix, which maintains the critical linearity while mitigating artifacts, and (4) intra-image nonrigid motion correction by incorporating the motion as subdomain translations into the system matrix and reconstructing the translations together with the image iteratively. Finally, for a single-shot 3D PACT system based on a single ultrasonic transducer, we propose (5) a fast implementation of the forward model by connecting traditional PACT with virtual detector responses through fast Fourier transform, and we iteratively reconstruct the image from signals with extremely compressed sensing and partial-view detection. All these proposed methods enable image reconstruction or significantly improve image quality in numerical simulations, phantom experiments, and in vivo experiments. Although they are demonstrated only for certain PACT systems, they are directly applicable to other systems and can be extended to other tomographic imaging modalities such as X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Wang, Lihong}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/nzk8-2d38, author Jordan}, title {New HCR 10-Plex Quantitative Spectral Imaging RNAs and of = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/nzk8-2d38}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06092023-193714022}, abstract = { Signal amplification based on the mechanism of hybridization chain reaction (HCR) enables researchers to quantitatively image RNA and protein expression in highly autofluorescent biological samples. This thesis extends the capabilities of HCR to three new domains: spectral HCR imaging for quantitative 10-plex immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization in highly autofluorescent samples; imaging of protein:protein complexes using cooperative probes for logical control over HCR signal amplification; and HCR lateral flow tests for sensitive, instrument-free, at-home testing for infectious diseases. While 4- or 5-plex imaging is readily achieved using orthogonal HCR systems labeled with spectrally distinct fluorophores, higher levels of multiplexing are challenging due to overlap in the broad excitation and emission spectra of commonly used fluorophores. In Chapter 2, we simultaneously image a combination of 10 protein and RNA targets via spectral imaging with linear unmixing. A combination of 10 reference spectra for 10 fluorophores chosen for optimal unmixing, 10 orthogonal HCR systems, and 11 optimized excitation and emission settings enable robust, user-friendly performance, which is demonstrated in whole-mount zebrafish embryos and mouse brain sections. We validate that unmixed subcellular voxel intensities enable accurate and precise relative target quantitation with subcellular resolution across all 10 channels and demonstrate single-molecule sensitivity and resolution for absolute RNA quantitation. In Chapter 3, we introduce an enzyme-free method for multiplexed imaging of protein:protein complexes using split-initiator HCR signal amplification. Antibodies specific to each protein of the complex carry fractional initiators that become colocalized upon introduction of a DNA ruler strand to form a full HCR initiator and trigger growth of a tethered amplification polymer. Automatic background suppression is present throughout the protocol, as split-initiator antibody probes that bind to the sample nonspecifically or to isolated protein targets are too far apart to become colocalized by the ruler strand, precluding colocalization of a full initiator and preventing HCR signal amplification. We demonstrate the technique with high signal-to-background in adherent mammalian cells, pro-T cells, and highly autofluorescent formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human breast tissue sections. Leveraging existing orthogonal HCR amplifiers, we design three orthogonal cooperative junctions for simultaneous 3-plex detection of protein:protein complexes. We validate that quantitative subcellular voxel intensities are generated, allowing for built-in relative quantitation of protein:protein complexes within the spatial context of the sample. Lastly, we demonstrate simultaneous detection of protein targets, RNA targets, and protein:protein complexes via a unified protocol for HCR immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization, and protein:protein complex imaging. In Chapter 4, we enhance the sensitivity of conventional unamplified lateral flow tests for at-home infectious disease testing by developing an amplified assay with isothermal, enzyme-free signal amplification based on the mechanism of HCR. Traditional lateral flow tests are amenable to at-home testing and return a result within 10-15 minutes but demonstrate a high false-negative rate (e.g., 25-50% for SARS-CoV-2) due to the absence of signal amplification. The HCR lateral flow assay we develop maintains the simplicity of the conventional lateral flow assay user experience via a disposable 3-channel lateral flow device to automatically deliver reagents to the test region in three successive stages without user interaction. To perform a test, the user loads the sample, closes the device, and reads the result by eye after 60 minutes. Detecting gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virions in a mixture of saliva and extraction buffer, the current amplified HCR lateral flow assay achieves a limit of detection of 200 copies/L using available antibodies to target the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. By comparison, five commercial unamplified lateral flow assays that use proprietary antibodies exhibit limits of detection of 500 copies/L, 1000 copies/L, 2000 copies/L, 2000 copies/L, and 20,000 copies/L. By swapping out antibody probes to target different pathogens, amplified HCR lateral flow assays offer a platform for simple, rapid, and sensitive at-home testing for infectious diseases.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Pierce, Niles A.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/fsbz-pd46, author Mott = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/fsbz-pd46}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05202023-131846404}, abstract = { Strong coupling between spin and charge degrees of freedom in two-dimensional spin-1/2 Mott antiferromagnets (AFMs) creates a rich platform to study quantum many-body physics. For decades, the consequences of these interactions have been intensely studied in thermal equilibrium, where the introduction of charge carriers through chemical doping has been shown to generate a vibrant phase diagram rich with unconventional types of charge, spin, and orbital ordering. In recent years, however, attention has grown to include the study of these materials as they are driven far from equilibrium using intense pulses of light produced by femtosecond laser sources. In addition to fundamental interest in the resultant dynamics, recent experimental and theoretical studies have suggested that driven Mott insulators can host states of matter that cannot be accessed in thermal equilibrium. While many driving protocols have been developed\u2014spanning from the selective excitation of bosonic modes to photon-dressing via coherent time-periodic driving\u2014the simplest conceptual approach to engineering Mott insulators with light is known as photo-doping. In this procedure, the material is impulsively driven resonantly with a transition from a filled band to an empty band, transiently producing charge carriers. Given the impact of chemical doping in thermal equilibrium, photo-doping has garnered interest as an important tool in the study of driven Mott insulators. Early successes in the study of photo-doped Mott AFMs include the observation of ultrafast demagnetization and the prediction of non-thermal magnetic states, charge density waves, and superconductivity. Photo-doping thus holds promise to generate an out-of-equilibrium phase diagram that is equally rich to that found in equilibrium. Yet, many open questions about the basic properties of photo-doped Mott insulators remain unresolved. Whether charge instabilities exist as a result of interactions between the photo-dopants has yet to be examined. Moreover, while theoretical studies have suggested that antiferromagnetic correlations can enhance attractive interactions between photo-dopants, evidence of the resultant bound states remain elusive. Even the light-matter interactions that generate the photo-dopants are in need of investigation, as the fate of a Mott insulator driven by strong electric fields remains a fundamental open theoretical and experimental problem. In this thesis, I present a series of experiments designed to answer each of these questions. After describing the properties of Mott insulators in Chapter 1, I present the experimental details of the tools that enable these studies in Chapter 2. Taking a multi-messenger approach to ultrafast spectroscopy, a suite of ultrafast probes simultaneously track the spin and charge degrees of freedom to paint a holistic picture of the out-of-equilibrium state. In Chapter 3, I use ultrafast THz conductivity to establish the existence of an insulating photo-excited fluid of Hubbard excitons (HEs), which are bound states that are thought to form as a result of attractive spin-mediated interactions. This magnetic binding mechanism is studied in more detail in Chapter 4 by examining the properties of these HEs in the magnetic critical region of several materials that lie in different magnetic universality classes. In Chapter 5, I study the effects of HE formation on the ultrafast demagnetization that is known to occur following photo-doping. Finally, I turn my attention towards the photo-dopant generation mechanism in Chapter 6, exploring the effects of strong electric field driving in Mott insulators. I find signatures of the so-called Keldysh crossover from a multiphoton-absorption- to a quantum-tunneling-dominated pair production regime.

The density of adsorbed gas species approaches the bulk liquid density, providing a method to increase the volumetric energy density of hydrogen and natural gas at conditions where the adsorbate is a non-liquid in the bulk phase. This dissertation explores the tunability of the strength of gas adsorption to surfaces of carbon adsorbents, known as the enthalpy of adsorption. Two methods are studied: modification of the surface atomic composition and microstructural changes to the carbon porosity. Applications are considered for both energy storage and carbon capture applications. The first chapter presents a brief overview of the energy storage field, with emphasis on non-conventional methods to store gases efficiently. Chapter 2 provides the thermodynamic and statistical mechanical derivations used throughout this work, and the assumptions that go into the models used to analyze adsorption data.

Chapter 4 presents the densification of a novel architected carbon structure, zeolite-templated carbon, for adsorbed natural gas storage. Through the pelletization process, the pore morphology of the underlying adsorbent framework is compressed, resulting in increased adsorption enthalpies with applied pelletization pressure. Chapter 5 focuses on the tunability of pore structure through potassium hydroxide activation, and the resulting adsorption properties pertinent to carbon dioxide capture from a simulated flue-gas stream.

The study is conducted using a combination of experiments, simulations, and theory, with the goal of developing a unifying theory of granular materials that can be described by continuum models. The main objective is to understand how microscale physics propagate to macroscale phenomena and to address issues related to setting boundary conditions and predicting timescales from unsteady to steady states. This research primarily aims to investigate stress variations in granular materials as a function of shear rate, encompassing both steady and unsteady states. Additionally, the thesis examines the phenomena of wall force anomalies and vortex flows. In Couette cell experiments and vertical plane shear simulations, granular material demonstrates a downward flow near the vertical shearing wall and an upward flow adjacent to another static vertical wall. Interestingly, this vortex flow causes a change in the direction of vertical shear stress when wall shearing commences, contradicting the prevalent assumption that particles consistently apply a downward force on the vertical wall. The study concludes with key findings, including the observation that normal and shear stresses on the shearing wall increase slowly after the initiation of shearing, and that steady-state values for these stresses are independent of the shearing speed within a certain range. The study also found that the height of particles near the shearing wall decreases gradually with the presence of vortex flow, and that the shear rate near the moving wall is initially high and decreases slowly to reach a steady state. Additionally, we used a non-local constitutive model and Boussinesq approximation to predict the downward flow that is driven by gravity and variations in the solid fraction near the shearing surface, as well as the decay profile of velocity in an infinitely wide box for the steady state. Overall, this thesis contributes to our understanding of granular materials in the slow flow regime, providing insights into their behavior under shear. The non-local model accurately predicts the downward flow and velocity decay profile, indicating its potential as a valuable tool for future research.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Hunt, L.}, } Soliman, Ahmed = {BICEP Array Detectors and Instrumentation at 30/40 GHz: Design, Performance, and Deployment to the South Pole for Constraining Primordial Gravitational Waves}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/srdx-w019}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05232023-174453276}, abstract = { The discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) in the 1960s has provided strong observational evidence for the Big Bang cosmological model to describe the origin and evolution of the universe. The theory of cosmic inflation was developed in the 1980s to account for the initial density perturbations by a period of exponential expansion in the early Universe to solve the horizon, flatness and monopole problems. Many inflation models predict potentially detectable primordial gravitational-waves (PGWs) background that imprint a B-mode polarization pattern in the CMB. The amplitude of the inflationary B-mode polarization depends on the energy scale of inflation and is parameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. The detection of a B-mode pattern would open a new window to probe the energy scale at the beginning of time when the universe was a mere fraction of a second old after the Big Bang. The BICEP/Keck collaboration is building a series of experiments located at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station to map the polarization of the CMB at degree angular scales using small-aperture telescopes. Our latest BICEP/Keck publications use data collected through 2018 and report the strongest constraints r0.05 < 0.036 at 95% confidence. The current sensitivity on r is limited by the variance from the gravitational lensing. BICEP/Keck is starting a collaboration with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) team to develop delensing techniques to improve future constraints on r. Characterizing Galactic foregrounds, especially synchrotron emission, remains a priority in order to improve constraints as statistical sensitivity continues to improve. The motivation for this thesis is to develop a highly sensitive receiver at 30 and 40 GHz, at frequencies where the synchrotron foreground dominates. BICEP Array represents the latest phase in the BICEP/Keck experiments, and will map the polarization of the CMB at 30/40, 95, 150, and 220/270 GHz. BICEP Array will search for PGWs with unprecedented sensitivity levels on r by characterizing and removing Galactic synchrotron and dust emission from our maps of the CMB. My PhD thesis focuses on the technology development for high sensitivity detectors and instrumentation to successfully deploy the first BICEP Array receiver at 30 GHz and 40 GHz to the South Pole in order to constrain the Galactic synchrotron foreground. My dissertation presents the receiver design and performance. I will first explain the engineering design principles, the fabrication and a laboratory demonstration of single-color antenna-coupled Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers. Secondly, I will discuss the design and demonstration of dual-color detectors at 30 and 40 GHz that gain receiver sensitivity by increasing the optical throughput and bandwidth of each pixel. I also developed microstrip diplexer circuits that divide the detector bandwidth into two CMB observing channels. I optimized this approach to design the dual-color bowtie-coupled detector at 90/150 GHz. Thirdly, I will introduce a new wide-band corrugated focal plane module design to minimize the beam mismatch systematic at 30 and 40 GHz bands simultaneously. Our receivers map polarization of the CMB by taking the difference between co-located and orthogonally polarized pair of detectors. Polarized beam difference measurements show a differential beam response due to a shift between the polarization beam centers within a pixel due to an electromagnetic interaction with the focal plane frame. The residual beams leak a temperature to polarization (T-P) in the CMB polarization maps and can produce a false B-mode signal that introduces non-negligible systematic errors for BICEP Array measurements to come with improved sensitivity. The wide-band design reduces this effect and associated systematic errors for 30 and 40 GHz receiver. I also developed a new single-band corrugated focal plane module design for 150 GHz receiver. I performed laboratory measurements of these designs at 30, 40, and 150 GHz to verify the modelled response. The corrugation design will also be extended to the 220/270 GHz receiver. Fourthly, I will show my contributions to the receiver deployment, integration and calibration during the first 2020 observing season. The measurements will include the full optical characterization of the detector camera, in-lab and on-sky sensitivity at the South Pole. I will also describe the tests done to diagnose the challenges during the first season and new upgrades during the second 2022 season to improve the overall sensitivity of the receiver. Improved detector modules have been installed during the 2023 season to further boost the mapping speed for measuring the synchrotron foreground. The technologies developed for BICEP Array feed into capabilities for the upcoming CMB-S4 program. For example, I used similar methods to design a diplexer for a CMB-S4 dual-color feedhorn-coupled detector design at 90/150 GHz.

This technique, while effective at producing materials necessary for traditional filtering applications, fails to afford control over morphology, both macro- and microscopically. The filtering material produced often relies exclusively on its randomly assembled porosity (and occasionally on its surface charge) to capture materials from filtered fluids but provides little means for targeted analyte capture without bulk surface coating or functionalization. This thesis seeks to demonstrate a unique approach to filtration membrane manufacture via a novel high-throughput holographic lithography and contact lithography process in the visible spectrum that utilizes a customized negative-tone photoresist inherently capable of localized surface modification. This thesis first describes the development of a large-scale holographic lithography process, from conceptualization to implementation, and demonstrates its efficacy by examining produced materials. A phase metasurface mask is utilized to produce a periodic intensity distribution of incident photons. This mask is irradiated at 0.23-0.25 W via linear raster scanning of a 2.2 mm diameter 532 nm laser at 1.5 mm/s and a scan offset of 0.4 mm to produce a homogeneous exposure profile in visible-light sensitized 2.4 cm\u00b2 lateral and ~500 nm-wide struts organized in layered 3D brick-and-mortar-like patterns to result in ~50-70% porosity. Scanning electron micrographs of cross-sectioned materials reveal how pattern morphology varies with cure depth, and furthermore how the lack of complete porosity disqualifies this material for application as a membrane filter. This thesis subsequently focuses on the development of a novel glycidyl methacrylate (GMA)-based negative-tone photoresist for implementation in the previously described lithography system to produce materials more amenable to functional membrane filter production. GMA is polymerized with a photo-caged an 85:15 monomer ratio, respectively. These linear co-polymers are then mixed with a photoacid generator (PAG) to produce a 532 nm sensitized negative-tone photoresist. Pre- and post-exposure bake temperatures are selected via glass-transition temperature identification (~62 \u00b0C) with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments, and cure depth varying with optical exposure dose is examined via establishment of contrast curves. The photoresist is then utilized in the previously described lithography system to produce square arrays of ~25 um circular holes, and the resulting films are characterized via optical and scanning electron microscopy. This thesis concludes with an examination of the poly(GMA-rand-ONBAMA) films implemented as water-permeable filtration membranes. Efficacy of surface functionalization and solution capture explored via amine deprotection and subsequent tagging with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) dye. The presence and intensity uniformity of tagged samples are examined via confocal microscopy. Transmission of water is justified analytical examination and phenomenologically demonstrated via droplet loading of supported membranes with methylene blue-dyed water.

Ground-based remote sensing measurements of column-averaged dry mole fractions (DMF) of gases such as carbon dioxide (CO) and carbon monoxide (CO) made by the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) are used to validate space-based measurements and better understand the carbon cycle. Surface signals of gas exchange can be masked in the total column values, however, limiting their use in assessment of local surface fluxes. Retrievals of the vertical distribution of trace gases can be used to obtain gas exchange information that is more directly related to changes at the surface but require high precision measurements with less temporal resolution than the TCCON total column measurements. In this thesis, I develop an algorithm, the Temporal Atmospheric Retrieval Determining Information from Secondary Scaling (TARDISS), that infers vertical information, or 'partial columns', from existing, quality-controlled total column data. The TARDISS algorithm does not fit the solar spectra but rather begins with trace gas column retrievals obtained from different spectral bands using the standard TCCON retrievals. TARDISS takes advantage of the fact that different bands have different sensitivities to the same trace gas as a function of altitude and solar zenith angle. We use the TARDISS partial column data to examine estimated surface fluxes in the North American boreal forest and compare them to surface fluxes estimated from tall tower in situ measurements. We also outline changes in air quality from the sudden change in traffic behavior from the COVID-19 lockdown which serves as motivation for the use of the TARDISS-derived lower partial column CO data to examine recent changes in air quality in the South Coast Air Basin.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Wennberg, Paul O.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/vg8a-y851, author = Prashant}, title = {On the Role of Three-Dimensional Genome Organization in Gene Regulation and mRNA Splicing}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/vg8a-y851}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05302023-040856946}, abstract = {The nucleus is spatially organized such that DNA, RNA, and protein molecules involved in shared functional and regulatory processes are compartmentalized in three-dimensional (3D) structures.

Through X-ray diffraction (XRD), nuclear resonant inelastic (FTIR) in the diamond anvil cell, the material properties of szomolnokite have been characterized under high pressures and low temperatures relevant to hydrous, sulfur-rich planetary environments. XRD measurements presented in this work have revealed two structural phase transitions occurring at pressures between 5.0 and 6.6 GPa and between 12.7 and 16.8 GPa, with the latter phase stable up to 80 GPa. The elastic parameters of each phase have been determined by fitting third-order Birch-Murnaghan equations of state. I compare our results with elastic parameters of other relevant sulfate phases, highlighting the importance of reporting and comparing these parameters at the pressures where the phases are stable. Using NRIXS and SMS, the lattice vibrational response and the effects on the iron electronic environments during the structural transitions are examined. The NRIXS and SMS data reveal distinct features and pressure-dependent behaviors that characterize alterations in both iron-site specific and bulk lattice properties associated with the phase transitions, including lattice softening and decreased iron-coordination environment symmetry. Utilizing both the NRIXS and XRD results, I discuss how the presence of sulfates in the ice-rich crusts of planetary bodies could affect tidal loading observations. Synchrotron FTIR measurements demonstrate that structurally bound HO is retained within the unit cell during the structural transitions and upon subsequent decompression, confirming the retention of water up to 23 GPa and temperatures as low as 20 K and indicating the reversibility of both structural transitions. Supported by our quantum mechanics molecular dynamics simulations, the existence of two vibrationally unique water sites in szomolnokite's crystal structure is proposed to explain the experimentally observed H2O-related features. I develop a spectral diagnostic for observing the high pressure structural transformations at ambient and low temperatures. The measured partial phonon density of states, predicted vibrational density of states, and measured FTIR spectrum are compared.

The strong influence of these processes on cloud formation and maintenance makes the task of modeling turbulence and convection one of the grand challenges in climate modeling, due to the outsized effect of clouds on climate. Current operational climate models fail to represent atmospheric turbulence and convection accurately and consistently across dynamical regimes and vertical levels; errors in the representation of these processes explain about half of the spread in climate projections. This dissertation seeks to reduce such representation errors by improving a recently proposed unified framework for modeling turbulence and convection, known as the extended eddy-diffusivity mass-flux scheme, in several ways. First, the framework is rederived by systematically coarse-graining the governing fluid equations, highlighting the assumptions about atmospheric motion that are necessary to yield the scheme. New terms related to turbulent entrainment processes are shown to arise from the derivation. Second, a generalized formulation of turbulent diffusion consistent with the framework is presented. This novel formulation is shown to accurately represent turbulent processes under statically stable and unstable conditions, including regimes with sharp lapse rate inversions such as the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer. Finally, a methodology to calibrate free parameters within the model from indirect data is proposed. The methodology, based on Kalman filtering, is shown to be efficient at calibrating imperfect black-box models from noisy data, and in its regularized unscented version approximately quantifies parametric uncertainty. The resulting unified data-informed model of turbulence and convection is shown to accurately represent a range of low-cloud regimes that are associated with the largest biases in current operational climate models. The response of the model to realistic climate perturbations is also shown to be consistent with the resolved climate response, although structural errors in the amount of condensate are still important at realistic vertical resolutions.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Schneider, Tapio}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/374f-1202, author = {Raghavan, Guruprasad}, title = {Engineering Artificial Systems with Natural Intelligence}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/374f-1202}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:03172023-050019811}, abstract = { Although Deep neural networks achieve human-like performance on a variety of perceptual and decision-making tasks, they perform poorly when confronted with changing tasks or goals, and broadly fail to match the flexibility and robustness of human intelligence. Additionally, artificial neural networks rely heavily on human-designed, hand-programmed architectures for their remarkable performance. In this thesis, I work towards achieving two goals: (i) development of a set of mathematical frameworks inspired by facets of natural intelligence, to endow artificial networks with flexibility and robustness, two key traits of natural intelligence; and (ii) inspired by the development of the biological vision system, I propose an algorithm that can 'grow' a functional, layered neural network from a single initial cell, with the aim of enabling autonomous development of artificial networks akin to living neural networks. For the first goal of endowing networks with flexibility and robustness, I propose a mathematical framework to enable continuous training of neural networks on a range of objectives by constructing path connected sets of networks, resulting in the discovery of a series of networks with equivalent functional performance on a given machine learning task. In this framework, I view the weight space of a neural network as a curved Riemannian manifold and move a network along a functionally invariant path in weight space while searching for networks that satisfy secondary objectives. A path-sampling algorithm trains computer vision and natural language processing networks with millions of weight parameters to learn a series of classification tasks without performance loss while accommodating secondary objectives including network sparsification, incremental task learning, and increased adversarial robustness. Broadly, for achieving this goal, I conceptualize a neural network as a mathematical object that can be iteratively transformed into distinct configurations by the path- sampling algorithm to define a sub-manifold of networks that can be harnessed to achieve user goals. For the second goal of 'growing' artificial neural networks in a manner similar to living neural networks, I develop an approach inspired by the mechanisms employed by the early visual system to wire the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), days before animals open their eyes. I find that the key ingredients for robust self- organization are (a) an emergent spontaneous spatiotemporal activity wave in the first layer and (b) a local learning rule in the second layer that 'learns' the underlying activity pattern in the first layer. As the bio-inspired developmental rule is adapt- able to a wide-range of input-layer geometries and robust to malfunctioning units in the first layer, it can be used to successfully grow and self-organize pooling architectures of different pool-sizes and shapes. The algorithm provides a primitive procedure for constructing layered neural networks through growth and self-organization. Finally, I also demonstrate that networks grown from a single unit perform as well as hand-crafted networks on a wide variety of static (MNIST recognition) and dynamic (gesture-recognition) tasks.

In next-generation research tasks, which could involve highly nonlinear, complicated, and large-scale decision-making problems in safety-critical situations, however, the existing performance guarantees of black-box AI approaches may not be sufficiently powerful. This thesis gives a mathematical overview of contraction theory, with some practical examples drawn from joint projects with NASA JPL, for enjoying formal guarantees of nonlinear control theory even with the use of machine learning-based and data-driven methods. This is not to argue that these methods are always better than conventional approaches, but to provide formal tools to investigate their performance for further discussion, so we can design and operate truly autonomous aerospace and robotic systems safely, robustly, adaptively, and intelligently in real-time. Contraction theory is an analytical tool to study differential dynamics of a non-autonomous (i.e., time-varying) nonlinear system under a contraction metric defined with a uniformly positive definite matrix, the existence of which results in a necessary and sufficient characterization of incremental exponential stability of multiple solution trajectories with respect to each other. Its nonlinear stability analysis boils down to finding a suitable contraction metric that satisfies a stability condition expressed as a linear matrix inequality, resulting in many parallels drawn between linear systems theory and contraction theory for nonlinear systems. This yields much-needed safety and stability guarantees for neural network-based control and estimation schemes, without resorting to a more involved method of using uniform asymptotic stability for input-to-state stability. Such distinctive features permit the systematic construction of a contraction metric via convex optimization, thereby obtaining an explicit exponential bound on the distance between a time-varying target trajectory and solution trajectories perturbed externally due to disturbances and learning errors. The first two parts of this thesis are about a theoretical overview of contraction theory and its advantages, with an emphasis on deriving formal robustness and stability guarantees for deep learning-based 1) feedback control, 2) state estimation, 3) motion planning, 4) multi-agent collision avoidance and robust tracking augmentation, 5) adaptive control, 6) neural net-based system identification and control, for nonlinear systems perturbed externally by deterministic and stochastic disturbances.

However, current commercialized technologies are limited by the one electron transfer per transition metal paradigm utilized by cathode materials that operate with an intercalation-based charge storage mechanism. Finding ways to increase the charge storage capabilities of the cathode into the multielectron regime has long been a focus of research efforts, and involvement of structural anions in the redox has been demonstrated as a promising way to accomplish multielectron storage. Layered lithium-rich oxide materials have been shown to afford dramatic improvements to overall storage capacity but are plagued by complex mechanisms and unwanted side reactions that lead to poor cycling stability and characterization difficulties. This thesis expands upon previous understanding of oxide-based anion redox materials and extends the exploration into sulfide and selenide systems, which allow the study of anion redox without the side processes that affect oxides. First, a dynamic charge compensation mechanism of late group metal-poor, lithium-rich oxide, Li2Ru0.3Mn0.7O3, is uncovered and found to involve an irreversible anion oxidation that leads to involvement of redox states on transition metals previously thought to be unavailable. Second, active electrolyte additives are explored as a method of stabilizing the cathode-electrolyte interface of anion redox material, Li2RuO3. alkali-rich sulfides, Li2FeS2 and of sulfides (S2-) to persulfides ([S2]2-).

Fourth, the role of metal-anion covalency is systematically investigated through anion substitution of Li2FeS2 with S2-, highlighting the importance of a holistic understanding of changes to the electronic and physical structure of anion redox materials to predict long-term performance.

Despite its significant role in various physical processes throughout the Universe, the particle nature of DM remains elusive. With the non-detection of classical candidates (e.g. WIMPs), the theoretical space for DM is becoming increasingly open. This thesis revolves around studying the nature of DM in the context of structure formation and we will focus on a category of DM with self-interactions (SIDM), which can be constrained only through astrophysical probes if DM has no coupling with the standard model particles. Utilizing advanced cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we examine the effects of DM elastic and dissipative self-interactions on galaxy structure and their interplay with baryonic physics processes. Our numerical studies encompass a range of systems, such as Local dwarf galaxies, massive galaxy clusters in the Local Universe, and rare massive quasar-host galaxies at high redshift (z 6). In Local dwarf galaxies, we analyze the unique signatures of dissipative self-interacting DM (dSIDM) with typical self-interaction cross-section /m ~ 0.1-10 cm\u00b2 g\u00b9 and dissipation factor ~ 0.5. We find a universal cuspy central density profile and systematic changes in halo morphology in dSIDM. By comparing our results with observations, we derive constraints for effective parameters of dSIDM and identify the parameter space where it remains viable and exhibits interesting observational implications. For a similar type of dSIDM with fairly low /m 0.05 cm\u00b2 g\u00b9, we also explore the possibility that the direct collapse of dSIDM halos at high redshift can seed supermassive black holes and serve as progenitors for massive bright quasars observed at high redshift. This scenario predicts a large population of quiescent supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshift, which could be tested by future LISA observations. Lastly, in Local massive galaxy clusters, we compare the X-ray morphology of hot gas in observed clusters with simulations of elastic SIDM. Although SIDM models with large interaction cross-sections (/m 0.5 cm\u00b2 g\u00b9) are favored, uncertainties from cooling and feedback physics in galaxy clusters must be taken into account.

This thesis addresses some of the issues in safety critical autonomy by introducing new techniques for computationally tractable and efficient safety-critical control. The approach developed in this thesis arises from taking a deeper look at two questions: 1) How can we obtain better uncertainty quantification of the disturbances that affect autonomous systems either as a result of unmodeled changes in the environment or due to sensor imperfections? 2) Given richer uncertainty quantification techniques, how do incorporate the diverse uncertainty descriptions into the control and planning framework without sacrificing the tractability and efficiency of existing approaches? I address the above two questions by developing risk-aware control and planning techniques for traversal of a mobile robot over static but extreme terrain and in the presence of dynamic obstacles. We first look at algorithms for risk-aware terrain assessment, and extensively test them on wheeled and legged robots that were deployed in subterranean tunnel, urban, and cave environments for search and rescue operations in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. I then present a theory for risk-aware model predictive control in static environments and in the presence of dynamic obstacles. Coherent risk measures are applied to this planning and control framework in order to account for diverse uncertainty descriptions. Computationally tractable reformulations of the optimal control problem are realized through constraint tightening techniques. I then investigate algorithms for uncertainty assessment and prediction of apriori unknown, dynamic obstacles using data-driven techniques. We use a technique from signal processing literature called Singular Spectrum Analysis for making linear predictions of dynamic obstacles. The obstacle motion predictions are equipped with error predictions to account for the uncertainty in the sensing heuristically using bootstrapping techniques. We use a statistical tool, Adaptive Conformal Inference, to further calibrate the heuristic error prediction online to obtain true uncertainty prediction while using nonstationary data to analyze the performance of the data-driven predictor.

Recent research has shed valuable light on this process through the discovery of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein complex (EMC) and its role in membrane protein biogenesis and quality control. As part of my Ph.D. research in the Voorhees lab, I collaborated with esteemed scientists to investigate the EMC in atomic detail. Described in this thesis is the mechanistic basis of EMC function in membrane protein biogenesis, including recent insights into its broader role beyond its well-defined insertase function. First, we determined the structure of the human EMC using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The structure revealed that it utilizes a mechanism similar to other protein-conducting channels, which involves membrane thinning and polar intramembrane residues to transport substrate transmembrane domains from the cytosol into the membrane. The EMC structure provided the foundation for the subsequent rigorous analysis of its role in membrane protein biogenesis. Through this work, we demonstrate the molecular mechanisms involved in the EMC-dependent path a membrane protein takes, from its initial cytosolic capture by methionine-rich loops of the EMC to its eventual membrane insertion via a hydrophilic vestibule. We further show that specific polar intramembrane residues on the EMC serve as an ER \"selectivity filter\" which uses charge-repulsion properties to reject mis-targeted mitochondrial membrane proteins and maintain organelle integrity. We also demonstrate that the EMC ensures that transmembrane-spanning substrates adopt the correct topology by promoting the \"positive-inside\" rule, which states that positively and negatively charged amino acids localize to the interior (cytoplasmic) and exterior (non-cytoplasmic) sides of membranes, respectively. Finally, our studies suggest that the EMC has a broader role beyond its well-defined insertase function. Specifically, we found that the EMC physically binds to other factors involved in membrane protein biogenesis, providing a shared interaction surface that acts as a hub to integrate signals from other pathways. Using a combination of structural and functional approaches, we identified the EMC's interaction with Nodal modulator (NOMO) complex, which is part of the multipass translocon complex and facilitate membrane protein biogenesis. Together, these results define and expand the model for membrane protein biogenesis at the ER membrane by the EMC and highlight the complex interplay between different factors in this important process.

We find that the inconsistency between the results of the near-surface in situ methane measurements and the satellite remote sensing measurements can be reconciled if and only if an active methane emission hot spot is located in the immediate vicinity of the Curiosity rover in northwestern Gale crater, or unknown physical or chemical processes are rapidly removing methane. Chapter 3 presents a novel phenomenon that could exist on exoplanets\u2014self-sustained photochemical oscillations, which is only produced by 3D atmospheric models. We use a 3D, fully coupled, chemistry-radiation-dynamics model to simulate the ozone-NOx-HOx photochemistry in the atmosphere of a tidally locked Earth-like exoplanet in the circumstellar habitable zone, and calculate the transmission spectra during transits. We find that under certain conditions, biological nitrogen fixation like the one on the Earth can drive large-magnitude, self-sustained photochemical oscillations in the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets. The resulting large temporal variability in ozone abundance on exoplanets, if observed, may suggest a strong surface NOx emission source, which could signal extrasolar life participating in the nitrogen cycle on exoplanets. Fully coupled, three-dimensional atmospheric chemistry-radiation-dynamics models can reveal new phenomena that may not exist in one-dimensional models, and hence they are powerful tools for future planetary atmospheric research. Chapter 4 uses a 3D fluid dynamics model to study the vertical exchange in the upper part of Earth's ocean that potentially has great implications for the marine ecosystem. We develop scaling laws for the exchange rate between the surface ocean and the ocean interior which is critical to the rate of nutrient supply to phytoplankton near the ocean surface. These scaling laws could substitute the crude 1D parameterizations that are currently widely used in ocean models. We find that submesoscale turbulence energized by baroclinic instability in the ocean mixed layer can induce tracer exchange between the surface ocean and the ocean interior. Various environmental physical parameters affect the exchange rate. The exchange is stronger where the ocean mixed layer is thicker, the Richardson number (defined as the ratio of the squared buoyancy frequency to the squared vertical shear of the horizontal flow) of the thermocline is smaller, and the Richardson number of ocean mixed layer is larger. The associated nutrient supply from the ocean interior to the surface ocean is also expected to be stronger under these conditions.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Yung, Yuk L. and Callies, J\u00f6rn}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/1jz8-5t85, author = {Bernstein, Jeremy David}, title = {Optimisation & Generalisation in Networks of Neurons}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/1jz8-5t85}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:10132022-000100592}, abstract = { The goal of this thesis is to develop the optimisation and generalisation theoretic foundations of learning in artificial neural networks. The thesis tackles two central questions. Given training data and a network architecture: On optimisation, an essential feature of neural network training is that the network weights affect the loss function only indirectly through their appearance in the network architecture. This thesis proposes a three-step framework for deriving novel \"architecture aware\" optimisation algorithms. The first step\u2014termed functional majorisation\u2014is to majorise a series expansion of the loss function in terms of functional perturbations. The second step is to derive architectural perturbation bounds that relate the size of functional perturbations to the size of weight perturbations. The third step is to substitute these architectural perturbation bounds into the functional majorisation of the loss and to obtain an optimisation algorithm via minimisation. This constitutes an application of the majorise-minimise meta-algorithm to neural networks. On generalisation, a promising recent line of work has applied PAC-Bayes theory to derive non-vacuous generalisation guarantees for neural networks. Since these guarantees control the average risk of ensembles of networks, they do not address which individual network should generalise best. To close this gap, the thesis rekindles an old idea from the kernels literature: the Bayes point machine. A Bayes point machine is a single classifier that approximates the aggregate prediction of an ensemble of classifiers. Since aggregation reduces the variance of ensemble predictions, Bayes point machines tend to generalise better than other ensemble members. The thesis shows that the space of neural networks consistent with a training set concentrates on a Bayes point machine if both the network width and normalised margin are sent to infinity. This motivates the practice of returning a wide network of large normalised margin. Potential applications of these ideas include novel methods for uncertainty quantification, more efficient numerical representations for neural hardware, and optimisers that transfer hyperparameters across learning problems.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Yue, Yisong}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/cdja-ck19, author = {Hui, Yue}, title = {Applications of Genetically Engineered Bacillus subtilis in Biocatalysis and Functional Materials}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/cdja-ck19}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:07272022-064642720}, abstract = { Bacillus subtilis is a gram-positive model bacterium that forms endospores as a response to nutrient limitation and other environmental stresses. The B. subtilis spore contains a dehydrated core, where the bacterial genome is safely stored, and multilayer proteinaceous coats, protecting the spore from various physical and chemical insults. Because of the outstanding resilience of the B. subtilis spore, it has attracted increasing interest for application in biotechnology. In this thesis, we demonstrate the utilization of genetically engineered B. subtilis cells and spores for heterologous protein display and functional material synthesis and characterization. In Chapter 1, we review the fundamentals of sporulation and germination in B. subtilis. We highlight notable biotechnological applications of native and engineered B. subtilis spores in recent years. We also discuss limitations associated with prior studies that inspire us to pursue the work in this thesis. In Chapter 2, we describe the T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) enabled high density protein display on B. subtilis spores (TIED) method. The TIED constructs employ a coat protein promoter - PcotG, PcotV, or PcotZ - to drive the expression of the T7 RNAP. Target proteins are fused to the C-terminus of a spore crust protein - CotY or CotZ - and subjected to amplification by the T7 promoter. We prepare the endogenous constructs in which coat protein promoters directly regulate fusion protein expression for comparison with TIED. In addition, we develop a supplementary procedure to harvest spores before mother cell lysis, further improving the loading density of the target proteins. We verify the performance of the TIED architectures with a fluorescent reporter protein, mWasabi. Together with the early harvest protocol, the TIED method substantially enhances the total expression level and loading density of the crust-mWasabi fusion proteins relative to the endogenous expression system, as evidenced by bulk fluorescence measurements and microscopy. In Chapter 3, we implement the TIED architectures described in Chapter 2 for enzyme display on B. subtilis spores. We demonstrate the spore-based biocatalyst platform with three enzymes - lipase A and lipase B secreted by vegetative B. subtilis, and an engineered peroxidase, APEX2. We manifest that TIED enables massive accumulation of all three enzymes on the spore surface, with loading densities in the range of 106-107 enzymes per spore. Further, TIED-enzymes show comparable catalytic performance to the respective free-form enzymes, enhanced catalytic activity in methanol, and increased temperature stability. We conduct Michaelis-Menten studies to elucidate the kinetic characteristics of TIED-enzymes and their free form counterparts. Finally, we demonstrate that TIED-enzymes are not only recyclable, but also fully renewable after loss of activity through induction of germination and sporulation, demonstrating the potential for perpetual regeneration of the immobilized biocatalysts. In Chapter 4, we describe a new class of living composite materials (LCMs), in which genetically engineered B. subtilis cells and spores are effectively crosslinked into the surrounding polymeric scaffold. The resulting LCMs can be dried to yield portable materials. When re-immersed in aqueous media, entrapped cells and spores in previously- dried LCMs exhibit metabolic activity, including synthesis and secretion of recombinant proteins. Notably, we show that the scaffold based on photopolymerization of N-(hydroxymethyl) acrylamide (NHMAA) achieves effective cellular confinement, showing no evidence of cellular leakage over a period of 72 hours. We envision that the design principles elucidated in this work can provide a promising route to functional living materials engineered for biomedical and other applications.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Tirrell, David}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/qnah-sc58, author = {Dove, Lilian Aja}, title = {Impacts of Zonal Asymmetry on Southern Ocean Dynamics and Biogeochemistry}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/qnah-sc58}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05302023-201452585}, abstract = { The Southern Ocean is a key region for the ventilation and formation of intermediate and deep water masses. Interactions of the Southern Ocean's Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) with bathymetry can result in the diversion and compaction of frontal currents, resulting in standing meanders associated with enhanced mesoscale eddy kinetic energy (EKE) and submesoscale vertical velocities. As a result, standing meanders are thought to shape uptake and sequestration of heat and carbon across the ACC. In this thesis, I use observations from remote sensing and various autonomous underwater vehicles to investigate how physical mechanisms, from the submesoscale to the basin scale, shape the biogeochemical properties and tracer distributions of the Southern Ocean. Processes at the ocean's submesoscale can play a vital role in exchanging water across the base of the mixed layer, contributing to water mass ventilation. Data from over 20,000 profiles from biogeochemical-Argo floats across the ACC highlight that the high EKE regions associated with standing meanders have relatively reduced apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) values below the base of the mixed layer. This result, as well as larger AOU variance in deep potential density classes, suggests there is enhanced ventilation occurring in standing meanders. Further investigation suggests the observed increased ventilation is due to both along-isopycnal stirring and enhanced exchange across the base of the mixed layer by vertical velocities at the submesoscale, highlighting the importance of standing meanders in shaping temporal and spatial variability of biogeochemical cycles and air-sea exchange. Observations with horizontal scales of 2-4 kilometers in the standing meander associated with Crozet Plateau show that submesoscale processes are indeed ubiquitous. In this region, processes on the submesoscale to mesoscale spectrum play a role in enhancing surface frontal gradients and heightening tracer variability at depth. A separate field program provided novel observations at the submesoscale in Drake Passage during wintertime. The Polar Front, one of the major fronts of the ACC, is shown to be eddy-suppressing, suggesting that along-isopycnal submesoscale processes contribute to ventilation at the front. These spatial variations in stratification may additionally impact carbon fluxes between the atmosphere, surface mixed layer, and interior ocean. This thesis presents evidence that ventilation is a heterogeneous process across the Southern Ocean, with contributions from processes at physical scales that are undersampled by current observational programs.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Thompson, Andrew F.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/dyq0-vm69, author = {Kim, Gunho}, title = {Wave Propagation in Periodic Acoustic Metamaterials: from 1D to 3D}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/dyq0-vm69}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:03022023-175118888}, abstract = { Wave propagation in periodic structures has been studied for centuries; for example, Newton derived the velocity of sound based on a linear lattice. Recently, advanced manufacturing techniques have led to the fabrication of geometrically complex architected materials with acoustic properties unattainable by their constituent materials. Such rationally designed structures are often called acoustic metamaterials and they can be engineered to transmit, block, amplify, or redirect acoustic waves. Subwave-length building blocks, typically periodic (but not necessarily so), can be assembled into effectively continuous materials to manipulate dispersive properties of vibrational waves in ways that differ substantially in conventional media. This thesis investigates rationally designed acoustic metamaterials, ranging from 1D to 3D, and how acoustic wave propagation can be controlled by these artificially structured composite materials for ultrasound-related biomedical applications. I first explore 1D wave propagation in acoustic metamaterials to study the basic mechanics and relevant analysis skills. Bio-inspired helical mechanical metamaterials are designed and their normal modes are investigated. I demonstrate the ability to vary the acoustic properties of the helical metamaterials by perturbing the geometrical structure and mass distribution. By locally adding eccentric and denser elements in the unit cells, I change the moment of inertia of the system and introduce centro-asymmetry. This allows me to control the degree of mode coupling and the width of subwavelength band gaps in the dispersion relation, which are the product of enhanced local resonance hybridization. Then I study 2D wave propagation in microlattice acoustic metamaterials for ultra- sound manipulation. When coupled with pressure waves in the surrounding fluid, the dynamic behavior of microlattices in the long wavelength limit can be explained in the context of Biot's theory of poroelasticity. I exploit elastoacoustic wave propagation within 3D-printed polymeric microlattices to design a gradient refractive index lens for underwater wave focusing. A modified Luneburg lens index profile adapted for ultrasonic wave lensing is demonstrated via the finite element method and underwater testing, showcasing a computationally efficient poroelasticity-based design approach that enables accelerated design of acoustic wave manipulation devices. Lastly, I show that tailorable 3D wave propagation can be achieved based on the findings from the previous chapters. Functional ultrasound imaging enables sensitive, high-resolution imaging of neural activity in freely behaving animals and human patients. However, the skull acts as an aberrant and absorbing layer for sound waves, leading to most functional ultrasound experiments being conducted after skull removal. A microscale 2-photon polymerization technique is adopted to fabricate a conformal acoustic window with a high stiffness-to-density ratio and sonotransparency.

Over the last few years, many new methods have been proposed for bridging that ever-widening chasm, more than a few of which harness the latent graphical structure of genomic data to reduce the number of calculations required and pack the data tighter in memory. This body of work continues this development on three different, but related, fronts. Firstly, I present developments that greatly improve upon the efficiency of state-of-the-art methods for the quantification of RNA-seq reads, and describe a method that improves the accuracy of quantification without substantially increasing the computational over- head. Secondly, I introduce a procedure for the discovery of associations between novel gene isoforms and phenotypes, without prior knowledge of those isoforms.

Extensive geological and mineralogical evidence suggest that ancient Mars once had large volumes of surface liquid water, which likely persisted over timescales of 10 - 10 years during the Noachian era (e.g., Carr et al., 2003; Clifford et al., 2001; Barnhart et al., 2009; Schon et al., 2012). Explaining this evidence for surface liquid water is challenging, however, because of Mars's distant orbit and the lower luminosity of the young Sun 3-4 billion years ago. The faint young Sun paradox is an important problem in planetary science that challenges our ability to understand atmospheric evolution in general, including Earth, Mars, and rocky exoplanets (e.g., Sagan 1972). The precise composition and climate of the early atmosphere overtime largely remains an open question. In 2014, it was first recognized that early Mars could have been episodically warmed by the greenhouse effects of H in a CO atmosphere (e.g., Wordsworth et al., 2017); however, no sustained source of H was identified in the literature (noting that volcanism would have been short lived). Chapter 2 presents a solution: crustal hydration (the loss of surface water to reduced iron and hydrated minerals) likely supplied large fluxes of H. Over a timescale of 10 years (the upper limit for the duration of large volumes of surface liquid water), crustal hydration provides a flux of H into the atmosphere large enough to sustain a surface temperature >273 K in a 1 bar Noachian atmosphere. Importantly, Mars was likely warm over only a fraction of its early history, and cold early atmospheres likely also existed during early Mars' history. In cool climates, I find that a loss of atmospheric oxidants to the ground (to oxidize surface reduced iron) caused CO to convert to CO in agreement with the results of Zahnle et al. (2008). Furthermore, a warm and wet climate suggests early Mars may have been similar to early Earth; however, the climate alone is not enough to suggest that early Mars may have been habitable. In Chapters 3 and 4, I investigate whether Mars may have had a nitrogen cycle, which would be important for nitrogen fixation. I used KINETICS, the Caltech-JPL 1D photochemical model, to explain present day deposits in Mars' soil samples. The Sample Analysis at Mars instrument onboard Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) has baked several volatile species out of the unique rock record at Mars, including nitrate (e.g., Sutter et al., 2017). The formation of these species would originate in the atmosphere as a result of photochemistry. In Chapter 3, I discover that nitrogen fixation in a warm and wet climate with lightning is able to explain the weight percent of nitrate measured by the MSL; lightning-induced NOx forms nitric acid in the atmosphere, and this nitric acid may dissolve in water, rain out to the surface, and undergo photoreduction in shallow surface waters. In Chapter 4, I discover a comparable amount of pernitric acid may be explained from formation in an icy climate; SEP-induced N(2D) attacks CO to form NOx which reacts with HO to form HONO. The relatively new subfield of comparative planetology between Mars' evolution and exoplanet evolution (specifically, close-in super-Earths) will soon open, in the new era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). I have prepared for this subfield by working with a suite of established numerical models to investigate the formation of prebiotic species in the reduced atmospheres of super-Earths (in Chapter 5) and the aerosols at warm gas Giants. In Chapter 6, I discover that aggregate hazes at warm sub-Neptunes, which result from methane photolysis, can explain the observed flat exoplanet spectra and muted spectral features, including the observations of GJ 1214b.

Recognized for this important role and its powerful chemistry, TrpB has more recently been used for the in vitro synthesis of tryptophan analogs and other noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs). This thesis describes some of these efforts as well as the application of TrpB for developing new methods in directed enzyme evolution. Chapter I first establishes important topical background. It begins with a general account of directed enzyme evolution by exploring the emergence of new catalytic functions in natural and laboratory settings, and how this information and chemical intuition can be used to create enzymes for desired reactions. This is followed by a description of the state of the field of ncAA synthesis, with a special focus on biocatalytic approaches using engineered enzymes. Chapters II and III examine targeted engineering campaigns to create enzymes that can efficiently synthesize valuable blue-fluorescent ncAAs such as 4-cyanotryptophan (Chapter II) and -(1-azulenyl)--alanine (AzAla, Chapter III) from accessible starting materials. In Chapter IV, the native function of TrpB for -tryptophan biosynthesis is used as a selection pressure to develop an in vivo continuous evolution system. Despite a selection pressure for only -tryptophan synthesis the orthologous TrpB variants generated by this system varying promiscuous activities for -tryptophan analogs, paralleling the sequence-function diversity of natural enzyme homologs. Chapter V describes evSeq, an inexpensive and simple method for sequencing all protein variants generated during an engineering campaign, demonstrated by collecting ~800 TrpB sequence-function data points. Finally, in Chapter VI, directed evolution and chemical intuition are used to convert TrpB from a tryptophan synthase to a blue-fluorescent (NaphAla) and gram scales. Because TyrS synthesizes a primary metabolite, this transformation represents a noncanonical method for the biosynthesis of -tyrosine. This is the first example of a feasible new route for de novo aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, which occurs through a universally conserved set of chemistry across all of life.

The first chapter introduces these and other advantages of electrochemistry, as well as details regarding the thermodynamic potentials and kinetic barriers associated with alkyl halide reduction or ammonia oxidation.

These properties motivate new work in control theory, blending recent results in localized and distributed control with older results from robust and modern control.

Most existing algorithms suffer from either approximations that are too inaccurate, or fundamental computational complexity that is too high. In studies of simplified models of strongly-correlated materials, tensor network algorithms have demonstrated the potential to overcome these limitations. This thesis describes our research efforts to develop new algorithms for two-dimensional (2D) tensor networks that extend their range of applicability beyond simple models and toward simulations of realistic materials. We begin by describing three algorithms for projected entangled-pair states (PEPS, a type of 2D tensor network) that address three of their major limitations: numerical stability, long-range interactions, and computational efficiency of operators. We first describe (Ch. 2) a technique for converting a PEPS into a canonical form. By generalizing the QR matrix factorization to entire columns of a PEPS, we approximately generate a PEPS with analogous properties to the well-studied canonical 1D tensor network. This connection enables enhanced numerical stability and ground state optimization protocols. Next, we describe (Ch. 3) a technique to efficiently represent physically realistic long-range interactions between particles in a 2D tensor network operator, a projected entangled-pair operator (PEPO). We express the long-range interaction as a linear combination of correlation functions of an auxiliary system with only nearest-neighbor interactions. This allows us to represent long-range pairwise interactions with linear scaling in the system size. The third algorithm we present (Ch. 4) is a method to rewrite the 2D PEPO in terms of a set of quasi-1D tensor network operators, by exploiting intrinsic redundancies in the PEPO representation. We also report an on-the-fly contraction algorithm using these operators that allows for a significant reduction in computational complexity, enabling larger scale simulations of more complex problems. We then move on to describe (Ch. 5) an extensive study of a \"synthetic 2D material\"\u2014a two-dimensional square array of ultracold Rydberg atoms\u2014enabled by some of the new algorithms. We investigate the ground state quantum phases of this system in the bulk and on large finite arrays directly comparable to recent quantum simulation experiments. We find a greatly altered phase diagram compared to earlier numerical and experimental studies, and in particular, we uncover an unexpected entangled nematic phase that appears in the absence of geometric frustration. Finally, we finish by describing (Ch. 6) a somewhat unrelated, but topically similar project in which we investigate the feasibility of laser cooling small molecules with two metal atoms to ultracold temperatures.

Decentralized water treatment is regarded as an important supplement to the conventional wastewater treatment system to address the water sanitation and water pollution issues in rural, remote, and undeveloped regions. Electrochemical water treatment technology has been demonstrated to be feasible for decentralized water treatment systems because of the ambient operation conditions, robust performance, modular design, small footprint, and environmental compatibility. The performance of electrochemical water treatment systems relies heavily on the choice of electrodes. This thesis presents a comprehensive study towards understanding and optimizing the electrodes to enhance the performance and lower the cost of electrochemical water treatment systems. The research work on anodes followed an \"understanding - development\" approach and spanned both the scientific and engineering sides of the spectrum. Specifically, a comprehensive review was assembled through the analysis of existing literature on mixed metal oxide anodes. This review pointed towards potential future research directions. With the advancement of material sciences, it is important to focus not only on single catalytic metal elements, but also on the intermetallic electronic interaction to gain a deeper understanding of the catalytic activity of mixed metal oxides. The microscopic steric effects imposed by crystalline structures may also be a nonnegligible contributor to the catalytic properties. Following the review, this thesis scrutinized the catalytic sites of crystalline CoSbO, an emerging anode for chlorine evolution reaction (CER) catalysis. It has been demonstrated to be a promising alternative for the conventional Ru- and Ir-based anodes based on its high activity and excellent stability, but its catalytic sites and mechanism are still unknown. By fabricating and testing a series of anodes with different Sb/Co ratios, it was discovered that the surface Sb/Co ratios in CoSbO were ~50% higher than in the bulk. At the same time, it was surprising to find through scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) that Sb-rich samples showed higher catalytic activities, indicating that Sb sites may be even more active catalytic sites than the Co-sites. This was attributed to the electronic interaction between Co and Sb, as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). On the engineering side, a Ni-Sb-SnO reactive electrochemical membrane (REM) was developed to treat primary effluent and greywater. In 30 min, the REM removed up to 78 \u00b1 2% COD and 94 \u00b1 0.6% turbidity from the primary effluent. The REM had ~100% COD removal and 89 \u00b1 4% turbidity removal from greywater, with the effluent meeting the NSF/ANSI 350 standard. Compared to the conventional plate-type electrodes under the same conditions, the REM had 36% lower energy consumption for primary effluent treatment and 22% lower energy consumption for greywater treatment while yielding better treatment results. The REM-based electrochemical system was demonstrated to be a promising solution for decentralized wastewater treatment and recycling for single households and for vehicles. Last but not the least, this thesis presents the 3D-printing-derived carbon lattice as a monolithic electro-Fenton cathode. The Fenton reaction is one of the most important advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) that is widely used in water treatment to remove non-biodegradable pollutants, and heterogeneous electro-Fenton (HEF) process catalyzed by carbon-based cathodes has received considerable attention as an evolving branch due to its wide working pH range and independence from chemical dosing. However, the conventional carbon cathodes suffered from poorly controlled porosities, which hampered the mass transport and limited the overall catalytic performance. Three rationally-designed carbon lattice cathodes with different macroscopic porosities were fabricated and tested, showing that it was feasible to facilitate the mass transport by tuning the macroscopic electrode structure. Specifically, Grid-2% cathode, which had the largest macroscopic porosity, showed 157% higher specific activity for electrochemical HO production and 256% higher specific activity for trimethoprim degradation than the Star-2%, the one with the smallest macroscopic porosity. Grid-2% achieved 97% aqueous trimethoprim removal in 60 min, demonstrating the potential of the carbon lattice cathode to be used for water treatment and remediation.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Hoffmann, Michael R.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/y6rd-nm97, author = Synthesis Progress Myrsinane = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/y6rd-nm97}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06012023-171716967}, abstract = { The interplay between total synthesis and methodology is a driver of innovation in organic synthesis.

Herein, we present how total synthesis drives innovation in organic chemistry. First, a novel cyclization reaction between pyridine and glutaryl chloride is discussed, which has enabled the synthesis of seven lupin alkaloids. Next, the development of a convergent fragment coupling tactic based upon the semi-pinacol rearrangement is evaluated for its generality inspired by the total synthesis of several C19 diterpenoid alkaloids.

Modern wind turbines, like aircraft and other aerodynamic structures, are typically designed with the assumption that the flows they encounter will be uniform and steady. However, atmospheric flows are highly unsteady, and systems operating within them must contend with gust disturbances that can lead to performance losses and structural damage. Therefore, the next generation of wind-energy systems requires physics-informed design principles that effectively account for and even leverage these unsteady flow phenomena for enhanced power generation, robustness, and operational longevity. Accordingly, this work details experimental and analytical efforts to characterize unsteady aerodynamics in wind-turbine contexts. First, the effects of unsteady streamwise motion on turbine performance are studied, as recent work has suggested that these dynamics may enable time-averaged efficiencies that exceed the steady-flow Betz limit on turbine efficiency. The power production of and flow around a periodically surging wind turbine are thus investigated using wind-tunnel experiments, which suggest that turbines in these flow conditions could leverage unsteady surge motions for power-extraction gains of up to 6.4% over the stationary case. Linearized and nonlinear dynamical models of the response of the turbine to these time-varying flows are derived and validated against the experimental data. These models are also coupled with a potential-flow model of the upstream induction zone of the turbine in order to predict temporal variations in the flow velocities and pressures in this region. Unsteady contributions to the time-averaged efficiency are also considered through theoretical potential-flow derivations. Additionally, a novel three-dimensional particle-tracking velocimetry approach using artificial snow as seeding particles is deployed to obtain volumetric flow measurements in the wakes of full-scale vertical-axis wind turbines in field conditions. These measurements yield insights into the effects of unsteady vortex dynamics on the structure of the near wake, with implications for the performance of turbines in wind-farm arrays. These investigations provide the analytical and experimental foundations for future studies of unsteady atmospheric flows, and will lead to the development of principles and techniques for wind-farm siting, control, and optimization.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Dabiri, John O.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/jken-ty64, author \u00c9owyn}, title = {Advancement of Asymmetric Bipolar Membranes for Tailoring Chemical Environments in Electrochemical Systems}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/jken-ty64}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:02162023-233344819}, abstract = { Under reverse bias, bipolar membranes (BPMs) enhance water dissociation (WD) at the junction between a cation exchange layer (CEL) and an anion exchange layer (AEL), often with additional improvement from an integrated WD catalyst. Recent research has shown promise for developing and implementing BPMs in renewable energy systems, such as carbon removal, water and CO electrolysis, and energy storage. The economic feasibility of these carbon capture and conversion systems with incorporated BPMs, however, relies on BPMs to maintain stable operation at high current densities (>100 mA cm\u00b2) and low overpotentials. Existing commercial BPMs are limited to current densities of 100 mA cm\u00b2 as water transport through the CEL and AEL cannot keep up with the increased rate of WD at the junction at higher current densities. In this work, we present a freestanding, high current density BPM (HCD-BPM) with a thin AEL (15 m, PiperION 15R), a graphene oxide (GrOx) catalyst layer, and a mechanically supportive CEL (50 m, Nafion 212) specifically designed to overcome water transport limitations. When tested under reverse bias in a custom electrodialysis cell with Luggin capillaries, this HCD-BPM demonstrates the lowest published overpotentials up to 1 A cm\u00b2. Furthermore, the HCD-BPM exhibits stabilities of >1000 hour at 80 mA cm\u00b2, >100 hours at 500 mA cm\u00b2, and >60 hours at 1 A cm\u00b2, Faradaic efficiencies for H and OH of >95%, and successful implementation into a multi-cell electrodialysis stack designed for integration into a DOC system. Additional characterization, such as SEM, Confocal microscopy, and titration, was performed to understand the structure and performance of the HCD-BPM. Additionally, the BPM was tested in forward bias to investigate its use for acid/base flow batteries.

In this thesis, we combine a variety of techniques to study the earthquake cycle on multiple temporal and spatial scales, including satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to observe the slow deformation of the Earth over wide areas, and high-performance computational simulations to model faults during earthquakes. We begin by presenting a method for removing the signal of plate-tectonic motion in large-scale InSAR measurements, allowing for better observation of small ground deformations. We then use these corrections to study the Makran subduction zone, on the Iran-Pakistan border. Our InSAR-derived ground velocity map can resolve motions at the level of millimeters per year over an area of nearly one million square kilometers, and we use it to place constraints on the degree of coupling on the subduction megathrust. Next, we show how InSAR can be combined with deep learning techniques to rapidly map earthquake damage in all weather conditions, day and night. Such products will hopefully prove useful in future disaster response. Finally, we present computational simulations of dynamic earthquake ruptures with enhanced dynamic weakening due to thermal pressurization. We apply our simplified model to the creeping section of the San Andreas Fault, which is generally thought to be a barrier to earthquake rupture. Our results show how thermal pressurization can allow earthquakes to propagate partially or completely through the creeping section for a range of physically reasonable parameters.

Our macro-energy model incorporated multi-decadal weather datasets and revealed unique long-duration energy storage roles, such as seasonal and multi-year storage, that increase the affordability of wind- and solar-based electricity, informing technology investments and policy.

This thesis aims to expand the scope of proline analogs that can be accepted by E. coli, and demonstrate the utility of proline mutagenesis in modifying and studying protein behavior. In Chapter II, we describe the incorporation of three aliphatic proline residues into recombinantly-produced insulin, and find that these modest modifications at ProB28 alter the biophysical properties of the therapeutic protein. In particular, the addition of an exocyclic olefin at B28 accelerated insulin fibril formation, while 4-methyl substituents increased the rate of dissociation from the pharmaceutically-formulated insulin hexamer. We expand our proline mutagenesis approach to insulins in Chapter III. of ProB29 slowed fibril formation.

To address this challenge, cryo-ET can be combined with other methods, including X-ray crystallography, single-particle cryo-EM, structure predictions, cross-linking mass spectrometry, biochemistry, and evolutionary analysis to produce integrative models. Recently, with the development of AI-based tools such as AlphaFold2, structure prediction has played an increasingly important role in integrative modeling. The combination of cryo-ET and structure prediction in particular has provided unprecedented insights into the ultrastructure of cellular components.

Such examples of porous, low-fired potteries transitioned into vitreous and heat-resistant porcelain with the advancements of kiln technologies, which steadily grew to reach temperatures up to 1270 \u00b0C by the time of the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE). In the modern-age, furnaces technologies have become exceedingly more sophisticated, reaching ultra-high temperatures of up to 3000 \u00b0C with dedicated calibration systems. With the advancement of firing technologies came the advancement of materials processing methods, which have transformed the role of ceramics in everyday applications: from ceramic fibers used in tennis racquets, to ceramics used in space shuttle tiles and even in artificial joints. Indeed, ceramics are candidate solutions to the most stringent material problems faced today, including high-temperature applications like electric propulsion and turbine engine systems. However, in order to improve the long-term use and sustainability of ceramics, it is essential to evaluate both their performance and their eventual degradation from mechanical wear and chemical erosion. This work explores the processing-microstructure-performance relationship of ceramics to better understand the performance and degradation mechanisms of ceramic surfaces. This relationship is investigated using a series of material case studies, including (i) advanced high-temperature ceramics composed of h-BN rich composites, and (ii) historic ceramics, ranging from low-fired pottery to porcelain.

Recently, AAV engineering efforts by our group and others have expanded the toolbox of AAV vectors to include capsid variants that traverse the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) in rodents. However, not all engineered AAV capsids translate from mice to non-human primates (NHPs). This is especially true for translation to the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), an Old World primate that is the predominant NHP model and shares a more recent common ancestor with humans (~25 million years ago) compared to rodents (~75 million years ago) and New World primates, such as the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus; ~35 million years ago). The primary contents of this dissertation will focus on the development of AAV.CAP-Mac as a vector for non-invasive gene-transfer to the NHP brain and demonstrations of its utility to interrogate neuronal morphology and physiology in the macaque central nervous system. We identified and selected CAP-Mac using a multi-species selection strategy in adult marmosets and infant macaques, where it demonstrated improved delivery efficiency compared to AAV9 and other engineered variants. In individual characterization, CAP-Mac was biased towards neurons in two infant Old World primate species, the rhesus macaque and the green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus). Given this neuronal tropism in Old World primates, we demonstrated how CAP-Mac can be readily used for non-invasive, Brainbow-like labeling of macaque neurons and calcium imaging of GCaMP ex vivo.

Though it consists primarily of carbonate grains surrounded by carbonate cements, such as might be found forming in any shallow carbonate platform, this record also contains one of Brazil's most extensive sedimentary phosphate deposits. In these deposits, phosphate is concentrated as carbonate fluorapatite cements (CFA) in digitate stromatolites, distinctively finger-like, branching accretionary structures likely formed by the accumulation of sediment by microbial mats and biofilms.

Several external stimuli can supply energy to facilitate productive chemical transformations. In recent years, that list has grown to include mechanical force. In the growing field of polymer mechanochemistry, privileged, mechanically sensitive molecules called mechanophores undergo desirable chemical reactions under force. Force is transduced to mechanophores through covalently attached polymer chains. Among many applications, mechanophores that react to produce colored species can be used for visual stress and damage detection in plastics. Naphthopyran is a highly modular molecular switch that can undergo ring-opening reaction to generates intensely colored merocyanine dyes. The studies described in this dissertation have thoroughly established the versatility and complexity of naphthopyran-based mechanochromic mechanophores. In Chapter 1, the history of naphthopyran molecular switches is summarized with particular emphasis on the exhaustive and generalizable merocyanine structure-property relationships established for photochromic mechanophores. Mechanochromic structure-function relationships are highlighted, as well as a series of studies using the naphthopyran platform for illustration of the unusual reaction pathways accessible under force, and studies demonstrating that multimodal naphthopyrans are an ideal platform for multicolor mechanochromism. As discussed extensively in Chapter 1, merocyanines are typically susceptible to thermal recyclization. However, Chapter 2 describes a scissile naphthopyran mechanophore that undergoes an unusual secondary mechanochemical ester after the ring-opening reaction. By revealing a -hydroxy ketone group with a stable intramolecular hydrogen bonding interaction, mechanical force uniquely generates persistent merocyanine species. The irreversible reaction sequence described in Chapter 2 enables determination of mechanochemical reaction kinetics under solution-phase ultrasound-mediated mechanical force. However, common methods for determining reaction rate constants under these conditions are time-intensive and convoluted by the competitive side reaction of nonspecific polymer backbone scission. In Chapter 3, through model studies on the highly efficient scissile naphthopyran and a comparatively inefficient coumarin dimer mechanophore, we validate a time-efficient and accurate initial rates method for determination of selective mechanophore reaction kinetics under ultrasonication. The ability to colorimetrically report on the magnitude of applied stress is a grand challenge in the field of mechanochromism. Chapter 4 describes the first single mechanophore capable of such behavior. Mechanical force induces unexpectedly simultaneous ring-opening reactions from a bis-naphthopyran mechanophore, biasing a dynamic equilibrium between two distinct merocyanine states to effect gradient force-dependent multicolor mechanochromism. In further studies seeking multicolor mechanochromic systems, it was discovered that mechanical force facilitates the first reported dual-ring-opening reaction of naphthodipyran.

The third most common cardiovascular disease is aortic stenosis (AS). AS is most commonly characterized as a stiffening of the native trileaflet aortic valve, which impedes blood flow into the aorta and puts extra stress on the heart. The aorta is the main artery that supplies oxygenated blood to the body. AS has been widely studied in the past. However, there has been little work in understanding the complex effects that non uniform stiffening of the aortic valve can have on the hemodynamics inside the aorta. The most effective treatment for AS is to replace the stiffened valve with a prosthetic valve. Care must be taken to ensure that the replacement actually performs better hemodynamically. A major metric for prosthetic valve performance is the transvalvular pressure drop which is a measure of how much pressure, and energy, is lost as the heart pumps blood through the valve. Generally speaking, larger valves exhibit a smaller pressure drop because they restrict the flow to a lesser degree. This phenomenon has led to a trend for surgeons to implant the largest prosthetic valve possible, and in some cases, to expanding the aorta to fit even larger valves. However, there has been relatively little work done on determining the effects of valve oversizing on the blood flow inside the Aorta. The aims of this study were two-fold. First, a model of AS was tested inside an in vitro aortic simulator in order to identify how different individual leaflet stiffnesses would affect blood flow. Digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) was used to measure velocity profiles inside a model aorta. The DPIV results were used to estimate the wall shear stress and blood residence time. Our analysis suggests that leaflet asymmetry greatly affects the amount of WSS by vectoring the systolic jet and that stiffened leaflets have an increased residence time. This study indicates that valve leaflets with different stiffness conditions can have a more significant impact on wall shear stress than stenosis caused by the uniform increase in all three leaflets (and the subsequent increased systolic velocity) alone. Second, the experimental apparatus was used to test different prosthetic valve sizes and valve mounting methods in order to identify how they affected residence time inside the sinus bulge. Dye residence experiments and DPIV were used to measure fluid stasis in several different combinations of prosthetic valve sizes, sinus sizes, and valve mounting methods. Our results indicate that valve to sinus sizing and mounting method is very important and can lead to greatly increased residence time and thrombosis risk. We have also identified a metric that can predict the threshold at which valves become oversized.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Gharib, Morteza}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/5sb5-fm96, author = {H\u00e4geli Stefan P.}, = {Experimental Study on the Thermodynamic Interactions of Phonons and Magnetism in Fe Systems}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/5sb5-fm96}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06012023-173549089}, abstract = { The macroscopic thermophysical behavior of materials is governed by their atomic level excitations and how they store heat. Most of the thermal energy excites oscillations of the atoms, quantized as phonons, but in magnetic materials a considerable amount of heat is also absorbed by fluctuations of the electronic spins. This thesis explores the thermodynamics of phonons and magnetic spins in Fe-systems: we investigate the coupling between these excitations in Fe, Fe-Ni, and Fe-C, quantify their size dependency in nanocrystalline in NiFe, and assess their individual roles in the anomalous thermal expansion of Fe-Ni Invar. Most materials expand when heated due to enhanced atomic oscillations. However, in 1895 C.E. Guillaume combined Fe and Ni to discover a material with near-zero thermal expansion, called Invar. This discovery was awarded the 1920 Physics Nobel Prize and sparked thousands of scientific investigations. Since the anomalous Invar effect is associated with magnetism, nearly all studies have focused on the electronic and spin structure of Fe-Ni. But phonons are needed to complete the picture, and to date, the anomalous Invar behavior is not fully understood. Here, we explore a method for measuring thermal expansion that is capable of isolating contributions from phonons and spins. Since the thermal energy of materials is related to entropy, the thermal expansion can be indirectly determined through individual entropic contributions by using a Maxwell relation. The phonon and magnetic entropies were measured by combining two nuclear resonant x-ray scattering techniques, with samples under pressure in diamond-anvil cells. We show that the Invar behavior stems from a competition between phonons and spins, that oppose each other for near-zero thermal expansion. A spin-phonon coupling improves the precision of this cancellation, extending the range of Invar behavior. Such a coupling of phonons and spin was also observed in pure Fe and FeC cementite, as their phonon energies correlate to the change in magnetization. This motivated us to develop a magnetic quasi-harmonic model for Fe and FeC, which accounts well for the deviation of phonon energies from pure volumetric effects of the conventional quasi-harmonic approximation. The thermodynamics of materials is also affected by the size of their crystallites. We determined the size effects on the heat absorption by phonons, electrons, and spins in nanocrystalline NiFe. All excitations become enhanced in the nanomaterial. In particular, the redistribution of spectral weights amplifies the phonon entropy. This helps stabilize the nanostructure against the enthalpy from its extra grain boundaries. However, the nanostructure is meta-stable, and the grains will grow into their bulk counterpart when diffusion is enabled at elevated temperatures.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Fultz, Brent T.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/bfsb-6438, author = {Zhang, Cheng}, title = {The Development and Performance of the First BICEP Array Receiver at 30 and 40 GHz for Measuring the Polarized Synchrotron Foreground}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/bfsb-6438}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:08222022-081848931}, abstract = { The existence of the CMB marks a big success of the lambda cold dark matter standard model, which describes the universe's evolution with six free parameters. The inflationary theory was added to the picture in the '80s to explain the initial conditions of the universe. Scalar perturbations from inflation seeded the formation of the large-scale structure and produced the curl-free E-mode polarization pattern in the CMB. On the other hand, tensor fluctuations sourced primordial gravitational waves (PGW), which could leave unique imprints in the CMB polarization: the gradient-free B-mode pattern. The amplitude of B modes is directly related to the tensor-to-scalar ratio r of the primordial fluctuations, which indicates the energy scale of inflation. The detection of the primordial B modes will be strong supporting evidence of inflation and give us opportunities to study physics at energy scales far beyond what can ever be accessed in laboratory experiments on the Earth. Currently, the main challenge for the B-mode experiments is to separate the primordial B modes from those sourced by matter between us and the last scattering surface: the galactic foregrounds and the gravitational lensing effect. The two most important foregrounds are thermal dust and synchrotron, which have very different spectral properties from the CMB. Thus the key to foreground cleaning is the high sensitivity data at multiple frequency bands and the accurate modeling of the foregrounds in data analyses and simulations. In this dissertation, I present my work on ISM and dust property studies which enriched our understanding of the foregrounds. The BICEP/Keck (BK) experiments build a series of polarization-sensitive microwave telescopes targeting degree-scale B-modes from the early universe. The latest publication from the collaboration with data taken through 2018 reported tensor-to-scalar ratio r0.05 < 0.036 at 95% C.L., providing the tightest constraint on the primordial tensor mode. BICEP Array is the latest generation of the series experiments. The final configuration of the BICEP Array has four BICEP3-class receivers spanning six frequency bands, aiming to achieve (r) 0.003. The first receiver of the BICEP Array is at 30 and 40 GHz, constraining the synchrotron foregrounds.

Most importantly, the learning system must interact with the rest of the autonomous system (e.g., highly nonlinear and non-stationary dynamics) in a way that safeguards against catastrophic failures with formal guarantees. In addition, from both computational and statistical standpoints, the learning system must incorporate prior knowledge for efficiency and generalizability. This thesis presents progress towards establishing a unified framework that fundamentally connects learning and control. First, Part I motivates the benefit and necessity of such a unified framework by the Neural-Control Family, a family of nonlinear deep-learning-based control methods with not only stability and robustness guarantees but also new capabilities in agile robotic control.

Chapter 1 contributes to the literature on reference dependent preferences, chapter 2 introduces a new solution concept for games played by teams of players, and chapter 3 analyzes a model of biased beliefs in law enforcement. In Chapter 1, I study the role of reference dependent preferences in motivating effort in online chess. In online chess, players are assigned ratings that measure chess skill and update after every game. I find evidence of bunching above round numbers in the distribution of ratings, suggesting that players care about their rating and that round numbers serve as reference points. I estimate a dynamic discrete choice model of the decision to end a playing session that nests both loss aversion and an alternative 'aspiration' specification involving a discrete jump in utility at reference points. I reject loss aversion in favor of aspirational preferences. I show that higher skilled players are significantly more aspirational, and that aspiration does not diminish with experience. In Chapter 2, coauthored with Jeongbin Kim and Thomas R. Palfrey, we develop a general framework for the analysis of games where each player is a team and members of the same team all receive the same payoff. The framework combines standard non-cooperative game theory with collective choice theory, and is developed for both strategic form and extensive form games. We introduce the concept of team equilibrium and identify conditions under which it converges to Nash equilibrium with large teams. We identify conditions on the collective choice rules such that team decisions are stochastically optimal: the probability the team chooses an action is increasing in its equilibrium expected payoff. The theory is illustrated with some binary action games. In Chapter 3, I model a social welfare maximizing law enforcement agency that does not know the supply of crime, that may have incorrect beliefs about its ability to detect crime, and that only observes the quantity of crime that it detects. An equilibrium is defined in which the enforcement agency is not surprised by the crime data it observes, and believes itself to be maximizing social welfare. Sufficient conditions for existence are provided. The model is shown to capture the intuition of crime-policing 'feedback loops' in which inefficient overpolicing or underpolicing is supported in equilibrium.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Palfrey, R.}, } Escobedo, Fabricio Gianfranco}, title = {Numerical Analysis of Folding and Deployment Dynamics of Thin Shell Structures with Localized Folds}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/gt81-0s18}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06012023-233806562}, abstract = {This thesis focuses on the analysis of tape springs folded in the opposite sense and their dynamic deployment, and aims to use methods to reduce the computational cost of the analysis.

As a result, BCI control in physical settings remains frustratingly difficult for paralyzed users. To improve dexterous BCI control, I studied the neural coding of individual finger movements in the posterior parietal cortex and motor cortex of tetraplegic participants. These regions are directly involved in dexterous hand movements and are candidates for BCI recording implants. Finger coding matched the correlation structure and dynamics of able-bodied usage, reflecting preserved motor circuits even after paralysis. Individual finger movements of each hand were coded in a factorized, correlated manner that still allowed decoding. Participants controlled artificial fingers with state-of-the-art accuracy.

This substance is ubiquitous in nature and industry, with examples ranging from soils, jointed rocks, foodstuffs, ball bearings, powders, and even asteroids. As such, understanding granular materials is necessary for making sense of the physical world. Tremendous progress has been made in directly simulating granular materials in the previous decades, in particular via the discrete element method (DEM). Nevertheless, there remains ample opportunity for manipulating granular materials to achieve specific outcomes by leveraging the DEM. The research presented in this thesis utilizes DEM simulations to develop tools and strategies for manipulating granular material to achieve desired attributes. These attributes include the shape of individual grains, the structure of granular tunnels, and mesoscopic packing characteristics such as packing fraction and coordination number. Optimization of granular materials is considered at 3 different scales: at the single grain scale (100 grains), at the scale of granular structures such as arches (101 grains), and at the mesoscopic scale (103 grains). The first component of this thesis considers automated design of individual grain shapes that embody user-specified morphological properties via genetic algorithms. Next, excavation in granular materials is considered. It is studied how ants can so successfully manipulate granular materials to achieve stable systems by mapping the forces around real ant tunnels. Ant tunnels are simulated using a DEM which can handle arbitrary shaped grains: the Level-Set Discrete Element Method (LS-DEM). Finally, tools are developed for controlling mesoscopic attributes of granular materials as a function of grain shape. To do so, genetic algorithms and a deep generative model are combined with LS-DEM. The methodologies introduced in this thesis serve as a foundation for controlling granular material attributes.

In Chapter 1, I introduce a fully rational model of social learning on networks with endogenous action timing. I show that the structure of the network can play an important role in the aggregation of information. When the social network contains high-degree vertices, agents can be arbitrarily likely to make good choices. In contrast, when the social network is linear, there is a bound on how likely agents are to make good choices which holds regardless of how patient they are. The main contribution of this chapter is the identification of a novel mechanism through which strategic behavior can substantially impede the flow of information through a social network. In Chapter 2, co-authored with Vadim Martynov and Omer Tamuz, we study the asymptotic rate at which the probability of taking the correct action converges to 1 in the classical sequential learning model with unbounded signals. We provide a characterization of the asymptotic law of motion of the public belief, and we use this characterization to show that convergence occurs more slowly than when agents directly observe private signals, and that the expected time until the last incorrect action can be finite or infinite. In Chapter 3, co-authored with Laurent Bartholdi, Maya Josyula, Omer Tamuz, and Leeat Yariv, we introduce equitability as a less stringent alternative to symmetry for modeling egalitarianism in voting rules.

The lack of efficient sweat sampling creates inaccurate sensing results from sweat mixing with skin contaminants or sensing byproducts. Moreover, the lack of evaluation of sweat metabolites with respect to relevant clinical conditions and the lack of scalable fabrication technique pose hurdles in the eventual applications of non-invasive sweat monitoring.

More recently, reductive cross-coupling catalyzed by nickel has emerged as a complementary synthetic approach that couples electrophilic fragments and is rendered catalytic by the inclusion of a terminal reductant. These reactions are advantageous because the use electrophiles as coupling partners which display greater stability, functional group tolerance, and commercial availability over the corresponding nucleophilic coupling partners. Additionally, Ni catalysts are less prone to -hydride elimination compared to later transition metals which enables C(sp\u00b3)-C(sp) couplings. The challenge with using coupling partners of the same polarity is developing a catalyst that can activate each electrophile in a mechanistically distinct way in order to get high levels off cross-selectivity, over statistical mixtures of cross- and homocoupled products. Herein, we describe a mechanistic investigation on Ni-catalyzed cross-electrophile couplings developed in redox properties of the Ni-bis(oxazoline) catalyst, the reaction kinetics, and mode of electrophile activation show divergent mechanisms for these two related transformations. Notably, the mechanism of C(sp\u00b3) activation changes from a Ni-mediated process when benzyl chlorides and Mn are used to a reductant-mediated process that is gated by a Lewis acid when NHP esters and tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene is used. Kinetic experiments show that changing the identity of the Lewis acid can be used to tune the rate of NHP ester reduction. Spectroscopic studies support a Ni^()-alkenyl oxidative addition complex as the catalyst resting state. DFT calculations suggest an enantiodetermining radical capture step and elucidate the origin of enantioinduction for this Ni-BOX catalyst. Efforts to expand the scope of coupling partners in XEC reactions to include novel classes of electrophiles, such as N-alkyl imines, are also described. The preparation umpolung-type alkylation under mild conditions, avoids the pre-generation of organometallic reagents, and exhibits good functional group tolerance.

While direct numerical simulations (DNS) and global analysis can be used, the large grids required make the stability calculations expensive, particularly when a large parameter space is required. At the same time, parabolized stability equations are non-convergent and unreliable for problems involving multi-modal and non-modal interactions. We therefore apply the One-Way Navier-Stokes (OWNS) Equations to study transitional hypersonic boundary layers. OWNS is based on a rigorous, approximate parabolization of the equations of motion that removes disturbances with upstream group velocity using a higher-order recursive filter. We extend the original algorithm by considering non-orthogonal curvilinear coordinates and incorporate full compressibility with temperature-dependent fluid properties. The generalized OWNS methodology is validated by comparing to DNS data for flat plates and a sharp cone, and to linear stability theory results for local disturbances on the centerline of the Mach 6 HIFiRE-5 elliptic cone. OWNS provides DNS-quality results for the former flows at a small fraction of the computational expense. We further demonstrate the capability of OWNS to track fully 3D instabilities by applying the algorithm to a complex Mach 6 finned-cone geometry as well as a 3D Mach 1.5 turbulent jet. It is often desirable, especially for design purposes, to compute worst-case disturbances, i.e. solving the inverse problem, otherwise known as resolvent or input-output analysis. While DNS and global analysis can be used to compute optimal forced responses, their large computational expense render these tools less practical for large design parameter spaces. We address this issue by modifying the original OWNS framework to find the optimal forcing and responses using Lagrangian multipliers via an iterative, adjoint-based, space-marching technique that appreciably reduces the computational burden compared to the global approach that uses singular value decomposition without sacrificing accuracy. The input-output OWNS model is validated against optimal forcings and responses of a Mach 4.5 flat-plate boundary layer from literature and a Mach 1.5 turbulent jet. We then apply these equations to study worst-case disturbances on the centerline of the Mach 6 HIFiRE-5 elliptic cone and on a highly cooled Mach 6 flat-plate boundary layer. Although the worst-case forcings are theoretically informative, they are not physically realizable. In natural receptivity analysis, disturbances are forced by matching local solutions within the boundary layer to outer solutions consisting of free-stream vortical, entropic, and acoustic disturbances. We pose a scattering formalism to restrict the input forcing to a set of realizable disturbances associated with plane-wave solutions of the outer problem. The formulation is validated by comparing with DNS of a Mach 4.5 flat-plate boundary layer. We show that the method provides insight into transition mechanisms by identifying those linear combinations of plane-wave disturbances that maximize energy amplification over a range of frequencies.

Compared with Burer-Monteiro factorization in the Euclidean space, using the low-rank matrix manifold has its unique advantages, as it eliminates duplicated spurious points and reduces the polynomial order of the objective function. Yet a few fundamental questions have remained unanswered until recently. We highlight two problems here in particular, which are the global geometry of the manifold and the global convergence guarantee. As for the global geometry, we point out that there exist some spurious critical points on the boundary of the low-rank matrix manifold M, which have rank smaller than r but can serve as limit points of iterative sequences in the manifold M. For the least squares loss function, the spurious critical points are rank-deficient matrices that capture part of the eigen spaces of the ground truth. Unlike classical strict saddle points, their Riemannian gradient is singular and their Riemannian Hessian is unbounded. We show that randomly initialized Riemannian gradient descent almost surely escapes some of the spurious critical points. To prove this result, we first establish the asymptotic escape of classical strict saddle sets consisting of non-isolated strict critical submanifolds on Riemannian manifolds. We then use a dynamical low-rank approximation to parameterize the manifold M and map the spurious critical points to strict critical submanifolds in the classical sense in the parameterized domain, which leads to the desired result. Our result is the first to partially overcome the nonclosedness of the low-rank matrix manifold without altering the vanilla gradient descent algorithm. Numerical experiments are provided to support our theoretical findings. As for the global convergence guarantee, we point out that earlier approaches to many of the low-rank recovery problems only imply a geometric convergence rate toward a second-order stationary point. This is in contrast to the numerical evidence, which suggests a nearly linear convergence rate starting from a global random initialization. To establish the nearly linear convergence guarantee, we propose a unified framework for a class of low-rank matrix recovery problems including matrix sensing, matrix completion, and phase retrieval. All of them can be considered as random sensing problems of low-rank matrices with a linear measurement operator from some random ensembles. These problems share similar population loss functions that are either least squares or its variant. We show that under some assumptions, for the population loss function, the Riemannian gradient descent starting from a random initialization with high probability converges to the ground truth in a nearly linear convergence rate, i.e., it takes O(log 1/ + log n) iterations to reach an -accurate solution. The key to establishing a nearly optimal convergence guarantee is closely intertwined with the analysis of the spurious critical points S_# on M. Outside the local neighborhoods of spurious critical points, we use the fundamental convergence tool by the ojasiewicz inequality to derive a linear convergence rate. In the spurious regions in the neighborhood of spurious critical points, the Riemannian gradient becomes degenerate and the ojasiewicz inequality could fail. By tracking the dynamics of the trajectory in three stages, we are able to show that with high probability, Riemannian gradient descent escapes the spurious regions in a small number of steps. After addressing the two problems of global geometry and global convergence guarantee, we use two applications to demonstrate the broad applicability of our analytical tools. The first is the robust principal component analysis problem on the manifold M with the Riemannian subgradient method. The second application is the convergence rate analysis of the Sobolev gradient descent method for the nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii eigenvalue problem on the infinite dimensional sphere manifold. These two examples demonstrate that the analysis of manifold first-order algorithms can be extended beyond the previous framework, to nonsmooth functions and subgradient methods, and to infinite dimensional Hilbert manifolds. This exemplifies that the insights gained and tools developed for the low-rank matrix manifold M can be extended to broader scientific and technological fields.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Hou, Thomas Y.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/pahb-cx81, author = {Shen, Cheng}, title = {Computational Imaging for Phase Retrieval and Biomedical Applications}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/pahb-cx81}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05272023-062623589}, abstract = { In conventional imaging, optimizing hardware is prioritized to enhance image quality directly.

The first half of the thesis begins with Fourier ptychography, which was employed to overcome chromatic aberration problems in multispectral imaging. Then, we proposed a novel computational coherent imaging modality based on Kramers-Kronig relations, aiming to replace Fourier ptychography as a non-iterative method. While this approach showed promise, it lacks certain essential characteristics of the original Fourier ptychography. To address this limitation, we introduced two additional algorithms to form a whole package scheme. Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrated that the combined scheme outperforms Fourier ptychography in achieving high-resolution, large field-of-view, aberration-free coherent imaging. The second half of the thesis shifts focus to deep-learning-based methods. In one project, we optimized the scanning strategy and image processing pipeline of an epifluorescence microscope to address focus issues. Additionally, we leveraged deep-learning-based object detection models to automate cell analysis tasks. In another project, we predicted the polarity status of mouse embryos from bright field images using adapted deep learning models. These findings highlight the capability of computational imaging to automate labor-intensive processes, and even outperform humans in challenging tasks.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Yang, Changhuei}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/2j2b-f649, author = {Blunt, Sarah}, title = {The Orbits of Young Extrasolar Planets as Formation Probes}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/2j2b-f649}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06032023-031445650}, abstract = { In this thesis, I have translated a few flavors of exoplanet timeseries measurements into constraints on exoplanet orbital parameters, and used these to make inferences about planet formation. I begin by introducing the two main observational techniques I used to perform these analyses: optical interferometry and stellar radial velocity monitoring. I then discuss some of the big open questions of exoplanet formation, particularly the mechanism for forming giant planets close to and far from their stars, where core accretion is thought to be too inefficient to form giant planet cores in time for them to accrete atmospheres. High cadence radial velocity monitoring enables advances in our understanding of stellar activity, the fundamental stumbling block in the path to discovering and characterizing planets like the Earth. In my second thesis chapter, I present an argument that previously published RV-derived activity models of the PMS star V1298~Tau suffer from overfitting, casting doubt on published mass estimates of the young planets in the system which necessitated rapid contraction after formation, in tension with formation theory. I walk through several potential explanations for this overfitting, pointing out that the star has a strong differential rotation signal which is not included in published model fits, and encourage broader use of cross validation techniques in stellar activity model evaluation. Optical interferometry, particularly using the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument, enables astrometry measurements that are orders of magnitude more precise than contemporary coronographic instruments, which translates to precise orbital parameters. In my third thesis chapter, I present and analyze two new VLTI/GRAVITY astrometric measurements of a young, widely separated planet and use them to make a preliminary argument that the planet's eccentricity is low or moderate. This sets an upper limit on the time (relative to disk dispersal) that the planet attained its current wide separation, and downweights the possibility of scattering after disk dispersal. In the next two chapters, I showcase my contributions to two widely used open-source orbit-fitting software toolkits: orbitize! and radvel. I highlight two major new features of orbitize! that are available in the main code base as of the release of version 2: jointly fitting radial velocity measurements and jointly fitting absolute astrometry measurements. In the radvel chapter, I motivate and describe an updated Gaussian Process regression model for stellar activity modeling that reduces the potential for overfitting.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Howard, Andrew W.}, } Generalized = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/nky2-p424}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:01312023-163405681}, abstract = {We theoretically study a mechanical system of two coupled harmonic oscillators with arbitrary damping kernels.

The balance of these forces depends on factors like the salt concentration, solution pH, and properties of the surface. The current work outlines the thermodynamics of charged systems and investigates the structure and phase behavior of polyelectrolytes near solid surfaces. In particular, the work covers the thermodynamic aspects of preferential adsorption of small ions in electric double layers, polyelectrolyte adsorption, polymer-mediated interactions of surfaces using strong and weak electrolytes, surface phase transitions and contact angles of complex coacervates on solid surfaces, complexation-induced conformational phase transitions of polyelectrolyte brushes, and electro-swelling of weak polyelectrolyte brushes.

A fundamental goal of biology is to understand the design principles of these multicellular circuits, and use these principles to design synthetic multicellular systems for therapeutic purposes. Top-down approaches, for example analyzing embryos bearing genetic mutations, have identified key genes in many multicellular circuits, but are challenging to study these circuits in an isolated context and in a quantitative and systematic manner. An alternative, complementary approach is to engineer or reconstitute multicellular circuits from bottom-up, which allows us to overcome the limitations of top-down approach and gain quantitative insights into multicellular circuit design. In this thesis, we use this bottom-up approach to explore the design principles of two multicellular circuits. In the first project, we took inspiration from two prevalent features from natural multistable circuits, namely competitive protein-protein interactions and positive autoregulation, to design a synthetic multistable circuit architecture called MultiFate. Both in the model and in the experiment, MultiFate circuits generate multiple cellular states, each stable for weeks, allow control over state-switching and state stability, and can be easily expanded to generate more states. In the second project, we use a gradient reconstitution system to systematically analyze a gradient modulation circuit consisting of BMP4 and its modulators, Chordin, Twsg and BMP-1. We found that the circuit can give rise to diverse gradient modulation capabilities. In particular, the full circuit is sufficient for active ligand shuttling and generation of non-monotonic displaced gradient.

Relative to proteins, complex nucleic acid-based systems can be designed more readily due to the countable nature of base-pairing interactions and readily available physical models. These features of nucleic acids enable us to design novel interaction pathways and functions by providing well-behaved molecular mechanisms. Two examples of these mechanisms are the conditional guide RNA (cgRNA) and the hybridization chain reaction (HCR). A cgRNA is a conditional programmable regulator where an expressed RNA trigger can conditionally turn on or off transcriptional regulation. HCR is a molecular mechanism for in vitro and in situ amplification of signals to spatially identify proteins, RNA, or DNA in a sample. This thesis will first demonstrate the use of these nucleic acid molecular mechanisms in closed-loop genetic circuits and infectious disease testing using cgRNAs and HCR, respectively, then provide updated tools for the nucleic acid design community to exploit the programmable nature of nucleic acids. We begin by demonstrating the use of conditional programmable cgRNAs in closed-loop genetic circuits. Synthetic genetic circuits allow scientists to engineer arbitrary molecular interactions in living organisms. Feedback circuits in particular are recurrently found in nature and enable useful functionalities. However, protein components of genetic circuits cannot be designed scalably, are often mined from preexisting genomes, and present difficulties in being biologically orthogonal to themselves or the host organism. We are motivated to address these limitations by using orthogonal nucleic acid circuits created de novo. One potential component of these circuits are conditional guide RNAs (cgRNAs). cgRNAs are switchable transcriptional regulators, and this allows gene expression to be modulated through the expression of a small RNA trigger. Here we assess cgRNAs as a component for feedback genetic circuits. As an initial demonstration of cgRNA synthetic circuits, we built and validated a simple threshold circuit and demonstrated its orthogonality and scalability by showing independent circuit functions of two switches in a single cell. We also created a larger toggle switch that is made from the same components as the previous switches. These experiments show the orthogonality and feedback capabilities of cgRNAs will position them as a composable component for scalable synthetic biology. We then used the hybridization chain reaction mechanism to develop an adaptable and sensitive test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The lateral flow assay format enables rapid, instrument-free, at-home testing for SARS-CoV-2. Due to the absence of signal amplification, this simplicity comes at a cost in sensitivity. Here, we enhance sensitivity by developing an amplified lateral flow assay that incorporates isothermal, enzyme-free signal amplification based on the mechanism of hybridization chain reaction (HCR). The simplicity of the user experience after the test begins is maintained by using a disposable 3-channel lateral flow device to automatically deliver reagents to the test region in three successive stages without user interaction. Prior to starting the test, a 15-minute heat step is required. Detecting gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virions in an extraction buffer, the current amplified HCR lateral flow assay achieves a limit of detection of 200 copies/\u00b5L using nucleic acid probes to target the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. By comparison, five commercial unamplified lateral flow assays that use proprietary antibodies to target the viral nucleocapsid protein exhibit limits of detection of 500 copies/\u00b5L, 1000 copies/\u00b5L, 2000 copies/\u00b5L, 2000 copies/\u00b5L, and 20,000 copies/\u00b5L. By swapping out nucleic acid probes to target different pathogens, amplified HCR lateral flow assays offer a platform for adaptable and sensitive at-home testing for emergent diseases. Components for the previous two projects are designed and analyzed with NUPACK. NUPACK is a growing software suite for the analysis and design of nucleic acid structures, devices, and systems serving the needs of researchers in the fields of nucleic acid nanotechnology, molecular programming, synthetic biology, and across the life sciences. NUPACK algorithms are unique in treating complex and test tube ensembles containing arbitrary numbers of interacting strand species, providing crucial tools for capturing concentration effects essential to analyzing and designing the intermolecular interactions that are a hallmark of these fields. The all-new NUPACK web app ( [nupack.org](https://nupack.org/)) has been re-architected for the cloud, leveraging a cluster that scales dynamically in response to user demand to enable rapid job submission and result inspection even at times of peak user demand. The web app exploits the all-new NUPACK 4 scientific code base as its backend, offering enhanced physical models (coaxial and dangle stacking sub-ensembles), dramatic speedups (20-120\u00d7 for test tube analysis), and increased scalability for large complexes. Natural biomaterials, e.g., shells, bone, and wood, are typically comprised of hard and soft constituent materials that are hierarchically ordered to achieve mechanical resilience, light weight, and multifunctionality. Advanced fabrication techniques have enabled the creation of precisely architected materials with exceptional mechanical properties unattainable by their constituent materials, yet they are often designed with fully interconnected structural members whose junctions are detrimental to their performance because they serve as stress concentrations for damage accumulation and lower mechanical resilience. Most studies have also focused on understanding the stretching, bending, and buckling of the structural members, while explorations toward contact interactions within structural members remain limited. We address these challenges by (i) introducing a new three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical architecture in which fibers are interwoven to construct effective beams, (ii) introducing the concept of knots into the hierarchical architecture framework, and (iii) developing a model to study the effects of structural element length scale on the energy dissipation capability of a frictional architected material. We first explore the effective lattice response of hierarchical woven microlattices, and we demonstrate the superior ability of woven architectures to achieve high tensile and compressive strains via smooth reconfiguration of woven microfibers in the effective beams and junctions without failure events. We study how fiber topology and constituent materials influence the mechanical behaviors of hierarchical intertwined structures, and we compare our results with theory. Our study reveals that knot topology allows a new regime of deformation capable of shape-retention, leading to increased absorbed energy and failure strain compared to structures with woven topology. Agreements between experimental results and a model for long overhand knots suggest that the model can aid the optimization of the mechanical performance of microwoven materials. We then adapt classical contact mechanics and adhesion models to explore the influence of the size of structural elements in a frictional architected material on its energy dissipation capability. Our model shows that the energy dissipation capability of our frictional architected material can be significantly increased when it is scaled down from the mm-scale to the sub-micron length scale. Our woven hierarchical design offers a pathway to make traditionally stiff and brittle materials more deformable and introduces a new building block for 3D architected materials with complex nonlinear mechanics. The unique tightening mechanism introduced by knotted topology unlocks new ways to create shape-reconfigurable, highly extensible, and extremely energy-absorbing bulk, 3D architected materials with mechanical properties that can be tuned not only by their geometries and bulk properties, but also by the surface interactions experienced by the structural elements. Lastly, our modeling work shows the potential of creating highly dissipative architected materials with shape-retention capability via carefully architected structural elements.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Greer, Julia R.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/rsx9-qt39, Hojin}, title = {New Long End-Associative Polymers for Mist Control in I.

However, the application of ultralong linear polymers is limited by shear degradation of the ultralong polymer chains that occurs under strong flow conditions. To overcome the issue of shear degradation, our group previously designed long end-associative polymers that can self-assemble into megasupramolecules (Mw > 2000 kg/mol) in low polarity solvents like jet fuel. The previously developed long end associative polymers had polycyclooctadiene backbones (1,4 polybutadiene) with carboxylic acid or tertiary amine end groups that associated via hydrogen bonding. They were shear degradation resistant and used as mist-control agents that provided fire-protection to jet fuel at concentrations as low as 0.3wt%. Building upon the previous work, this thesis describes efforts toward expanding the applicability of long end-associative polymers. We first describe the design and synthesis of water-soluble long end-associative polymers for agricultural spray mist-control. We synthesized telechelic polyacrylamides using reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. We explored two types of associations that can form stable supramolecules in water: host-guest interactions between adamantane and beta-cyclodextrin (Chapter 1), and metal-ligand association between terpyridine and transition metal ions (Chapter 2). Careful optimization of polymerization conditions allowed the synthesis of ultra-high molecular weight telechelic polyacrylamides with narrow polydispersity. We the terpyridine with Mw kg/mol could assemble > 2000 kg/mol) upon addition of Fe(II) or Ni(II). In Chapters 3 and 4, we return to long end-associative polymers in hydrocarbon solvents. In Chapter 3, we tackle the issue of poor solubility of the previous generation of associative PCODs in a highly nonpolar solvent, PAO. In Chapter 4, we develop a new generation of end groups for improved solubility and ease of synthesis. Finally in Chapter 5, we discuss polyDODT (poly(3,6-dioxa-1,8-octanedithiol)), a polydisulfide that tends to form a mixture of linear and cyclic species.

Following on from this we will further show that in many cases these series FNK(x, q) themselves display a regularity in N, reminiscent of the HOMFLY-PT polynomial, allowing the construction of a 3 variable series FK(x, a, q) interpolating FNK(x, q) for all N. 2.

It is imperative to comprehend the mechanisms that hinder the efficacy of CAR T cell therapies and to devise strategies to counteract tumor resistance. In this study, we hypothesized that disruptions in the cell-intrinsic interferon (IFN) signaling pathway contribute to the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in solid tumors, ultimately rendering solid tumor cells resistant to CAR T cell-mediated elimination. To investigate this, we established syngeneic models of IFN signaling-deficient tumors in the context of murine IL-13Ra2 targeted CAR T cell therapy. Our findings revealed that these models indeed manipulate the tumor microenvironment (TME), leading to a resistance to CAR T cell therapy. Notably, we observed variations in gene expression related to IFN signaling components and cytokines between IFN signaling-deficient tumor cells and wild type (WT) tumor cells following CAR T cell treatment. Moreover, employing techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry analysis, we scrutinized the immune cell infiltrates within tumors lacking IFN signaling in comparison to WT controls. This in-depth analysis identified key immune-mediated factors contributing to the resistance observed in tumors with disrupted Janus Kinase1 (JAK1/KO) signaling upon CAR T cell therapy. Specifically, CAR T cell-treated IFN signaling-deficient tumors exhibited reduced T-cell transcripts, characterized by a decline in the frequency of CD8-early active and CD8-native like T cells. Conversely, an increase in regulatory and follicular T cells, exhausted endogenous T cells, and even exhausted CAR T cells was observed in treated IFN signaling-deficient tumors when contrasted with treated WT tumors. Furthermore, our analyses underscored the enrichment of genes associated with fibroblasts, neutrophils, and myeloid cells within IFN signaling-deficient tumors in contrast to WT tumors. These findings collectively suggest that the immune suppressive communication within the IFN signaling-deficient tumor microenvironment could arise due to the differential enhancement of receptor-ligand interactions, such interactions involving integrins on other cell lineages. To address the resistance observed in IFN-deficient tumors, we devised strategies aimed at enhancing the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy by promoting the recruitment of activated immune cells and reshaping the tumor microenvironment. We next conducted an analysis of immune signatures in 32 GBM patients who exhibited progressive disease following CAR T cell treatment, comparing them with patients who displayed relatively stable disease or showed signs of improvement. Our investigations revealed the presence of fibroblasts and SPP1+ APOE+ C1QA+ C1QC+ myeloid cells within the GBM signatures, which are associated with immune suppression and resistance to therapy. Notably, patients with GBM who displayed a relatively stable treatment response and enhanced T cell recruitment demonstrated distinct expression patterns of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) compared to patients with less favorable treatment responses. These findings offer insights into the intricate interplay between tumor-intrinsic driver mutations, the composition of the tumor microenvironment, and the responsiveness of solid tumors to CAR T cell therapy.

Sharp induction of gene expression with heat has been established using these bacteria- and phage-derived proteins. Here, we expand the toolbox for thermal control of E. coli through both direct cold-induced gene expression and through the construction of genetic circuits to invert heat-induced gene expression. We accomplish direct induction at low temperatures through the use of temperature-sensitive mutants of Lambda repressor as transcriptional activators. In addition, we show that a temperature-sensitive mutant of Lambda repressor can serve as an activator and a repressor of different genes simultaneously in one genetic circuit, leading to opposite thermal responses and serving as a temperature switch. Next, we demonstrate inversion of a temperature-sensitive repressor using a temperature insensitive repressor. We apply this multicomponent switch to engineer a temperature self-regulation circuit for E. coli-based ELMs. Seasonal variation in ambient temperature presents a challenge in deploying ELMs outside of a laboratory environment, because E. coli growth rate is impaired both below and above 37\u00b0C. Our construct enables E. coli to produce a light-absorptive pigment in response to environmental temperature below 36\u00b0C with the goal of allowing the cells to absorb sunlight and locally warm to their optimal growth temperature. We demonstrate the efficacy of our pigment temperature switch in a model flat ELM growing at 32\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C in a home-built illuminated growth chamber. Below 36\u00b0C, our engineered E. coli increase in pigmentation, causing an increase in sample temperature and growth rate above non-pigmented bacteria. On the other hand, above 36\u00b0C, they decrease in pigmentation, protecting their growth compared to bacteria with temperature- independent high pigmentation.

Broadly, two deployment strategies exist: 1) controlled or deterministic, and 2) unconstrained. Controlled deployment involves carefully orchestrated events using control or guidance systems, while in unconstrained deployment, the structure is simply allowed to self-deploy with minimal guidance. Unconstrained deployment offers lighter deployment mechanisms and better packaging efficiency but the unpredictability of this process has been a significant obstacle to its adoption. This study focuses on demonstrating the predictability of unconstrained dynamic deployment of thin-shell structures, using the Caltech Space Solar Power Project (SSPP) structures as a case study. The Caltech SSPP uses composite triangular rollable and coilable longerons as the primary building blocks to create large bending-stiff structures. The specific objective is to improve the predictability and robustness of the unconstrained dynamic deployment of the Caltech SSPP structures. Deployment is influenced by the initial conditions and the interaction between the structure and the mechanism during the deployment. To understand these effects, high-fidelity numerical simulations are developed and validated against experiments. The study also examines the sensitivity of deployment characteristics to various design parameters and external influences to ensure the robustness of deployment. This research demonstrates that the interaction between the structure and the deployment mechanism must be minimal to ensure the predictability of deployment, as thin-shell structures can self-deploy using stored strain energy. This study's sensitivity analysis will inform the design of future SSPP deployment mechanisms and structures. Additionally, the numerical simulation techniques developed have broader applicability beyond this specific case study to any deployable thin-shell structure. Due to the large aspect ratios of thin-shell structures, a very fine finite element mesh is required to model them accurately. A dense finite element mesh is also required to model the contact interactions between the structure and the rigid components of the deployment mechanism. As large spacecraft structures become increasingly complex, full-scale numerical modeling becomes impractical, necessitating the search for more computationally efficient finite element methods. In this study, NURBS-based isogeometric analysis is explored, and it is shown that it is not yet worth switching to NURBS-based elements for the analysis of thin-shell deployable structures. In addition, h-adaptive meshing for quadrilateral shell elements is investigated, and more efficient refinement indicators and solution mapping techniques for nonlinear analyses are proposed and their superior performance is demonstrated using a test case of quasi-static folding of a tape spring. This thesis fills a gap in the literature on unconstrained dynamic deployment of space structures, providing crucial insights and numerical modeling tools for further research. It establishes a knowledge and resource foundation to advance space structure design and promote more frequent use of unconstrained deployment, marking a pivotal contribution to the field and enabling safe and efficient space structure deployment. Furthermore, the study provides insights into more computationally efficient finite element methods, such as h-adaptive meshing.

The Notch pathway enables direct signaling through membrane-bound ligands and receptors, and is used in diverse contexts. While its canonical molecular signaling mechanism is well characterized, its many-to-many interacting pathway components, the complexity of their expression patterns, and the presence of same-cell (cis) as well as inter-cellular (trans) receptor-ligand interactions, have made it difficult to predict how a given cell will signal to others. Here, we use a cell-based approach, with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells and myoblasts, to systematically characterize trans-activation, cis-inhibition, and cis-activation efficiencies for the essential and activating ligands (Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, and Jag2), in the presence Fringe (Lfng) or the enzymatically dead Lfng D289E except Jag1, which competitively inhibits Notch1 signaling, and whose Notch1 binding strength is potentiated by Lfng. For Notch1, cis-activation is generally weaker than trans-activation, but for Notch2, cis-activation by Delta ligands is much stronger than trans-activation, and Notch2 cis-activation by Jag1 is similar in strength to trans-activation. Cis-inhibition is associated with weak cis-activation, as by the Delta ligands and weakens trans-activation of both receptors by the Jagged ligands.

Proliferation of these technologies has effected a shift towards a more decentralized, flexible, and sustainable energy system that can meet the growing demand for energy while reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. The work in this thesis studies two principal themes in this transformation: uncertainty and decentralization. Uncertainty is a key challenge in the modern grid resulting from the weather dependence of variable renewables and volatile loads like electric vehicles distributed throughout the grid. Electricity markets, whose function is to regulate the precise balance of supply and demand across the system, face a pressing need for dispatch mechanisms that account for uncertainty while providing participation incentives for generators and loads. We introduce a framework for multi-stage market dispatch and pricing under a general description of forecast uncertainty that enables system operators to explicitly incorporate uncertainty into market-clearing prices. In related work, we study mechanisms that guarantee feasibility of multi-interval dispatch under robust uncertainty and provide participation incentives for shiftable demand response in forward multi-interval markets. The trend towards a more decentralized energy system stems from the inherent modularity of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar and storage, as well as the persistent growth in end-use loads. This evolution presents significant challenges to system operators who typically lack the tools and processes for managing a complex, distributed power system. To fill this gap, we introduce and implement a Microgrid Operating System (OS), a software platform for monitoring, modeling, and optimizing microgrids and distribution systems. The Microgrid OS is a central layer that links DER hardware, such as batteries, solar, and flexible loads, to energy applications like cost minimization, emissions reduction, and wholesale market participation. The core functions it provides are data acquisition and processing, system modeling and learning, and optimization and control. We present key modules of the Microgrid OS in the context of several implementation projects in microgrids, commercial buildings, and distribution networks.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Low, Steven H.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/4wtg-qb69, author Zachary}, title = {Genetically Encoded Biosensors for Ketamine and Other Rapidly Acting Antidepressants in Zebrafish and Cell Culture}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/4wtg-qb69}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05292023-213541270}, abstract = { Over the past century, the development and use of treatments for depression has been one of the most important projects in both neuroscience and medicine. Not only is relatively little known about the underlying pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD), a mechanistic understanding of the ways in which common antidepressants \u2014 such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) \u2014 contribute to symptomatic relief remains elusive. Furthermore, the delay until typical antidepressant treatments take effect (a 'therapeutic lag' of weeks to months) presents a series of challenges to researchers in chemistry, neuroscience, pharmacology, and medicine, as the connection between apparent physiological changes and clinical benefit has yet to be established. The recent advent of a new class of drugs \u2014 rapidly acting antidepressants (RAADs), including the multi-purpose compound ketamine \u2014 which ameliorate symptoms within hours to days provides a crucial (if perplexing) perspective on the treatment of MDD and neuropsychiatric disorders more broadly. To answer questions concerning how various kinds of antidepressants might exert their effects, where those interactions take place, and what sorts of physiological changes drive clinical response, we have designed genetically encoded drug-specific intensity-based sensing fluorescent reporters (iDrugSnFRs) which are engineered to detect drugs of interest in both in vitro and in vivo applications. We have successfully evolved iDrugSnFRs for an array of RAADs (iRAADSnFRs) which detect pharmacologically relevant concentrations of their target drugs sensitively and specifically in both cell culture as well as in the nervous tissue of larval zebrafish. Another set of iDrugSnFRs for SSRIs has provided novel insights into the potential reasons for the aforementioned 'therapeutic lag' as well as side effects, while yet another set has provided a pharmacokinetic basis for the evaluation of smoking cessation drugs. In all, our findings lead us to posit that iDrugSnFRs can aid in the elucidation of mechanisms by which a wide variety of orally active pharmaceutical compounds operate as well as provide a crucial basis for the development of better medicines.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Lester, Henry A.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/jej3-4444, author = Prithvi}, title = {Reliable Controller Synthesis: Guarantees for Safety-Critical System Testing and Verification}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/jej3-4444}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06122023-162907795}, abstract = { The well-known quote by George Box states that \"All models are wrong, but some are useful\", and the controls and robotics communities alike have followed a similar paradigm to make significant theoretical and practical advances in the study of controllable systems to date. However, recent robotic system requirements include formal considerations for system safety, especially as we engineer systems that are required to work alongside us in our daily lives. As such, current research directions require analyses that consider these inaccurate system models, our inaccurate understanding of the environments in which these systems operate, and their combined effects on safe, effective system operation, e.g. the canonical autonomous driving problem in exceedingly difficult-to-model urban environments. Recently, this has led to burgeoning efforts in a formal study of controller verification. Specifically, verification denotes the process of determining whether a controller steers its system to exhibit desired behaviors despite the variety of environments the system might face during operation, e.g. whether the autonomous car's controller successfully drives the car to a destination without crashing into obstacles or pedestrians along the way. However, formalization of such a verification pipeline has proved difficult to date, especially since both the models we use for controller synthesis and our understanding of system environments are typically inaccurate. As a result, this thesis describes our efforts in the development of a formal verification pipeline that addresses a few key challenges in traditional approaches to safety-critical system verification. The first contribution centers on difficult, reactive test synthesis. By test synthesis, we mean the construction of a (potentially difficult) environment in which we require the system under test to perform its objective, e.g. placement of parked cars around which an autonomous vehicle must park. Typically phrased as an optimization problem over the space of allowable environments, these tests are \"static\" insofar as they do not react to the system's choices made during the test. We posit that such reactivity could more accurately identify worst-case system behavior. As a result, we phrase reactive, maximally difficult test synthesis as a game-theoretic optimization problem, leveraging the same control theoretic tools that facilitate safety-critical controller synthesis - control barrier functions and signal temporal logic. We prove that our proposed synthesis technique is always solvable and always produces a realizable test environment. Finally, we showcase our results by synthesizing reactive tests for both single and multi-agent systems. The second set of contributions centers on our efforts in uncertainty quantification. Due to un-modeled system and environmental aspects affecting system evolution in unpredictable ways, real-life systems need not realize the same paths every time. As such, typical analyses phrase verification as an optimization problem minimizing the expected value of a function over system trajectories with the expectation taken over this path variability, the distribution for which is assumed to be known. However, we posit that such an analysis should be risk-aware, i.e. account for this variability in a more principled fashion than an expectation-specific analysis, and should not assume apriori knowledge of the distribution corresponding to path variability, as it will be unknown in practice. To that end, we develop methods to bound a subset of risk measures for random variables whose distributions are unknown. This subset includes both Value-at-Risk and other, coherent risk measures heavily utilized in the controls and robotics communities. Simultaneously, we note that the same procedure can be applied to a wide class of non-convex optimization problems. In doing so, we develop a percentile-based optimization approach that rapidly identifies percentile solutions to optimization problems, i.e. a 90-th percentile solution is as good as 90% of solutions in the considered decision space. The third set of contributions focuses on the application of the prior mathematical developments to facilitate both risk-aware safety-critical system verification and controller synthesis. We phrase risk-aware controller verification as a risk-measure identification problem and utilize the prior bounding results to provide an efficient, dimensionally-independent verification procedure. Then, we phrase risk-aware controller synthesis as an optimization problem maximizing the bound provided by our risk-aware verification method, and show that this problem is solvable by the percentile optimization methods mentioned prior. Finally, we lay the foundation for the utilization of the aforementioned mathematical developments in other aspects of controls and robotics and communities more broadly. We show how risk-measure bounding can augment models both offline and online to robustify safety-critical controllers, how percentile optimization can facilitate \"optimal\" input selection and guarantee generation for non-convex finite-time optimal controllers, and how multiple applications of the percentile approach can also bound the optimality gap of reported percentile solutions. We showcase all these results on hardware for multiple systems and highlight the data efficiency of our proposed approaches.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Ames, Aaron D.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/2ff5-e145, author = {Torok, Zsofia Erzsebet}, title = {Resilience of a Precise Motor Behavior}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/2ff5-e145}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:10122022-003401041}, abstract = {Motor memory retention is an essential part of survival and reproduction of most species. However, these behaviors are variable and hard to measure. The zebra finch provides a great model organism to study motor behavior on a fine scale and ask fundamentally important questions. Zebra finch males learn their song from their father and once learnt this song remains unchanged for the remainder of the animals' life. This highly stereotypic and precise motor function engages a handful of motor nuclei organized in a spatially spread out manner that allows for precise targeting of each key circuit participant for the production of the behavior. In my studies, I focus on better understanding the role of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the pre-motor nucleus of the song production system. The goal was to perturb the precision of behavioral execution by collapsing the neuronal circuit responsible for sequential activity. Then, to study if the behavior could re-establish in an adult less plastic state of neuronal organization. After I have shown that motor function recovers to produce the same song post disruption, I investigated the large and small scale changes in neuronal activity and transcriptomics accompanying this degradation and recovery trajectory. I have learned that loss of inhibition leads to hyperactivation which eventually leads to a circuit level homeostatic compensation to shut down the pathological activity level. In addition, the upregulation of MHC1 receptors and microglia points to a homeostatic mechanism for synaptic reorganization and re-establishment. Now that we have the means to execute precise cell-type specific manipulations that are reversible and that we understand the underlying phenomenology of perturbation and recovery, we can ask many questions about the architecture of a highly resilient motor pathway.

Given the current societal burden of cardiovascular disease, there is a need for translational medical devices that bridge the accuracy gap between invasive and non-invasive measurements in the assessment of heart health. This thesis focuses on the development and validation of a high-resolution cuff-based system for assessment of central cardiovascular health. Traditional pressure cuffs suffer low signal resolution when applied to non-invasive pulse waveform acquisition. In the first section of this thesis, we develop a cuff-based device with a pneumatic filter for high fidelity pulse waveform acquisition. This work discusses the design and functionality of the cuff-device, and investigates the repeatability of the cuff-based measurement. Furthermore, the derived mathematical model of the pneumatic filter is shown to have an equivalent behavior to an electrical low-pass filter inclusive of a time constant and a frequency response curve. The accuracy and reliability of the pulse waveform features from the cuff-device are evaluated with human study data. Firstly, an IRB study is performed at Caltech on a young and healthy population showing that the cuff-device data lies within a narrow distribution indicative of the healthy nature of the population. Secondly, data from a clinical trial collecting simultaneous invasive catheter, cuff, and ECG is analyzed. The first analysis compared waveform parameters from the cuff in sSBP hold pressure with simultaneous aortic catheter, showing strong correlations between the two measurement modalities for both magnitude and fluctuations thereof. Lastly, this work investigated the relationship between cuff-based parameters and left ventricular functions. We introduced a cuff-based method for extraction of the pressure-sound waveform, a pressure based surrogate of heart sounds. The results from this analysis showed that the pressure-sound features correlate with the strength of the left ventricular isovolumetric contraction and relaxation. Other important results from this work demonstrated the correlations between the heart-lung interactions in the left ventricle and cuff parameters: breathing fluctuations proportionally affect LV pressures and cuff sSBP waveform parameters. Overall these results support the accuracy and reliability of a cuff-based device for central cardiovascular health assessments.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Gharib, Morteza}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/rwmn-hq80, author = {Douglas, Madison Marie}, title = {Mechanics of River Erosion and its Effects on Floodplain Biogeochemistry}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/rwmn-hq80}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06012023-210614776}, abstract = { Rivers transport water, sediment, and nutrients across Earth's surface. They shape landscapes, eroding mountain ranges and building floodplains, simultaneously providing important resources and posing a hazard to nearby communities. Here, I present field work, flume experiments, numerical models, and laboratory analyses addressing three main themes: permafrost river and floodplain dynamics, river meandering without plants, and rates of bedrock incision. Arctic rivers migrate rapidly across their floodplains and their migration rates are predicted to increase as permafrost thaws due to climate change. However, no mechanistic model is capable of predicting permafrost riverbank annual erosion rates. To address this knowledge gap, I developed a calibrated numerical model for permafrost riverbank erosion. A previously published theory assumes that permafrost erosion rates are limited by pore-ice thaw, but underestimates thaw rates due to bank roughness increasing heat transfer from the river to its banks (Chapter 3). Results indicate that thaw-limited erosion is orders of magnitude higher than observed erosion rates, and permafrost riverbank erosion must instead be limited by sediment entrainment and the collapse of overhanging blocks to match observed rates (Chapter 2). Based on experimental results, I developed a 1D numerical model that includes roughness-dependent permafrost thaw and sediment entrainment and tracks how heat transfer within the riverbank can form a thawed layer (Chapter 4). Results indicate that permafrost riverbank erosion rates respond to changes in river discharge due to climate change, which affect both bank thaw and entrainment rates, and are only sensitive to changes in water temperature via thawed layer failure. As a case study, I conducted fieldwork along the Koyukuk River in Alaska, which is located in discontinuous permafrost. I found that changes in riverbank erosion rates may more rapidly erase permafrost from floodplains (Chapter 7) and change the spatial patterns of floodplain methane emissions (Chapter 5). While riverbank erosion releases eroded organic carbon to be oxidized as greenhouse gases or transported downstream, a portion of this carbon is re-deposited in the floodplain, modulating the effects of river migration on regional carbon cycling (Chapter 6). To understand the effects of vegetation on river migration rates and fluvial stratigraphy, I conducted long-term monitoring of the unvegetated, ephemeral Amargosa River in Death Valley, California (Chapter 8). This study found that the Amargosa is actively meandering at very slow rates and frequently avulses, producing muddy stratigraphy with isolated sand bodies that is thought to be unique to vegetated meandering rivers. Sediment transport has also been proposed as a primary control on bedrock river incision rates, where saltating grains gradually abrade the channel bed over geologic timescales. However, uncertainty about long-term sediment supply and the frequency of floods that cause significant bedrock incision has prevented using saltation-abrasion to model landscape evolution. Using a global data compilation, I calculated a best-fit sediment supply-normalized flood intermittency parameter so that the saltation-abrasion model can be broadly applied (Chapter 9). Together, these studies advance understanding of how riverine sedimentary transport governs permafrost riverbank erosion, Arctic floodplain biogeochemistry, stratigraphic deposits of unvegetated rivers, and bedrock incision rates.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Lamb, Michael P.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/tba9-sb03, author = {Hsu, Alice}, title = {Neurotechnology for Multiplexed Interrogation of Brain Circuits and Synaptic Activity}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/tba9-sb03}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06032023-030758184}, abstract = { This thesis describes the development of neural technologies for 1) multiplexed brain circuit electrophysiology (ephys) recordings and control of activity in optogenetic mice lines with concurrent recording paired with two-photon imaging and 2) multiplexed measurements of synaptic release events in microfluidic platforms.

This consisted of technological development of novel, high density multisite silicon probes for electrophysiology recordings in vivo. The probes consist of four columns of electrodes densely packed at the shank tip. This density of electrode arrays allowed for higher resolution isolation of more distinct waveforms than previous ephys probes and benchmarking measurements to triangulate the locations of emitting neurons. These measurements help benchmark the ability of existing silicon extracellular probes to capture surrounding extracellular activity. When combined with two-photon imaging, we can simultaneously record ephys activity, image the probe and surrounding brain, quantify brain damage during probe implantation, and control neural activity using optogenetic mouse lines. The second project described development of a microfluidic platform to monitor synaptic release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Microfluidic devices were used to isolate synaptic processes expressing synaptic reporters and provide targeted recording of glutamate activity across the synapse. Synaptic glutamate release was monitored with a two part genetically encoded fluorescent reporter that detects glutamate released at the synapse, called split-iGluSnFR, developed in Professor Lin Tian's lab at UC Davis.

Temporal variations serve as an additional dimension for the design and structure of materials, further expanding potential functionalities and performance. Many of the concepts of waves in time-varying media have been developed in photonics and other electromagnetic systems, but the same fundamental dynamics govern acoustic and elastic systems, which provide alternative opportunities for implementation and new applications of time-varying media. In this thesis, we employ a one-dimensional phononic lattice composed of repelling ring magnets with electromagnetic coils that act as time-dependent grounding stiffness. The lattice provides an excellent platform for studying waves in time-varying media, with implementation and modeling of time-variation of elastic properties made simple by its discreteness. In addition, the repelling force between the magnets allows not only for the study of the linear dynamics of time-varying systems for small displacements but also for the exploration of the interaction between time-variation and nonlinear effects. We first present novel demonstrations of two types of time-varying wave phenomena in acoustic or elastic systems. First, the measurement of the propagation of waves across a temporal discontinuity in elastic properties demonstrates the temporal analog to refraction across a spatial boundary. Second, the experimental reconstruction of the dispersion relation of a time-periodic periodic medium shows the opening of wavenumber band gaps.

The linear, triatomic molecule ytterbium monohydroxide (YbOH) has emerged as a promising candidate for next-generation molecular EDM searches, because it possesses both an electronic structure amenable to optical cycling and parity doublets in the bending mode. These features enable laser cooling, highly polarizable science states, and internal comagnetometry which promises an order-of-magnitude improvement to current EDM sensitivities. Additionally, different isotoplogues of YbOH offer sensitivity to different sources of P,T-violating physics: leptonic sources via a measurement of the electron's EDM in 174YbOH and hadronic sources via a measurement of the nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment (NMQM) of the 173Yb nucleus in 173YbOH.

However, scalable synthesis of pure cyclic polymers remains elusive. The most straightforward way is to recover a used catalyst after the synthesis of cyclic polymers and reuse it. Unfortunately, this is demanding because of the catalyst's vulnerability and inseparability from polymers, which reduce the practicality of the process. In Chapter 1 we describe a continuous circular process, where polymerization, polymer separation, and catalyst recovery happen in situ, to dispense a pure cyclic polymer after bulk ring-expansion metathesis polymerization of cyclopentene. This process is enabled by ruthenium catalysts and newly designed glassware. Different depolymerization kinetics of the cyclic polymer from its linear analogue are also discussed. This process minimizes manual labour, maximizes the security of vulnerable catalysts and guarantees the purity of cyclic polymers, thereby showcasing a prototype of a scalable access to cyclic polymers with increased turnovers (415,000) of precious catalysts. -Oxygenated Z-olefins are ubiquitous in biologically active molecules and serve as versatile handles for organic synthesis, but their syntheses are often tedious and less selective. In Chapter 2 we report the efficient Z-selective metathesis of various terminal acrylates and allyl alcohols, which facile and selective construction of high value-added -oxygenated Z-olefins from readily available feedstock chemicals. These challenging metathesis transformations are enabled by novel cyclometalated Ru-carbene-nitrate complexes bearing bulky-yet-flexible side arms, whose assembly was unlocked by new organometallic syntheses. Efficient separation of macrocyclic polyolefins from reaction mixtures of ring-opening metathesis polymerization is crucial for their application in materials science, drug delivery, and for the mechanistic study of the reaction mechanism. In Chapter 3, we present a facile method for obtaining topologically pure macrocyclic fractions by modifying chain ends using enyne metathesis chemistry and introducing polar functional groups into linear polymer chains through the addition of polar monomers. Nonpolar cyclic polyolefins are then readily separated using silica gel chromatography. The purity of the cyclic fractions was verified using multiple techniques, including gel permeation chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

Despite this progress, researchers have yet to develop a safe and effective vaccine against HIV-1. The work presented here describes a structural perspective related to the HIV-1 Envelope (Env) glycoprotein, the sole viral target of vaccines that seek to elicit neutralizing antibodies. Env is the only viral protein on the surface of HIV-1 virions and is composed of a homotrimer of gp120/gp41 heterodimers. Env mediates entry into target cells by engaging the host receptor, CD4. CD4 triggers conformational changes in gp120, thereby enabling coreceptor recognition. Interactions with the host coreceptor trigger structural rearrangements in gp41 that facilitate fusion of host and viral membranes leading to infection. Our work builds upon our understanding of Env structural plasticity. First, we evaluated the conformational plasticity of soluble Env constructs using double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy. This method measured distances between probes in Env subunits, allowing us to interpret the distribution in distances as Env flexibility. Our findings captured previously unseen nuances in static Env structures including gp41 elasticity and conformational heterogeneity associated with CD4-receptor binding. Although our work gave a new perspective on Env flexibility, it largely corroborated observations from static Env structures. Importantly, this suggested that soluble versions of Env, which serve as templates for immunogen design, retain favorable structural properties. Informed with these insights in Env structure, we then sought to address a prevailing question related to receptor engagement: how many CD4 receptors are needed to induce gp120 conformation changes that lead to coreceptor binding followed by fusion? Prior work only characterized CD4-induced Env structural changes in Envs complexed with three soluble CD4 proteins. In our work, we designed and structurally characterized Envs bound to only one or two CD4 receptors. We found that Env engagement of one CD4 resulted in minor changes to the prefusion, closed Env conformation while Env bound to two CD4 molecules led to CD4-induced opening in the CD4-bound gp120s and a partially open conformation in the unliganded gp120. Structural biology has also been leveraged to characterize the mechanism by which broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) recognize HIV-1 Env. We include an extensive review of how structural observations from antibodies bound to viral proteins contribute to our understanding of antibody-mediated viral neutralization. We also present a technical evaluation of bNAb binding assays that revealed how Env conformations can be unintentionally altered resulting in misleading antibody binding results and identified ideal methods to ensure reliable data. Additionally, we report on projects related to bNAbs that target the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) epitope of Env. In the first, we characterized the inferred germline (iGL) precursor of BG24, a VRC01-class bNAb with features that make it a promising target for vaccine design. We solved four cryo-EM structures of BG24iGL constructs complexed with different Envs and provided insight on the mode of iGL accommodation. The second project centers around the IOMA-class of CD4bs bNAbs. We characterized features of IOMA-class bNAbs and measured how different features contribute to neutralization breadth and potency. Taken together, the conclusions from our work provide guidance for the next generation of structure-based, CD4bs-targeting immunogen design.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, California 91125}, advisor = {Bjorkman, Pamela J.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/cdwp-c709, author = {Sarraf, Namita}, title {Towards Integrated Molecular Machines: Structural, Mechanical, and Computational Motifs}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/cdwp-c709}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:01272023-184413283}, abstract = { The programmability of DNA has made it well-suited for building molecular machines, performing nanoscale self-assembly, and computing via biochemical circuits. In the last few decades, great strides have been made in characterizing the interactions between DNA molecules such that they can be predicted and engineered. The development of frameworks for those interactions has enabled the construction of more complex molecular systems that can execute specified programs. Such programs have included mechanical tasks, like walking and sorting cargo; assembly and reconfiguration of 2D and 3D shapes; and computation, like Boolean logic and pattern recognition. However, the continuing development of more complex molecular programs relies upon expanding the modules available for molecular systems to use to execute them. Expanded functionality of mechanical, structural, and computation modules are required in order to build compound systems that can interact with the physical world, reconfigure, and analyze signals in a variety of interesting ways. In this dissertation, we will discuss our contributions to this effort, which include exploring a motif for molecular robotic behavior, characterizing tile-tile interactions, and developing new capabilities for bimolecular circuits. Within the framework of a maze-solving molecular robot, we aim to implement walking behavior on DNA origami that introduces a surface modification via a four-way strand displacement reaction. Surprisingly, our experiments suggest that the walking behavior is at least two orders of magnitude slower than expected. To understand why, we quantitatively explore to what extent the speed and completion level of the robot can be modulated by design considerations such as toehold lengths, track redundancy, and strand purity. Another factor affecting the reaction rate is the number of tethering points, and we demonstrate an order of magnitude speed up in the four-way strand displacement reaction when we remove one tethering point. The characterization of a surface-modifying four-way strand displacement reaction is a useful tool for the continued development of molecular robots with more complex functionality. Free-floating DNA origami tiles, called invaders here, can swap out DNA origami tiles within larger assemblies via a technique called tile displacement, which has previously been demonstrated using single tile and dimer invaders with 4- and 9-tile arrays. We introduce initial structures and invading assemblies with more complex shapes. We explore the robustness of this reaction by testing a variety of edge configurations and comparing their reaction rates. We demonstrate tunable growth of one of the invaders, which can grow into polymers of arbitrary length or close into 3D structures. By a tile displacement reaction, we reconfigure the 3D structures into 2D. The invaders with complex shapes are able to reconfigure the original tile assembly at rates comparable to simpler tile displacement reactions, and two reconfiguration events can take place sequentially or simultaneously. Finally, we build two new modules for use with biochemical circuits. The first, a loser-take-all circuit, yields binary outputs indicating which analog signal is the smallest among all inputs. We implement a signal reversal function that converts the smallest input to the largest output, which can then be composed with a previously developed winner-take-all function to achieve loser-take-all. By making concentration adjustments, we can mitigate biases in the circuit that are a result of sequence-dependent different in reaction rates. We experimentally demonstrate a three-input loser-take-all circuit with nine input combinations. With further development, this circuit could be used to implement the activation function in neural networks that perform pattern classification according to which memory an input pattern is least similar to. The second circuit processes information using temporary memory. We design and implement a circuit that outputs distinct logic decisions based on relative timing information of a pair inputs and their logic values. We show that we can mitigate crosstalk in the circuit by utilizing mismatches and adjusting toehold lengths. The circuit is able to display clear ON-OFF separation at time intervals as short as one minute between the two inputs arriving.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Qian, Lulu}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/qhz7-a383, author = {Yang, Chien-I}, title = {Mechanism and Function of Nascent Protein Modification in Bacteria}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/qhz7-a383}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:07032022-182356199}, abstract = { Newly synthesized proteins undergo multiple modifications to ensure proper biogenesis and acquire their functions. N-terminal methionine excision (NME), mediated by the sequential actions of peptide deformylase (PDF) and methionine aminopeptidase (MAP), is an essential and the most prevalent N-terminal protein modification in the bacterial proteome. Despite the extensive studies on enzymatic catalysis, how NME impacts various cellular functions and how the enzymes achieve timing and selectivity under complex cellular conditions have been long-standing puzzles. In this work, we use a combination of biochemical analyses, computational modeling, and in vivo measurements to investigate the molecular mechanisms and physiological functions of cotranslational NME reactions. We show that the interactions between the ribosome, the nascent chain, the NME enzymes, and other ribosome-associated protein biogenesis factors dramatically remodel the kinetics and specificity of NME reactions under physiological conditions. In addition, we apply time-resolved, system-wide analyses on the translatome and steady-state proteome to study how the inhibition of PDF influences diverse cellular pathways in bacteria. The results unveil the impact of NME on the biogenesis of nascent proteins and highlight the role of the membrane in coupling the biochemical activities of NME enzymes to cellular physiology.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Shan, Shu-ou}, } Millifluidic Bulge Test for Multiscale Properties of Engineered Biofilms}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/e1yv-mr74}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:08282022-230140735}, abstract = { Biofilms - communities of bacterial cells associated with their extracellular polymeric matrices - are complex materials whose features span many length scales, ranging from bulk cohesive material properties, to mesoscale structural and compositional heterogeneity, down to the microscopic cellular morphology and cell-cell interaction chemistry. Here, we demonstrate a tool to study the mechanical properties of biofilms across length scales from the mesoscale (0.2 mm) to the bulk (1 mm) using a simplified model system based on genetically engineered E. coli. Using a custom millifluidic device that suspends a 3 mm dia. biofilm across a support, we impose tunable hydrostatic pressure drops in the Pa-kPa range across the biofilm. The resulting deformation of the film through an aperture is visualized with optical coherence tomography and used to estimate bulk and mesoscale mechanical properties of the film. Our method requires only microliters of material, causes minimal disruption to the film structure, and allows for estimates of both average properties as well as local heterogeneity as a function of cell-cell interaction chemistry and biofilm damage and healing.

A thermodynamic analysis of the 2D ideal gas and the slit-pore models highlighted the role of van der Waal potentials in the adsorption energy and isotherm fitting methods, especially Henry's law. Experimental data of krypton adsorption on CNS-201 and MSC-30 porous carbon materials revealed a significant weakening in the isosteric adsorption energy with temperatures from 250 K to 330 K. Using the zero-coverage Henry's constants and Clausius-Clapeyron equation, the adsorption energies weaken for 13% and 15% for CNS-201 and MSC-30. The corresponding changing rates are for CNS-201 and 3.65k_B for MSC-30. The DFT-based computational study with the slit-pore model showed the van der Waal potentials of different-sized pores. Then it showed how the structures of the pores significantly influence the surface dynamics and the internal energies of the adsorbates at different temperatures. Gas molecules adsorbed in pores of different sizes have different heat capacities larger than the gas phase, leading to a temperature dependence of adsorption energy. Monte Carlo calculation indicated that displacements of adsorbent atoms caused by thermal vibration slightly weaken the van der Waal potentials but have a negligible effect on the temperature dependence of the adsorption energy. The distribution of pore sizes plays a crucial role in the temperature dependence of the overall adsorption energy. With increasing temperature, the pores with higher energy states become more accessible due to the Boltzmann distribution, weakening the statistically averaged internal energy. Adsorption energy weakening of 5% and 15% for CNS-201 and MSC-30 are given by combining the computational van der Waal potentials and experimentally measured pore sizes.

Vat photopolymerization (VP), a light-enabled AM technique, is particularly promising due to its ability to achieve good surface quality, high resolution, and large volumetric throughput. The vast majority of materials obtained by VP are covalently-crosslinked thermosets with nondegradable carbon backbones. This highly crosslinked molecular structure gives rise to stiff and brittle materials, limiting the structural functionality in desired applications. This thesis explores a variety of molecular structures for new VP photopolymers: a) dynamically-crosslinked compliant polymer, b) interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogel, c) covalently-crosslinked polymer with labile group (ex. ester) insertion to polymer backbone. With the dynamic crosslinking system, we demonstrate tunable mechanical behaviors of the metal-coordinated supramolecular polymers. These materials display a range of failure strain of 450% - 940% and ultimate tensile strength of 12.4 - 2.2 MPa with varying resin compositions. To incorporate multifunctionality, we design thermoresponsive IPN hydrogels by fabricating a hydrophilic host polymer network via VP and a subsequent formation a thermoresponsive 2nd network (poly(N-Isopropylacrylamide)). The architected IPNs consistently display strong polymer-liquid phase separation behavior and a tunable water release behavior with volumetric shrinkage between 30% and 70% upon heating at 50oC. Finally, to promote the degradability of the acylate-based photoresin, we demonstrated successful incorporation for ester functional groups into the polymer backbone via radical ring opening polymerization of cyclic ketene acetals. The obtained polymer undergoes 84% mass loss within 7 hours under hydrolytic degradation condition. Overall, we demonstrated VP as a powerful technique to achieve one-pot synthesis and fabrication of functional materials. Our explorations on the development metal-coordinated supramolecular polymers provide valuable insights into the impact of resin formulation on mechanical properties. From analyzing the molecular weight of 3DP materials to finetuning of phase separation behavior and degradability, we demonstrate that VP provides a new platform to inspire advanced photoresin design strategies for desirable mechanical performance.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Greer, Julia R.}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/g80m-dy31, author = {Ma, Xiuqi}, title = {Fractonic Orders from Lattice Models and Field Theories}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/g80m-dy31}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:06022023-010804337}, abstract = { Fracton models are characterized by exotic features such as point-like excitations with restricted mobility, sub-extensive ground state degeneracy and UV/IR mixing. They have been studied previously using exactly solvable lattice models, higher rank gauge theories, etc. In an effort to classify fracton models into phases (i.e., fractonic orders), the so-called foliation structure has been introduced and shown to exist in many previously known models. A natural question then arises concerning the feasibility of the foliation paradigm in general. In this thesis, I study fracton models beyond the foliation paradigm and give simple diagnostics for the absence of a foliation structure. New notions of fractonic orders therefore need to be conceived, and I present such a conception which is a generalization of the foliation RG. In Chapters 2 - 4, I introduce new fracton models obtained from infinite-component Chern-Simons (CS) theories. By calculating observables such as ground state degeneracy and planon braiding statistics, I prove that most CS theories are not foliated. A CS theory can also be gapless with certain choices of parameters, and I show that such a theory is a stable gapless fracton model. Furthermore, I discuss topological features of a large subclass of gapless CS theories and present fully continuous effective field theories for this subclass. In Chapters 5 - 6, I discuss a new notion of fractonic orders by studying the example of the Ising cage-net model. I begin by calculating the ground state degeneracy of the model, which shows that the model is not foliated. The calculation uses an operator algebra approach which relies only on intrinsic physical properties of the model rather than microscopic details, and I establish the framework of this approach conceptually and via examples. I then argue why this intrinsic approach, despite being a tool for calculation initially, may be a useful characterization of a fractonic order. Finally, I present a generalized foliation RG scheme, apply it to the Ising cage-net model, and discuss its limitations.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Chen, Xie}, } @phdthesis{10.7907/xsyc-6668, title = {Parametrically-Driven Nonlinear Optical Resonators and their Networks for Sensing and Computing}, school = {California Institute of Technology}, year = {2023}, doi = {10.7907/xsyc-6668}, url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:03142023-213121023}, abstract = { New physics and novel applications in various fields ranging from biology, and spectroscopy, to manipulation of quantum systems are driven by the availability of coherent light sources including frequency combs in the visible and mid-infrared spectral regimes. Nonlinear optical systems, that are parametrically driven by technologically mature near-infrared lasers, are leveraged in this regard to access challenging wavelengths where conventional lasers may be unavailable. It is of paramount importance to miniaturize these systems and replace the traditional bulky setups thereby paving the way for a plethora of applications. Optical parametric oscillators are among the most prominent examples of such nonlinear systems and beyond their indispensable usage as light sources (both classical and quantum) their unique non-equilibrium dynamics can endow a wealth of functionalities absent in their linear counterparts. These properties can be engineered and utilized for realizing highly sensitive sensors as well as special-purpose computing hardware that may outperform conventional digital computers. A network of these coupled parametric oscillators can be made to interact leading to emergent behaviors that are not expected from the individual constituents. In this work, we experimentally and theoretically study the dynamics of individual and coupled optical parametric oscillators towards sensing and computing applications. We explore a previously avoided regime of operation for generating ultra-short pulses from these parametrically driven nonlinear resonators that lead to extreme pulse compression. We engineer the nonlinear dynamics of these systems to realize all-optical spectral phase transitions (both first-order and second-order) that behave as highly-sensitive sensors. We show how these critical phenomena can be utilized to enhance the solution accuracy of physics-based solvers in finding optimum solutions to combinatorial optimization problems in the context of coherent Ising machines. We also realize optical parametric oscillators in integrated lithium-niobate nanophotonic platform and demonstrate a mid-infrared frequency comb source that is widely tunable over an octave accompanied by visible frequency comb generation. We develop a comprehensive description to investigate the noise properties of optical parametric oscillators that provide new insights into the phase noise behavior of optical parametric oscillators in their various operating regimes. Finally, we propose a system of parametrically driven resonators as a synthetic medium with highly reconfigurable interactions that can host a plethora of emergent phenomena ranging from topological behaviors to non-Hermitian dynamics.

Among the materials that hold promise for such applications, thin-laminate fiber composites with thicknesses less than 200 m stand out due to their strength-to-weight ratio, packaging efficiency, and ability to deploy using stored strain energy. However, designing deployable structures with thin-laminate composites is challenging as they need to be stiff enough to withstand loads during deployment while also having a small volume in the packaged configuration. Complicating matters further, stress relaxation of the polymer matrix within the composite during long-term stowage in response to an imposed curvature can drastically impact both the deployment process and the performance of the structure in its deployed state, even leading to catastrophic failure in the stowed configuration. This thesis presents a comprehensive study of the time-dependent failure behavior of thin-laminate fiber composites under bending, with a focus on a fundamental material-level understanding. The work is divided into three main parts. First, a novel test method called Flattening to Rupture (FTR) test was developed to effectively load composite coupons under long-term bending, enabling the measurement of time-dependent rupture and identification of the underlying failure mechanisms. Second, numerical simulations using the Abaqus/Standard finite element software were developed to understand the sequence of rupture events and the influence of several parameters that affect time-dependent rupture. Finally, a statistical approach was proposed to model the stochastic nature of the failure of thin composite laminates. The contributions of this thesis extend the understanding of the microscale failure mechanisms involved in the time-dependent failure of fiber composites. These new insights pave the way for the efficient design of tightly and safely packaged deployable structures under long-term loading. The findings of this research can be utilized to optimize the design and performance of deployable space structures made of fiber composites, leading to new technologies that can advance space exploration.}, address = {1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California 91125}, advisor = {Pellegrino, Sergio}, } "}
