It convinced him that the body could repair itself and stay healthy thereafter if it were given the right support and if the right toxins and other barriers to recovery were removed. Therefore, Dr. Chang became a board-certified naturopath so he could utilize the very best natural remedies and treatments in the world to help his patients. Naturopathic doctors never simply dispense a drug to cover up a symptom. Instead, they look for the cause of that problem and treat that underlying cause with natural and non-toxic methods. Each patient is treated as an individual case. There's never a set program for a person with respiratory problems or heart disease because everyone's contributing factors are different. Practitioners of this medical art may utilize treatments as diverse as ozone therapy or massage, dietary counseling or neural therapy. Dr. Chang has selected the highest-quality and most successful therapies for his practice, all with the goal of helping patients return to wellness.
