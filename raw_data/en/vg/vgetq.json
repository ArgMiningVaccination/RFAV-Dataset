We develop and promote thearts across England, acting as an independent bodyat arm's length from government. Between 2006 and 2008, we will invest \u00a31.1 billion of public money from government and the NationalLottery in supporting the arts. This is the bedrock ofsupport for the arts in England. We believe that the arts have the power to change lives and communities, and to create opportunitiesfor people throughout the country. For 2006 to 2008, we have six priorities: taking part in the arts children and young people the creative economy vibrant communities internationalism celebrating diversitychair's report 2 Arts Council England annual review 2006Sir Christopher Frayling Photo: Piers Allardyce In Arts Council England's 60-year history, there can rarely have been a year like this, when the nature of our arts funding and developmentsystem has been under such close scrutiny. We have seen the publication of a plethora of papers and books from academics and think tanks of various political persuasions. In addition,we faced our first independent Peer Review, led by Baroness McIntoshof Hudnall. Central to these debates has been the role of the Arts Council and the future of the 'arm's length' principle. Some based their arguments ona perception that government has shackled the arts to a list of socialpolicy goals and bureaucratic targets. Often, they argued, these goalsand targets have little to do with creative process or the value that the public gains from the arts. A few went so far as to suggest thatthe arm's length principle, which since 1946 has guaranteed theindependence of funding decisions from political interference, mayhave outlived its usefulness. Having been in the front line of those who have raised concerns about the danger of political encroachment on the arm's length principle, I can say with real optimism that this year was the year when the tideflowed again - and strongly - in favour of the principle. The PeerReview emphatically backed the continuation of Arts Council Englandas an arm's length agency and the Rt Hon Tessa Jowell MP , Secretaryof State for Culture, Media and Sport, gave that her wholeheartedand public support. In principle, and in practice, it works. Wherever you stand in relation to these arguments, one thing is certain - cultural policy is no longer a backwater of political thinking.The interface between government, its agencies, and the arts andcreative industries is an area of debate finally beginning to take itsrightful place alongside the other big contested issues in public life.We will take an even more central role in these debates in future. There is much to discuss - the importance of creativity and innovationto our place in the global economy, the politics of wellbeing andhappiness, national identity, freedom of expression, a cultural foreignpolicy - the list goes on. There is much else to celebrate this year. The public consultation on the National Lottery good causes has resulted in the Governmentannouncing that the arts will continue to benefit from the lottery for another 10 years - providing more than \u00a31 billion for arts projectsthroughout England. The current golden age for the arts is set tocontinue. Our artists and arts organisations have had yet another great year. Apart from The Sultan's Elephant in spring 2006, my favourite personal arts experiences of the year happened at Arthur Miller's The Crucible by the Royal Shakespeare Company , watching contemporary dance at Sadler's Wells, in the main concert hall at The Sage Gateshead and invarious ways celebrating the centenary of e=mc 2. In 2005/06, it has definitely been a case of e=ace. The coming year will have many challenges. Making the case for enhanced public investment in the arts to government and others willbe a major issue for us and our partners. But, we can address thesechallenges with renewed confidence and optimism. How many publicbodies can honestly say, hand on heart, that they combine nationalpolicy and regional delivery in such efficient, effective and creative ways? Sir Christopher Frayling, Chair Arts Council England annual review 2006 3The last year has again been one of change and challenge for Arts Council England. We assessed our achievements and operationsand identified some new priorities for the coming years. Personally, I was lucky enough to be able to spend the first few months of 2005 stepping outside my 'day job' to take stock of the past,present and future of the Arts Council. I returned from my strategic'time out' refreshed, stimulated and excited by the challenge ahead. I came back convinced that the Arts Council has achieved a huge amount in 60 years and that to have maintained impact and relevancewe have had to constantly change. But just as clear was the need toadapt again to meet the new challenges of the next 10 to 15 years. All this was confirmed by a Peer Review of the Arts Council that took place in summer 2005. Commissioned jointly by the Department forCulture, Media and Sport and the Arts Council, the Peer Reviewlooked at our strengths and weaknesses, achievements and progressand identified opportunities for the future. The review team recognised our role in shaping the national artistic and cultural landscape, crediting us for 'the increased vibrancy of the artssector and the greater centrality of arts in national life'. But the review also gave pointers for further positive change. The team encouraged us to build on the progress made since our mergerwith the regional arts bodies and become even more a nationaldevelopment agency for the arts in England. A lead body for the artswith authority and impact, one whose voice is heard by - and listenedto - not just government but every part of national public life. The Arts Council has always had a dual responsibility: to develop and improve the practice of the arts and to increase accessibility of the arts. Arguably for the last 60 years we have focused more on the first side of that equation - investing in and supporting artists and arts organisations. Now is a good time to start to redress that 4 Arts Council England annual review 2006chief executive's reportArts Council England annual review 2006 5balance and to invest in and support audiences and participation in the arts. This is reflected in a new ambition, which sets the tone for our work for the next two years: to put the arts at the heart ofnational life and people at the heart of the arts. Which is why one of our main themes for the next two years is to encourage more people to take part in and engage with the arts. New technology and the way people interact with it require us to re-think what we mean by traditional phrases like 'attendance' and'participation'. There are tremendous opportunities to find new waysfor audiences to enjoy and participate in the arts and for artists tocreate in different ways. We also need to connect better with the public - and other stakeholders - and find new ways to listen to and understand them and theirexpectations and aspirations for the arts. So later in 2006 we willlaunch a major debate - a public value exercise, talking with andlistening to a wide range of people and testing with them what westand for and what we should prioritise in the future. The findings willrefresh our purpose and inform our long-term direction and objectives. Near the end of 2005, we contributed to the government's comprehensive spending review looking at the period since 1997. Thisprocess gave us a valuable opportunity to assess our performance andachievements. And the story that emerged is one of a sustained increasein government investment, matched by reform and delivery within theArts Council and across the arts, resulting in massive achievementsand real progress. In fact, arts and culture have never been better. Our objective now must be to build on that remarkable success. We must make the case to government and beyond, that arts andculture have an enormous and still untapped potential to inspire thenation and deliver tangible benefits to our children, our communitiesand our wider society.

This unique and dynamic festival took place aboard Stubnitz ,a German ship that travelled to the Tyne for the festival, at BALTIC and on a coach touring throughout the region. The festival from June to July 2005 attracted important international artistsand critics, and premiered work from artists such as Karen Finley, Andr\u00e9 Stittand Kira O'Reilly. Produced by amino, BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, Forma and MichelleHirschhorn, Navigate was fundedthrough the Urban Melati Suryodarmo performs -butter dance at the Navigate Arts Festival.

It was launched by CreativePartnerships Durham Sunderland and Creative Partnerships London South simultaneously. The launchtook place at Southwick PrimarySchool in Sunderland and at theMayor's office in London withyoung people and teachers from Sandhurst Junior School in Lewisham. The installation uses an ordinary park bench placed with one endtouching a wall in a public placesuch as a canteen, an office or a school playground. A videoimage projected onto the wallnext to the bench shows thebench continuing into thedistance. By sitting on the park bench and watching the screen,a pupil sitting in a schoolplayground in London can talkwith a pupil in a playgroundin Sunderland. They can chatover their lunch as if they weresitting on the same park benchin the same place. This exciting project has huge potential for people to exchangeknowledge, build friendships and practise using new technology.Using technology to champion poetry In November 2005, the Poetry Archive launched a national online collection of recordings of poets readingtheir own work. The brainchild of Andrew Motion, UK Poet Laureate, and recording producer, Richard Carrington, the recordingsmake poetry accessible, relevant and enjoyable to a wide audience. Enabling access to poets' own interpretationof their works gives a uniquely illuminating experiencethat can re-energise the teaching of poetry at all levels. This Gloucestershire-based resource grows continually as old recordings are discovered and new ones made.The Poetry Archive receives regular funding from us. One of the few r emaining independent poetry presses in the country, Peterloo Poets in Cornwall, was founded and is still run by former English lecturer Harry Chambers. To date, the press has published nearly 200 volumesof poetry by 125 authors, together with numerousanthologies and the house journal Poetry Matters . Peterloo aims to publish quality work by new and neglected poets and is expanding into online publishingas a way of increasing exposure. Online publishing is acost effective solution to help manage the thousands of new manuscripts received, without risking large financial outlay for print. Peterloo Poets receives Grants for the arts funding.

In 2005/06, Arts Council Englandgranted \u00a350,000 further funding on top ofinitial funding for the project. Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, launched Quick Reads in March 2006. Short booksfrom authors including Ruth Rendell, JoannaTrollope and Minette Walters sell for \u00a32 each. The Premier League Reading Stars supports a series of family reading groupsat libraries across the country. Playersrecommend books, such as Roald Dahl'sMatilda , recommended by Steven Caldwell of Sunderland. This is a partnership betweenthe Football Foundation, the National LiteracyTrust, the Premier League and the Arts Council. Get London Reading encourages Londoners to make more time for books. The campaignis managed by Booktrust, which receivesover \u00a3238,000 each year from the ArtsCouncil to support core operating costs. Itworks with Transport for London, the Mayorof London, Creative London, Rough Guidesand London Book Fair to bring stimulatingpromotions and events to London. A Book for Every Londoner is a series of free activities in the capital's libraries, organisedby the London Libraries Development Agency(LLDA), which receives regular revenuefunding of \u00a330,000 from the Arts Councilto support reader development. Arts Council England annual review 2006 9Arts and sport research Almost three quarters of year 9 pupils in the north west take part in arts activities inschool and during lessons. The same number takes part in arts activities outside school informally with friends. One quarter are active members of an out-of-school arts club orprogrammed activity. One in six belongsto a dance club. The 2004 Arts and Sport study provided a unique, large scale insight into the regularparticipation of school pupils in a broadrange of cultural activities. The study emphasised the huge opportunities for young people to benefit from the crossover between creative and health agendas - the commoncommitment to self-esteem, creativity, andhealthy bodies and minds. The north west is already profiting from these findings with their commitment todance organisations such as the regularlyfunded Cultural Fusion - which providescreative spaces and support for young peopleto sing, dance and make music - and Gameswithout Frontiers - a project that combined a youth sports event with arts performances.

In August, Britain's only centre dedicated to celebrating children's books - Seven Stories - opened its doors. The \u00a36.5 million projectconverted a Grade II listed Victorian granaryinto a modern, family-friendly art gallery andinteractive centre in the heart of Newcastle.It houses a nationally important collection of books, manuscripts, original artwork andrelated media for children, focusing on workcreated in post-war Britain. In December, Unicorn Theatre opened a purpose-built theatre for children. Thestunning \u00a313 million building in Southwark,London, includes two theatre spaces, aneducation studio and a cafe, and has apedestrianised path to the Thames. Thearchitecture is both impressive in its ownright and rich in child-scale detail. Thisreflects Unicorn's belief that theatre forchildren should have the same high standardsas theatre for adults. The theatre will playto over 100,000 children each year. The \u00a33 million egg theatre - so named for its egg-shaped auditorium - also opened in2005/06. Part of the Theatre Royal Bath, it isthe first dedicated theatre space for childrenand young people in the south west andwelcomed over 4,000 visitors in its first month. Arts Council England annual review 2006 11Artsmark Artsmark recognises schools that have made a strong commitment to the arts. In June 2005, we awarded nearly 1,200 Artsmarks, in the fifth round of this nationalaward for schools. The highest number yetbrought the total of Artsmark schools to3,067. Nationally, 13 per cent of schoolshold an Artsmark - 10 per cent of primaryschools and 31 per cent of secondaries. Of the 165 schools receiving the award in the West Midlands, nearly half attainedArtsmark Gold for providing an excellentrange of arts opportunities. Castle SpecialSchool in Walsall showed how the arts areapplied across the curriculum when, forexample, pupils learnt about forensics byactors presenting a science-based mystery.

In 2005, we secured funding from the Department for Trade and Industry throughthe Phoenix Fund to roll out the Creative Industries Business Advisory Service(CIBAS) to six locations across the south east.CIBAS provides one-to-one bespoke businessadvice and guidance from specialist businessadvisors, as well as local networking eventsand seminars. It is for artists, creativepractitioners and businesses, and deals withspecific issues that arise from artistic andcreative practice within a business context. TheArtists' Resource Centre (ARC) at Aspex Gallery in Portsmouth has been granted\u00a399,000 from Grants for the arts to developARC+, a new professional developmentinitiative for artists and artist-led organisationsin the south east.

Run by a team of industry professionals, Escalator Music helps emerging rock and pop artists, providing expertisewith all aspects of the business from production andrecord label management to public relations. Artists arechosen from each area in the region and mentored andsupported to achieve their professional goals, and topromote their work to a wider commercial audience. As well as offering artists the opportunity to make the move from passion to profession, Escalator Music isbuilding shared knowledge in the region and encouraginga more integrated way of working between the industryspecialists, creating an infrastructure for the future. Escalator Music also supported an exciting programme of lunchtime concerts with Britten Sinfonia , broadcast on BBC3. The 2005 performances, curated by NicholasDaniel, featured new pieces commissioned from composerswith links to the East of England, alongside pieces thatinfluenced their creation. Since 2004, Amplifier has been transforming the opportunities for young people aged 11 and upwards toget involved in rock and pop. It will give 2,000 workshopsover three years.

Photo: Patrick Harrison Arts Council England annual review 2006 15 In 2005, we focused on the needs of artists and arts organisations in rural areas.We are committed to enabling a growth inthe scale, reach and confidence of the artsin rural England. In the East Midlands , market towns such as Wirksworth in the Derbyshire Dales havefaced big challenges in recent years dueto the decline of traditional industries suchas farming, quarrying and textiles. At thesame time, the area has attracted a thrivingcommunity of artists, who have taken overredundant buildings, started new enterprisesand launched a festival that has helped re-energise the community. Nationally there are 37 touring schemes working with professional companies, artistsand performers to offer events in ruralcommunities. In the south east since 2004, 22 new communities have promoted theatrein villages - further evidence that our ruralstrategy is helping communities developtheir own sense of creativity and place,and flourish through the arts. In 2005, Villages in Action, a rural touring scheme in Crediton, Devon, ran an innovativeparticipatory project in five villages acrossDevon. The villages worked with threeprofessional artists to produce a performance,event or exhibition celebrating Devon's linkswith other parts of the world. Events rangedfrom a drum festival with Karen people fromthe UK and Thailand, to a Spice of Life festivalin South Brent. Six of the seven rural touringschemes in the south west receive regular funding and many individual performancesand events also receive grants. There are thousands of high quality arts events taking place in rural and othercommunities, extending access to the arts totens of thousands of people who may haveonly limited access to live performance. Theseevents play an important part in the sociallife of rural and other small communities.See our 2005 publication Arts in rural England for more details. 16 Arts Council England annual review 2006 Puppetcraft performing The Pied Piper for a family audience in the Memorial Hall, East Ogwell.

Arts Unwrapped , an Arts Council and Creative London initiative, brought togetherexhibitions and events in studios acrossLondon in November and December 2005. It was the largest event of its kind in Europe.The Project Director, Ms H Dunn, says, 'Open studio events give artists an opportunity toshow and sell their work... they offer visitorsa rare chance to see the creative process atwork... It makes sense to capitalise on theskills and vision they bring to our city.' Acme Studios , founded in 1972, provides over 400 studios for London artists. There is huge demand, with over 3,500 artists onwaiting lists for affordable London studios. In 2005, we awarded Acme Studios a \u00a32 million capital grant to increase artists'studio space in London.

In June 2005, our Eastregion's local government arts forum broughttogether councillors and arts developmentofficers from 54 local authorities. The summitlooked at ways that the arts could be usedto support development and regenerationinitiatives in the region. It focused oncollaboration between different areas ofgovernment and the arts, and embeddingthe arts into new projects. One example is the Green Heart Partnership, a three-year programme for environmentalplanning and capital projects in Hertfordshire.Projects include new park and play areasand refurbishment plans for a rundowncommunity centre in Broxbourne. This partnership involves all 10 local authorities in the county alongside Lee ValleyRegional Park Authority, Hertfordshire CountyCouncil and Arts Council England, East.

Arts Council England, East's unique shared prospectus with the East of England Development Agency identifiesinternational partnerships as one of the important areasfor strategic joint investment. International links with the United States, Poland and Latin America are developing new marketplaces andsecuring additional resources while individual creativeand cultural collaborations are sharing knowledge andraising ambitions, invigorating the creative sector in theEast of England. The Malopolska region is economically important for Poland and a significant academic and cultural hub, withthe country's oldest university.

The delegation also forgedpartnerships with the Marshall's office in Malopolska and the Mayor's office in Krakow. San Jose in California has existing connections to the East through hi-tech industry.

TheMigrations project is the result of a collaboration between five secondary schools in the north east area of Birmingham with SAMPAD (South Asian Arts). Thiscollaboration was developed to reflect the diverse rangeof cultures within the schools. SAMPAD introduced acreative literature project called Spinning a Yarn , which involved writing bilingual stories. In autumn 2005, the schools got involved in a storytelling performance and the project culminated in a collaborative installation includinglive and recorded performance, visual arts and craft andmultimedia exhibitions. The south east is hosting The Margate Exodus , a high profile community arts event in 2006. Towards a Promised Land, which formed part of the planning for this event, is based on an ancient story of migration and the search fora promised land. The story is retold to reflect the modernexperience of migration. The focus of the project, led byartist Wendy Ewald, was to encourage and help childrenin the region - especially those whose lives have beendisrupted by drastic change in some of the world's worsttrouble spots - to explore their own feelings about historyand place through words and images. The communityworked collaboratively with local artists on theperformance, which forms part of a film for Channel 4.

Both Kajansin Birmingham and RIFCO in Slough havebeen added, in r ecognition of their work towards developing opportunities for local people and building international links. Kajans has been providing artistic, educational and outreach programmes forover a decade. Kajans focuses on developingBlack art, and community involvement in andownership of the arts.

Thissection reports on our performance towardsparticular strategic priorities and public servicetargets (PSA3 targets) in that agreement forthe period April 2005 to March 2006. Focusing on our customers We are making changes to improve customersatisfaction across our organisation. We haveestablished a project team to create a strongercustomer focus ethos within the organisation.This project team is made up of representativesor leaders of interdependent projects or areas ofwork such as Grants for the arts and enquiries. Each regional office has developed an action plan to address issues identified in relationto its own operational customers. Seniormanagement teams and regional councilshave endorsed these action plans andexecutive directors are responsible for theirimplementation. The project team has also identified a range of initiatives to address issues that arecommon across the organisation. The Grants for the arts programme has made improvements, including being clearer aboutwhat we offer in the new Grants for the artspack, training for staff in giving feedbackto unsuccessful applicants, and improvingthe activity report form. Our enquiries team and regional offices are working together forimproved communication, generating better processes and enhancing the service for callers. We also aim to make better use of our existing communications with our customers, includingour regularly funded organisations, regionalpartners, and communities with special needs.The Grants for the arts activity report formsare an example of this. We want ongoingfeedback on our customer focus betweenthe major surveys of customer satisfaction:spring 2007 is the next. Other initiatives in development include: investigating the feasibility of purchasingcustomer relationship management softwareto link to 'Arena', the new single IT system;ensuring that customer focus becomes anintegral part of our induction programmes;and revising our customer focus guidelines,ensuring they dovetail with our responsibilitiesunder the Joint Lottery Distributors' customerservice charter. In 2006/07, the customer satisfaction survey will form part of a broader programme ofstakeholder engagement that aims to ensurethat the Arts Council continues to delivervalue to the public, the arts community andour partners in central and local government. We have set a target of raising our overall satisfaction rating among operationalcustomers from 70.4 per cent in 2005 to 75 per cent, and among strategic customersfrom 69 per cent in 2005 to 75 per cent bythe spring 2007 survey. 30 Arts Council England annual review 2006reporting against our official commitmentsCreative Partnerships We were committed to establishing 36 Creative Partnerships by March 2006, andachieved this. From May 2002 until March2006, the number of young people involvedin Creative Partnerships was 499,039, nearly50,000 over target. There have been 4,747projects, involving 46,539 teachers. Administrative savings We have agreed with DCMS a target forrecurrent administrative cost savings for ourgrant-in-aid and lottery activities combinedas a result of the merger of the former ArtsCouncil of England with the 10 regional artsboards in April 2002. The target is to achievesavings by comparison with the administrationcosts of the 11 previous organisations priorto the merger. The savings arose from a number of areas. These include the reduction of staff numbersfollowing the merger in April 2002, themerger of two regional arts boards into ourSouth East office, savings relating to thereduction in use of office space in Londonand savings in relation to support servicesand procurement. This measure excludesthe one-off costs of change and of newdevelopments, the most material of whichis the Creative Partnerships programme.All calculations are adjusted to removethe impact of inflation.The target and actual savings for 6.9772005/06 6.7 7.252 Reduction in staff numbers As part of the reorganisation savings targetdetailed above, we also agreed with DCMS, in2004, a target for reduction in staff numbersby March 2006. Actual staff numbers at theend of March 2006 were 630 compared witha target of 600. This is a reduction of 81 fromthe 711 staff for the base year, 2001/02.Again this excludes staff working on one-offprojects and Creative Partnerships. A further reduction in staff numbers is anticipated as a result of the structuralreview of the national office, proposalsfor which were announced in March 2006.

The objectives of the Arts Councilas stated in the Royal Charter, our governingdocument, are i) to develop and improve theknowledge, understanding and practice ofthe arts, ii) to increase accessibility of the artsto the public, and iii) to advise and cooperatewith other government departments, localauthorities and the Arts Councils for Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland (or theirsuccessors). To this end, we make grantsto artists and arts organisations and engagein other activities on behalf of the sector. Arts Council England was granted a Supplemental Charter on 18 March 2002.Its purpose was 'to give effect to newarrangements for regionalisation of its structureand activities'. There were no changes to theobjects of the Arts Council and the mainchanges relate to our powers to establish Foreword continued Arts Council England annual review grant-in-aid accounts 2006 39Structure, governance and management continued and to delegate powers and functions toregional councils. The charter sets out thenew composition of the Council, whichincludes the chairs of the regional councils. The Arts Council works at arm's length from government and has the status of a non-departmental public body. As such, we areregulated in accordance with a ManagementStatement/Financial Memorandum andFunding Agreement issued by the Secretary ofState. We prepare our accounts for grant-in-aidand lottery separately to comply with AccountsDirections also issued by the Secretary of State. Arts Council England has nine regional offices, matching the government's regionalboundaries, and a national office.

The Arts Council maintains a register of interests of its members, which is available for public inspection by appointment at our Great Peter Street address. Policies and procedures adopted for the induction and trainingof trustees The Council recognises the importance of ensuring that its members, as trustees, arefully briefed and introduced into their rolein the organisation. For all newly-appointed trustees, the Council arranges for an induction process to beundertaken. This includes meeting with thechief executive and the chair to discuss therole of the member and the functions of ArtsCouncil England, and a range of meetingswith staff of the Council to appreciate thepolicies, strategies and activities of theCouncil in more detail. Members who arealso appointed to chair a regional councilreceive a further induction to that role,led by the relevant regional director. The Council undertakes regular debates and facilitated group sessions, ranging from halfa day to two days, outside of their businessmeetings at least four times a year. Theseafford opportunities for development and toconsider a range of issues that are importantto the work of the Council outside the formalmeeting setting. The Council organised a day session ('Leading Lights') in October 2004, for all members ofthe Council and of the regional councils tocome together and discuss issues affectingthe development and work of Arts CouncilEngland. It is intended that a similar eventwill be held during the later part of 2006.

Research activity Arts Council England's three-year researchstrategy for 2003-06 is designed to addressour strategic objectives, gather the dataneeded to demonstrate public accountability,evaluate the outcomes of our funding,develop a sound evidence base which canbe used to inform and evaluate policy andplanning, and provide research findings to help make the case for the arts. During the year, we contributed funding to a major new survey of the general public, Taking Part, commissioned by DCMS in partnership with Sport England, English Heritage andthe Museums, Libraries and Archives Council.Information was collected from approximately6,000 adults about their attendance at,participation in, and attitudes to the arts.As well as giving us valuable informationon levels of engagement with the arts, thedata will also be used to report to DCMS onprogress towards achieving the performanceindicator in the Funding Agreement. For someresults of the survey, see pages 133 to 135. Financial review Arts Council England receives grant-in-aid fromDCMS and is one of the bodies designatedto distribute funds from the National Lotteryby the National Lottery etc Act 1993 (asamended by the National Lottery Act 1998). This year, for the first time, we have implemented significant changes to thedisclosure made in the annual accounts asrequired by the new Charities Statement ofRecommended Practice issued during 2005. Inparticular, this has meant changing the formatof the Statement of Financial Activities andrelated notes to an activity-based pr esentation, allocating our support costs between ourvarious funding activities. In addition to this,new disclosures are required this year underthe new Financial Reporting Manual issuedby HM Treasury, including the remunerationreport on pages 34 to 36. This report replacesnotes previously included in the grant-in-aid Financial review continued and lottery accounts on executive directors'and Council members' remuneration. DCMS provided grant-in-aid of \u00a3409 million for the year. Ring-fenced funding is table people's Arts Awards 0.3 0.3 0.7 Youth theatre 0.6 0.6 0.6Centres of Excellence 1.5 1.5 1.5Cultural Leadership Fund 6.5 5.5 0 European Capital of Culture 0 2.0 3.0 South Bank Centre 0 3.0 2.0Other capital funds 1.0 3.0 2.0 In addition, we received \u00a311 million of grants and donations for specific strategic pr ojects from a number of other organisations. During the year, we awarded grants to our 1,100 regularly funded arts organisations of\u00a3301 million, and made \u00a39 million awardsunder the Grants for the arts - individuals, ouropen application programme for individualartists. In addition, we spent \u00a373 milliondirectly on strategic initiatives, includingour Creative Partnerships programme. The statement of financial activities funded from grant-in-aid shows net incomingresources for the year of \u00a33 million onunrestricted funds. This surplus is due to thechange in the timing of some projects, whichhave slipped into the next financial year.At 31 March 2006, Arts Council England had unrestricted reserves of \u00a317 million. Ourpolicy on reserves is to ensure that we holdsufficient funds to maintain liquidity, to coverunforeseen short-term cash requirementsof \u00a31 million, to cover planned futureexpenditure and to repay to DCMS grant-in-aid over-committed in previous years, whichat 31 March 2006 was \u00a32 million. We reviewthis policy and our reserves position annually.Our use of reserves, however, is restrictedby the Government's end-of-year flexibilityregulations which mean that we are notcurrently allowed to use our reserves broughtforward from 2001/02 of \u00a310 million. In December 2004, DCMS announced that our funding for the financial years 2006/07and 2007/08 would be \u00a3415.5 million and\u00a3411.5 million respectively. These figuresinclude a capital allocation for the SouthBank Centre and the European Capitalof Culture 2008 of \u00a35 million in 2006/07and an undesignated capital allocation of\u00a31 million in 2007/08. In addition, we willreceive \u00a312 million over these two yearstowards the Cultural Leadership Programme. In 2005/06, we delivered a combined grant-in- aid and lottery administrative saving of \u00a37.3million compared to the target of \u00a36.7 millionas set out in our Funding Agreement andagreed with DCMS (2004/05 saving \u00a37 million;target \u00a36 million), see note 23 to the accounts. The savings arose from a number of areas. These include the reduction of staff numbersfollowing the merger in April 2002, the mergerof two regional arts boards into our South Eastoffice, savings relating to reducing the use ofoffice space in London, savings in relationForeword continued Arts Council England annual review grant-in-aid accounts 2006 4344 Arts Council England annual review grant-in-aid accounts 2006Foreword continued Financial review continued to support services and procurement savings. During the year, responsibility for managing the relationship with most capital grant recipientswas delegated from the national office toregional offices. This will achieve furthersavings in lottery administration costs from2006/07 onwards. We anticipate furthersavings by rationalising IT systems and furtherreviews of staffing in 2006/07 and 2007/08. Full details relating to financial instruments are given in note 25 to the grant-in-aid accounts.Consolidated activities We prepare separate accounts for our grant-in-aid and lottery activities as required by theSecretary of State. We do not prepare a full setof consolidated accounts due to the differingaccounting policies we are required to followunder the two separate Accounts Directions.However, to give a better understanding of ouractivities, we have prepared the followingsummary results for the two accountscombined for the 408,678 368,859 Share proceeds from the National Lottery Distribution Fund 163,828 160,739 Investment returns on the Distribution Fund 8,115 8,428 Other income 12,537 10,833 Total 314,778 Other expenditure 30,216 Operating costs 54,121 49,386 Total expenditure 605,090 581,019 Exceptional items Cost of fundamental reorganisation (1,797) (462) Net (outgoing) resources (13,729) (32,622) Profit on revaluation of fixed assets 8,003 4,342 Net movement in funds (5,726) (28,280) Consolidated reserves brought forward 18,221 46,501 Consolidated reserves carried forward 12,495 18,221Consolidated activities continued The above figures for net lottery grantcommitments include an accounting policy adjustment to reflect grant-in-aid accountingpolicies (note 1). This has the effect of decreasing net grant commitments comparedwith the figures in the lottery distributionaccounts by \u00a328 million in 2005/06 (2004/05: an increase of \u00a310 million). Operating c osts have increased by \u00a35 million in the year dueto the expansion of the Creative Partnershipsprogramme and the one-off costs of thenew 'Arena' single finance, grants andmanagement information system. Approach to employee development, participation and diversity Arts Council England's training and development programmes are designed toencourage and support all employees inimproving performance and developing theirskills and competence. Six regional officeshave had Investors in People recognitionfor a number of years and the organisationachieved the award as a whole in spring 2006. We have arrangements to promote effective consultation and communication with allstaff. Executive Board and Council activitiesare disseminated through a system of teambriefing meetings, our intranet and regularlyemailed updates, supplemented from time totime by office and directorate meetings. Forthe first time, we conducted a staff satisfactionsurvey in early 2005 and have analysed andacted on the results during 2005/06. More formally, Arts Council England recognises the trade unions Amicus andUnison for consultation and collectivebargaining, and has established appropriate consultative arrangements to support thisthrough a Recognition Agreement. TheNational Joint Consultative and NegotiatingCommittee (NJCNC) handles all core pay,terms and conditions of employment andHR policies and procedures across the wholeorganisation. The NJCNC is supported byLocal Joint Consultative and NegotiatingCommittees in each of the 10 workplaces. Arts Council England seeks to ensure that the requirements of health and safetylegislation are met in the workplace.Health and safety issues of general concernare discussed with Amicus and Unison. The organisation is committed to creating a working environment that treats peoplewith fairness and respect, and is free fromdiscrimination, harassment and bullying.Policies and procedures are geared towardseliminating direct and indirect discrimination,and supporting employees in reaching theirfull potential. In recognition of our positive approach to recruiting and managing staff withdisabilities, we have been awarded the 'TwoTicks' symbol by The Employment Services.We are taking positive steps to encouragemore Black and minority ethnic, disabled andlesbian and gay people to become employedin the organisation, with support fromspecialist external advisory organisations. Following the introduction of our race equality scheme, we have been workingon a programme of 36 projects with the aimof changing the organisation and making Foreword continued Arts Council England annual review grant-in-aid accounts 2006 45Approach to employee development, participation and diversity continued real and permanent changes within thearts sector. Internally, this includes trainingstaff, reviewing all our Human Resourcesprocedures, and revamping how we dealwith complaints and procurement to includethe Commission for Racial Equality's bestpractice. We have set Black and minorityethnic staff targets for recruitment andretention and set up a Black Workers' Group. Currently, 13.5% of staff classify themselves as Black, Asian, Chinese or Dual Heritage, and2.5% of staff classify themselves as disabled. Statement of trustees' and chief executive's responsibilities Under the Royal Charter, the Arts Council is required to prepare a statement of accountsfor the financial period in the form and onthe basis directed by the Secretary of Statefor Culture, Media and Sport, with theconsent of HM Treasury. The accounts areto be prepared on an accruals basis andto show a true and fair view of the ArtsCouncil's state of affairs at the year end andof our incoming resources and resourcesexpended and cash flows for the financial year.They are also prepared so as to comply withthe Charities Statement of RecommendedPractice (revised 2005). In preparing theaccounts, the accounting officer must complywith the requirements of the GovernmentFinancial Reporting Manual and in particular to: observe the Accounts Direction* issued by the Secretary of State, which sets out accounting and disclosure requirements,and apply suitable accounting policies on a consistent basis make judgements and estimates on a reasonable basis state whether applicable accounting standards, as set out in the GovernmentFinancial Reporting Manual, have beenfollowed, and disclose and explain anymaterial departures in the financialstatements prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it isinappropriate to presume that ArtsCouncil England will continue in operation The accounting officer for DCMS has designated the chief executive as accountingofficer for the Arts Council. The responsibilitiesof the accounting officer, which include theresponsibility for the propriety and regularityof the finances for which the chief executiveis answerable, and for the keeping of properrecords, are set out in the Non-DepartmentalPublic Bodies' Accounting Officers'Memorandum, issued by HM Treasury. Peter Hewitt, Chief Executive Sir Christopher Frayling, Chair4 July 2006 *a copy of the Accounts Direction is available from the Accounting Officer,Arts Council England, 14 Great Peter Street,London SW1P 3NQ.Foreword continued 46 Arts Council England annual review grant-in-aid accounts 20061 Scope of responsibility As accounting officer and representative of the trustees, we have joint responsibilityfor maintaining a sound system of internalcontrol that supports the achievement ofArts Council England's policies, aims andobjectives, while safeguarding the publicfunds and assets for which we are responsible,in accordance with the responsibilitiesassigned to us in Government Accountingtogether with ensuring compliance withthe requirements of Arts Council England'sManagement Statement and FinancialMemorandum. 2 The purpose of the system of internal control The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level ratherthan to eliminate all risk of failure to achievepolicies, aims and objectives; it can thereforeonly provide reasonable and not absoluteassurance of effectiveness. The system ofinternal control is based on an ongoingprocess designed to identify and prioritisethe risks to the achievement of Arts CouncilEngland's policies, aims and objectives, toevaluate the likelihood of those risks beingrealised and the impact should they berealised, and to manage them efficiently,effectively and economically. The systemof internal control has been in place inArts Council England for the year ended31 March 2006 and up to the date ofapproval of the annual report and accounts,and accords with Treasury guidance. Arts Council England's policy on risk can be summarised as follows. The organisation willat all times ensure that we meet our statutory reporting and regulatory obligations, that it isaccountable to the public and will maintainsystems to ensure that it protects its resources.Against this background, risk-taking isacceptable where it helps to deliver theorganisation's core objectives. It is Arts Council England's intention that risk-taking is not avoided; it is managed. Thekey to this approach is understanding the risksit faces, their causes and how to control them,and then focusing attention on key risks. 3 Capacity to handle risk Arts Council England undergoes a six-monthlyreview of its central risk register. The registercaptures risks identified by staff across theorganisation and categorises these risks asstrategic, operational, financial, external,reputational, human resources or compliancerisks. Their impact and likelihood of occurrenceare evaluated by senior staff, and decisionsare taken on whether to tolerate, transfer,terminate or treat the risk. Steps to mitigateagainst each risk are identified and recorded inthe register and assigned to a member of theExecutive Board to manage. A summary of thehigh level risks is presented to Arts CouncilEngland's Audit Committee every six months. Risk management forms part of the organisation's ongoing activity and is addressedas standard practice in its corporate projectplans. It continues to be a key element of howArts Council England monitors its corporatepolicies and initiatives. Each corporate projectis monitored against milestones and issupported by a risk management plan. Statement on internal control Arts Council England annual review grant-in-aid accounts 2006 473 Capacity to handle risk continued During 2005/06, the organisation developedits approach to capturing risk by broadeningthe involvement of staff and by discussing riskissues with senior management teams in eachoffice. In addition, Council regularly reviewsrisks facing its major funded organisations.Arts Council England is also discussing withthe Department for Culture, Media and Sporthow it can best share its common risks anddevelop joint monitoring plans. 4 The risk and control framework The system of internal control is based on a framework of regular managementinformation, administrative proceduresincluding the segregation of duties, anda system of delegation and accountability.Arts Council England has established thefollowing processes: a) A national Council, made up of the trustees of Arts Council England, which hasa code of practice which includes a policyon declaration and registration of interests.Its defined responsibilities include: strategic planning and control including approval each year of a corporate planand approval of the overall budgetallocation on a three-year basis delegating responsibility for specific matters to the regional councils being accountable for public funds, ensuring that Arts Council Englandconducts operations economically,efficiently and effectively approving the annual report and accounts ensuring that Arts Council England fulfils its obligations as an employer andcomplies with all relevant legislationb) An Audit Committee with agreed terms of reference which include: reviewing Arts Council England's internal and external financial statements toensure they reflect best practice considering internal and external audit reports and reviewing Arts CouncilEngland's relationship with its internaland external auditors reviewing the effectiveness of Arts Council England's internal control system, includingthe review of the risk management policyand risk register reporting to the national Council on the above duties c) An Executive Board and Management Committee sub group with defined termsof reference which include: developing the corporate policy on high level issues and overseeing theimplementation of nationally agreedpolicies and plans receiving and monitoring financial information relevant to Arts CouncilEngland's overall managementresponsibilities taking decisions within delegated powers and approving further delegation asappropriate d) An internal audit function that operates to standards defined in the GovernmentInternal Audit Standards and whoseprogramme of work is agreed andmonitored by the Audit Committee.Internal auditors base their annual internalaudit plans on an analysis of the risk towhich Arts Council England is exposed.

Our review of the effectiveness ofthe system of internal control is informedby the work of the internal auditors and theExecutive Board, who have responsibility forthe development and maintenance of theinternal control framework, and commentsmade by the external auditors in theirmanagement letter and other reports. Wehave been advised on the implications of theresult of our review of the effectiveness ofthe system of internal control by ExecutiveBoard and the Audit Committee and plan toaddress weaknesses and ensure continuousimprovement of the system in place. Improvements to internal controls made during the year include the establishment of adedicated procurement staffing resource andtraining on current procurement policy. Thishas been rolled out across the organisation.Improvements to the procurement processhave been included in the specification forthe new grants and information system,which will be implemented during 2006/07. During 2005/06, the organisation also ran training for senior managers to enhance their understanding of internal financial controls.This included information on Arts CouncilEngland's regulatory framework and keyissues arising from it, including fraud. Lastly, the organisation r estructured the chief executive's unit to increase resources inparticular in relation to corporate governanceand planning.

They meetthe requirements of the Companies Acts, and of the Statements of Standard AccountingPractice/Financial Reporting Standards issuedand adopted by the Accounting StandardsBoard, so far as those requirements areappropriate. The accounts are presentedin accordance with the revised Statement ofRecommended Practice (SORP) issued by theCharity Commission in 2005, and comparativeamounts have been restated accordingly. The accounts are prepared on a historic cost basis. The Accounts Direction requires theinclusion of fixed assets at their value tothe business by reference to current costs.However, for 2005/06, the values of fixedassets expressed in current cost terms, withthe exception of the works of art collectionand freehold land and buildings, arenot materially different to historic costs.Therefore these fixed assets are shown athistoric cost on the balance sheet. Freeholdland and buildings are revalued periodicallyto current market value and are includedat this valuation on the balance sheet. Separate accounts have been prepared for the Arts Council's lottery activities, in accordancewith the directions issued by the Secretaryof State, which follow different accountingpolicies. Grant commitments are recognisedin the lottery accounts once grant offers areaccepted. Grant commitments in the grant-in-aid accounts are recognised when theoffer is issued. Consequently, in the opinionof the trustees, it is not possible to prepare full consolidated accounts covering bothgrant-in-aid and lottery activities as it wouldnot provide a fair view of the application ofthe Arts Council's resources. In this respect, wehave not been able to comply with paragraph381 of the SORP issued by the CharityCommission in 2005. However, we haveincluded a summary of the consolidatedfigures for our combined activities and anestimate of the impact of the change inaccounting policy on the lottery accounts inthe foreword to the accounts, on page 44. b) Incoming resources All income is accounted for on a receivablebasis. Grant-in-aid from the Department forCulture, Media and Sport allocated to generalpurposes is taken to the statement of financialactivities in the year in which it is received. c) Expenditure Grant expenditure is charged to the statementof financial activities in the year in whichfunded activities take place. Any amountsunpaid from grants at the year end are shownin the balance sheet as creditors. Grant commitments made in the year relating to future years' activity as disclosedin note 14 of the accounts are not chargedto the statement of financial activities, as wecannot r ecognise grant-in-aid income to match against these commitments before wehave received it. The trustees do not believethis would provide a true and fair view ofthe Arts Council's resources. In this respect,we have not been able to comply withparagraph 159 of the SORP issued by the Charity Commission in 2005. Any advance payments to funded organisations in Notes to the grant-in-aid accounts 56 Arts Council England annual review grant-in-aid accounts 20061 Accounting policies continued anticipation of grants to be charged in the following financial year are shown as assetsin the balance sheet. Expenditure classified as activities undertaken directly relates to expenditure supporting the arts other than grants. This includes the cost of delivering major arts policies and projects. Support costs comprise operational expenditure, including staff costs, directlyattributable to charitable activities. Governance costs comprise an apportionment of general administration expenditure basedon an estimate of staff time and direct costssuch as the cost of administering Counciland external and internal audit. d) Depreciation and fixed assets Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixedassets (excluding freehold land and works ofart) at rates calculated to write off the costless estimated residual value of each assetsystematically over its expected useful lifeas follows: freehold buildings: 50 years leasehold buildings: life of the lease equipment, fixtures and fittings: four years motor vehicles: four years A full year's depreciation is provided in the year of an asset's acquisition, and none inthe year of its disposal. Software costs arewritten off in full in the year of acquisition.Donated fixed assets are capitalised andincluded as income at market value in theyear in which they are received. All individualassets valued greater than \u00a32,000 arecapitalised, except our freehold interests in the South Bank Centre and National Theatreas described in notes 17 and 18 of theseaccounts. Our works of art collection is revalued at market value on a rolling basis, with all assetsbeing revalued at least once every five years,and the highest value items at least everythree years. e) Leases Costs in respect of operating leases are chargedto the income and expenditure account on astraight line basis over the life of the lease. f) Taxation Arts Council England is a registered charity(No 1036733) and is eligible under the Incomeand Corporation Taxes Act 1988 to seek fromHM Revenue and Customs exemption fromtaxes on income arising from its charitableobjectives. HM Revenue and Customs hasgranted this exemption. Accordingly, notaxation has been provided for in theseaccounts. g) Pensions We provide a defined benefit pension schemefor our employees (the Arts Council RetirementPlan 1994) and are a participating employer inthe West Yorkshire Pension Fund. However, asthese are multi-employer schemes, we cannotidentify our share of the underlying assets andliabilities. We have therefore accounted for theschemes as if they were defined contributionschemes, in accordance with FRS17 Retirement Benefits , with the costs of the schemes charged to the statement of financial activities.

We are required to apportion indirect costs properlybetween the two areas on a full cost basis in accordance with goodaccounting practice. The notes to the statement of financial activitiesare shown before costs apportioned to the Arts Council lotterydistribution accounts. In accordance with the SORP 2005, we have apportioned support costs between our differ ent activities. We have used an estimate of staff time spent on each activity to do this. Prior year figures have been restated accordingly. i) Notional costs In accordance with HM Treasury guidance, the notional cost of capitalis charged in the statement of financial activities in arriving at a netincoming/(outgoing) resources figure. This is then added back in thestatement of financial activities, and so no provision is included onthe balance sheet. 2 Voluntary income Unrestricted Restricted Total Total funds funds 2005/06 2004/05 \u00a3000s \u00a3000s \u00a3000s \u00a3000s Cash grant-in-aid paid in full 369,152 0 369,152 340,455 Capital funds for South Bank Centre 0 2,000 2,000 0 Capital funds for Capital of Culture 0 3,000 3,000 0 Other ring-fenced funds 0 2,800 2,800 0 Creative 2006 1,874 0 1,874 2,874 Grant-in-aid as shown in the statement financial 368,152 40,526 408,678 368,859Notes to the grant-in-aid accounts continuedArts Council England annual review grant-in-aid accounts 2006 593 Incoming resources from charitable activities Unrestricted Restricted Total Total funds funds 2005/06 2004/05 \u00a3000s \u00a3000s \u00a3000s 139 9,693 9,832 8,304 Local authority subscriptions 380 3 383 89 Sundry 310 91 401 456 829 9,787 10,616 8,849 \u00a3000s \u00a3000s \u00a3000s Grants, sponsorship and donations are analysed as follows: Arts Council of Northern Ireland 0 150 150 200 Arts Council of Wales 0 150 150 0 Association of Greater Manchester Authorities 0 340 340 170 Birmingham City Council 0 189 189 0 Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council 08 48 4 101 Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment 0 223 223 258 Department for Culture, Media and Sport 0 375 375 350 Department for Education and Skills 0 2,504 2,504 2,591 Deutsche Bank 06 06 0 1,003 1,003 0 Esmee Fairbairn Foundation 08 48 4 0 European Regional Development Fund 0 970 970 83 European Social Fund 0 1,118 1,118 1,924 Lancashire County Council 06 96 9 69 Manchester City Council 0 101 101 170 North West Development Agency 05 85 8 362 Northumberland County Council 07 37 3 0 Nottingham County Council 07 07 0 0 One NorthEast 0 200 200 250 Scottish Arts Council 0 240 240 120 South East England Development Agency 0 203 203 392 Other 139 1,429 1,568 1,264 139 9,693 9,832 8,304Notes to Arts Council England annual review grant-in-aid accounts 20064a Charitable activities Activities Grant Net undertaken funding of support Total Total directly activities costs 2005/06 2004/05 individuals those organisations of strategic importance with which the Arts Council has long-term, multi-yearfunding agreements Grants for the arts - individuals are awards for activities that benefit people in England or help artists from England to carry out their work Strategic funding and activities are those specific projects funded by grants and direct arts expenditure.

The total amountreimbursed in the year is shown in note 9. 7 Pensions We are a participating employer in theArts Council Retirement Plan (1994), andthe West Yorkshire Pension Fund and alsocontribute to a group personal pensionarrangement.Arts Council Retirement Plan (1994) The scheme is a defined benefit scheme.However, because it is a multi-employerscheme, we are unable to identify ourshare of the underlying assets and liabilities.Consequently, we have accounted for thescheme as if it were a defined contributionscheme, in accordance with FRS17Retirement Benefits . The scheme is financed by payments by Arts Council England and employees intoa trustee-administered fund independentof Arts Council England's finances. Thesecontributions are invested by a leading fundmanagement company. The net market valueof the scheme's assets at 31 March 2006 was\u00a348.3 million. An actuarial valuation of the pension fund takes place every three years. At the lastvaluation on 1 April 2005, the actuarial valueof the assets using the projected unit methodwas sufficient to cover 67% of the valueaccrued to members, a deficit of \u00a317,100,000.As a result, and on the advice of the actuary, we will be increasing our employer'scontribution to 23.5% with effect from1 April 2006. The main long-term assumptions used for the actuarial valuation were as follows: Price inflation rate 2.9%Rate of pay increases 4.4%Rate of pension increases 2.8% Amounts due to the fund at 31 March 2006 were \u00a3nil (31 March 2005: \u00a3nil).Notes to the grant-in-aid accounts continuedArts Council England annual review grant-in-aid accounts 2006 637 Pensions continued West Yorkshire Pension FundWe are an admitted member of the WestYorkshire Pension Fund.

Consequently, we haveaccounted for the scheme as if it were adefined contribution scheme, in accordancewith FRS17 Retirement Benefits . The net market value of total scheme assets at 31 March 2006 was \u00a36.6 million. An actuarial valuation of the pension fund takes place every three years. At the lastvaluation on 31 March 2004, the actuarialvalue of the assets using the projected unitmethod was sufficient to cover 82% of thevalue accrued to members. From 1 April 2003,employer contributions were set at 15%. The main long-term assumptions used for the actuarial valuation were: Rate of inflation 2.8%Rate of pay increases 4.6%Rate of pension increases 2.8% Amounts due to the fund at 31 March 2006 were \u00a3nil (31 March 2005: \u00a342,000).

It is not held for investment or resale, and is thereforeclassified as a designated fund. Arts Council England also owns a library of 20th century poetry that is managed by the Hayward Gallery. Due to the difficulty in obtainingan accurate valuation for this asset, it has not been included on thebalance sheet. 11 Costs apportioned to Arts Council England lottery distribution accounts Directions issued by the Secretary of State require that costs incurred which relate to both grant-in-aid and lottery activities should beapportioned between the two in accordance with good accountingpractice. Consequently, we have apportioned them accordingly, basedon an assessment of time spent on each activity. Costs associatedwith Creative Partnerships are excluded from this assessment. 12 Debtors 31 March 31 March 2006 2005 \u00a3000s \u00a3000s Trade debtors 4,350 2,298 Other debtors accrued income 1,249 3,392 6,309 6,252 13 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year 31 March 31 March 2006 2005 \u00a3000s \u00a3000s Trade creditors 749 2,055 Other creditors including taxes and social security 418 164 Accruals and deferred income 8,629 5,822 9,796 8,041Notes to the grant-in-aid accounts continued66 Arts Council England annual review grant-in-aid accounts 200614 Grant offers 31 March 31 March at 31 March 2006 mainly represents allocations for regularly funded organisations for the three-year funding cycle2005/06 to 2007/08 that were announced before the year end. 15 Leases At 31 March 2006, the Arts Council had annual commitmentsunder non-cancellable operating leases as set out below.

Arts Council England has appointed a number of specialised solicitors to its externalsolicitor pool. We attempt to abide by the Better Payment Practice Code, and in particular to pay bills inaccordance with contract. Invoices are normallysettled within our suppliers' standard terms,usually 30 days. In 2005/06, ofundisputed lottery invoices were paid within30 days (2004/05: 85%). Structure, governance and management Arts Council England was established by Royal Charter on 13 March 1994, taking overthose responsibilities in England previouslydischarged by the Arts Council of GreatBritain. The objectives of the Arts Council asstated in the Royal Charter, our governingdocument, are i) to develop and improve theknowledge, understanding and practice ofthe arts, ii) to increase accessibility of the artsto the public, and iii) to advise and cooperatewith other government departments, localauthorities and the Arts Councils for Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland (or theirsuccessors). To this end, we make grantsto artists and arts organisations and engagein other activities on behalf of the sector. Arts Council England was granted a Supplemental Charter on 18 March 2002.Its purpose was 'to give effect to newarrangements for regionalisation of its structureand activities'. There were no changes to theobjects of the Arts Council and the mainchanges relate to our powers to establishForeword continued 78 Arts Council England annual review lottery distribution accounts 2006Structure, governance and management continued and to delegate powers and functions to regional councils. The charter sets out thenew composition of the Council, whichincludes the chairs of the regional councils. Arts Council England works at arm's length from government and has the status of anon-departmental public body. As such, we areregulated in accordance with a ManagementStatement/Financial Memorandum issuedby the Secretary of State. We prepareour accounts for grant-in-aid and lotteryseparately to comply with Accounts Directionsalso issued by the Secretary of State. Arts Council England has nine regional offices, matching the government's regionalboundaries, and a national office. Each regionhas a council and the 15-strong nationalCouncil (details on page 77) includes the chairof each of the regional councils. The nationalCouncil met in formal session five timesduring the year and monitored the work ofthe chief executive and staff. Council membersare appointed by the Secretary of State forCulture, Media and Sport and are eligiblefor reappointment. The term of office isdetermined by the Secretary of State. The Executive Board is made up of the Chief Executive, Peter Hewitt, the nine regionalexecutive directors and the four executivedirectors at the national office for arts,development, external relations, and financeand operations. The Arts Council maintains a register of interests of its members, which is availablefor public inspection by appointment at our Great Peter Street address. Our priorities for 2006 to 2008, as published inOur agenda , are: taking part in the arts children and young people the creative economy vibrant communities internationalism celebrating diversity During 2005, Arts Council England took part in a peer review process run by the Departmentfor Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). Thisis designed to modernise the relationshipbetween DCMS and non-departmental publicbodies and help the latter improve overall performance. In December 2005, we published an action plan identifying a number of ways in which weare responding to the key recommendationsin the peer review team's report. Research activity Arts Council England's three-year researchstrategy for 2003-06 is designed to addressour strategic objectives, gather the dataneeded to demonstrate public accountability,evaluate the outcomes of our funding, developa sound evidence base which can be usedto inform and evaluate policy and planning,and provide research findings to help makethe case for the arts. During the year, we contributed funding to a major new survey of the general public, Taking Part, commissioned by DCMS in partnership with Sport England, English Heritage and Foreword continued Arts Council England annual review lottery distribution accounts 2006 79Research activity continued the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council.Information was collected from approximately6,000 adults about their attendance at,participation in, and attitudes to the arts.As well as giving us valuable informationon levels of engagement with the arts, thedata will also be used to report to DCMS onprogress towards achieving the performanceindicator in the Funding Agreement. For someresults of the survey, see pages 133 to 135. Financial review Arts Council England receives grant-in-aidfrom DCMS and is one of the bodiesdesignated to distribute funds from theNational Lottery by the National Lottery etcAct 1993 (as amended by the NationalLottery Act 1998). This licence is currentlyunder review and an announcement as to thefuture distributors will be made in June 2006. This year, for the first time, we have implemented significant changes to thedisclosure made in the annual accounts asrequired under the new Financial ReportingManual issued by HM Treasury, including theremuneration report on pages 34 to 36. Thisreport replaces notes previously included in thegrant-in-aid and lottery accounts on executivedirectors' and Council members' remuneration. New lottery grant commitments (offers made and accepted) in the year totalled \u00a3211million. At year end, a total of \u00a3208 millionaccepted grant commitments remainedoutstanding and awaiting payment togetherwith \u00a315 million commitments offered butnot accepted. This compares with a balancein the National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF), plus bank balances, of \u00a3163 million.We monitor levels of lottery income closely,and the level of outstanding grantcommitments is considered prudent, basedon past and projected income flows. At 31 March 2006, our balance in the NLDF account was \u00a3153 million. This is less thanthe target balance agreed with DCMS of\u00a3160 million. The cash balance at the samedate stood at \u00a310 million. Throughout the year we awarded grants in support of the arts under a number ofseparate schemes and programmes. Theseincluded our current scheme, Grants for thearts, and also the Arts Capital Programme,Stabilisation programme and Awards for All. Ofamounts approved in principle in the previousyear, only \u00a33 million had not been offered asgrants by the year end under Grants for thearts - capital programme. The equivalent figurefor the Arts Capital Programme was \u00a33 million. In 2005/06, we delivered a combined lottery and grant-in-aid administrative saving of\u00a37.3 million compared to the target of\u00a36.7 million in our Funding Agreementand agreed with DCMS (2004/05 saving\u00a37 million; target \u00a36 million). The savings arose from a number of areas. These include the reduction of staff numbersfollowing the merger in April 2002, the mergerof two regional arts boards into our South Eastoffice, savings relating to reducing the use ofoffice space in London, savings in relation tosupport services and procurement savings.Foreword continued 80 Arts Council England annual review lottery distribution accounts 2006Financial review continued During the year, responsibility for managing therelationship with most capital grant recipientswas delegated from the national office toregional offices which will achieve savings inlottery administration costs. We anticipatefurther savings by rationalising IT systems and further reviews of staffing in 2006/07 and2007/08. Further details of the activities and policies of the Arts Council are included in the NationalLottery report 2005/06 (see pages 106 to 129). Full details in relation to financial instruments are given in note 20 of the notes to thelottery accounts. Approach to employee development, participation and diversity Arts Council England's training and development programmes are designed toencourage and support all employees inimproving performance and developing theirskills and competence. Six regional officeshave had Investors in People recognitionfor a number of years and the organisationachieved the award as a whole in spring 2006. We have arrangements to promote effective consultation and communication with allstaff. Executive Board and Council activitiesare disseminated through a system of teambriefing meetings, our intranet and regularlyemailed updates, supplemented from time totime by office and directorate meetings. Forthe first time, we conducted a staff satisfactionsurvey in early 2005 and have analysed andacted on the results during 2005/06.More formally, Arts Council England recognises the trade unions Amicus andUnison for consultation and collectivebargaining, and has established appropriateconsultative arrangements to support thisthrough a Recognition Agreement. TheNational Joint Consultative and NegotiatingCommittee (NJCNC) handles all core pay,terms and conditions of employment andHR policies and procedures across the wholeorganisation. The NJCNC is supported byLocal Joint Consultative and NegotiatingCommittees in each of the 10 workplaces. Arts Council England seeks to ensure that the requirements of health and safetylegislation are met in the workplace. Healthand safety issues of general concern arediscussed with Amicus and Unison. The organisation is committed to creating a working environment that treats peoplewith fairness and respect, and is free fromdiscrimination, harassment and bullying.Policies and procedures are geared towardseliminating direct and indirect discrimination,and supporting employees in reaching theirfull potential. In recognition of our positive approach to recruiting and managing staff with disabilities,we have been awarded the 'Two Ticks'symbol by The Employment Services. Weare taking positive steps to encourage moreBlack and minority ethnic, disabled andlesbian and gay people to become employedin the organisation, with support fromspecialist external advisory organisations.Foreword continued Arts Council England annual review lottery distribution accounts 2006 81Approach to employee development, participation and diversity continued Following the introduction of our raceequality scheme, we have been workingon a programme of 36 projects with the aimof changing the organisation and makingreal and permanent changes within thearts sector. Internally, this includes trainingstaff, reviewing all our Human Resourcesprocedures, and revamping how we dealwith complaints and procurement to includethe Commission for Racial Equality's bestpractice. We have set Black and minorityethnic staff targets for recruitment andretention and set up a Black Workers' Group. Currently, 13.5% of staff classify themselves as Black, Asian, Chinese or Dual Heritage, and2.5% of staff classify themselves as disabled. Statement of Council's and chief executive's responsibilities Under the National Lottery etc Act 1993 (as amended by the National Lottery Act 1998),the Arts Council is required to prepare astatement of accounts for the financialperiod in the form and on the basis directedby the Secretary of State for Culture, Mediaand Sport, with the consent of HM Treasury.The accounts are to be prepared on anaccruals basis and to show a true and fairview of the Arts Council's state of affairs atthe year end and of our incoming resourcesand resources expended and cash flows forthe financial year. In preparing the accounts,the accounting officer must comply with therequirements of the Government FinancialReporting Manual and in particular to: observe the Accounts Direction* issued by the Secretary of State, which sets out accounting and disclosure requirements, and apply suitable accounting policies ona consistent basis make judgements and estimates on a reasonable basis state whether applicable accounting standards, as set out in the Government Financial Reporting Manual, have been followed, and disclose and explain any material departures in the financialstatements prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it isinappropriate to presume that ArtsCouncil England will continue in operation The accounting officer for DCMS has designated the chief executive as accountingofficer for the Arts Council. The responsibilitiesof the accounting officer, which include theresponsibility for the propriety and regularityof the finances for which the chief executiveis answerable, and for the keeping of properrecords, are set out in the Non-DepartmentalPublic Bodies' Accounting Officers'Memorandum, issued by HM Treasury. Peter Hewitt, Chief Executive Sir Christopher Frayling, Chair4 July 2006 * a copy of the Accounts Direction is available from the Accounting Officer,Arts Council England, 14 Great Peter Street,London SW1P 3NQ.Foreword continued 82 Arts Council England annual review lottery distribution accounts 20061 Scope of responsibility As accounting officer and representative of the trustees, we have joint responsibilityfor maintaining a sound system of internalcontrol that supports the achievement ofArts Council England's policies, aims andobjectives, while safeguarding the publicfunds and assets for which we are responsible,in accordance with the responsibilitiesassigned to us in Government Accountingtogether with ensuring compliance withthe requirements of Arts Council England'sManagement Statement and FinancialMemorandum. 2 The purpose of the system of internal control The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level ratherthan to eliminate all risk of failure to achievepolicies, aims and objectives; it can thereforeonly provide reasonable and not absoluteassurance of effectiveness. The system ofinternal control is based on an ongoingprocess designed to identify and prioritisethe risks to the achievement of Arts CouncilEngland's policies, aims and objectives, toevaluate the likelihood of those risks beingrealised and the impact should they berealised, and to manage them efficiently,effectively and economically. The systemof internal control has been in place inArts Council England for the year ended31 March 2006 and up to the date ofapproval of the annual report and accounts,and accords with Treasury guidance. Arts Council England's policy on risk can be summarised as follows. The organisation willat all times ensure that we meet our statutory reporting and regulatory obligations, that it isaccountable to the public and will maintainsystems to ensure that it protects its resources.Against this background, risk-taking isacceptable where it helps to deliver theorganisation's core objectives. It is Arts Council England's intention that risk-taking is not avoided; it is managed. Thekey to this approach is understanding the risksit faces, their causes and how to control them,and then focusing attention on key risks. 3 Capacity to handle risk Arts Council England undergoes a six-monthlyreview of its central risk register. The registercaptures risks identified by staff across theorganisation and categorises these risks asstrategic, operational, financial, external,reputational, human resources or compliancerisks. Their impact and likelihood of occurrenceare evaluated by senior staff, and decisionsare taken on whether to tolerate, transfer,terminate or treat the risk. Steps to mitigateagainst each risk are identified and recorded inthe register and assigned to a member of theExecutive Board to manage. A summary of thehigh level risks is presented to Arts CouncilEngland's Audit Committee every six months. Risk management forms part of the organisation's ongoing activity and is addressedas standard practice in its corporate projectplans. It continues to be a key element of howArts Council England monitors its corporatepolicies and initiatives. Each corporate projectis monitored against milestones and issupported by a risk management plan. Statement on internal control Arts Council England annual review lottery distribution accounts 2006 833 Capacity to handle risk continued During 2005/06, the organisation developedits approach to capturing risk by broadeningthe involvement of staff and by discussing riskissues with senior management teams in eachoffice. In addition, Council regularly reviewsrisks facing its major funded organisations.Arts Council England is also discussing withthe Department for Culture, Media and Sporthow it can best share its common risks anddevelop joint monitoring plans. 4 The risk and control framework The system of internal control is based on a framework of regular managementinformation, administrative proceduresincluding the segregation of duties, anda system of delegation and accountability.Arts Council England has established thefollowing processes: a) A national Council, made up of the trustees of Arts Council England, which hasa code of practice which includes a policyon declaration and registration of interests.Its defined responsibilities include: strategic planning and control including approval each year of a corporate planand approval of the overall budgetallocation on a three-year basis delegating responsibility for specific matters to the regional councils being accountable for public funds, ensuring that Arts Council Englandconducts operations economically,efficiently and effectively approving the annual report and accounts ensuring that Arts Council England fulfils its obligations as an employer andcomplies with all relevant legislationb) An Audit Committee with agreed terms of reference which include: reviewing Arts Council England's internal and external financial statements toensure they reflect best practice considering internal and external audit reports and reviewing Arts CouncilEngland's relationship with its internaland external auditors reviewing the effectiveness of Arts Council England's internal control system, includingthe review of the risk management policyand risk register reporting to the national Council on the above duties c) An Executive Board and Management Committee sub group with defined termsof reference which include: developing the corporate policy on high level issues and overseeing theimplementation of nationally agreedpolicies and plans receiving and monitoring financial information relevant to Arts CouncilEngland's overall managementresponsibilities taking decisions within delegated powers and approving further delegation asappropriate d) An internal audit function that operates to standards defined in the GovernmentInternal Audit Standards and whoseprogramme of work is agreed andmonitored by the Audit Committee.Internal auditors base their annual internalaudit plans on an analysis of the risk towhich Arts Council England is exposed.

Our review of the effectiveness ofthe system of internal control is informedby the work of the internal auditors and theExecutive Board, who have responsibility forthe development and maintenance of theinternal control framework, and commentsmade by the external auditors in theirmanagement letter and other reports. Wehave been advised on the implications of theresult of our review of the effectiveness ofthe system of internal control by ExecutiveBoard and the Audit Committee and plan toaddress weaknesses and ensure continuousimprovement of the system in place. Improvements to internal controls made during the year include the establishment of adedicated procurement staffing resource andtraining on current procurement policy. Thishas been rolled out across the organisation.Improvements to the procurement processhave been included in the specification forthe new grants and information system,which will be implemented during 2006/07. During 2005/06, the organisation also ran training for senior managers to enhance their understanding of internal financial controls.This included information on Arts CouncilEngland's regulatory framework and keyissues arising from it, including fraud. Lastly, the organisation r estructured the chief executive's unit to increase resources inparticular in relation to corporate governanceand planning.

The Accounts Direction requiresthe inclusion of fixed assets at their valueto the business by reference to current costs.However, for 2005/06, the values of fixedassets expressed in current cost terms arenot materially different to historic costs, andso fixed assets are shown at historic cost onthe balance sheet. Separate accounts have been prepared for the activities funded from grant-in-aid,in accordance with the directions issuedby the Secretary of State. Consolidatedaccounts have not been prepared. b) Recognition of income and expenditure All income and expenditure are accountedfor on a receivable basis.As required by the Secretary of State, we have made a distinction between lottery grants thatare 'hard' and 'soft' commitments. A hardcommitment is when the Arts Council hasmade a firm offer of grant which (togetherwith appropriate conditions) has beenaccepted by the recipient. A soft commitmentis when we have agreed in principle to fund ascheme and made an offer, but the offer andassociated conditions have not been accepted. Hard commitments are recognised as items of expenditure in the income and expenditureaccount. Details of soft commitments aredisclosed in note 9 to the accounts. Hard commitments payable within one year of the balance sheet date are recognised inthe balance sheet as current liabilities. Thosepayable more than one year from the balancesheet date are shown as grant commitmentsover one year. c) Depreciation and fixed assets Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixedassets financed by lottery funds at ratescalculated to write off the cost less estimatedresidual value of each asset systematicallyover its expected useful life as follows: leasehold buildings: the life of the lease equipment, fixtures and fittings: four years a full year's depreciation is provided in the year of an asset's acquisition,and none in the year of its disposal software costs are written off in full in the year of acquisition1 Accounting policies continued Assets used jointly for grant-in-aid andlottery activities are accounted for in thegrant-in-aid accounts. A capital recharge forthe use of these assets by lottery is includedin the apportioned costs (1g). d) National Lottery Distribution Fund Balances held in the National LotteryDistribution Fund remain under thestewardship of the Secretary of State forCulture, Media and Sport. However, theshare of these balances attributable toArts Council England is as shown in theaccounts and, at the balance sheet date, hasbeen notified by the Secretary of State forCulture, Media and Sport as being availablefor distribution by Arts Council England forcurrent and future commitments. e) Taxation Arts Council England is a registered charity(No 1036733) and is eligible under the Incomeand Corporation Taxes Act 1988 to seek fromHM Revenue and Customs exemption fromtaxes on income arising from its charitableobjectives. HM Revenue and Customs hasgranted this exemption. Accordingly, notaxation has been provided for in theseaccounts.f) Pensions We provide a defined benefit pensionscheme for our employees (the Arts CouncilRetirement Plan 1994) and are a participatingemployer in the West Yorkshire PensionFund. However, as these are multi-employerschemes, we cannot identify our share ofthe underlying assets and liabilities. We havetherefore accounted for the schemes as ifthey were defined contribution schemes,in accordance with FRS17 Retirement Benefits , with the costs of the schemes charged to thestatement of financial activities. g) Apportioned costs Arts Council England incurs indirect costs,which are shared between activities fundedfrom grant-in-aid and activities funded fromthe National Lottery. We are required toapportion indirect costs properly betweenthe two areas in accordance with goodaccounting practice. h) Notional costs Arts Council England is required to calculatea notional cost of capital, which is disclosedin the income and expenditure account.These accounts cover the lottery distributionactivities of Arts Council England, and onlyfunds from the National Lottery are includedwhich bear a cost of capital of 0%.

Arts Council Retirement Plan (1994) The scheme is a defined benefit scheme.However, because it is a multi-employerscheme, we are unable to identify our shareof the underlying assets and liabilities.Consequently, we have accounted for thescheme as if it were a defined contributionscheme, in accordance with FRS17Retirement Benefits .The scheme is financed by payments by Arts Council England and employees intoa trustee-administered fund independentof Arts Council England's finances. Thesecontributions are invested by a leadingfund management company. The net marketvalue of the scheme's assets at 31 March2006 was \u00a348.3 million. An actuarial valuation of the pension fund takes place every three years. At the lastvaluation on 1 April 2005, the actuarialvalue of the assets using the projected unitmethod was sufficient to cover 67% ofthe value accrued to members, a deficit of\u00a317,100,000. As a result, and on the adviceof the actuary, we will be increasing ouremployer's contribution to 23.5% with effectfrom 1 April 2006. The main long-term assumptions used for the actuarial valuation were as follows:Price inflation rate 2.9%Rate of pay increases 4.4%Rate of pension increases 2.8% Amounts due to the fund at 31 March 2006 were \u00a3nil (31 March 2005: \u00a3nil). West Yorkshire Pension Fund We are an admitted member of the WestYorkshire Pension Fund. The scheme is adefined benefit scheme. However, becauseit is a multi-employer scheme, we are unableto identify our share of the underlying assetsand liabilities.

Arts Council England's ongoing commitments policy can be summarised as follows. Based on forecasts of income and theanticipated timing of cash flows against existing commitments, ArtsCouncil England will set additional commitments at such a level thatour National Lottery Distribution Fund balance will move towards andthen remain at a balance of \u00a350 million. However, as the end of thecurrent licence period in January 2009 approaches, this ongoing policywill be tempered by the need to ensure that outstanding commitmentsdo not exceed the total amount of lottery cash forecast to be available. Given our commitments policy, the impact of the January 2009 date and the fact that lottery licence arrangements beyond that date werenot confirmed until June 2006, the fund's balances for the next threeyears are forecast as follows: Target Actual \u00a3000s \u00a3000s 31 March 2005 175,000 173,260 31 March 2006 160,000 153,235 31 March 2007 105,000 n/a 31 March 2008 50,000 n/a These forecasts reflect Arts Council England's best estimate of the likely timing of future grant payments, and the level of future lotteryticket sales. The latter is informed by forecasts provided by theDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport. The timing of future grantpayments, particularly on major capital projects, can be subject tomaterial variation beyond Arts Council England's control, dependingon the circumstances of the individual projects themselves.Notes to the lottery distribution accounts continued Arts Council England annual review lottery distribution accounts 2006 978 Notional costs The Arts Council is required to calculate a notional cost of capital, which is disclosed in the income and expenditure account.

We completed the transfer of monitoring large scale capital projects from our nationaloffice. The regional offices best appreciatethe needs of the local communities whichthe projects are intended to benefit. At thesame time, we established a team in ournational office to provide support andexpertise for the technical aspects ofconstruction and renovation projects. The development and delivery of our lottery programmes were determined by our prioritiesfor the arts as laid out in our corporate plan.Further details on how we achieved this in2005/06 can be found in this report onpages 108 to 113. We continued to improve Grants for the arts, our flagship programme. In autumn 2005,we introduced an improved application packbased on the findings of the evaluation ofthe programme that we published in March2005. We carried out further usability andaccessibility testing in March 2006. Thisshowed the print and website versions of theapplication materials are working well andidentified some improvements we can maketo the website version. We are working on thisfor the pack published in September 2006. During the year, we also received the results of a major evaluation of our Stabilisationprogrammes. The findings are informingGrants for the arts funding for organisations,enabling them to develop their capabilitiesand strengths and to ensure that they thrive. Youth Music, which distributes \u00a310 million on our behalf, provided funding for musical provision for children and young people, targeting those who would not otherwisehave an opportunity to learn an instrument or to make music. In addition to our \u00a310 million, Youth Music raised \u00a31.2 million fromother sources enabling our lottery funds togo further. We continued to work in partnership with other lottery distributors to provide supportand funding to the Awards for All programme.Awards for All provides small scale fundingfor a range of voluntary and community-based projects through a quick and simpleapplication process. During 2005/06, work wasundertaken to redesign the programme toraise the upper limit for grants from \u00a35,000 to\u00a310,000. The new Awards for All programmein England, making grants between \u00a3300and \u00a310,000, was launched in April 2006. We continued to work with Sport England, the Big Lottery Fund, the Department for Culture,Media and Sport (DCMS), and the Departmentfor Education and Skills in delivering the Spacefor Sport and Arts Programme. From 2000 tothe end of 2005/06, the programme fundedaround 270 new or modernised facilities for sport and arts at primary schools.

We supported this exerciseand undertook a range of activities toencourage responses from artists, artsorganisations and the wider public on howlottery funding can best support the arts.The outcome of the consultation processwill be known in June 2006 when DCMSpublishes its plans for the future of theNational Lottery. Policy Directions Under the National Lottery etc Act 1993,the Secretary of State issued Policy Directionsin August 1998, which we must take intoaccount in distributing National Lotteryfunds. These are set out below, with ashort explanation of how the directionshave been met. The references below relate to the National Lottery etc Act 1993 as amended by theNational Lottery Act 1998.AThe need to ensure that money is distributed under section 25(1) forprojects which promote the public goodor charitable purposes and which arenot intended primarily for private gain. All of our application processes, as well as those of our delegates, require applicants forfunding to clearly demonstrate the expectedpublic benefit of their proposed activity.We give this careful consideration duringour assessment processes. BThe need to ensure that it considers applications which relate to the completerange of activities falling within section22(3)(a) and in respect of which it has powerto distribute money, taking into account: iits assessment of the needs of the arts and its priorities for the time being foraddressing them iithe need to ensure that all parts of England have access to funding iiithe scope for reducing economic and social deprivation at the same time ascreating benefits for the arts An important principle of Grants for the arts is to provide equality of access to fundingregardless of where an applicant lives andthe arts activity they want to do. We operateGrants for the arts through our regionaloffices and applicants apply to the regionthey are based in. This allows us to provideappropriate advice and support to applicantsusing regional knowledge.Policy Directions 108 Arts Council England annual review National Lottery report 2006Demand for our grants remains high and we use priorities to help us make choices aboutwhich applications to support. These prioritiesmake a significant contribution to this policydirection. We give priority to applicants whohave not received funding from us before,and activities that benefit areas of the countrywith social deprivation or with limited culturalopportunities. We also consider how theactivity contributes to arts development. Our capital funding plays a major role in addressing the infrastructural imbalancesbetween different regions through thecreation of new and enhanced facilities forthe arts. All capital projects are assessedagainst criteria of public benefit that coverboth urban regeneration and arts provision. In 2005/06, awards were made to the Creative Foundation, an artists' workspace projectin a derelict area of Folkestone; GreaterManchester (Cornerhouse), acultural landmark arts and cinema centre thatmakes a positive, visible contribution to thecontinuing renaissance of Manchester; andto the City of Wakefield towards the creationof the Hepworth Gallery for creative artswhich forms part of its \u00a3100 million mixed-use Waterfront Regeneration Scheme. Lottery funds delivered by Youth Music have now reached 98 per cent of English localauthorities. Under the Space for Sport andArts programme, 254 capital projects havebeen completed in primary schools in someof the most deprived areas of the country.CThe need to promote access to the arts for people from all sections of society. Championing cultural diversity, which was one of our six ambitions for the arts,continues to be central to all our activities.Through Grants for the arts, we placeimportance on broadening access andincreasing opportunities for diversity in thearts. We continue to target at least 10 percent of our Grants for the arts budget toapplicants from Black and minority ethniccommunities. We consider access in all its forms - physical, attitudinal and intellectual - to be paramountto every capital project that we fund. Anexample of this is First Movement, a disability-led organisation based in Derbyshire, whichwas awarded a grant in the year underreview to build a main artists' studio andalso a mobile studio that will deliver projectsthroughout the region. We also stipulated that each capital project specifically address issues of cultural diversityand made cultural diversity a priority underthe Arts Capital Programme and the Grantsfor the arts - capital programme. Grants fromboth these programmes have been awardedto the London-based Yaa Asantewaa project, a purpose-built, fully flexibleperformance and presentation space, cinema,social area and music centre providing a homefor the Ebony and Mangrove steel bandsand the Association of Black Calypsonians. Policy Directions continued Arts Council England annual review National Lottery report 2006 109DThe need to promote knowledge and appreciation of the arts by children andyoung people. We recognise the importance the positive influence arts have on the development ofchildren and young people. We promoteopportunities for young people and make thisa priority in our ambitions for the arts. Theprovision of arts-related activities and facilitiesfor young people are the primary purpose ofboth Youth Music and our collaboration inthe Space for Sport and Arts programme. Grants for the arts has funded a wide range of activities for young people including ST-ART,an arts organisation based in Barton uponHumber which will deliver a programme ofcreative workshops for young people acrossNorth Lincolnshire. The sessions, whichinclude circus skills, screen printing and film-making, will take place in village and churchhalls and community centres, providing workopportunities for artists living in rural areasand for young people to learn new skills. Under the Arts Capital Programme, we have made an award to the Stephen LawrenceCharitable Trust for their Creative Arts Labproject based in Lewisham, London. Thisaims to build on the widespread interest inthe performing arts among Black Caribbeanand African young people (aged 12 andolder) by introducing them to technicalroles in the creative and digital arts.EThe need to further the objectives of sustainable development. Arts Council England supports the government's definition of sustainabledevelopment and recognises ourresponsibilities in the three areas of social,economic and environmental sustainability. We and the other lottery distributors are developing a common approach and sharedguidance and information for fundedorganisations. This will be available to allorganisations undertaking new construction-related projects and will raise awareness ofsustainable issues by promoting alternativetechnologies and responsible energymanagement. We are also contributing to a new initiative to develop energy efficiency ratings forcultural buildings. This will ensure that thearts sector is able to meet forthcomingchanges in legislation, such as the EuropeanEnergy Performance of Buildings Directive. As part of the assessment and monitoring process for lottery-funded projects, we reviewthe organisation's environmental strategyto ensure the approach is appropriate andfurthers the sustainable agenda. We recognise that arts and cultural buildings can have high energy consumptions. We knowthey can encourage participation in raisingawareness around sustainable developmentfrom within the arts sector. To do this, wesupport sustainable development activities thatdemonstrate good practice for the arts sector. Policy Directions continued 110 Arts Council England annual review National Lottery report 2006FThe needs of projects relating to film and the moving image, and in particularthe need to foster the development ofsustainable structures in the film industryby, among other things, supporting thedevelopment, distribution and promotionof films, as well as their production. As in previous years, the Film Council continues to act as a delegate body for us,delivering a number of programmes aimed atimproving the distribution of film, in particularthe funding of digital projection equipment. The Government continues to review this policy direction with the intention of issuinga new direction that accurately recognisesour responsibilities since the establishmentof the UK Film Council. In the meantime,we continue to work according to an interimunderstanding with DCMS about ourresponsibilities in relation to film. GThe needs of projects relating to crafts. Grants for the arts continues to fund a wide range of activities relating to crafts. In 2005/06,we made 191 grants totalling \u00a34.2 millionfrom Grants for the arts - organisations and from our national activities budget to projects with a crafts element. Under Capital Programme One, we have contributed to the Leigh Park Craft Initiativein Hampshire. This project, comprising theconstruction of workshops, training roomsand office space, is one of the major elementsof a larger scheme to establish a centre ofexcellence for contemporary crafts and aCrafts Development Agency for the SouthEast region.Established in 1995 when it consisted of only a few artists' studios and a small exhibitionspace, Waygood Gallery and Studios is nowembarking on an ambitious capital project,part of the Grants for the arts - capitalportfolio. Waygood intend to redevelop andexpand a city centre, artist-led venue to create40 artists' studios, two gallery spaces anda learning centre, all of which will directlybenefit local artists specialising in crafts. HThe need for money distributed under section 25(1) to be distributed to projectsonly where they are for a specific time-limited purpose. All lottery awards made by us and our delegates in 2005/06 were for specificand time-limited purposes. IThe need: iin all cases, for applicants to demonstrate the financial viability of the project for theperiod of the grant iiwhere capital funding or setting up costs are sought, for a clear businessplan beyond the period of the grantincorporating provision for associatedrunning and maintenance costs iiiin other cases, for consideration to be given to likely availability of other fundingto meet any continuing costs for areasonable period after completion of theperiod of the lottery award, taking intoaccount the size and nature of the project,and for lottery funding to be used to assistprogress towards viability beyond theperiod of the grant wherever possible All eligible applications to our Grants for the arts programme are assessed for the activity'sPolicy Directions continued Arts Council England annual review National Lottery report 2006 111financial practicality, and its future impact on the applicant. Applicants for funding forcapital projects are asked to supply a robustbusiness plan including five-year income andexpenditure projections. These plans arecarefully assessed to see how realistic andachievable they are and are monitored overthe lifetime of the project. Youth Music has adopted a similar approach, requiring all applicants to demonstrate thatthey have a well-developed What Next plan. Recent research conducted among previouslyfunded organisations has shown that 93 percent of them continue to offer music-makingservices for children and young people beyondthe life of the project and that 94 per centcontinue to work in at least one of YouthMusic's five priority areas. JThe desirability of supporting the development of long-term financial andmanagerial viability of organisations in thearts. In taking this into account the ArtsCouncil shall have regard to Direction H. As with our stabilisation programmes, Grants for the arts provides funding for organisationsto develop their financial and managerialcapabilities. Funding has been used foraudience and market research which hasthe positive impact of increasing participationin the arts, and the benefit of improving therevenue generation of funded organisations. KThe need to require an element of partnership funding and/or contributionsin kind from other sources, commensuratewith the reasonable ability of differentkinds of applicants, or applicants inparticular areas to obtain such support.We want to make our lottery funding go further. We encourage applicants to makethe most of other sources of funding wherethey are available. The amount raised fromother sources is taken into account duringthe assessment of each proposal. For applications to our Grants for the arts programme, we normally require applicants tohave raised at least 10 per cent of the totalcosts of their activity. However, we recognisethat for some applicants or particular activitiesthis target is very difficult to achieve and incertain cases we will consider funding thetotal cost of a project. This flexible approachhas helped us to reach new applicants tothe programme and communities where theopportunities for other funding are limited. Under the Arts Capital Programme and Grants for the arts - capital, we did not specifya partnership-funding ratio for projects.However, in most circumstances we aim tobe the minority funder. A successful exampleof this is the Whitechapel Art Gallery in EastLondon. The project comprises the freeholdpurchase, restoration and conversion of aGrade II listed library adjacent to the existinggallery and our award of \u00a3500,000 representsonly five per cent of the overall project cost.Other partnership funding includes a majorcontribution from the Heritage Lottery Fund. A further example is Hull Truck Theatre Company; a purpose-designed Centrefor Time Based Arts situated in the city'semergent cultural quarter, with facilitiesfor flexible performance/exhibitions, mediaand live art production, education/training,research and start-up units. Our capital grantamounts to just over one quarter of the total Policy Directions continued 112 Arts Council England annual review National Lottery report 2006project cost and the organisation has secured significant awards from Hull City Council, theEuropean Regional Development Fund andYorkshire Forward. LThe desirability of working with other organisations, including other distributors,where this is an effective means ofdelivering elements of its strategy. Our role as the national development agency for the arts means we enjoy long-standingpartnerships with a wide range of agencies- government departments, regionaldevelopment agencies, local authorities,and other public and private bodies. We actively work in partnership with the other lottery distributors to review andimprove access to lottery funding. In thespring of 2006, the Lottery Funding websiteand helpline was publicly launched with theaim of providing information for individualsand organisations who have not applied forlottery funding before. In addition to the various formal relationships detailed elsewhere in this report, we frequentlywork with others on a project-by-project basisto ensure that all stakeholders contribute bothfinancially and by other means to a successfuloutcome. In particular, such collaborationshave been crucial to the success of many ofthe large scale capital projects that we funded. The extensive redevelopment of the Roundhouse in Camden has resulted inan all-new, large scale adaptable venue forlive performance and a training resourcefor young people in music, theatre, TV, filmand new media which opened in June 2006.The Arts Council's capital investment under the Arts Capital Programme represents only12 per cent of the total project cost. We haveworked alongside other lottery distributors(Heritage Lottery Fund, New OpportunitiesFund - now the Big Lottery Fund) andstakeholders (London Development Agency,London Borough of Camden, EnglishHeritage) to ensure its success. MThe need to ensure that its powers of solicitation under section 25(2A) areused in conjunction with the pursuitof strategic objectives. During 2005/06, we and our delegate bodies only used our powers to solicitapplications when pursuing objectivesset out in our corporate plan. NSuch information as it considers necessary to make decisions on each application,including expert independent advicewhen required. We continually review and evaluate our application packs and other materials to ensurethat we receive sufficient information to beable to make a careful and fully consideredassessment of each proposal for funding.Where a proposal involves particular complexor technical aspects, such as in majorconstruction or renovation projects, we seekthe advice of appropriate external experts. Monitoring and evaluation As reported in 2004/05, we have adopteda single set of principles to inform the levelof monitoring we carry out for each of ourfunding programmes. The level is based on ananalysis of risk that takes into consideration:Monitoring and evaluation Arts Council England annual review National Lottery report 2006 113 the amount of money involved the strategic importance of the activity any other risk factors We do not necessarily avoid risk; it is often a central aspect of the creative process.Our approach is to manage risk by carefullyassessing all applications we receive andtailoring our monitoring requirements ona project-by-project basis. Where the risksassociated with a project are considered tobe low, a 'light touch' approach is adoptedenabling us to concentrate our resources onmonitoring and supporting projects wherethe risks may be higher. We evaluate our funding programmes regularly to assess whether they are deliveringthe benefits that we expected for artists, artsorganisations and the wider public. We use thefindings of such evaluations to refine existingprogrammes and inform the developmentof future ones. Below, we describe how we approached this for each of our programmes. Awards for All Awards for All in England is a joint-distributorlottery scheme funded by Arts Council England,Big Lottery Fund, Heritage Lottery Fund andSport England. In 2005/06, it made 12,743 grants of between \u00a3500 and \u00a35,000 acrossEngland worth a total of \u00a352.6 million to small local groups, mainly in the voluntary and community sector. Awards for All is managed by a joint programme board with representationfrom the four participating distributors.The scheme is operated by Big Lottery Fundand assessment is undertaken by their staff. In 2005/06, these staff were located in nineregional offices but during 2006/07 thesefunctions will move to two operations centresin Newcastle and Birmingham. Monitoringand evaluation of the scheme at theoperational level remains the responsibility ofBig Lottery Fund, with the high level overviewbeing taken by the programme board. Following a major investigation by Big Lottery Fund during the year into suspectedmultiple application fraud in Awards for Alland other lottery programmes, assessmentand monitoring procedures were thoroughlyreviewed and more robust systems to guardagainst multi-application fraud wereimplemented. Capital During the period under review, we approved19 projects within the portfolios of CapitalProgramme One, the Arts Capital Programmeand Grants for the arts - capital. We workclosely with each organisation throughoutthe project - minimising risk by monitoring,evaluating and assessing each stage of theproposed work and helping them fulfil theirplans and deliver the intended benefits. We continue to monitor projects whose main awards had previously been approved toensure that they are completed on time, withinbudget and to the highest possible quality. The responsibility for the monitoring of capital projects in progress and those in a periodof post-completion has now been delegatedto our regional offices. The monitoringprocess uses a number of tools including: Monitoring and evaluation continued 114 Arts Council England annual review National Lottery report 2006 regular progress reports from the organisations independent expert project monitors - receiving updates on all areas of theproject and undertaking regular visits a robust system of scrutiny of payment claims careful monitoring of partnership funding and cash flow control a series of key stages and key stage reviews with a comprehensive frameworkof deliverables identified for the life ofthe project regular risk assessment analysis followed by consideration and implementationof risk management strategies regular expert reviews of the design progress of the project control of the grant through an allocation into parts with key stages having to besuccessfully completed before the nextpart is confirmed regular reviews of the forward revenue projections looking beyond completionof the capital project All organisations with a capital project in post-completion monitoring must completean annual return to ensure their continuedcompliance with conditions and to verifyownership of the assets. All projects receiving over \u00a3250,000 are subject to a one-off evaluation againstthe intended benefits of the projects tobe completed as soon as possible after aproject has been operational for 12 months.In addition, we undertake random reviewvisits to provide assurance on the continuedbenefits arising from the investment.Finally, we sometimes carry out ad hoc targeted evaluations of completed projects,for example: financial viability of projects in a particular region or artform increased accessibility effectiveness of box office installations Grants for the arts - organisations and Grants for the arts - national touring Grants for the arts for individuals andorganisations is our open applicationprogramme. Grants normally range from\u00a3200 up to \u00a3200,000 and can coveractivities lasting up to three years. 2005/06was the third full year of operation. Grantsfor individuals are not funded by the lottery. Demand for Grants for the arts remained high. During 2005/06, we considered 4,951applications and made 2,727 grants million. Theaverage grant to organisations was \u00a321,634which is 21 per cent higher than in 2004/05.The average success rate for grants toorganisations remained consistent fromlast year at 55 per cent. We considered 504 applications for national activities and made 327 grants totalling\u00a313.5 million. The average grant for nationalactivities was \u00a341,152 and the averagesuccess rate was 65 per cent. During 2005/06, 700 applications were considered from organisations that are Blackor minority ethnic-led requesting \u00a313 millionin funding. Of these, 300 were successful,receiving \u00a35.4 million in total.Monitoring and evaluation continued Arts Council England annual review National Lottery report 2006 115An appropriate level of monitoring for each project is determined during the assessmentstage of each application. Our assessorsconsider what likely risks a project may faceand if thought necessary, additional conditionsare attached to our offer of funding. Theseconditions require projects to demonstrateeither before or during their activities thatthey have taken appropriate steps to mitigatethe risks that we have identified. On completing their activity, all applicants who receive an award of \u00a31,000 or moreare required to complete a standard activityreport form. This report captures details ofwhat they have achieved and enables us tomonitor whether the lottery funds have beenused appropriately for the agreed activity.The information from these reports alsomakes a vital contribution to our evaluationsof the overall success of the programme. Applicants receiving less than \u00a31,000 do not complete a standard form but write to usdescribing what they have achieved. National Foundation for Youth Music (Youth Music) All projects funded by Youth Music arerequired to complete a monitoring reportevery time a payment is requested.Expenditure is closely monitored by thesubmission of certified invoice summariesand, in the case of substantial purchases,copies of the actual invoices. These reportsare used to track the progress of each projectand whether it is meeting the objectives setby Youth Music and the project itself. Inaddition, experienced people are appointedas independent monitors to visit projects.External evaluators are used to determine the effectiveness and quality of Youth Music'sfunding programmes. Summaries of theevaluations and, in some cases, the fullevaluation are at www.youthmusic.org.uk National Touring Programme The National Touring Programme (NTP) closedat the end of March 2003, having distributedover \u00a335 million across the main touring artforms of combined arts, dance, literature, music,theatre and visual arts to 497 projects. Some ofthese projects involved complex preparation andspan a number of years. Around 40 projectsare still active in 2006/07 but we anticipatethey will all be closed by August 2006. We are maintaining regular contact with the remaining live projects to ensure thatthey are successfully drawn to a close andfinal payments are released by August2006. Where grant recipients are unlikelyto deliver the original project, either in fullor in part, the grant is reduced accordingly.Relevant final report information is beingassessed and recorded as necessary to informfuture planning of touring distribution. Regional Arts Lottery Programme The last awards under the Regional Arts LotteryProgramme were made in the early monthsof 2003/04. Funding was available for activityspanning up to three years and at this stageonly a handful of the more complex projectsremain active. Monitoring of these projectsis continuing as described in previous lotteryreports. We anticipate that all projects willbe completed and closed by September 2006. Monitoring and evaluation continued 116 Arts Council England annual review National Lottery report 2006Space for Sport and Arts Sport England undertakes the monitoring of allawards made under the Space for Sport andArts programme on behalf of the Arts Council. The Space for Sport and Arts Lottery Programme is being nationally evaluated bythe Centre for Physical Education Researchat Canterbury Christ Church University.The evaluation has been designed to testthe scheme's effectiveness in meeting itsobjectives. It measures: the extent to which the new facilities have impacted on levels of provisionof sport and arts in schools levels of engagement in sport and arts by pupils children's personal development, including motivation and self-esteem the perceived impact on the local community The evaluation also examines the new facilities to ensure they have created environments inwhich pupils and the wider community feelsafe and comfortable participating in sportsand/or arts activities, and what the perceptionsof both pupils in the schools and those fromsurrounding schools are of the new facilities.The evaluation report is due for completionby summer 2006. Stabilisation and recovery By the end of 2005/06, 11 of the 20organisations admitted to the stabilisationprogramme had implemented theirstabilisation strategies and exited from theprogramme. The remaining nine continueto implement their stabilisation plans.By the end of 2005/06, 65 organisations had been admitted to the recovery programmeof which 31 had implemented their recoveryplans and exited from the programme. Ofthe remaining, one is currently developingits recovery plan and 33 are in the processof implementing their plans. We use the same approach to monitoring for both programmes: monitoring continues throughout the implementation of each organisation'splan including regular meetings betweenus, the organisation, and other stakeholders we review a wide range of evidence submitted by each organisation such asboard papers, financial and marketingplans, and other documents to assess howwell the implementation plan is progressing when an organisation is identified as being 'high risk', we adopt a more intensiveapproach, meeting with the organisationon a more frequent basis and reviewingthe implementation plan in more detail on completion of the implementation plan, each organisation is required toprepare and adopt a three-year businessplan. We regularly undertake follow upmeetings up to a year after an organisationhas left the programme During 2005/06, we received the evaluation of the two programmes based on a sampleof nine organisations from the stabilisationprogramme and 10 organisations from therecovery programme. The evaluation hasconfirmed that the objectives of the twoprogrammes are being achieved. Monitoring and evaluation continued Arts Council England annual review National Lottery report 2006 117Urban Cultural Programme The Millennium Commission has delegatedits responsibility for monitoring the awardsunder this programme to the four ArtsCouncils in England, Wales, Scotland andNorthern Ireland. All Urban CulturalProgramme awards in England are beingmonitored by Arts Council England. Due to the value of the grants issued under the Urban Cultural Programme, we haveput in place a detailed monitoring processinvolving the submission of a quarterly returnsetting out the activity that has taken placeand details of expenditure and partnershipincome. These are compared to the originalagreed programme to assess progress andidentify any issues that have arisen. At the end of the programme each recipient is required to submit final accounts and anactivity report form that includes a self-evaluation section. This information allowsus to confirm what activity took place andwho benefited. The findings will contributeto the overall evaluation of the programme. When all the activities funded under UrbanCultural Programme are concluded, we willevaluate them as a whole to assess howeach activity met its own objectives and theobjectives of the Urban Cultural Programme. Financial Directions Under the National Lottery etc Act 1993, theSecretary of State issued Financial Directionsto the Arts Council, as set out below. Weconfirm that, to the best of our knowledge,we complied fully with these in 2005/06.A copy of the Statement of FinancialRequirements is available from us.(I)The Arts Council of England ('the Body') shall comply with the requirementscontained within the Statement ofFinancial Requirements attached as anAnnex to these directions when carryingout its functions under Section 25 of theNational Lottery etc Act 1993 ('the Act') asamended by the National Lottery Act 1998('the 1998 Act'). Wherever specified in thatAnnex, the Arts Council of England mustobtain the consent of the Secretary ofState before carrying out certain activities. We confirm that, to the best of our knowledge, we complied fully with the financialrequirements in 2005/06. We revisited andupdated our previous reviews to ensure thatwe were complying with the requirements. (II)The Arts Council of England shall devise and abide by a procedure for handlingpotential conflicts of interest which mayarise in the evaluation of applications bythe Body or individual members of theBody. This procedure, together with astatement confirming the arrangementsthat have been applied, should be providedto the Secretary of State for Culture,Media and Sport ('the Secretary of State')before the distribution of any funds underSection 25 of the Act, and thereafter atthe beginning of each financial year. We have written procedures for dealing with conflicts of interest. Note 19 in the lotterydistribution accounts gives information onrelated parties in 2005/06.Financial Directions 118 Arts Council England annual review National Lottery report 2006Performance against targets for administrative efficiency In accordance with the Financial Directions issued by the Secretary of State, we operate a system of performance measures and targets foranalysing our administrative efficiency. For 2005/06 there were twosuch formal measures in operation, relating to the average processingtime for applications and the cost of processing applications. As noted in previous years, a number of recent programmes provide a relatively light-touch approach, with a simplified application procedureand a reduced processing time. The number of applications can beunpredictable and vary from year to year, but the costs of administrationand processing are not subject to the same fluctuations. For thesereasons, year-on-year comparisons have limitations and must beviewed with caution. Our lottery programmes are responsive to needsand changes in patterns of activity, and therefore our portfolio ofactivity has changed considerably in recent years. 2003/04 2004/05 2005/06 2005/06 Performance measure actual actual target actual cost of processing each application* \u00a33,625 \u00a33,108 \u00a33,250 \u00a33,222 Average time to process each application (work days) 44 39 39 38 For reference: number of applications processed 5,398 5,966 6,000 6,139 Lottery administration costs The Lottery Forum, which is made up of representatives from allof the lottery distributors, has agreed, in conjunction with DCMS,to publish annually the following information about the costs ofadministering the distribution of lottery funds. *Following our decision with other lottery distributors to publishadditional information about the costs of administering thedistribution of lottery funds, we have changed how we calculate theaverage cost of processing each application. For consistency, theperformance measure above is based on our actual administrationcosts excluding exceptional items and one-off IT development costs.Performance against targets for administrative efficiency Arts Council England annual review National Lottery report 2006 119Performance against strategic objectives 2005/06 was the last of the three years covered by our corporate plan 2003-6. This plan laid outour six strategic objectives - our ambitionsfor the arts. These ambitions have beencentral to all of our lottery-funded activities. Supporting the artist Ongoing support for the artist is vital for thearts to flourish. We have used lottery fundsin a variety of ways to do this. Our capitalprogrammes have provided funding for artists'workspaces. In 2005/06, awards were madeto The Creative Foundation, Waygood Gallery,and Lancaster City Council (Storey Gallery). Our capital programmes have also confirmed awards to organisations that promote trainingfor artists such as the Stephen LawrenceCharitable Trust, the Roundhouse and RichMix. Our continued support of disabledartists is illustrated by an award of \u00a3750,000to First Movement, whose disabled artists'workspace project will use live video/audiotechnology to link up disabled artists livingmany miles apart in combined arts projects. Grants for the arts - individuals is funded from our grant-in-aid, but all strands ofthe programme provide significant benefitto artists. During 2005/06, 32 per cent of all grants made were identified as makinga specific contribution to the delivery ofthis ambition. From all activity funded in2005/06, it is anticipated that over 320,000artists will benefit and over 332,000 daysof employment will be provided for artists. Within the last year, Youth Music launched a new scheme called MusicLeader to provideinformation, advice and guidance, andprofessional development opportunities tomusic leaders. In June 2005, Youth Musicpublished Singbook , a new resource for singing leaders consisting of 12 specially commissionedsongs, teaching guidance and a professionallyproduced CD. A website was also developedproviding other supporting information. Enabling organisations to thrive, not just survive Grants for the arts has funded a wide rangeof activities to enable organisations to buildupon their strengths so that they may thrive.Of all the awards made during the year, 14per cent were identified as making a specificcontribution to the delivery of this ambition. Our first Capital Programme highlighted the need to strengthen the skills of staff and boardsof organisations to help them meet the largePerformance against strategic objectives 120 Arts Council England annual review National Lottery report 2006Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 2001/02 2002/03 income 10.32% 13.24% 12.15% 10.96% 11.5% * Figures have been adjusted for inflation using 2001/02 as the base year **Excludes exceptional items and one-off IT development costsnumber of challenges posed by capital projects. As a result, projects included in the portfoliosof both the Arts Capital Programme and theGrants for the arts - capital automaticallyreceive funding specifically to build theorganisation's capacity to run the capitaldevelopment once it is complete. In addition,culturally diverse projects also receive up to\u00a3100,000 revenue grant as many of theseare younger, smaller organisations that oftenrequire 'bridging' finance until the capitalproject is up and running and their ongoingfinancial viability is secured. Championing cultural diversity Championing cultural diversity is central toall of our activities. We continue to monitorall applications for lottery funding to ensurethat we are reaching all sections of society.During 2005/06, Grants for the arts provided\u00a35.4 million to organisations which definedthemselves as Black and minority ethnic led,which represented 10 per cent of the entiregrant offers made under the programme. Diversity - encompassing cultural diversity and disability - was a priority for both theArts Capital Programme and Grants for thearts - capital. Awards made to diverse projectsduring 2005/06 include First Movement,Carnival Village, Mind the Gap and Art Asia. Offering opportunities for young people As stated in previous reports, this aim iscentral to the existence of Youth Music andthe purpose of the Space for Sport and Artsprogramme. Grants for the arts has also madea major contribution to offering opportunities for young people, making over 800 grants.Our capital programmes provide opportunities for young people as participants andspectators by funding specific organisationsthat have a role in developing lifelonglearning opportunities. Examples of suchorganisations, all of which were awardedgrants in 2005/2006, include the Roundhouse,the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust andthe Rich Mix Cultural Foundation in London,and FACT (Foundation for Art and CreativeTechnology) in Liverpool. Encouraging growth We promote growth through our programmesin a number of ways such as encouragingorganisations to develop relationships withother funders in order to attract additionalpartnership funding. If previously successful applicants apply to us to fund their activity again, we expect themto demonstrate how they have grown anddeveloped since we first gave them funding.Youth Music has adopted a similar approach,requiring all second time applicants todemonstrate that they have developedartistically by including new and additionalwork in their proposed programme of activity. Our own collaborative ventures with government departments, such as the Spacefor Sport and Arts with the Department forEducation and Skills, have helped leveradditional funds for the arts. Our work withthe other lottery distributors, such as theUrban Cultural Programme in collaborationwith the Millennium Commission, has reapedsimilar benefits. Performance against strategic objectives continued Arts Council England annual review National Lottery report 2006 121Living up to our values Our corporate plan lists five values that theArts Council and staff have chosen to sumup what is fundamental to Arts CouncilEngland. The values are creativity, diversity,trust, collaboration and quality. The open application process for Grants for the arts funding enables us to support thewidest range of creativity by artists andarts organisations from all backgrounds -celebrating the rich cultural diversity of England. Our risk-based approach to monitoring allows us to trust artists and arts organisations toget on with their jobs and only step in whenour help is needed. We continue to work in collaboration with the other lottery distributors to simplify andstreamline access to lottery funding andimprove public awareness of what the lotteryhas achieved. To improve quality, we regularly review our work to see what has succeeded and what wecould do better. These evaluations inform thedevelopment of new and existing programmesand bring improvements to the way we work.
