Mucosal immunity may provide robust 34 protection at the predominant sites of SARS -CoV -2 infection. However, it remains unclear 35 whether respiratory mucosal administration of DNA vaccines could confer protective immune 36 responses against SARS -CoV -2 challenge due to the insurmountable barriers posed by the 37 airway. Here , we applied self-assembled peptide- poloxamine nanoparticles with mucus - 38 penetrating properties for pulmonary inoculation of a COVID -19 DNA vaccine (pSpike/ PP- 39 sNp). Not only displays the pSpike/ PP-sNp superior gene -transfection and favorable 40 biocompatibility in the mouse airway, but pSpike/ PP-sNp promotes a tripartite immunity 41 consisting of systemic , cellular and mucosal immune responses that are characterized by 42 mucosal IgA secretion, high levels of neutralizing antibodies, and resident memory phenotype 43 T-cell responses in the lungs of mice. Most importantly, pSpike/ PP-sNp completely 44 eliminates SARS -CoV -2 infection in both upper and lower respiratory tracts and enables 45 100% survival rate of mice following lethal SARS -CoV -2 challenge. Our findings indicate 46 PP-sNp might be a promising platform in mediating DNA vaccines to elicit all -around 47 mucosal immunity against SARS -CoV -2. 48 49 Key words : mucosal vaccine, COVID -19, SARS -CoV -2, DNA vaccine, nanoparticle, 50 pulmonary delivery. 51 52 53 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

SARS -CoV -2, which invade s 59 the host through the muco sa of the respiratory tract , may seed in the initial reservoir and 60 continue to spread between individuals2. Recent studies have demonstrat ed that respiratory 61 mucosal vaccinated adenoviral vaccines could overcome the drawbacks of parenterally 62 administered counterpart via the stimulation of broad local immune responses in the airways 63 that in turn can block both infection and spread from this reservoir3-6. Secret ory 64 immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and pulmonary resident memory T cells (TRM) are suggested to be 65 key component s in this first -line of defense7-9. Compelling evidences have indicated that sIgA 66 in the respiratory mucosa contributed to SARS -CoV -2 neutralization to a greater extent t han 67 IgG equivalents10, 11, and lung-TRM cells are critical in mediating protectio n against 68 respiratory pathogens12. Since mucosal route of immunization is considered by the research 69 community as the most straightforward approach to induce potent mucosal immunity13, safe 70 and efficient delivery of vaccine to the respiratory mucosa would be needed in order to 71 reliably stimulate sIgA secretion and engender protective mucosal immunity against SARS - 72 CoV -214. 73 74 Despite the great potential of mucosal immunity, the major advances seen with parenterally 75 administered vaccines (such as adjuvanted subunit antigens, DNA and , more recently, RNA 76 vaccines) have not been translated into licensed mucosal vaccines . There continues to be a 77 dearth of safe and effective respiratory mucosal vaccine platforms despite decades of 78 investigations15. Up to date, t he only successful approach is virus -based mucosal va ccines. Of 79 the nine mucosal vaccines approved for use in humans ( one intranasal and eight oral) all are 80 either live attenuated or whole -cell inactivated vaccines16. The dichotomy in parenteral and 81 mucosal approaches is, in part, due to the existence of multiple barriers (e.g., the mucus layer 82 that traps exogenously inhaled substances) and natural defense mechanism (such as 83 mucociliary clearance ) keeping the foreign substances out13. Viruses have evolved to 84 proficiently overcome these barriers, this explains why the vast majority of investigations 85 achieving protection against SARS -CoV -2 using airway route of immunization exclusively 86 utilized virus -based vaccines, such as adenoviruses6, 17 -19. Nevertheless, these virus vaccines 87 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Therefore, it is 90 difficult to strike a delicate balance between immune efficacy and safety of these virus 91 vaccines . On the other hand, cutting -edge advances and research into the nucleic acid-based 92 vaccine technologies provide alternative options to solve the unmet needs for safe and 93 efficient non -viral based mucosal vaccines. 94 95 DNA vaccines, which proved to be helpful in controlling the pandemic21, would offer 96 substantial advantages over virus -based vaccines , including safe profiles22, 23, ease of 97 manufacture with low costs , and stability at room temperature21. Howeve r, DNA vaccines 98 generally display limited immunogenicity in the airways because the most commonly used 99 electroporation device is not applicable and consequently require potent del ivery system s to 100 overcome the barriers within the respiratory tract24. Traditional DNA delivery vectors , such as 101 cationic polymers and even lipid-based formulation s that were tested in clinical trials, have 102 turned out to be inefficient owing to the poor airway mucus penetrat ing properties25, 26. 103 Therefore , the pulmonary administration of conventional DNA nanoparticles is unlikely to 104 shuttle DNA cargos efficiently to initiate robust immune response s in the respiratory tract. As 105 revealed by a previous study, the intranasal COVID -19 DNA vaccination in mice only led to a 106 modest induction of local T -cells secreting IFN -, without sIgA and 107 circulating IgG against SARS -CoV -2 even after prime and two boost doses27. To the best of 108 our knowledge, whether a COVID -19 DNA vaccine delivered via the airway could confer 109 prote ctive efficacy against SARS -CoV -2 challenge was still unknown. 110 111 In a previous study, we developed a self-assembled p eptide-p oloxamine nanoparticle (PP- 112 sNp) delivery system that is specifically designed for efficient delivery of plasmid DNA 113 across the mucus layer of the respiratory tract28. PP -sNp carrying a Sleeping Beauty 114 transposon system successfully enabled the genomic integration of CFTR gene in the airway 115 epithelia of cystic fibrosis mice with a safe integration profile28. These results suggest that PP - 116 sNp would be promising in mediating DNA va ccines to stimulate potent mucosal immune 117 response s against SARS -CoV -2. To this end , we integrated an intercellular adhesion 118 molecule -1 (ICAM -1/CD54 , which is abundantly expressed on the epithelial and immune 119 cells29) targeting moiety into the PP-sNp with the purpose of enhancing the specific cellular 120 uptake of pulmonary dendritic cells and airway epithelial cells .

A DNA vaccine 123 encoding the wild -type spike protein of SARS -CoV -2 (pSpike, which has been tested in 124 clinical trials22) was formulated in PP-sNp (pSpike/ PP-sNp) for mucosal vaccine applications . 125 Three vaccine doses of pSpike/ PP-sNp via respiratory tract induced comprehensive and broad 126 protective immune response s, including mucosal immunity ( SARS -CoV-2 specific sIgA in 127 the airways as well as lung-TRM cells) and systemic immunity (neutralizing serum IgG). All 128 these merits conferred virtually full protection of vaccinated mice against lethal SARS -CoV -2 129 challenge and completely removed the virus in both the turbinat es and lungs of mice . Thus, 130 our study may serve as the first proof -of-concept revealing that respiratory mucosal 131 immunization of DNA vaccines holds the potential to elicit robust protective immunity 132 against SARS -CoV -2 infection in the upper and lower respi ratory tracts . 133 134 Results 135 The characterization and in vitro investigation of peptide-poloxamine 136 nanoparticle (PP-sNp) containing plasmid DNA 137 The PP-sNp formulation is formed by a simple self-assembly of multi-modular peptide 138 (Supplementary Table 1) , poloxamine 704 ( a block copolymer proven to be capable of 139 mediating efficient DNA transfection in the airways to a level that is significantly better than 140 \"gold -standard\" lipid -based GL67A formulation that utilized in clinical trials26, 32, 33) and 141 pDNA components (Fig. 1a). We engineered small and monodisperse nanoparticles 142 with negative charge ( potential: -34.7\u00b1 0.5 mV) via an optimized procedure in order to deal 143 with the small volumes and high concentrations required in vivo (Fig . 1b, Supplementary 144 Table 2). The electron microscopy showed that PP -sNp had a spherical morphology with (Fig . 1c and 1d). PP -sNp can be stored at room or high temperatures 146 and remain s stable ( Supplementary Fig. 1). We then evaluated the uptake efficiency of PP - 147 sNp in DC2.4 and MH -S cell lines, the results indicate a n enhanced cellular uptake of PP -sNp 148 containing Cy5 labelled pDNA (Cy5 -pDNA) by both cell lines compared to the 25 kDa 149 branched polyethyleneimine (PEI, a representative polymer based delivery vehicle in DNA 150 mucosal vaccines34-36)-based and naked Cy5-pDNA -based controls (Fig. 1e, Supplementary 151 Fig. 2). Confocal microscopy revealed that the majority of Cy5 -fluorescence was observed in 152 the nucleus of Cy5-pDNA/PP -sNp transfected DC2.4 cells with dispersed patterns , while the 153 Cy5-fluorescence signal within the nucleus of cells transfected by Cy5-pDNA/PEI and naked 154 Cy5-pDNA was very pDNA encoding firefly luciferase ( pFLuc ) 155 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

As shown in Fig. 1g and 156 Supplementary Fig. 3, PP -sNp displayed the most efficient transfection in several cell lines 157 (DC2.4, Calu -3, 16HBE and BEAS -2B) compared to control formulations, such as 158 lipofectamine2000 (lipo2000)- based lipoplex, PEI -based polyplex and naked -pFLuc . 159 Meanwhile, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of these formulations and found PP -sNp based 160 formulation did not provoke significant cytotoxicity on the viability of different cell lines, 161 whereas Lipo2000 -based and PEI -based counterparts did (Fig . 1h). Additionally, m ultiple 162 particle tracking (MPT) assays were performed to evaluate the mucus penetrating ability of 163 PP-sNp. The trajectories of the PP-sNp-based and PEI -based particle motion s were captured 164 (Supplementary Video 1 and 2), and representative trajectories were mapped in Fig. 1i . PEI 165 nanoparticles were almost trapped by the mucus network. In contrast, PP -sNp was able to 166 move freely in a large area, displaying a better diffusion pattern. The mean square 167 displacement ( MSD) of PP -sNp was about 1000 -fold higher than PEI counterpart at 10 s 168 (Fig. 1j ). Consistently , signi ficantly higher 169 than that of PEI ( Fig. 1 k).

Bioluminescence signals from live 201 animals and excise d organs reveal intratracheally administered PP-sNp exhibited superior 202 efficacy compared to pFLuc/ PEI or naked -pFLuc counterpart s, and the lung was the most 203 abundant fLuc -expressing site and no signals were detected in other organs ( e.g., heart, live, 204 spleen, kidneys and small intestinal) after the PP -sNp transfection (Fig . 2b). Based on these 205 results, we further evaluated the capability of PP -sNp in intratracheal delivery of a plasmid 206 encoding the full -length spike protein of SARS -CoV -2 (pSpike )22. Considerable levels of 207 spike gene -specific mRNA were detected in the lungs of mice transfected by pSpike/ PP-sNp 208 compared to pSpike/PEI or naked -pSpike counterparts ( Fig. 2c). Histopathological analysis 209 demonstrated that the lungs and other major organs (including heart, liver, spleen and kidney) 210 from pSpike/PP -sNp treated mice were indistinguishable from naked -pSpike and phosphate - 211 buffered saline (PBS) controls , without significant histopathological signs of inflammation 212 (Supplementary Fig. 5).

PEI-based formulation was excluded in the following studies due to its poor 218 transfection efficiency and toxic profiles. Although there was a lack of overt lung 219 inflamm ation observed with histology, pSpike/PP -sNp may rapidly and robustly, but only 220 transiently, activate innate immunity. As shown in Fig . 2d, tumor necrosis factor - (TNF -) 221 and interleukin -6 (IL -6) expression within bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and 222 supernatants of lung homogenates peaked during 1 -2 days after administration then 223 immediately resolved to background levels. However, no significant increase of cytokines 224 was found in the spleen -based and serum -based counterparts (Supplementary Fig. 6). 225 226 Mature DCs are powerful antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and play key roles in initiating 227 antigen -specific immune responses. We therefore evaluated whether the pulmonary DCs 228 (CD11c+CD11b+) can efficiently uptake the pSpike/PP -sNp. Comparative analysis showed 229 that 6.15\u00b1 0.65% of pulmonary DCs internalized Cy5 -pSpike/PP 230 fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 232.0\u00b1 20.60, which was significantly higher than naked Cy5 - 231 pSpike counterpart with a 1.23\u00b1 0.64% uptake rate (MFI: 62.5\u00b1 1 9.90) (Fig . 2e, Supplementary 232 Fig. 7). Meanwhile , we confirmed a deep penetration and widespread distribution of the 233 intratracheally administered Cy5-pSpike/PP -sNp in the 234 (Fig. 2f) . On the contrary, identically admin 235 PP -sNp. 236 Immunofluorescence sections of airway region suggest that considerable pSpike expression 237 mediated by PP -sNp could be clearly observed in pulmonary DCs and airway epithelial cells 238 (AECs) with a widespread distribution pattern, while the spike protein signal within naked - 239 pSpike treated group was very limited and neither co -localize with pulmonary DCs nor AECs 240 (Fig. 2g). To our surprise, we could not detect transgene expression mediated by pSpike/PP - 241 sNp in alveolar macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 8) , which are represent ative airway APCs 242 being supposed to engulf most of the exogenous antigens38. We further examined the ability 243 of pSpike/PP -sNp in promoting DC maturation. Compared to naked -pSpike, pSpike/PP -sNp 244 could induce two -fold expressions of CD11c+CD86+ on bone marrow derived cells ( BMDCs) 245 (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 9). The expressions of CD86+MHC -II+ on CD11c+ cells were 246 significantl y elevated by more than 300% in pSpike/PP -sNp treated group compared to 247 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

We observed the body weight of 276 mice treated by pSpike/ PP-sNp and naked -pSpike transiently decreased during 2 -3 days post 277 the prime and 1st boost dosing, which progressively recovered to the levels displayed by other 278 control groups ( Fig. 3b). We also confir med the necessity of the 2nd boost dose by detection of 279 IgG in serum and sIgA in BALF at pre -determined time points (Supplementary Fig. 10). 280 Intratracheal immunization of pSpike/ PP-sNp, but neither pVax /PP-sNp, naked -pSpike nor 281 PBS controls, induced high levels of spike-specific IgG antibodies in serum samples ( Fig. serum from pSpike/ PP-sNp group reached 1/51200 on day 35 283 (Fig. 3d).

Most importantly, only 285 pSpike/ PP-sNp induced high levels of spike -specific sIgA antibody in BALF with most 286 samples could reach an endpoint titer of 1/128 (Fig. 3e and Fig . 3f). Furthermore, distal 287 mucosal immune responses were also induced by pSpike/ PP-sNp as it proved by the presence 288 of SARS -CoV -2-specific sIgA antibody in vaginal lavage fluid ( Supplementary Fig. 12).

We also failed to detect sign ificant secretion of IFN - or 327 IL-4 in splenic CD8+ T and CD4+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. 16-17). These data reveal a 328 comprehensive SARS -CoV -2-specific Th1 and cytotoxic T cells activation in the lung of 329 pSpike/PP -sNp-treated mice. To determine whether memory T cell responses within 330 pulmonary mucosal site s were elicited by pSpike/PP -sNp, the effector memory T (T EM) cells 331 or central memory T (T CM) cells, identified as CD44hiCD62Llo and CD44hiCD62Lhi, were 332 detected by flow cytometry. We found both CD4+ TEM and CD8+ TEM cells in lung, but not 333 splenic T EM cells or T CM cells, were significantly activated via the immunization of 334 pSpike/PP -sNp ( Fig. 4f and 4g, Supplementary Fig. 18-19). Recent studies have suggested 335 that tissue- resident memory T (T RM) cells play crucial role s in maintaining long -term 336 protective immunity against mucosal pathogens39, 40. We investigated the expression of the 337 tissue -retention markers CD69 and CD103 on total CD4+ or CD8+ T cells isolated from the 338 lung.

To this end, a SARS -CoV - 364 2 C57MA14 strain (which causes severe re spiratory symptoms and mortality in mice) was 365 applied in the challenge study . The pSpike/PP -sNp vaccine demonstrated remarkable 366 protective efficacy as evidenced by an 100% survival rate at the predetermined end (14 days 367 post-challenge), while all mice from control groups were deceased during 4-7 days after 368 challenge (Fig. 5a). The body weights of pSpike/PP -sNp vaccinated mice decreased slightly 369 (<10%) in the first 3 days post-challenge but gradually recovered to a level displayed by the 370 control group (with out challenge). In contrast, pVax /PP-sNp and PBS groups led to a 371 dramatic decrease in body weight until 6 days after challenge when all animals died ( Fig. 5b). 372 Some mice were randomly euthanized to analysis the viral RNA loads in the airways 3 days 373 post-challenge. Significant lower levels of viral RNA were detected in the turbinates ( Fig. 5c 374 and 5 e) and the lungs ( Fig. 5d and 5f) of pSpike/PP -sNp vaccinated mice compared to control 375 counterparts. Moreover, the viral RNA loads in turbinates and lungs of pSpik e/PP-sNp treated 376 mice decreased with time and were almost undetectable 14 days post -challenge (Fig . 5g and 377 5h), indicating pSpike/PP -sNp not only prevents virus infection but eventually eliminates the 378 virus in respiratory tract completely. Additionally, lu ng sections were subjected to an 379 immunohistochemistry assay aiming to explore the replication of SARS -CoV -2 by detecting 380 its SARS -CoV -2 N protein expression in the lung 3 days post -challenge .

However, apart from extensive investigations using adenovirus -based 420 vaccines17, 18, 41, whether DNA vaccines could achieve this goal remains unclear. In this study, 421 we demonstrate a COVID -19 DNA vaccine ( pSpike/PP -sNp) delivered via pulmonary route 422 could induce a robust protective immunity consisting of mucosal, humoral and cellular 423 immune responses , which is sufficient to completely protect the upper and lower respiratory 424 tracts against lethal SARS -CoV -2 challenge in mice. Early studies suggested that DNA 425 vaccines are poorly immunogenic in the airways with low levels of antigen expression owing 426 to the barriers posed by the respiratory tract. This could be reflected by the previous study 427 indicating intranasal COVID -19 DNA vacci nation were not able to elicit mucosal sIgA and 428 circulating IgG against SARS -CoV -2 even after three times of repeated dosing27. Similar 429 observations have been reported in another study showing that the serum neutralization IC 50 430 of a COVID -19 DNA vaccine just reached 1 /83.8 against SARS -CoV -2 pseudoviruses after 431 seven -times repeated intranasal vaccination s42. Although the previous studies reveal the 432 intranasal administered DNA vaccines could trigger a certain degree of SARS -CoV -2 specific 433 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

PEI was adopted as a control 444 formulation because it is one of the most well -studied polymer -based gene carrier and has 445 been applied in many mucosal DNA vaccine applications43. Although PEI appears to be 446 promising in delivery of mucosal DNA vaccines encoding antigens of Influenza, HIV and 447 SARS -CoV43, we found it fails to mediate efficient DNA transfection in the mouse airway, 448 perhaps owing to its poor mucus penetrating properties. We applied a n improved method of 449 preparing nanoparticles without aggregation to enhance the utility of PP -sNp for in vivo 450 applications44. The optimized nanocomplexes appeared as evenly distributed spherical 451 nanoparticles with sizes being smaller than mucu s mesh pores (~140\u00b1 50 nm)45. The unique 452 high mobility in mucus gel facilitates deep penetration and widely spread of PP -sNp through 453 the airway mucus layer (Fig. 6a) , thereby improving the probability of DNA payloads 454 encounter and uptake by target cells. Subsequently, the targeting moiety within PP -sNp 455 (which binds the ICAM -1/CD54 ) provides the possibility to specifically deliver the DNA 456 cargos via receptor -mediated uptake , concurrent with efficient endosome escape and nucleus 457 localization i n these cells28. By virtue of these merits, PP -sNp efficiently mediates the 458 transfection of pulmonary DCs and AECs 6b) the 459 most powerful APCs , pulmonary DCs are imperative in shaping antigen -specific immune 460 responses46. The enhanced DNA vaccine uptake by pulmonary DCs and subsequent DC 461 differentiation may lead to more profound and durable antigen presentation to T -cells47. Our 462 finding is also in agreement with previous evidences demonstrating a positive correlation 463 between the ratio of antigen -activated DCs and t he magnitude of TEM-biased response48. 464 Meanwhile, AECs appear to be essential for determining the potency of mucosal immune 465 response and IgA production . Several studies have suggested that AECs provides a constant 466 supply of cytokines (such as IL -6) which are essential for B cell proliferation, IgA isotype 467 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The close proximity of AECs 468 to DCs and B cells situated in respiratory mucosa probably ensures efficient antigen cross - 469 presentation which directs B cells isot ype switch towards IgA 1 and IgA 2 with the help of 470 cytokines produced by AECs50. AECs also hold critical roles in orchestrating innate and 471 adaptive immune responses in the respira tory system during viral infection51, 52. As an RNA 472 sequencing analysis reveals, pSpike/PP -sNp successfully activated innate and adaptive anti - 473 virus pathways in vaccinated mice ( Supplementary Fig. 22, more details are reported in the 474 Supplementary Results) , which is in consistent with previous findings suggesting the 475 transiently activated innate immunity is sufficient to augment subsequent adapted immune 476 responses53. 477 478 The complete protection against lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge was largely due to the ability 479 of pSpike/PP -sNp in stimulating comprehensive mucosal, humoral and cellula r immunity, 480 characterized by robust secretion of sIgA and NAb as well as potent T cell responses 481 (especially TRM cells) in the respiratory system. pSpike/PP -sNp efficiently activated systemic 482 immune response, concurrent with significant levels ( ND 50 at ~1/1875) of NAb in serum . 483 Previous findings suggest a serum NAb titer >300 was generally associated with protection 484 against SARS -CoV -254. It is worth noting that pSpike/PP -sNp vaccinated mice displayed B 485 cells secreting IgA and high levels of SARS -CoV -2-specific sIgA antibody titer (with a mean /102.4 ) in the BALF samples (Fig. 6c) , which are even higher than those 487 induced by intranasal vaccination of adjuvanted subunit vaccines according to previous 488 publications55-57. Although the SARS -CoV -2-specific sIgA antibody titer in BALF of 489 intranasally vaccinated mice using adenovirus -vector is insurmountable when co mpared to 490 non-viral vaccine induced counterpart, substantial NAb titers could be detected in BALF 491 samples of pSpike/PP -sNp vaccinated mice with a level (~1/73) that is comparable to the 492 adenovirus- based counterpart (~1/100)19. 493 494 Additionally, it has been long recognized that high-quality antigen-specific T cell responses 495 are pivotal in combating various types of coronavirus infection9. pSpike/PP -sNp successfully 496 mediated the presence of SARS -CoV -2 specific CD8+IFN- T cells (cytotoxic T cells) and 497 elicited a Th1 -biased cellular immune responses (Fig. 6d) , both of which would be 498 advantageous in eliminating coronavirus without adverse effects, since Th2 cell responses are 499 suggested to be associated with enhancement of lung disease s58. pSpike/ PP-sNp also 500 generated a robust memory -based cellular immunity in the airways, including the significantly 501 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

T EM-biased 502 response created by pSpike/PP -sNp, which could immediately act on and rapidly removes 503 respiratory pathogens, is particularly pronounced in the lung. But we failed to observe 504 increased ratio of TCM cells, which is in line with previous findings indicat ing that TCM-biased 505 response generally induced by conventional route of vaccination (e.g., electroporation)59. 506 Accumulating evidence s demonstrate that pulmonary CD4+TRM and CD8+TRM cells play 507 crucial roles in resisting respiratory pathogen infections , including MERS -CoV , SARS -CoV 508 and SARS -CoV -23, 60. The airway TRM cells, which are exclusively generated t hrough the 509 respiratory route vaccination/infection , reside in the lung and does not recirculate61, so that 510 they c an instantly recognize invading pathogens in the airway and efficiently prevent virus 511 replication at the early stage of infection/re -infection. 512 513 514 Figure 6 | Schematic of the SARS-CoV-2 specific immune responses and subsequent protection 515 established by pSpike/PP -sNp vaccine inoculated via respiratory route. a) After pulmonary inoculation, 516 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The SARS -CoV -2 derived antigens expressed in AECs are 521 subsequently presented to other immune cells such as pulmonary DCs. AECs simultaneously orchestrate 522 the adaptive immune responses via the transient secretion of cytokines. Mature pulmonary DCs then 523 migrate to the bronchial -associated lymphoid tissues (e.g., mediastina l lymph node ) and present antigens to 524 na\u00ef ve T cells and B cells for humoral and cell ular immune responses. c) Activated B cells proliferate and 525 differentiate i nto antibody -secreting plasma cells to generate secretory IgA (sIgA) and systemic IgG 526 antibodies, the former of which efficiently neutralizes invading SARS -CoV -2 within the upper and lower 527 respiratory tracts . d) Meanwhile, a portion of T cells obtains a tissue resident memory phenotype (TRM), 528 enabling them to reside in the airway and respond rapidly when encountering SARS -CoV -2 virus. Other 529 activated CD 4+ or CD8+ T cells, including CD44hiCD62Llo T cells, CD4+IFN- T cells and CD8+IFN- T 530 cells, take part in the process of eliminating SARS -CoV -2 infect ions as well . The robust and 531 comprehensive immunity conferred by pulmonary vaccination of pSpike/PP -sNp probably controls SARS - 532 CoV -2 replication and removes the viruses at the initial sites of infection, thus protects the vaccinated mice 533 from lung lesions and death. 534 535 Despite the promising results we observ ed in the current study, pSpike/PP-sNp is still far 536 from successful clinical trans lation and more in-depth investigations are necessary. There are 537 several limitations that we did not address in this study and will be useful topics for future 538 studies, including the absence of data on the neutralization and protection efficiency elicited 539 by pSpike/PP -sNp against emerging SARS -CoV -2 variants of concern. Similar to those cases 540 of authorized COVID -19 vaccines62, the neutralizing activity of NAb induced by the 541 pSpike/PP -sNp vaccine may suffer a significant decrease within several months/years after 542 vaccination , more boost doses may be necessary . Besides, immunization and challenge 543 studies wi th larger animals such as non -human primates should be carried out to confirm the 544 extent of protective mucosal immunity conferred by pSpike/PP -sNp. Another limitation 545 relates to the intratracheal dosing which is not appropriate to be applied in humans when 546 considering its poor compliance. Most of the relevant studies chose the intranasal inoculation 547 because of its noninvasive and convenient features , but there are still huge concerns and 548 uncertainties regarding intranasal route of vaccination. For example, negative perception for 549 nasal vaccines was generated from reported cases of Bell's palsy after intranasal dosing of 550 influenza vaccines63, 64. Alternatively, the noninvasive nebulized formulations seem to be one 551 of the most appropriate approaches in delivering mucosal vaccines to the human airway . 552 However , the nebulized DNA formulations still face many challenges as indicated by a 553 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Finally, the 556 mechanism and pathways that involved in the pSpike/PP -sNp induced immune responses will 557 be explored in details with the help of cutting -edge technologies such as the single -cell RNA 558 sequencing in order to further improve the vector/platform design and our understanding of 559 DNA- based mucosal vaccines. 560 561 In summary, our dataset reveals that pSpike/PP-sNp with pulmonary mucus penetrating 562 properties was capable of inducing comprehensive mucosal, humoral and cellular immune 563 responses to provide complete protection against SARS -CoV -2 infection. The safe profile and 564 ability to potentiate DNA vaccines fo r strong mucosal immunity make PP-sNp a promising 565 platform for COVID -19 mucosal vaccines if its efficacy can be shown in large animal models 566 and clinical trials , since robust protection at the respiratory mucosal site would be, at least 567 theoretically, one of the most effective means to prevent the infection of SARS -CoV -2. 568 569 References 570 1.

PBS was added to wash the 936 cells twice, then centrifuged at 1500 \u00d7 g for 5 min, the cell pellets were eventually re - 937 suspended in RPMI1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. 938 939 For flow cytometric study, cells were first stained with the LIVE/DEAD fixable cell stains kit 940 (65-0865- 14, Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For surface markers, 941 the cells were incubated with anti -mouse staining, cells were stimulated with the 943 overlapping peptide pool spanning of 14 -mer peptides overlapping by nine amino acids from 944 the SARS -CoV -2 RBD proteins (see Supplementary Notes ) for 6 h at 37 \u00b0 C, 5% CO 2. Then 945 the cells were incubated with anti -mouse IL -4 (17 Cytofix/Cytoperm 947 Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (554714 , BD Biosciences,) according to the manufacturer's 948 instructions. In order to detect the T EM/TCM and T RM cells, the cell samples were stained with 949 the following indicated antibodies in FACS buffer: anti-CD62L All the samples were measured on a BD FACS Array flow cytometer (BD 952 Biosciences). Data are analyzed with FlowJo software V10. 953 954 Enzyme linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay. Cellular immune responses in mice were 955 performed using mouse IFN -/IL-4 ELISPOT PLUS plates plates were pre -treated as the manufacturer's 957 instructions. 5 \u00d7 105 mouse splenocytes or pulmonary lymphocytes were plated into each well 958 and stimulated with the above -mentioned peptide pools at a final concentration of 1 g of 959 each peptide per well. Additionally, PMA/Ionomycin were added as a positive control and 960 RPMI 1640 media was used as a negative control. After incubation at 37 , 5% CO 2 for 24 h, 961 the plates were washed with PBS and incubation with biotinylated anti -mouse IFN - or IL -4 962 antibody for 2 h at RT. Finally, TMB substrate solution were added to visualize the spots. 963 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Spot-forming 964 unit (SFU) per million cells was calculated by subtracting the negative control wells. 965 966 Statistics and analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using the Graph Pad Prism 8 967 (GraphPad Software, USA). Unless otherwise specified, data were expressed as mean \u00b1 968 Standard Error of Mean (SEM). Dual comparisons were made using Welch's t -test, and 969 comparisons between multiple conditions were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) 970 followed by the appropriate post -hoc tests. All the tests were two tailed. Differences were 971 considered statistically significant when P < 0.05. All of the experiments were successfully 972 repeated at least twice with three or more biological replicates to ensure the reproducibility of 973 the data. 974 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.
