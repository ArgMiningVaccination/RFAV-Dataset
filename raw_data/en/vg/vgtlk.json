Speaking as someone who has ADD, I resemble that remark. Several years ago, I visited a small village in El Salvador. On the first day there I attended a meeting of the village council. At one point, I found myself staring out the window at a rooster. It was then that I remembered that the shirt I was wearing had this:Dogs can't get autism because they all already have ADHD.... Squirrel! I say let the dog decide. They are clearly smarter than 37% of their owners.In other words, 37% of people who own dogs shouldn't. This happens to me almost every single day on this site...I had to check the date to make sure it wasn't 4/1 and the masthead to make sure I wasn't reading The Onion. Or convince them that 7 goes into 28 13 times.I need to find these people and ask them if they have two tens for a five until I can retire. \"The stupidest timeline so far.\"Yet more proof that we do, indeed, live in the STUPIDEST timeline. There is a common trope that dog behavior reflects that of their owners.I'd be more worried about their humans biting me. The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good People MenDo Nothing Oh man, hopefully that gets taken down. I know Facebook was shouldering a lot of the blame when it came to overall disinformation\\misinformation but YouTube was, and still is, a major supplier of garbage rhetoric. I wouldn't be surprised if those sort of videos became more prevalent and focused on \"dog autism\" for the first 10 minutes then took a sharp turn to focus on human vaccinations for the next 20.Wait until they try to board the dog, or take it into an emergency shelter during a natural disaster. Or even to a new veterinarian or groomer. I just came upon a YouTube with an alleged veterinarian who was not exactly preaching against them. He just had his dog on the video, and added, \"I don't give him vaccinations any more.\" Same with heart-worm preventative. I tried to report the channel under \"disinformation\". Yea but, like Socrates said, you can't fix stupid.Lack of quality education. Provide quality education. Well, umm, they did.CVH? Why not just spell out the phrase. Emphasis mine.That concern was supported by the new study, which found that the dog owners who espoused \"canine vaccine hesitancy,\" or CVH, were more likely to embrace misinformation and falsehoods linked to human vaccines. Imagine thinking dogs can't suffer from mental disorders/dysfunction. She's probably just not into it. It took us a long time to get our dog to play fetch.I'm a little sad. I have a dog where you throw a stick, she chases it, then looks at it and waits for you to come over to pick it up and throw it again. My cat, on the other hand, will chase a hair tie and then bring it back to you so he can chase it again. We live in a contorted world. Keyword: \"tort.\" There was a lot of gold to be mined in suing vaccine companies for screwball theories about vaccines and autism. And, for whatever reason, the media loves a good story about corporate greed from the biopharmaceuticals industry. They do not report on tort lawyer greed. I guess that doesn't fit the narrative.How does misinformation like this persist? How does society correct it? Yeah, it'd be really cool to have American Mages! They could meet up and wear wizard robes together and have themselves a Grand Wizard and ...Never underestimate the stupidity or gullibility of the human animal, especially the species americanus magus. What makes you think people knew how toasters or combustion engines worked?As technology accelerates, people are just going to make up irrational reasons why things they don't understand work or don't work. Yes! What she really wants is to play fight. Come and take my toy, I dare you and then proceeds to play tug of war.Gives us the full stink eye if we go to grab it to throw again. To an extent you can't only ignore trolling, but at the same time it's not useful to argue, so I figured a quote implying vigilance and action are necessary to stop people like him (and that he is also evil adjacent)Why did you reply to obvious trolling? Unless you think Ars is a right wing site as the poster stated? How does misinformation like this persist? How does society correct it? Ugh, I hope they at least find closure after the first 'reading' and that the \"medium\" doesn't lead them on for weeks\\months\\years.Double big sigh. I guess it goes along with pet channelers or mediums. Someone on Nextdoor near me went on for months about trying to find her small terrier. Should could not accept that a coyote or hawk had gotten it. Which is a not infrequent things for small pets let out without anyone nearby in this area. So the last few posts she had hired a pet medium to channel where her pet might be. Double sigh again. Man I hate this argument. The reason we talk about things and give them labels is because labels are USEFUL. \"Let people be people\" is exactly what the whole neurotypical/neurodivergent terminology is all about. It points out that our huge piles of societal norms don't work for much of the populace and here is WHY. It's about pointing out that you can't \"let people be people\" without effort because people by their very nature are going to INTERACT and those interactions have consequences that need to be understood through more than the societal norms lens.This is tangental, but as someone with a aspergers diagnose (which is the actual diagnose I have), I really detest all this talk about neurotypicals and neurodivergence, at least how people talk about it. It usually ends up being yet another thing that becomes Us vs Them (\"what neurotypicals don't understand...\"). Let people be people, let them be individuals. The same goes for dogs. They're dogs. We don't have to put a label on every single thing and make A Thing out of it. But I guess it's the human conditon that makes us inclined to define every little thing until that thing is so well defined it's static. So what! My cat's dyslexic. And she's had her rabies shot. Coincidence????? I don't think so! /sI dont even....no, just no. This is too stupid for words..dog autism. Is there a large overlap with Trump supporters by any chance because that could explain a lot, Unfortunately you can replace \"Americans\" with so many other cultures these days.Given how many Americans don't give a fuck about the health and safety of other Americans, I'm rather surprised they were shocked that so many of the same Americans also don't give a fuck about the health and safety of their pets. Define \"on the spectrum.\" Are these dogs who avoid eye contact? Are bad with people? Lack social skills.I had to look it up and it's evidently a thing. In other words dogs can be neurotypical and dogs not in the range of normal can be considered autistic along a spectrum. Never ascribe to autism that which can be explained by malevolence. *Cat Autism on the other hand... is also not caused by Vaccines. One of my cats is antisocial, picks fights, runs around for no reason and is an extremely picky eater.So what! My cat's dyslexic. And she's had her rabies shot. Coincidence????? I don't think so! /s Americanus Crassus seems more descriptive.Never underestimate the stupidity or gullibility of the human animal, especially the species americanus magus. More like all cats have autism and the ones with broken brains are the nice ones.Autism is a disorder that causes problems with social interaction, communication and repetitive actions. Cats can't get autism. That's just a normal cat. He was pretty useful then he in the 90s he got spasmodic dysphonia and believed he treated it with alternative methods. His descent into Woo began then.I saw the most amazing information placard today that heartily thanked RFK Jr. specifically for his advocacy work which helped restore the Petitcodiac River, 20ish years ago. So I guess the asshole "}
