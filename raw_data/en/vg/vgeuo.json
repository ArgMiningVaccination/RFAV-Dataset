Introduction Urticaria is a skin condition characterised by recurrent transient raised pruritic lesions (wheals), which last for between one hour and several days, and resolve without disruption of the epidermis. Angioedema is localised subcutaneous swelling, and often coexists with urticaria but can also occur independently. Urticaria may be acute, with lesions recurring over a period of hours, day s or weeks, or chronic, lasting for more than 6 weeks. There have been recent advances in research and availability of new medications to treat chronic urticaria. Definitions Urticaria is defined by pruritic wheals, caused by mast cell degranulation in the superficial dermis. Angioedema is swelling arising in deeper dermal layers, triggered either by mast cell -derived histamine or by bradykinin. The diagnosis of urticaria and angioedema is made based on clinical features . For consistency , we refer to the EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO Guideline for the Definition, Classification, Diagnosis, and Manage ment of Urticaria: The 2017 Revision and U pdate (Zuberbier et al., 2018 ). Urticaria is characterized by: 1. wheals of variable size, surrounded by erythema. 2. pruritus of variable severity, or sometimes a burning sensation. 3. a transient nature with the skin returning to normal, usually within 30 minutes to 24 hours. Angioedema is characterised by: 1. a sudden, pronou nced swelling of the deeper dermis or mucus membranes. 2. painful or uncomfortable, rather than pruritic. 3. resolution slower than for urticaria, may take up to 72 hours. Acute urticaria is urticaria (recurrent wheals) lasting for a period of less than 6 weeks . Acute urticaria may be caused by allergy, in which case it usually lasts for 24 -48 hours or less. Urticaria lasting for days or weeks can be caused by infection. However , in many cases no cause can be found. Discussion of acute urticaria is beyond the sc ope of this document. Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) (known autoimmune + unknown) refers to wheals arising spontaneously on most days of the week for six weeks or more. The term \"spontaneous\" is used to distinguish CSU from the inducible (physical) u rticarias, where lesions are induced by physical stimuli such as scratching or friction (dermographism), cold (cold urticaria), sunlight (solar urticaria), increased body heat (cholinergic urticaria), pressure (delayed pressure urticaria) or vibration. The se forms of urticaria are not considered further, although it should be noted that inducible urticaria can coexist with CSU. Often the management for both will overlap and the coexistence of inducible urticaria with CSU should not exclude the patient from usual CSU therapies. The term \"chronic idiopathic urticaria\" is no longer used because the current understanding is that many cases of CSU have an autoimmune basis, although this cannot be determined routinely in individual cases. Other conditions may mimic CSU but are distinct and represent different pathophysiological entities. Urticarial vasculitis differs from CSU in that lesions tend to last longer than 24 hours, are painful rather than pruritic and often bruise. The pathology shows leucocytoclastic vasculitis. This type of urticaria is more likely to be associated with systemic autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE ) pruritic urticarial plaques caused by superficial dermal inflammation that persist s for weeks and settle s with scale. It is usually idiopathic (Banan, Butler & Wu, 2014 ). Urticaria (either ASCIA INFORMATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 4 spontaneous or cold -induced) may occur in the context of rare autoinflammatory/periodic fever syndromes. Urticaria pigmentosa is a form of cutaneous mastocytosis that manifests as fixed pigmented lesions that may urticate with friction (Darier's sign) but it has a different appearance to CSU. Epidemiology and natural history In adults, CSU is a common condition with a life time prevalence rate of around 1.8% of the general population, (Zuberbier, Balke, Worm, Edenharter, & Maurer, 2010 ) and a point prevalence rate in adults of 0.1 -0.8% . It affects females more often than males (female s 68-80% of cases ). (Broder, Raimundo, Antonova, & Chang, 2015 Gaig ., 2004; Zuberbier et al ., 2010 ). In children, the life time prevalence of urticaria has been reported at 22.5% ( Bruske et al ., 2013 ; Shin & Lee, 2017). Acute urticaria occurs more commonly in paediatric populations , with prevalence rates of between 2% and 14%, compared with chronic urticaria which has a reported pr evalence of 0.1 (Greav es, Zitelli & Cardoro , 2011 ). Most (80 -90%) infants and young children presenting with urticaria have acute urticaria , while fewer than 10% develop chronic urticaria (Konstantinou al ., 2011 ; Legrain, et al ., 1990; Liu, Lin, & Yang, 2010 ; Mortureaux et al ., 1998 ; Sakesen et al ., 2004 ) Recurrent acute urticaria is reported in between 10% and 30% of young children (Legrain, 2004 ). Chronic urticaria is more common among adolescents and older children (Konstantinou et al, 2011 ; Legrain, et al ., 1990; Liu, Lin, & Yang, 2010 ; Mortureaux et al., 1998; Sakes en et al., 2004 ). CSU is by far the most common subgroup of chronic urticaria in children (Sahiner, Civelek, & Tuncer, 2011 ). Chronic inducible urticaria (most commonly dermographism) accounts for the next most common subgroup (Khakoo et al ., 2008 ). CSU is accompanied by angioedema in approximately 40% of cases (Kaplan, 2004; Maurer, Rosen, & Hsieh, 2013 ). Recurrent angioedema may also occur in the absence of urticaria, and may be histamine - mediated (prevented by regular prophylactic antihistamines) or bradykinin -mediated (anti-histamine resistant) . Further discussion of angioedema in the absence of urticaria is beyond the scope of this document. CSU is usually self -limited. In a population based study of 5003 adults, 147 (2.9%) had current or previous CSU. In 52.3% it had resolved within 12 weeks, however it lasted for more than 1 year in 20% of patients, and more than 5 years in 1 1.3% of patients (Gaig et al ., 2004 ). The presence of angioedema or anti -thyroid antibodies was associated with increased duration of disease in one study of 139 patients (Toubi et al., 2004 ). Fifty-two percent of patients with anti -thyroid antibodies still had urticaria after 5 years, compar ed to 16% of those without. In children CSU may also persist for months to years with an estimated resolution rate of 10% per year (Kaplan , 2002; Khakoo & Cordoro, 2011 ). In terms of prognosis , children with detectable basophils on a blood count showed slower resolution compared to those with undetectable basophils (Netchiporouk et al ., 2017) Also, surprisingly, children with a positive result on a Basophil Activation Test (BAT; > 1.8% CD63 posit ive basophils) which correlates with the presence of mast cell auto an tibodies and higher disease activity, also showed faster resolution of their disease compared to children with a negative BAT result. (Netchiporouk et al ., 2017 ; Sahiner et al., 2011 ) reported resolution rates for CSU in children of 16.5%, 38.8% and 50% at 12, 36 and 60 months of follow up respectively. Female sex and age over 10 years carried a worse prognosis. Chansakulporn et al. (2014 ) reported slightly more optimistic resolu tion rates of 18.5%, 54% and 67% at the same time points. There was no significant difference in resolution rates comparing those children with proven autoimmune CSU and those without. ASCIA INFORMATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 5 Differential diagnosis and investigations CSU is diagnosed by history and examination. Skin biopsy will provide confirmation but is seldom necessary unless an alternative diagnosis (usually vasculitis) is suspected. There is no underlying or associated disease in the vast majority of cases. Guidel ines and position papers from Europe, the United Kingdom and The United States agree that extensive routine investigations are not required or recommended for CSU (Bernstein et al., 2018; Powell et al ., 2007 ; Zuberbier et al ., 2009 ), unless concomitant dis orders are suggested by the history or physical examination. In a retrospective study of 356 adults (Tarbox, Gutta, Radojicic, & Lang , 2011 ), 1872 tests were ordered and 319 (17%) were abnormal. However most abnormal results were trivial and only one subject had an improvement in urticaria as a result of management changes implemented because of testing. Therefore , in the majority of cases of C SU, routine tests appear unnecessary and unhelpful. The following conditions should be distinguished from CSU by history and examination and require discussion of these conditions is beyond the scope of this document. Pathogenesis CSU is caused principally by activation of cutaneous mast cells, and possibly also extravasated basophils of autologous serum was found to cause a wheal and flare reaction in some patients with CSU, indicating the presence of serum 1986 ). Subsequent studies demonstrated the presence of circulating antibodies directed against the alpha chain of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcR1) in 30 -50% of patients with CSU (Hide, Francis, Hakimi , Kochan & Greaves, 1993 ), with a smaller proportion of patients with an autoantibody directed against the low - affinity IgE receptor (Puccetti et al., 2005 ) and some to the IgE molecule itself. Therefore in these cases, CSU would appear to be an autoimmune disorder. Antibodies to FcR1 can be detected by enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) however these are not specific to autoimmune urticaria and therefore ELISA is not used routinely for diagnosis (Sabroe & Greaves , 2006 ). Not all patients with a positive intradermal s erum test have autoantibodies, implying the presence of other serum HRF. Many patients with CSU have a negative intradermal serum test, therefore there are other pathways to cutaneous mast cell activation, as yet unknown. There is a strong association between CSU and other autoimmune disorders, in particular thyroid autoimmune disease. Thyroid (anti -thyroperoxidase) autoantibodies are the most common laboratory abnormality associated with CSU, being present in 20% of patien ts, compared to 1.8% of controls (Diaz -Angulo et al., 2016 ), although clinical hyper - or hypothyroidism was only present in 5% of patients, and 1.4% of controls tested (Diaz-Angulo et al ., 2016 ). The rates of thyroid antibodies associated with CSU in child ren seem to be lower at around 2% of cases. Whereas IgG autoantibodies have been designated type II autoimmunity, type I autoimmunity (autoallergy), in which IgE against soluble autoantigens (particularly demonstrated for thyroglobulin), has also been prop osed as a mechanism for CSU ( Kolkhir et al., 2017). ASCIA INFORMATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 6 Assessment of activity and quality of life (Qo L) in CSU Quantitative measurement of CSU activity is useful to monitor disease and the effects of medications and other interventions. In the absence of biochemical markers or objective parameters, patient reported outcomes (PRO) are used. Parameters such as extent of rash, severity of s ymptoms, and quality of life (Qo L) impact are recorded. The UAS7 is a validated tool and is the sum of scores for wheals and itch over seven days . (Hawro et al., 2017 ; Mlynek et al ., 2008 ). It is now used extensively in clinical practice and clinical trials as a measure of disease activity. It is a required measure in the assessment of patient suitability for omalizumab prescription in Australia . CSU i s a variable condition so a measure of ov erall disease activity over several days is most useful. This is a patient -recorded score on a daily basis, reflecting on activity over the previous 24 hours. Over a 7 day period the maximum score is 42. UAS7 scores of less than 6 are considered a marker of well controlled symptoms and UAS7 scores of 0 a complete response (Saini et al., 2015). In the ASTERIA I study comparing omalizumab and placebo, itch alone was used as the primary endpoint, the maximum weekly score being 21, with the minimally important difference a decrease of greater or equal to 5. Mathias, Crosby, Zazzali, Maurer & Saini (2012) defined the minimally important difference in the UAS7 as 9.5 -10.5. Table 1: The UAS7 for assessing disease activity in CSU Score Wheals Pruritus 0 None None 1 Mild (<20 wheals/24 h) Mild (present but not annoying or troublesome) 2 Moderate (20 -50 wheals/24 h) Moderate (troublesome but does not interfere with normal daily activity or sleep) 3 Intense (>50 wheals/24 or large confluent areas of wheals) Intense (severe pruritus, which is sufficiently troublesome to interfere with normal daily activity or sleep) Sum of score: 0 -6 for each day is summarised over 1 week (maximum 42). Two other meas ures, Qo L and disease control, are used in clinical trials and are useful measures to apply in clinical practice as well. While generic measures (such as SF -36 and SF -12) and dermatological disease -specific questionnaires (such as DLQI) have bee n used, an urticaria -specific QoL tool has been developed and validated. The CU -Q2oL has been developed specifically for assessment of CSU. Baiardini et al . (2011) , in a GA2LEN position paper , recommended the use of the urticaria specific quality of life assessment CU -Q2oL due to its availability in a number of languages, and due to an urticaria specific Qo L assessment being more sensitive to changes in symptoms but no references were given. Further support for using both a severity score and a quality of life score come from Koti et al . (2013) who found that there was only a moderate correlation between the quality of life scores determined from CU -Q2oL transla ted into Greek, and a generic Qo L score as well as the UAS. Another score, the Urticaria Control Test (UCT) is used in the assessment of patients' disease status and is useful in as sisting in treatment decisions (Ohanyan et al ., 2017; Weller et al., 2014). The UCT was developed and validat ed to determine the level of disease control in all forms of CU (CSU and ASCIA INFORMATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 7 CIndU). The UCT has only four items and a clearly defined cut off for patients with \"well -controlled\" vs. \"poorly controlled\" disease, and it is thus suited for the management of pati ents in routine clinical practice. The cut -off value for well -controlled disease is 12 of 16 possible points. This helps to guide treatment decisions. For patients with angioedema, a novel activity score, the Angioedema Activity Score (AAS) has been devel oped and validated (Weller et al ., 2013). A validated angioed ema-specific QoL tool, the AE -QoL may be used for assessing and monitoring quality of life impairment in those with angioedema without wh eals. The recently published International Guidelines for CSU recommend that patients with chronic urticaria be assessed for disease activity, impact, and control at every visit and that the UAS7 and AAS be utilised for assessing disease activity. In the s ame guideline, the CU-Q2oL and the AE -QoL are recommended for assessing quality of life impairment in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria. ASCIA INFORMATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 8 2. Treatment Drug treatment s CSU has a high rate of spontaneous remission (Gaig et al ., 2004 ); 80% of patients settle within 12 months without intervention . This leaves a significant minority of patients with a long term condition. Whilst induction of remission, or cure, would be the optimal therapeutic goal, there is no evidence that any of the currently available agents have any effect on the n atural history of the disease. It is possible that, by analogy with other autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, some immunomodulatory medications might have \"disease modifying\" effects but this remains to be proven. Therefore, currently the goal of manageme nt is to control or suppress symptoms. This should be emphasised at the outset in managing patients with CSU. Treatment will need to be continued until remission occurs. Because of this, it is important that medications used are well tolerated and do not have significant long -term morbidity. Symptom control includes suppression of itch, suppression of visible rash, and prevention of angioedema episodes. Optimal adherence to medications will result in optimal symptom control. There is no evidence that adhere nce to medications (for example, regular compared with on -demand antihistamines) has any influence on the natural history of CSU but it has bee n shown to result in improved Qo L (Grob, Auquier, Dreyfus & been shown to be effective in patients with CSU There is no evidence that their efficacy is superior to second generation anti histamines despite carrying a higher degree of sedation, anticholinergic effects and cognitive impairment (Breneman, 1996 ; Grant et al ., 1998; Kalivas et al ., 1990 ; Monroe, 1992; & comparing loratadine vs hydroxyzine (not available in Australia ) (Monroe et al., 1992; 1992 ) et al ., 1990 ) did not demonstrate any significant difference in efficacy. A single randomised contr olled trial evaluating the addition (hydroxyzine), to standard dose levocetirizine monotherapy, also reported no additional benefit despite higher degree of daytime sedation (Staevska et al., 2014 ). First generation antihistamines are not recommended as first line treatment for patients with CSU because of their significant side effects. Second generation (non -sedating) H1 antihistamines Second generation H1 antihistamines in include cetirizine, levocetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine and fexofenadine . All have in CSU in a vast number of randomised controlled trials , including a total of nearly 4 ,000 patients . All have demonstrated safety and efficacy with no signifi cant adverse effects . Levels of somnolence and sedation are consistently comparable to placebo -treated patients and significant i mprovements in health -related Qo L, work performance and daily activities have also been reported. Minor adverse events only hav e been noted in a minority of patients , including headache, drowsiness, constipation and abdominal pain . (Augustin & Ehrle, 2009 ; Breneman, 1996 ; Finn et al .,1999; Goh, Wong & Lim, 1991 ; Grob et al ., 2008 ; Grob, Auquier , Dreyfus & Ortonne, 2009 ; Juhlin & Arendt, 1988 ; Juglin,1991 ; Kalivas et al ., 1990 ; Kaplan et al., 2005 ; Kapp & Pichler, 2006 ; Kawashima & Harada, 2001 ; Koti et al ., 2013; Kulthanan et al, 2001 ; Monroe et al ., 1992; Monroe, 1992 ; Monroe et al ., 2003; Nettis, 2006 ; Monroe et et al ., 2007; Raynolds 2000; Ring et al ., 2001 ; Spector et al ., 2007 ; Thompson, Finn & Schoenwetter, 2000 ). ASCIA INFORMATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 9 Second generation H1 antihistamine comparisons Comparative studies suggest that second generation antihistamines (histamine -1 receptor antagonists, H1RA) may not be equally effective, however there is insufficient evidence currently to make strong recommendations and antihistamine choice for CSU is usu ally dependent on clinician preference. Cetirizine has been compared with loratadine, fexofenadine and levocetirizine in two randomised controlled trials and one open label study (Garg & Tharmi, 2007 ; Guerra Dogra Kumar, over fexofenadine (Handa, Dogra & Kumar, 2004 ) but greater when compared to loratadine or levocetirizine (Garg & Tharmi, 2007 ; Guerra et al .,1994 ). There are two randomised controlled comparison stu dies of levocetirizine and desloratadine both suggesting greater symptom control in the levocetirizine group (Potter et al ., 2009; Staevska et al ., 2010) although no significant difference in health related quality of life scores was reported (Potter et a l., 2009 ). Levocetrizine has also been compared to loratadine in a small open label randomised study with minimal statistically significant improvement in symptom score in the levocetirizine group (Anuradha et al ., 2010). Second generation H1 antihistamine s: updosing Standard treatment protocols recommend increasing the dose of second -generation H1 antihistamines up to 4 times the standard dose, if standard doses are ineffective ( Zuberbier et al ., 2018 ). While there are no large, double blind placebo controlled studies to support this, a recent systematic review and meta -analysis did find that while the studies did not show an improvement in wheal number at higher doses there are improvements and also that a larger number of patients responded to treatment with higher doses o f antihistamines than to standard doses, however there was heterogeneity amongst these studies ( Guillen -Aguinaga et al ., 2016 ). Interestingly, in the meta -analysis fexofenadine was the drug most likely to have increased response rates at higher doses, in contrast to previous studies that had not shown an improvement with up -dosing this medication (Finn et al ., 1999; Nelson et al ., 2000 ). A recent study has looked at data from one centre in which antihistamines have been up -dosed at doses greater than 4 times the standard dose and found an additional number of patients achieved symptom relief (van den Elzen et al ., 2017 ) with a 10% rate of side effects. However , given this is a single study, a recommendation to increase to greater than 4 times the current dose cannot be made at this time. Doxepin Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant that is approximately 56 times more potent than hydroxyzine as a H1 blocker and six times more potent than cimetidine as an H2 blocker ( Green & Masayani, 1977 ; Richelson, 1979 ). A double -blind placebo -controlled crossover trial of 16 adults with CSU of more than 3 months duration and refractory to antihistamines, demonstrated improved itch, urticaria and angioedema in doxepin treated subjects (25mg TDS) compared to placebo (Goldsobel et al .,1986 ). Although drowsiness, dry mouth, and constipation were commonly observed, only one patient ceased therapy because of lethargy (Goldsobel et al ., 1986 ). Doxepin may provide additional relief for some patients with CSU and generally, smaller doses (10 - 50mg), are often used. All patients should be appropriately counseled regarding drowsiness and anticholinergic side effects and the drug should be avoided in high risk occupations such as commercial drivers (e.g. bus, taxi, aircraft) or a ny work involving operation of heavy machinery. ASCIA INFORMATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 10 H2 Antagonists Current evidence for the use of H2 receptor blockers in CSU is lacking and are now difficult to source . Early studies demonstrated improved itch, wheal size and intensity despite no significant greater overall improvement in symptoms of urticaria ( Bleehan et al ., 1987; Monroe et al .,1981) . Others have demonstrated no clinically significant benefit (Paul & Bodeker, 1986; Sharpe & Shuster, 1993 ). Small randomised trials have reported t reatment efficacy of combination H1 and H2 receptor antagonist/ Montelukast therapy, however, follow up did not extend beyond four weeks and long term data is lacking ( Wan, 2009; Wan & Chang, 2014 ). Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) There is limited low level evidence regarding the use of LTRAs in CSU. One small placebo -controlled trial of zafirlukast monotherapy showed no benefit (Reimers et al, 2002) . Two randomised controlled trials with montelukast reported reduction in number of hives c ompared to placebo, but no significant benefit in other outcomes (Erbagci, 2002 ; Di Lorenzo et al ., 2004 ). A number of head to head studies comparing montelukast with antihistamines favour antihistamines ., 2003 ). However, some studies have demonstrated efficacy of LTRAs in particular patient groups, notably; delayed pressure urticaria, cold urticaria, positive ASST and intolerance to aspirin or food additives (Bagenstose, Levin & Berns tein, 2004 ; Pacor, Di Lorenzo & Corrocher, 2001 ) Combination LTRA and antihistamine therapy studies have demonstrated variable improvement in VAS, itch and urticarial scores at follow up ranging from three to six weeks ( Bagenstose et al ., 2004; Nettis et al ., 2004 Wan, 2009; Wan & Chang, 2014 ). Long term data is lacking. Two further contradictory trials have, however, failed to demonstrate additional efficacy of combined therapy, in all but a small minority of patients, particularly when patients with positive ASST and intolerance to aspirin or food additives were excluded (Di Lorenzo et al ., 2004; Nosik & Subi, 2011 ). All trials have, however, consistently reported excellent tolerability and side effect profile (Bagenstose et al ., et ., 2003, et al 2004 ; Pacor et al ., 2001 ; Reimers et al ., 2002 ; Wan, 2009; Wan & Chang, 2014 ). Omalizumab Omalizumab is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody engineered to bind to the CH3 domain of the chain of IgE, clos e to the binding site of IgE for both the high affinity (FcRI) and low affinity (CD23) IgE receptors (Babu, Arshad & Holgate, 2001 ; Holgate et al ., 2005 ). This binding target means that Omalizumab may only bind circulating IgE and cannot bind cell bound IgE to cause receptor cross - linking. Omalizumab has been shown to reduce the levels of both free IgE and the high -affinity IgE receptor (FcRI) ( Beck, MacGlashan , of are essential in mast -cell and basophil activation. Omalizumab has been approved as add -on therapy in the IgE -mediated disease of moderate -to-severe persistent allergic asthma (European Medicines Agency Assessment Report for Paediatric Studies 2017 ). The use of Omalizumab (Xolair\u00ae - Novartis Pharmaceuticals Australia Pty Ltd) was added to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Sch eme (PBS) on 1st September 2017 for the treatment of patient s with severe chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Post marketing research has consistently shown benefit, similar to the original studies at 300mg/month with around 63% of patients well controlled, and an additional 25% with fair to weak response with 12% labelled as non -responders. While a lower dose of 150mg/4 weeks has been beneficial in some (Vadas z et al ., 2017), in patients with a poor response, studies have shown improvement in some, but not all, with either increasing the frequency of injections to 2 weekly , (Clarke et al ., 2016), or increasing the dose age >57 years and prior ciclosporin therapy predicts treatment failures at standard doses (Curto et al, 2018) . ASCIA INFORMATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 11 The common side effects include headache, fatigue and injection site reactions ( Bernstein et al ., 2018 ). More unusu al reported side effects includ e serum sickness in a 12 year old gi rl (Eapen & Kloepfer, 2018) and transient hair loss & Daniilidis, 2016 ; Noshela & Thomsen, 2017). As use becomes more widespread, experience is growing with serious adverse events. The most concerning immediate reaction is the potential for anaphylaxis. Post marketing data encompassing 819,018 patient years, including patients receiving omalizumab for both chronic spontaneous urticaria and asthma, demonstrated a 0.20% reported rate of anaphylaxis. (Australian Public Assessment Report for Omalizumab , 2016) . In the most recent study of 96 episodes of anaphylaxis, 80% where it was given for asthma, 72% of episodes occurred within the first 3 doses. (Lieberman, Umetsu, Carrigan & Rahmaoui, 2016) . There are reports of increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in a cohort of 5007 severe asthmatic patients treated with omalizumab, compared to 2829 moderately severe asthmatic controls. The omalizumab treated group had 13.4 events per 1000 person years, compared to the non - omalizumab treated group with 8.1 events per 1000 person years. (Iribarren et al., 2017 ). It should be noted however, that there is a higher risk of these events in patients with chronic, severe asthma (Iribarren , Tolstykh, Miller, Sobel & Eisner, 2012), which is not present in patients with chronic urticaria (Egeberg , 2016). No study has been performed on patients with CSU treated with omalizumab. Fortunately , there does not appear to be an increased risk of malignancy in the same cohort of patients with severe asthma treated with omalizumab. ( Long et al., 2014 ). Although there has been reported resistance with retreatment with other biologic therapies, this ha s not been the case with omalizumab where if treatment is stopped, retreatment appears equally effective. (Metz , 2014). Unmet needs and unknowns with omalizumab use There are now ample data available to support the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in patients with CSU . However, there remain many unanswered questions regarding this treatment. Knowledge gaps include efficacy of omalizumab in patients with angioedema , but no hi ves; mode of action; safety of long-term use (greater than 12 months) in this population; efficacy and safety in children with CSU. Very practical questions for the treating physician include: How to determine if a CSU patient is likely to respond to omali zumab ? How to measure response to omalizumab for a CSU patient ? When should a CSU patient be classified as a non -responder to omalizumab and on what basi s? Omalizumab dose and frequency for a CSU patient from the point that they have been determined to be a responder ? Whether there should be a trial of omalizumab cessation and if so, when ? Whether patients no longer on omalizumab should be re -treated with it upon CSU recurrence and if yes, with what dose and frequency ? What is the response to omalizumab? Response patterns to omalizumab in CSU are dose dependent. Commencing with 300mg monthly ensures the largest percentage of patients gain complete (UAS 7=0) or good (UAS 7 6) control with half the patients achieving this after the second dose. This finding has been confirmed in the OPTIMA study (Lynde et al ., 2017) . While real -life studies of omalizumab in reveal a response rate of 77% - 83% (UAS 7 6), some patients do not achieve good control at the recommended dose of 300mg every 4 weeks. Curto -Barredo et al . (2018) showed that 21% of CSU patients required a higher dose of omalizumab to achieve UAS 7 6; 15% did with 450mg monthly, while 6% required 6 00mg monthly. ASCIA INFORMATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 12 Predictors of partial response to 300mg and good response with the updosing were previous treatment with c iclosporin, obesity and age >57 years old. Previous use of ciclosporin could alter responsiveness to omalizumab by modifying patients ' immune status or may reflect severity of the disease itself. Long - term efficacy of biologics in other inflammatory cutaneous diseases such a s psoriasis is influenced by body mass index (BMI), so this may also be the case for omalizumab in CSU (Curto-Baredo et al ., 2018). Late responders to omalizumab Patients should be treated for at least 6 months before being regarded as non -responsive to omalizumab treatment (Kaplan et al ., 2016). At this point, omalizumab should be discontinued and alternative treatments may be considered. In the ASTERIA I study (Saini et al ., 2011) the median time to complete response was observed between 8 -10 weeks at 300mg monthly. 58% of patients in the omalizu mab group w ho had not responded with a UAS 7 6 by week 12 did so during weeks 13 -24. Results were similar in both GLACIAL and ASTERIA I studies . Three doses of omalizumab may therefore miss the opportunity to bring symptoms under control . (Kaplan et al., 2016 ). Further research is needed to understand mechanisms responsible for early and late patterns of responses. Outcomes after cessation of omalizumab treatment Further unanswered questions regarding omalizumab treatment in CSU relate to whether there should be a trial of omalizumab cessation after a good response to treatment, and if so, at what point should this be attempted. If there is recurrence of CSU, should patients be re -treated, with what dose and frequency and will re -treatment be as effective as initial treatment? In the OPTIMA study (Lynde et al., 2017), after being well controlled (UAS7 6), 44.5% of CSU patients on omalizumab 150 mg and 50% of patients on omalizumab 300 mg relapsed (UAS7 16) upon withdrawal of treatment. Within the allocated 8 -week treatment withdrawal period as per protocol, the overall time to relapse in both dosages was 4.7 weeks. Re -introduction of treatment with both dosages was effective. Overall, 87.8% of patients regained symptom control upon re -treatment, after being previously well controlled and relapsing. Quality of life worsens consid erably after drug withd rawal. It is unknown whether stepping down rather than cessation of treatment would a llow continued symptom control . Angioedema component - omalizumab responsiveness The effect of omalizumab on the angioedema component of CSU had not been studied un til recently . (Staubach et al ., 2016). The X -ACT study was a phase III, randomised, double -blind study conducted in 24 German centres which selectively included CSU patients with angioedema and wheals. Patients were randomised (1:1) to omalizumab 300 mg or placebo (every 4 weeks up to week 24). The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of omalizumab vs placebo at week 28 using the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life (CU -Q2oL) questionnaire. Omalizumab was superior to placebo in reducing the CU -Q2oL total score from week 4 onwards over the 28 weeks of treatment (P < 0.001 at all measurement points ). There was a threefold improvement in angioedema -burdened days/week with omalizumab (0.3) vs placebo (1.1). The median time to first recurrence of angioed ema was 57 -63 days with omalizumab and <5 days with placebo. Omalizumab significantly improved angioedema -specific Qo L (P < 0.001). The adverse events reported were in line with the established safety profile of omalizumab . ASCIA INFORMATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 13 Ciclosporin In the first randomised controlled trial of c iclosporin for CSU in 29 subjects (Zuberbier et al ., 2009 ), two thirds experienced short term complete resolution of urticaria . Long term remission (whe re urticaria did not recur after c iclosporin was ceased) was seen in only 5 subjects. In the largest, double blind randomised placebo controlled trial with 99 antihistamine -refractory patients (Brown, ), ciclosporin (5m g/kg/day in conjunction with cetirizine 10mg/day) was given for the first 2 weeks, 4mg/kg/day for the next 2 weeks, and then 3mg/kg/day. Patients were treated for 16 weeks, and reviewed 8 weeks after study conclusion. Although adverse events were common (6 0%), these led to discontinuation of treatment in only 6%. C iclosporin was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo and cetirizine. There was a 52.9% improvement in the mean urticaria severity score at week 16, compared to 25% in the placebo g roup (p<0.01). At week 24, there was 41.7% improvement in the mean severity score for the c iclosporin group, ve rsus 30.2% in the placebo group. More prolonged courses of low dose c iclosporin treatment have been shown to be safe and effective in an observa tional study involving 120 patients with severe CSU (Banan et al ., 2014 ). At a dose of 3mg/kg/day for three months of treatment, 20 patients discontinued because of side effects. C iclosporin was not effective for 18 patients. Thirty patients had complete resolution, while 32 had a moderate response and needed ongoing antihistamine treatment. A further 20 patients found c iclosporin beneficial, but required much longer periods of treat ment. In this group of c iclosporin dependent patients, dosage was reduced to 1 -2mg/kg/day after 3 months of treatment. Eight patients were given ciclosporin at this dosage for 8 -14 months of follow -up, and 12 patients were given c iclosporin for 60 - 120 mont hs. Short term (5 -month) use of ciclosporin in CSU with positive autologous serum skin test (ASST) has been suggested from an open label study of 23/30 subjects completing a 5 -month trial of ciclosporin (receiving mean dose of 2.16 mg/kg for the first mon th and 0.55 mg/kg for the fifth month) with 3 non responders and 4 dropouts due to adverse events (Zuberbier et al ., 2014 ). At 1 year follow up 87% remained symptom free and repeat ASST was negative in 78% suggesting a possible role for short term, low dose treatment benefit in some. Recently, a system atic review and meta -analysis of ciclosporin CSU identified 18 studies (909 participants) receiving very low (<2 mg/kg/d), low (from 2 to< 4 mg/kg/d), and -5 mg/kg/d) doses , respectively (Gaig et al ., 2004 ). Of concern only 3 studies were available to assess impact on UAS7 of which only a single RCT was included. After 4 weeks of ciclosporin treatment, the pooled statistical estimate of mean relative UAS7 changes from baseline was -17.89 (95% CI, -21.95 to -13.83), and significantly -2.3 (1 study; 95% CI, -3.72 to -0.88). After 12 weeks of treatment, the pooled response rate appeared dose responsive, for low - dose ciclosporin 69.9% (95% CI, (95% CI, 69.3% -92.8%). At least one adverse event was reported following ciclosporin treatment in patients treated with very low 6.2% (95% 1.0% -29.8%), low 23.4% 57.9% (95% CI, 32.3% -79.8%). Adverse events that led to the discontinuation of CsA included hypertension, severe gastrointestinal adverse events, precordialgia, persistent peripheral neuropathy, and severe headaches. These limited findings sugg est that ciclosporin is effective in CSU in low (from 2 - <4 mg/kg/d) to moderate doses (4 -5 mg/kg/d) although adverse events appeared dose dependent and at least one adverse event was experienced by more than half of pati ents treated at moderate doses. A previous EAACI/GA\u00b2LEN/EDF/WAO Guideline (Greaves, 2000 ) suggest ed that ciclosporin may have a role in CSU unresponsive to high dose H1 -antihistamines . However , with the availability of omalizumab,a trial of ciclosprin should follow fai lure of omalizumab to bring about control, given its off ASCIA INFORMATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 14 label status and increased adverse event profile , this should follow a trial of omalizumab. For the treatment of CSU, the dosage for c iclosporin ranges from 1 to 5 mg/kg per day. Patients taking ciclosporin need to have blood pressure and renal function closely monitored during treatment. From 1st of May, 2015, c iclosporin has become exempt from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) statutory price reductions, and is available on a private prescript ion. Corticosteroids Systemic corticosteroid use for CSU, although widely accepted, has not been extensively studied. There are no randomised controlled trials and quality evidence regarding systemic corticosteroids is lacking. Current evidence is limited to a single retrospective study evaluating a short course of moderate dose prednisone (25mg tapered over 10 days) in 86 patients not responding to standard dose antihistamines ( Asero & Tedeschi, 2010). All patients responded well, evident as early as 24 hours after the first 25mg dose. Half the patients achieved a maintained response one month after the initial course and the remaining 50% relapsed when dose was tapered or ceased. In almost one third of these, a second ten day tapering course, induced and maintained remission at one month. There has been no follow up beyond four weeks and long term data is lacking. Systemic corticosteroids have a role in short term rescue therapy only, and long term, or frequent short term use, should be avoided. In a retrospective cohort study of 12647 patients with CSU analysing a commercial claims data base, those who were treated with oral corticosteroids had an increased risk of side effects and higher total healt h care costs. Patients suffering diabetes, hypertension or significant cardiovascular disease are especially at high risk of significant steroid related morbidity. Anticoagulants There have been several small case series reporting warfarin or heparin to be effective for CSU (Berth -Jones, Hutchinson, Wicks & Mitchell, 1988 2005). & Cugno (2010) has proposed that heparin and tranexamic acid therapy may be effective in CSU with elevated D -dimer, and report improvement in five of eight patients in an uncontrolled series. Thyroxine There have been several case series sh owing mixed results for thyroxine given to euthyroid patients with CSU, whether they had thyroid autoantibodies or not ( Averssano al & Mishal, 2012 ; Rumbyrt, Katz & Schocket, 1995). On balance, there is probably a minority of euthyroid CSU patients who have thyroid autoantibodies and may respond to thyroxine therapy, and a trial of thyroxine could be considered at 100 -200mcg per day for four weeks. Other treatments Studies on small numbers of patients have suggested some benefit from the use of dapsone in CSU (Engin & Ozdemir, 2014). Glucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency should be checked for prior to commencing dapsone . Hydroxychloroquine Overall, the published evidence for hydroxychloroquine is limited ( Boonpiyathad et al., 2013 ; Lammert & Robinson, 1996). There is only limited evidence showing possible efficacy in CSU for : Sagi et al., 2011 ; Sharma et al ., 2014 ). ASCIA INFORMATION FOR 15 Mycophenolate (Shahar, Bergamn, Guttman -Yassky & Pollack, Egger, 2009; (Arkwright, 2009; Yee & Paget, 2011; ). Other medications with more evidence for treatment efficacy are therefore recommended. Drug treatment in paediatric populations Although further studies of CSU are needed in paediatric populations, evidence to date sugges t that the prevalence and causes are similar to that in adults (Caffarelli et al ., 2013; Maurer, Church & Second generation H1 -antihistamines remain the mainstay of CSU treatment in children. These non - sedating drugs are safe and usually very effective at controlling urticaria in infants and children (Asero et al., 2013; Church, Weller, Stock, & Maurer, 2011; Simons, 2001). Second H1 antihistamines are preferred to first generation H1 -antihistamines, which have a higher incidence of adverse effects, including central nervous system depression and anti -muscarinic effects (Church et al, 2011). Although up-dosing of second generation H1 -antihistamines, to up to four times the recommended dose, is effective in adults and often trialled in children in clinical practice, there have been no studies undertaken in paediatric populations to support its use. Ove rall there is a paucity of evidence to support the use of most second line treatments in children with CSU. The strongest evidence exists for omalizumab, which has been shown to be safe and effective in treating CSU in patients from seven years of age ( Kaplan, 2012 ; Maurer et al ., et al ., 2014 ). Adolescents aged 12 were included in three large randomised control phase III studies (A STERIA I, ASTERIA II, and GLACIAL) which clearly demonstrated the efficacy of omalizumab o ver placebo (Kaplan, 2012 ; Mlynek et al ., 2008; Sussman et al ., 2014). In Canada, a prospective open label trial demonstrated a good response to omalizumab in children as young as seven years (Sussman et al ., 2014). In addition, a single case series found ciclosporin to be effective at controlling symptoms in seven children with CSU ( Doshi & Weinberger, 2009). However, there are no controlled trials to support the use of c iclosporin or other second line agents, (e.g. leukotriene receptor antagonists, H2 receptor antagonists, hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine or methotrexate ), in treating children with CSU (Asero et al., 2013; Church et al ., 2011). The rationale for the use of these medications in paediatric patients wi th CSU is based on their safety and tolerability treating other conditions in children and extrapolation of data from trials in adults with CSU. ASCIA INFORMATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 16 Drug availability in New Zealand The second -generation antihistamines loratadine and cetirizine are available and fully subsidised on prescription. There is a partial subsidy for fexofenadine 60mg and 120mg. Fexofenadine 180mg, levocetirizine and desloratadine are available but at full cost to the patient. Montelukast is fully funded and used off license for CSU and angioedema. Ciclosporin is fully subsidised (off license indication) on prescription. Omalizumab is Pharmac funded by application for subsidy by special authority. Applications must be made by a clinical immunologist or dermatologist. Doxepin, c iclosporin, dapsone, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and azathioprine are fully subsidised (off-licence indication) on prescription. PBS requirements in Australia In Australia, PBS requirements for omalizumab prescription require : a UAS7 of 28; a trial of high dose non -sedation antihistamines in combination with any two of H2 antagonist, montelukast or doxepin. In addition, the first PBS prescription is for three months only with demonstration of benefit required for further prescriptions. Recent international guidelines and this updated guideline provides evidence that some patients may take longer than three months to gain a response and an evidence -based argument can be made to allow a six month trial before accepti ng treatment failure. Furthermore, H2 antagonists are now difficult to source and the evidence base for efficacy in CSU is weak, so these should no longer be required as a step before allowing prescription of omalizumab. There is also limited evidence for the use of montelukast , so while a treatment trial may be attempted, this should no longer be required as a step before allowing prescription of omalizumab. Finally, most clinicians believe that setting the UAS7 criteria at 28 ignores the ve ry significant burden of disease that occurs with lower scores. For these reasons the algorithm in this document proposes modified criteria. ASCIA INFORMATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 17 Non-drug management Dietary management Dietary manipulations are not recommended for the majority of patients with CSU (Banan et al ., 2014 ; Brown & Carter, 2007 ; Zuberbier et al ., 2009 ). Although dietary factors have long been suspected of influencing the manifestations of urticaria it is extremely rare for IgE -mediated food allergy to be causative i n CSU Zuberbier et food additives, preservatives, dyes, vasoactive and aromatic compounds h ave been reported to induce and/or aggravate urticaria in CSU patients (Henz & Zuberbier,1998; Juhlin,1982 ; Zuberbier,1995) but with varied results (Bunselmeyer et ., 2009 ; Zuberbier et al ., 2010; Zuberbier et al ., 2009 ). No reliable laboratory or skin tests can currently identify those patients who may benefit f rom a pseudoallergen - free diet (Reese et al ., 2009). There is a lack of supportive quality evidence and these diets remain controversial (Banan et al ., 2014 ). For the majority of patients with CSU, dietary manipulations are not recommended (Bernstein et al ., 2014; Rajan, Zuberbier & Supervised pseudoallergen -free diets may improve symptoms in strongly motivated adult patient s with CSU, if maintained for 3 -4 weeks (Greaves, 2000; Zitelli & Cordoro, et al ., 1995 ). The risk of adverse outcomes, including nutritional deficiencies, food aversion an d development or exacerbation of eating disorders should be considered by the treating physician prior to recommending dietary restriction. Pseudoallerg en-free diets in the paediatric population may have adverse outcomes (Gray et al ., 2013) and are not recommended for use in children with CSU (Mortureaux et al .,1998 ). A small RCT found supplementation with high dose vitamin D (4000iu per day) as add on therapy to antihistamines and montelukast was of possible benefit in reducing the symptoms of urticaria (Rorie, Goldner, Lyden, & Poole, 2014 ). However, further studies are required on appropriate dosage and duration of vitamin D supplementation. Reduction of emotional stress Emotional factors and physical stress are recognised to correlate with CSU severity and activity (Konstantinou et al ., 2011 ; Verghese et al ., 2016 ), although the mechanisms are not well understood. Stress reduction techniques, screening for comorbid mental health problems and a whole person treatment approach may be of benefi t in managing CSU (Ben-Shoshan, Blinderman & Raz, 2013; Kaplan, 2004 ; Lindsay, Goulding, Solomon & Broom, 2013; Liu et al ., 2011 ). ASCIA INFORMATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 18 Management of CSU in pregnancy and lactation Urticaria commencing during pregnancy must be distinguished from other pruritic conditions of pregnancy such as pruritic urticarial papules pregnancy; cholestasis of pregnancy and autoimmune progesterone dermatitis of pregnancy. Pregnant women with CSU should be treated with the least amount of medication possible to control symptoms, particularly pruritus. Most women can be treated with a second generation H1 antihistamine. Occasional short courses of corticosteroid s may be required for severe flares. There is no data available on the advisability of escalating the currently recommended doses of antihistamines in pregnancy. Omalizumab in pregnancy has not been associated with increased risks to the mother or foetus b ut more data is needed (EXPECT). The physician should undertake a careful discussion with the pregnant woman regarding the risks and benefits of available treatments.
