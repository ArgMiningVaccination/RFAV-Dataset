And where there's smoke, there's a story. Thirty years ago, Trattner suffered a severe asthma attack that left her in a medically induced coma for five days, her lung function provided by a ventilator. The endotracheal tube going into her mouth scraped her vocal chords, causing irreparable damage. Hence the rasp. \"I suffered tremendously,\" she tells me. \"I have a different perspective on healing.\" Trattner is a doctor of Chinese medicine, [a licensed acupuncturist](https://www.allure.com/story/best-acupuncturist-new-york-state?mbid=synd_yahoo_rss), and an integrative-medicine practitioner. \"I did receive my shamanic rites,\" she says in a matter-of-fact tone that most people might use to tell you about having minored in French. Her alternative-healing practice is located in \u2014 do you want to guess? It's not Los Angeles, but the heat is on, and it's more famous for butt lifts than acupuncture. Yes, it's South Florida, and it's perfect for Trattner, with her Miami blowout and her Miami tan and her Miami disposition. Early in her career, Trattner worked in a plastic surgeon's office, helping patients with their recovery processes, and mentored under Andrew Weil \u2014 Harvard M.D. and patron saint of holistic health. She can outline nutrition plans aimed at lowering your cholesterol, for example, and recommend a steady regimen of Chinese herbs to help [balance your hormones](https://www.allure.com/story/late-period-reasons-other-than-pregnancy?mbid=synd_yahoo_rss) or overcome symptomatic body odor (be sure to run any herbal remedies by your general practitioner for potential drug interactions). She chimed a tuning fork over a toy poodle when the pup seemed to be stressed, and she'll use the same technique for you, too. Trattner treats everything from anxiety to allergies to weight gain to that weird dull pain, right here, that won't quite go away. (And if your ailment evades her repertoire of remedies, she'll refer you to an -ologist and keep track of your progress.) Like many things in the wellness space, it's easy to second-guess her methods. Take, for example, the \" [gemstone facial](https://www.allure.com/story/magickal-healing-crystals-guide?mbid=synd_yahoo_rss),\" which can't help but be Instagram bait. As Trattner explains in a post on the platform, acne can be treated in part with stones, like luminous aquamarine, on your face, \"[stabilizing] heat and wind,\" in addition to gemstones lined up on a patient's body like sushi on a buffet. Trattner's approach, however unorthodox, might appeal to some who feel hurried by traditional medicine. Her point is not to rush the process. In terms of healing, Trattner says, there's an invaluable, powerful, oft-overlooked benefit to simply spending time with somebody who wants to help you. \"[In a traditional office] the doctor has two minutes with you,\" she says. \"I spend time with patients. There's a huge therapeutic value, knowing somebody has your back.\" More on alternative healing: [Meet the Former Photo Editor Who Quit Her Job and Became One of New York's Best Acupuncturists](https://www.allure.com/story/best-acupuncturist-new-york-state?mbid=synd_yahoo_rss) Now watch Angela Bassett break down her most iconic movie looks: Follow Allure on [subscribe to our newsletter](https://www.allure.com/newsletter/subscribe?mbid=synd_yahoo_rss) for daily beauty stories delivered "}
