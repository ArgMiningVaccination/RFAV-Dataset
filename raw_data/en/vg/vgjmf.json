On July 11, 2023, best-selling American author, YouTube video blogger, and philanthropist [John Green](/wiki/John_Green) began advocating via Twitter and YouTube for Johnson & Johnson to allow the patent on bedaquiline to expire so that millions of vulnerable people worldwide could access the life-changing treatment via generic brands. [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMhgw5SW0h4&ab_channel=vlogbrothers) Green, a long-time public health advocate, led thousands of people in [Nerdfighteria](/wiki/Nerdfighteria) and from among his online following in contacting Johnson & Johnson to protest the company's efforts to evergreen the patent and hold the company responsible for violating its own credo under the Twitter hashtag #patientsnotpatents. [[2]](https://twitter.com/sportswithjohn/status/1679291184621944835?s=12) [[3]](https://twitter.com/johngreen/status/1678803865330647042?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) In response, Johnson & Johnson released a statement on Twitter in response, claiming that the company's patents have allowed them to ship 660,000 courses of SIRTURO (bedaquiline) to 159 countries and asserting that \"the most significant barrier to treatment access for patients today is the fact that millions of patients with TB go undiagnosed every year.\" [[4]](https://twitter.com/JNJNews/status/1679168314986094592?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) The statement as Twitter users fact-checked the statement, refuting it with evidence of Johnson & Johnson's efforts to limit the lower pricing of bedaquiline and contrasting the millions of deaths from tuberculosis with the comparatively small number of SIRTURO courses provided to low-income countries. Business sectors[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Johnson_%26_Johnson&action=edit\u00a7ion=11)] The company's business is divided into two business sectors: Pharmaceuticals and Medtech.

Reed](/wiki/John_C._Reed), James Jennifer Wengel, and Joseph J. Wolk. [[119]](#cite_note-119) Joaquin Duato chief Johnson & Johnson has set several positive goals to keep the company environmentally friendly and was ranked third among the United States's largest companies in [Newsweek](/wiki/Newsweek)'s \"Green Rankings\". [[123]](#cite_note-123) Some examples are the reduction in water use, waste, and energy use and an increased level of transparency. [[124]](#cite_note-124) Johnson & Johnson agreed to change its packaging of plastic bottles used in the manufacturing process, switching their packaging of liquids to non- [polyvinyl chloride](/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride) containers. [[125]](#cite_note-ens-125) The corporation is working with the Climate Northwest Initiative and the EPA National Environmental Performance Track program. [[126]](#cite_note-126) As a member of the national Green Power Partnership, Johnson & Johnson operates the largest solar power generator in Pennsylvania at its site in [Fort Washington, Pennsylvania](/wiki/Fort_Washington,_Pennsylvania). [[127]](#cite_note-127) Recalls and litigation[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Johnson_%26_Johnson&action=edit\u00a7ion=18)] 1982 On September 29, 1982, a \"Tylenol scare\" began when the first of seven individuals died in [Chicago metropolitan area](/wiki/Chicago_metropolitan_area), after ingesting Extra Strength Tylenol that had been deliberately laced with [cyanide](/wiki/Cyanide). [[128]](#cite_note-nytrecall-128) Within a week, the company pulled 31 million bottles of capsules back from retailers, making it one of the first major recalls in American history. [[128]](#cite_note-nytrecall-128) The incident led to reforms in the packaging of [over-the-counter substances](/wiki/Over-the-counter_substance) and to federal anti-tampering laws. The case remains unsolved and no suspects have been charged. Johnson & Johnson's quick response, including a nationwide recall, was widely praised by [public relations](/wiki/Public_relations) experts and the media and was the gold standard for corporate crisis management. [[129]](#cite_note-129) [[130]](#cite_note-130) [[131]](#cite_note-131) 2010 children's product recall[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Johnson_%26_Johnson&action=edit\u00a7ion=20)] On April 30, 2010, [McNeil Consumer Healthcare](/wiki/McNeil_Consumer_Healthcare), a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson, voluntarily [recalled](/wiki/Product_recall) 43 [over-the-counter](/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug) children's medicines, including [Tylenol](/wiki/Tylenol_(brand)), Tylenol Plus, [Motrin](/wiki/Motrin), [Zyrtec](/wiki/Zyrtec) and [Benadryl](/wiki/Benadryl). The recall was conducted after a routine inspection at a manufacturing facility in [Fort Washington, Pennsylvania](/wiki/Fort_Washington,_Pennsylvania), United States, revealed that some \"products may not fully meet the required manufacturing specifications\". [[132]](#cite_note-US_firm_recalls_children's_drugs-132) [[133]](#cite_note-Warning_As_Baby_Medicines_Are_Recalled-133) Affected products may contain a \"higher concentration of active ingredients\" or exhibit other manufacturing defects. [Fiji](/wiki/Fiji) were included in the recall. [[132]](#cite_note-US_firm_recalls_children's_drugs-132) In a statement, Johnson & Johnson said \"a comprehensive quality assessment across its manufacturing operations\" was underway. [[132]](#cite_note-US_firm_recalls_children's_drugs-132) [[133]](#cite_note-Warning_As_Baby_Medicines_Are_Recalled-133) A dedicated website was established by the company [listing](https://web.archive.org/web/20100504052605/http://www.mcneilproductrecall.com/page.jhtml?id=%2Finclude%2Fnew_recall.inc) affected products and other consumer information. [[133]](#cite_note-Warning_As_Baby_Medicines_Are_Recalled-133) 2010 hip-replacement recall[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Johnson_%26_Johnson&action=edit\u00a7ion=21)] On August 24, 2010, DePuy, a subsidiary of American giant Johnson & Johnson, recalled its ASR (articular surface replacement) hip prostheses from the market. DePuy said the recall was due to unpublished National Joint Registry data showing a 12% revision rate for resurfacing at five years and an ASR XL revision rate of 13%. All hip prostheses fail in some patients, but it is expected that the rate will be about 1% a year. [[134]](#cite_note-Out_of_joint-134) Pathologically, the failing prosthesis had several effects. Metal debris from wear of the implant led to a reaction that destroyed the soft tissues surrounding the joint, leaving some patients with long term disability. Ions of cobalt and chromium - the metals from which the implant was made - were also released into the blood and cerebral spinal fluid in some patients. [[135]](#cite_note-fda1-135) In March 2013, a jury in Los Angeles ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay more than $8.3 million in damages to a Montana man in the first of more than 10,000 lawsuits pending against the company in connection with the now-recalled DePuy hip. [[136]](#cite_note-Meier-136) Some lawyers and industry analysts have estimated that the suits ultimately will cost Johnson & Johnson billions of dollars to resolve. [[136]](#cite_note-Meier-136) 2010 Tylenol recall[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Johnson_%26_Johnson&action=edit\u00a7ion=22)] In 2010 and 2011, Johnson & Johnson voluntarily recalled some [over-the-counter](/wiki/Over-the-counter) products, including Tylenol, due to an odor caused by tribromoanisole. [[137]](#cite_note-WebMd-137) [[138]](#cite_note-138) In this case, [2,4,6-tribromophenol](/wiki/2,4,6-tribromophenol) was used to treat wooden pallets on which product packaging materials were transported and stored. [[137]](#cite_note-WebMd-137) [ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Johnson_%26_Johnson&action=edit\u00a7ion=23)] In 2010 a group of [shareholders](/wiki/Shareholders) sued the board for allegedly failing to take action to prevent serious failings and illegalities since the 1990s, including manufacturing problems, bribing officials, covering up adverse effects and misleading marketing for unapproved uses. The judge initially dismissed the case in September 2011, but allowed the plaintiffs opportunity to refile at a later time. [[139]](#cite_note-139) In 2012 Johnson and Johnson proposed a settlement with the shareholders, whereby the company would institute new oversight, quality and compliance procedures binding for five years. [[140]](#cite_note-140) Illegal marketing of Risperdal[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Johnson_%26_Johnson&action=edit\u00a7ion=24)] Juries in several US states have found J&J guilty of concealing the [adverse effects](/wiki/Adverse_effects) of [Janssen Pharmaceuticals](/wiki/Janssen_Pharmaceuticals)' [antipsychotic](/wiki/Antipsychotic) medication [Risperdal](/wiki/Risperdal), produced by its unit, in order to promote it to doctors and patients as better than cheaper generics, and of falsely marketing it for treating patients with [dementia](/wiki/Dementia). [[141]](#cite_note-CNNMoney-141) States that have awarded damages [South Carolina](/wiki/South_Carolina) ($1.2 billion). [[142]](#cite_note-142) In 2010, the [United States Department of Justice](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice) joined a [whistleblowers](/wiki/Whistleblowers) suit accusing the company of illegally marketing Risperdal through [Omnicare](/wiki/Omnicare), the largest company supplying pharmaceuticals to nursing homes. [[143]](#cite_note-Hilzenrath-143) [[144]](#cite_note-144) The allegations include that J&J were warned by the FDA to not promote Risperdal as effective and safe for elderly patients, but they did so, and that they paid Omnicare to promote the drug to care home physicians. [[145]](#cite_note-145) The settlement was finalized on November 4, 2013, with J&J agreeing to pay a penalty of around $2.2 billion, \"including criminal fines and forfeiture totaling $485 million and civil settlements with the federal government and states totaling $1.72 billion\". [[146]](#cite_note-DOH2013-146) Johnson & Johnson has also been subject to congressional investigations related to payments given to [psychiatrists](/wiki/Psychiatrists) to promote its products and [ghost write](/wiki/Ghost_writer) articles, notably [Joseph Biederman](/wiki/Joseph_Biederman) and unit. [[147]](#cite_note-147) Foreign bribery[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Johnson_%26_Johnson&action=edit\u00a7ion=25)] In 2011, J&J settled litigation brought by the [US Securities and Exchange Commission](/wiki/US_Securities_and_Exchange_Commission) under the [Foreign Corrupt Practices Act](/wiki/Foreign_Corrupt_Practices_Act) and paid around $70M in disgorgement and fines. [[148]](#cite_note-148) J&J's employees had given kickbacks and bribes to doctors in Greece, Poland, and Romania to obtain business selling drugs and medical devices and had bribed officials in [Iraq](/wiki/Iraq) to win contracts under the Oil for Food program. [[149]](#cite_note-149) J&J fully cooperated with the investigation once the problems came to light. [[150]](#cite_note-FCPA2011-150) Consumer fraud settlements[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Johnson_%26_Johnson&action=edit\u00a7ion=26)] In May 2017, J&J reached an agreement to pay $33 million to several states to settle consumer fraud allegations in some of the company's over-the-counter drugs. [[151]](#cite_note-151) [[152]](#cite_note-152) [[153]](#cite_note-153) Use of the Red symbol[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Johnson_%26_Johnson&action=edit\u00a7ion=27)] Johnson & Johnson registered the [Red Cross](/wiki/Red_Cross) as a U.S. trademark for \"medicinal and surgical plasters\" in 1905 and has used the design since 1887. [[154]](#cite_note-154) The [Geneva Conventions](/wiki/Geneva_Conventions), which reserved the [Red Cross emblem](/wiki/Emblems_of_the_International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement#Red_Cross) for specific uses, were first approved in 1864 and ratified by the United States in 1882. However, the emblem was not protected by U.S. law for the use of the [American Red Cross](/wiki/American_Red_Cross) (ARC) and the U.S. military until after Johnson & Johnson had obtained its trademark. A clause in this law (now 18 U.S.C. 706) permits this pre-existing use of the Red Cross to continue. [[155]](#cite_note-155) [[156]](#cite_note-156) [[157]](#cite_note-157) A declaration made by the U.S. upon its ratification of the 1949 Geneva Conventions includes a [reservation](/wiki/Reservation_(law)) that pre-1905 U.S. domestic uses of the Red Cross, such as Johnson & Johnson's, would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on \"aircraft, vessels, vehicles, buildings or other structures, or upon the ground\", i.e., uses which could be confused with its military uses. [[158]](#cite_note-158) This means that the U.S. did not agree to any interpretation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions that would overrule Johnson & Johnson's trademark. The American Red Cross continues to recognize the validity of Johnson & Johnson's trademark. [[159]](#cite_note-159) In August 2007, Johnson & Johnson filed a lawsuit against the ARC, demanding that the charity halt the use of the red cross symbol on products it sells to the public, though the company takes no issue with the charity's use of the mark for nonprofit purposes. [[160]](#cite_note-160) In May 2008, the judge in the case dismissed most of Johnson & Johnson's claims, and a month later the two organizations announced a settlement had been reached in which both parties would continue to use the symbol. [[161]](#cite_note-161) Boston Scientific lawsuits[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Johnson_%26_Johnson&action=edit\u00a7ion=28)] Since 2003, Johnson & Johnson and [Boston Scientific](/wiki/Boston_Scientific) have both claimed that the other had infringed on their patents covering [heart stent](/wiki/Heart_stent) medical devices. The litigation was settled when Boston Scientific agreed to pay $716 million to Johnson & Johnson in September 2009 and an additional $1.73 billion in February 2010. [[162]](#cite_note-162) Their dispute was renewed in 2014, now on the grounds of a contract dispute. [[163]](#cite_note-163) Patent-infringement case against Abbott[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Johnson_%26_Johnson&action=edit\u00a7ion=29)] In 2007, Johnson & Johnson sued [Abbott Laboratories](/wiki/Abbott_Laboratories) over the development and sale of the arthritis drug [Humira](/wiki/Humira), claiming Abbott used technology licensed exclusively to Johnson & Johnson's [Centocor](/wiki/Centocor) division. Johnson & Johnson won the court case, and in 2009 Abbott was ordered to pay Johnson & Johnson $1.17 billion in lost revenues and $504 million in royalties. [[164]](#cite_note-Bloomberg2009-164) The judge also added $175.6 million in interest to bring the total to $1.84 billion. [[165]](#cite_note-bloomberg2010-165) This was the largest patent-infringement award in U.S. history [[164]](#cite_note-Bloomberg2009-164) until the 2013 decision against Teva in favor of [Takeda](/wiki/Takeda_Pharmaceutical_Company) and [Pfizer](/wiki/Pfizer) for over $2.1 billion. [[166]](#cite_note-WSJ2013-166) In 2010 Abbott appealed the verdict [[165]](#cite_note-bloomberg2010-165) and in 2011 won the appeal. [[167]](#cite_note-BusinessWeek2011-167) Vaginal mesh implants[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Johnson_%26_Johnson&action=edit\u00a7ion=30)] Tens of thousands of women worldwide have taken legal action against Johnson & Johnson after suffering serious complications following a vaginal mesh implant procedure. [[168]](#cite_note-cbsnews.com-168) In Australia, more than 700 women began a [class action](/wiki/Class_action) against the company in the [Federal Court of Australia](/wiki/Federal_Court_of_Australia) in 2017, telling the court they \"suffered irreparable, debilitating pain after the devices began to erode into surrounding tissue and organs, causing infections and complications\". The class action alleged that Johnson & Johnson, which \"aggressively marketed\" the implants \"failed to properly warn patients and surgeons of the risk, or test the devices adequately\". [[169]](#cite_note-169) Emails between executives show the company was aware of the risks in 2005 but still went ahead and made the product available. [[170]](#cite_note-170) In November 2019 the [Federal Court of Australia](/wiki/Federal_Court_of_Australia) found Johnson & Johnson negligent. [[171]](#cite_note-:2-171) The judgment was appealed, with the appeals court upholding all findings of Justice [Anna Katzman](/wiki/Anna_Katzmann). [[172]](#cite_note-172) Ethicon then sought a High Court decision but this was not permitted by the High Court of Australia. Subsequently (September 2022) a A$300,000,000 compensation agreement was reached between [Shine Lawyers](/wiki/Shine_Lawyers) and J&J but this agreement remains subject to approval by the Federal Court of Australia. [[171]](#cite_note-:2-171) In the US in 2016 the U.S. states of [California](/wiki/California) and [Washington](/wiki/Washington_(state)) filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing it of deception. [[168]](#cite_note-cbsnews.com-168) In October 2019, the company and its subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. reached a settlement with 41 states and the District of Columbia, with no admission of liability, in a suit alleging deceptive marketing of transvaginal surgical-mesh devices. The suit also alleges that the company failed to disclose risks associated with the product, which J&J pulled from the US market in 2012. The amount settled in the suit was about $117 million. [[173]](#cite_note-173) Baby powder[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Johnson_%26_Johnson&action=edit\u00a7ion=31)] J&J has been the subject of over 26,000 lawsuits claiming that its [baby powder](/wiki/Baby_powder) causes [ovarian cancer](/wiki/Ovarian_cancer). The lawsuits focus on [claims](/wiki/Talc#Association_with_asbestos) that the [talc](/wiki/Talc)-based powder is contaminated with [asbestos](/wiki/Asbestos), a known [carcinogen](/wiki/Carcinogen) commonly found in places where talc is mined. [[174]](#cite_note-:8-174) In 2016, J&J was ordered to pay $72 million in damages to the family of Jacqueline Fox, a 62-year-old woman who died of ovarian cancer in 2015. The company said it would appeal. [[175]](#cite_note-BBC-175) A year later, over 1,000 U.S. women had sued J&J for covering up the possible cancer risk from its Baby Powder product. The company says that 70% of its Baby Powder is used by adults. [[176]](#cite_note-176) Later that year, a California jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $417 million to a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer after using the company's talc-based products like Johnson's Baby Powder for [feminine hygiene](/wiki/Feminine_hygiene). The verdict included $70 million in compensatory damages and $347 million in punitive damages. J&J said they would appeal the verdict. [[177]](#cite_note-177) The [Missouri](/wiki/Missouri) Eastern District appeals court later negated a $72 million jury verdict in the Jacqueline Fox lawsuit, ruling it lacked jurisdiction in Missouri because of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that imposed limits on where injury lawsuit can be filed. Subsequently, this ruling killed three other recent St. Louis jury verdicts of more than $200 million combined. Fox, 62, of [Birmingham, Alabama](/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama), died in 2015, about four months before her trial was held in [St. Louis](/wiki/St._Louis) Circuit Court. She was among 65 plaintiffs, of whom only two were from Missouri. [[178]](#cite_note-178) A St. Louis jury awarded nearly $4.7 billion in damages to 22 women and their families in 2018 after they claimed that asbestos in Johnson & Johnson talcum powder caused their ovarian cancer. [[179]](#cite_note-179) In August, J&J said that it removed several chemicals from baby powder products and re-engineered them to make consumers more confident that products were safer for children. [[180]](#cite_note-180) The company was forced to release internal documents with 11,700 people suing J&J over cancers allegedly caused by baby powder. The documents showed that the company had known about asbestos contamination since at least as early as 1971 and had spent decades finding ways to conceal the evidence from the public. [[181]](#cite_note-181) The company lost its request to reverse a jury verdict that ruled in favor of the accusers, which required the company to pay $4.14 billion in punitive damages and $550 million in compensatory damages. [[182]](#cite_note-182) A large study performed in 2003 found that ovarian cancer risk increased from a baseline of 0.0121% to 0.0161% in people who reported regularly using talc in the genital area. Two more studies over the next twelve years, which also relied on [self-reporting](/wiki/Self-report), had similar results; however, none of the three studies showed a relationship between how long someone used talc and how much their cancer risk increased, which is expected in experiments with carcinogens and other toxic substances (see [dose-response relationship](/wiki/Dose%E2%80%93response_relationship)). [[183]](#cite_note-183) Conversely, a St. Louis jury ruled in favor of Johnson & Johnson in the case of a single plaintiff who had used the company's talc-containing baby powder for thirty years with a similar claim. [[184]](#cite_note-184) The company's CEO, Alex Gorsky, declined to appear at a United States congressional hearing on the safety of J&J's Baby Powder and other talc-based cosmetics. J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said that the subcommittee had rejected the company's offers to send a talc testing expert or a J&J executive in charge of consumer products. [[185]](#cite_note-185) In response to declining demand, J&J announced it would discontinue the sale of talc-based baby powder in the United States and Canada in 2020, but would continue to sell it in other markets. In a statement, the company said that the existing retail inventory of the talc-based powder will sell until it runs out, while the company's [cornstarch](/wiki/Corn_starch)-based baby powder will continue to sell in the United States and Canada. [[186]](#cite_note-186) The [Supreme Court of Missouri](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Missouri) refused to consider J&J's appeal of a $2.12 billion damages award to women who blamed their ovarian cancer on its talc-based products. [[187]](#cite_note-187) [[188]](#cite_note-188) The [Supreme Court of the United States](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States) also refused to consider an appeal from J&J, leaving in place a judgment from a state appeal court that had cut the original award to $2.1 billion. [[189]](#cite_note-189) Two of the justices had to recuse: [Samuel Alito](/wiki/Samuel_Alito) because either he and/or his wife owning or recently owning stock in J&J, and [Brett Kavanaugh](/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh), whose father led an industry group lobbying against safety warnings on talc products. Representing the affected women during the trial, [Mark Lanier](/wiki/W._Mark_Lanier) remarked that the Supreme Court's decision sent \"a clear message to the rich and powerful: You will be held to account when you cause grievous harm under our system of equal justice under law.\" [[190]](#cite_note-190) [[191]](#cite_note-191) J&J had argued that the combined claims in the St. Louis trial were too different, yet the short jury deliberation and identical payouts were, therefore, a violation of the company's due process and also that the high punitive award was unconstitutional. [[174]](#cite_note-:8-174) In 2021, Johnson & Johnson subsidiary LTL Management LLC, using a process called a [Texas divisional merger](/wiki/Texas_two-step_bankruptcy), filed for [Chapter 11 bankruptcy](/wiki/Chapter_11_bankruptcy) in [North Carolina](/wiki/North_Carolina). The process allowed by [Texas](/wiki/Texas) law lets a company create a separate subsidiary to take over liabilities, with the existing company operating normally. The new company, with a different name, can locate in a state such as North Carolina where bankruptcy laws are different, and then declare bankruptcy, paying less than the original company would have. In the case of LTL, a $2 billion trust will be created, compared to $25 billion if Johnson & Johnson had declared bankruptcy. According to the filing, a company known as Old JJCI took on the baby powder related liabilities in 1979, while Johnson & Johnson remained a defendant. LTL and New JJCI were created with LTL taking the baby powder related liabilities and some assets, and New JJCI taking the remaining assets. Johnson & Johnson says LTL is now based in [New Jersey](/wiki/New_Jersey). [[192]](#cite_note-192) [[193]](#cite_note-193) The company announced that it would stop making talc-based powder by 2023 and replace it with cornstarch-based powders. The company says the talc-based powder is safe to use and does not contain asbestos. [[194]](#cite_note-194) In 2023, the number of lawsuits regarding talc-based baby powder has exceeded 40,000 as more claimants come forward to say that the company's product caused them to have cancer. Johnson & Johnson have now reportedly offered $9 billion to settle all the lawsuits against the company, up from the previous figure of $2 billion. [[195]](#cite_note-195) Opioid epidemic[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Johnson_%26_Johnson&action=edit\u00a7ion=32)] By 2018, the company had become embroiled in the [opioid epidemic in the United States](/wiki/Opioid_epidemic_in_the_United_States) and had become a target of [lawsuits](/wiki/Lawsuit). [[196]](#cite_note-196) [[197]](#cite_note-197) Over 500 opioid-related cases have been filed as of May 2018 against J&J and its competitors. [[198]](#cite_note-198) In Idaho, J&J is part of a lawsuit accusing the company for being partially to blame for opioid-related overdose deaths. [[199]](#cite_note-199) The first major trial began in Oklahoma in May 2019. [[200]](#cite_note-200) On August 26, 2019, the Oklahoma judge ordered J&J to pay $572 million for their part in the opioid crisis, [[201]](#cite_note-201) and in October J&J paid $20.4 million to two Ohio counties fighting the opioid epidemic. [[202]](#cite_note-202) In January 2022, Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay up to $5 billion as part of a $26 billion settlement which included [McKesson](/wiki/McKesson_Corporation), [AmerisourceBergen](/wiki/AmerisourceBergen), and [Cardinal Health](/wiki/Cardinal_Health).

The settlement allows the company avoidance of a trial accusing J&J and many other pharmaceutical manufacturers of helping to spark the US opioid epidemic. The trial was thought to be an indicator for thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against many drug manufacturers. The arrangement, which contains no admission of liability by the company, provides the counties $10 million in cash, $5 million for legal expenses and $5.4 million in contributions to opioid-related nonprofit organizations in the counties.
