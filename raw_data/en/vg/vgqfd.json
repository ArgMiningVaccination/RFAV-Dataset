It is not just because of medical research that we are able to fight this deadly virus but several strategies and models have also been used in understanding and dissecting this virus. The vaccination drive began in January '21 and so far millions of people have received doses of covid-19 vaccines. Considering the exponential increase in the cases, the government has declared the third phase of vaccination drive where people above 18 years can get immunised against coronavirus. Amidst all the confusion regarding vaccination, we have gathered all the necessary information here. From the registration process to dos and don'ts, we have added everything here.
