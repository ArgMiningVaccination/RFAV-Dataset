He is also certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine(NCCAOM). He is a graduate of the prestigious Bastyr University in Seattle, Washington. Acupuncture involves the insertion of very thin gauge single-use sterile needles into specific energy points in the body. These are not your family doctor's painful flu-shots or insulin shots. They are generally painless in most areas of the body. In addition to the needles, Dr. Chang also employs other modalities including Auricular Medicine, Infrared heat lamp application, Cupping Technique, manual therapies, etc. that can also enhance and benefit the patient. The primary goal of acupuncture is to help the body heal itself but restoring the flow of Qi throughout the body. Our bodies are highly dynamic systems and nothing ever stands still. Injuries, chronic pain, stress, diet and our daily lives can all contribute to our bodies losing its balance and slowing down the flow of Qi. Acupuncture will help restore the optimal function of our bodies by freeing the flow of Qi. Dr. Chang is always happy to offer a free consultation for those interested in acupuncture.
