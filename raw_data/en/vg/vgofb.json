Farrell1*, James E. Truscott1,2and Roy M. Anderson1 Abstract Background: Systematic non-compliance to chemotherapeutic treatment among a portion of the eligible population is thought to be a major obstacle to the elimination of helminth infections by mass drug administration (MDA). MDA for helminths is repeated at defined intervals such as yearly or every 2 years, as a consequence of the inability of the human host to develop fully protective immunity to reinfection. As such, how an individual complies to these repeated rounds of MDA can have a significant impact on parasite transmission. The importance of this factor is poorly understood at present. Few epidemiological studies have examined longitudinal trends in compliance in the many communities in areas of endemic helminth infection that are undergoing MDA. Reducing systematic non-compliance will obviously increase the number of individuals treated, but it may also alter the dynamics of parasite transmission. Methods: Here we develop an individual-based stochastic model of helminth transmission and MDA treatment to investigate how different patterns of compliance influence the impact of MDA for two groups of helminths, the soil transmitted nematode infections and the schistosome parasites. We study the effect of several alternative treatment and compliance patterns on the dynamics of transmission. Results: We find that the impact of different compliance patterns, ranging from random treatment at each round of chemotherapy to systematic non-compliance by a proportion of the population, is very dependent on both transmission intensity in a defined setting and the type of infection that the treatment is targeted at. Systematic non-compliance has a greater impact on the potential for elimination of Schistosoma mansoni transmission by intensive MDA, than it does on Ascaris lumbricoides . Conclusions: We discuss the implications of our findings for the prioritisation of resources in MDA programmes and for monitoring and evaluation programme design. The key message generated by the analyses is that great care must be taken to record individual longitudinal patterns of compliance at each round of MDA as opposed to just recording overall coverage.

Parasites & Vectors (2017) 10:291 DOI 10.1186/s13071-017-2206-5Background Over the past decade the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) have become a major focus for research, both on new treatments and diagnostics and on the best method to reduce or eliminate parasite transmission by various interventions [1, 2]. Of these, parasitic infections by soil-transmitted blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma , are among the most common, with estimates of those harbouring STH infections ran- ging up to 2 billion individuals worldwide [3, 4]. STH infections are caused by a variety of intestinal nematode species. The most important are the will focus here on A. lumbricoides , the most common of these in humans [5]. Mild infections are often symptomless but heavier infec- tions may lead to serious morbidity including diarrhoea, and may cause or exacerbate nutritional deficiencies leading to reduced growth in children [6]. The disease schistosomiasis, caused by infection with the schisto- some parasites, is widespread primarily across sub-Sa- haran Africa, occurring also in the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean region, Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, affecting primarily rural communities in contact with contaminated water sources. Heavy in- fections with this parasite can cause serious morbidity and even mortality [7]. Though both Schistosoma man- soni and Schistosoma haematobium are widespread in humans, we focus on intestinal schistosomiasis through S. mansoni infection in comparison with the intestinal helminth A. lumbricoides . Current WHO guidelines aim to eliminate STH as a public health problem in children by 2020 through a focus on preschool-aged children (pre-SAC, 2 -4 year olds) and school-aged children (SAC, 5 -14 year olds) though mass drug administration (MDA) of albendazole or mebendazole at a coverage of at least 75% of both preschool and school-aged children [6] . Similarly, the WHO goals for schistosomiasis are to control morbidity through an MDA treatment regime in affected areas covering at least 75% of school-aged children by 2020, as well as at risk adults, with an eventual goal of elimin- ation as a public health problem by 2025 [7]. If MDA is aimed at elimination the transmission of helminth infection in defined settings, sufficient treat- ment coverage and frequent treatment are essential as outlined in a series of recent publications [8 -13]. There are a number of potential social, logistical and technical challenges in achieving high coverage [14, 15]. A large gap can exist between the proportion of the population actually participating in MDA (having actually taken the relevant drug), and the coverage reported by government or international agencies [16]. Reasons for non-compliance(for the definitions of compliance and coverage as used here, see below) can vary very widely even within the same treatment programme, for the same infection, within the same country [17]. These might include access issues, programme fatigue for longer-running treatment programmes, whether the drug distributers are personally known to the local populati on, and education of the population to causes of disease and the benefits of MDA [16-18]. MDA programmes that are designed to account for those social and behavioural factors that act to reduce compliance to treatment, can greatly improve treatment coverage [18]. Treatment coverage and compliance figures are com- monly aggregated on a village-wide level or other admin- istrative units, and may hide substantial variation in the numbers of treatments taken by individuals during an MDA programme [16]. Very few studies have included individual treatment data with a longitudinal component to cover what happens at each round of drug adminis- tration. There have been increasing efforts to ascertain a picture of compliance with STH treatment that reflects individual compliance over time in addition to simple measures of overall coverage, with two major studies in progress or upcoming that will include longitudinal measurement of compliance [19, 20]. Individuals who systematically do not adhere to treat- ment, over a number of treatment rounds, which we term systematic non-compliance , may provide an import- ant reservoir to sustain reinfection in the population. The effect of systematic non-compliance on transmis- sion has not so far been directly investigated for the major helminth infections of humans [16]. Systematic non-compliance is clearly an issue in terms of prevent- ing individual morbidity. Moreover, any non-compliance is a programmatic issue which determines the popula- tion level impact of an MDA intervention. The importance of the more subtle effects of compli- ance on the transmission dynamics of helminth parasites is less clear. For example, in the absence of variation in coverage, what effect does systematic non-compliance have on the difficulty of transmission elimination by MDA? An answer to this question would help guide the allocation of resources within international parasite elim- ination attempts. In a defined transmission intensity set- ting is it necessary to maximise coverage by any means available, or is the best approach to focus most attention on reaching regularly untreated members of a community in an effort to reduce any reservoir-of-infection effect? Here, we present a quantitative framework for asses- sing of the importance of compliance patterns in elimin- ating transmission. Rather than \"elimination as a public health problem \"we consider scenarios in which complete elimination of the parasite from a small com- munity is the goal and analyse the likelihood of success.Farrell et al. Parasites & Vectors (2017) 10:291 Page 2 of 12We undertake a computational analysis of the impact of compliance pattern and systematic non-compliance in communities with defined intrinsic transmission inten- sities and treatment patterns, in which either Ascaris lumbricoides orSchistosoma mansoni parasites are endemic. By focusing on a pair of disease and treatment settings we provide a snapshot of the variability of com- pliance impact as well as considering the predicted im- pact on disease elimination in these particular settings. In published mathematical models of transmission dynamics and MDA a common assumption is that treat- ment is administered at random to the population at each round, but with a defined proportion of the popula- tion receiving treatment at each round [21]. Plaisier et al., in a paper based on an individual based simulation model [22], argue that attendance patterns under randomly-allocated treatment do not adequately reflect actual attendance in real world situations, as individuals may well participate in treatment irregularly. This study does not directly compare simulation results under alter- native attendance patterns. To address this gap we make comparisons between a proposed alternative model of attendance pattern and random attendance in both dis- eases, using a well-defined individual based stochastic model which incorporates the known population biology of the parasites. Efforts to assess and improve models of realistic treatment patterns are ongoing [23]. Methods Models of helminth transmission An individual based stochastic model framework allows for heterogeneity at the individual level and tracking of individual behaviour which influence both exposure to infection and compliance to treatment. The model builds on the framework described in an earlier publica- tion by Anderson & Medley [24]. Much recent work on the impact of MDA on helminth infections has focussed on the predictions of a hybrid deterministic partial dif- ferential equation-based model, describing changes in mean worm burden age profile in the human population over time [11, 24], which permits the calculation of treatment coverage levels that will eliminate parasite transmission. These models include probabilistic ele- ments (in terms of a distribution of parasite numbers per host of negative binomial form, with fixed aggrega- tion parameter k), density dependence in fecundity and sexual mating for the dioecious parasites (assumption of polygamy for STH and monogamy for schistosomes). As noted earlier, these models assume that for a defined level of coverage, treatment is at random at each round, and with a constant probability. The deterministic and stochastic models share a num- ber of common features. In brief, due to generally strong age dependence in observed helminth infectionintensities both models account for age-specific contact rates. Specifically, the transmission parameter repre- sents factors including time spent in contact with infec- tious material or degree of personal protection from infection that vary with age (e.g. use of sandals). Of particular importance is the presence of density- dependent egg production controlled by the parameter : Increasing numbers of worms lead to a reduction in per-- female egg output, which is the key limiting factor to over- all parasite population. A second density-dependent effect, the worms 'sexual reproduction, leads to a predicted breakpoint in trans- mission dynamics [25, 26]. Where numbers of worms are low, the likelihood of both sexes being present in a host drops, leading to either loss of egg production or the production of unfertilised eggs, depending on spe- cies. This means that below a certain context-dependent threshold, the parasite population cannot sustain itself and collapses toward extinction without further inter- vention. This effect is highly dependent on the degree of worm aggregation across hosts and is of particular im- portance in the context of regular MDA and parasite elimination [21, 24]. Reproduction may be either monogamous or polygam- ous. The soil-transmitted helminths are thought to be polygamous and the schistosomes are thought to pair for life, and hence are monogamous. Hard evidence in either case is very limited. Fertile eggs produced contrib- ute to a single environmental reservoir of infection, sym- bolising infectious material across a village, single water source or similar local area. In the absence of directly observed data on age-specific contribution to the infec- tious reservoir, we assume contribution rates are equal to age-specific contact rates. Treatment is by periodic MDA, and has an immediate impact in reducing worm burden. Evidence for possible host immune responses to infection as a consequence of past exposure is limited at present and is not modelled ex- plicitly. Many immunological responses to infection can be observed in terms of antibody and cellular responses to parasite antigens but these do not create and effective ac- quired immunity. However, in the stochastic model gen- etic/behavioural differences between individual hosts are included in host predisposition to infection, as described below. Individual-based stochastic model The stochastic model used throughout the analyses pre- sented in this paper incorporates a number of additional features over those described above. Hosts are modelled individually with their own burden of male and female worms. The acquisition and deaths of individual worms in individual hosts are modelled as distinct events, as are births and deaths within the host population.Farrell et al. Parasites & Vectors (2017) 10:291 Page 3 of 12The basic behaviour and basic outputs of the two models are roughly equivalent; quantification of the dy- namics over time of helminth transmission and predic- tions on elimination, impact of control measures and so on. The benefit of the individual-based stochastic ap- proach is that a number of additional features may be implemented which are difficult or impossible to pro- duce otherwise. Different compliance settings for in- stance may be modelled using a deterministic model but require additional compartments, an approach that quickly becomes unmanageably complex. A stochastic approach allows us to quantify the degree of variability in predicted outcomes, in particular the probability of disease elimination rather than a binary success/failure prediction when using a deterministic framework. In addition this individual-based approach allows us to view details that are impossible to visualise employing a deterministic approach. An example of the time trajec- tories of parasite burden in 5 individual people within a stochastic simulation is shown as an illustrative example in Fig. 1. Note how individual trajectories vary widely from the mean behaviour. Worm burden data shows that worms are not distrib- uted evenly or randomly (Poisson) through the host population and instead tend to be aggregated more highly in some individuals than others [27, 28]. To ac- count for differential exposure to infection due to a range of possible host genetic, immunological, behav- ioural, social or environmental factors, individuals are assigned a personal predisposition index to infection, drawn from at random from a gamma distribution at birth with shape parameter [21, 25]. Given worm death rates that are constant over time, and the Poisson distribution of infection events, the distribution ofworms that arises across the host population is a nega- tive binomial in form due to the compounding of Poisson distributions in individuals with means distrib- uted in a gamma form. This overall distribution of para- site numbers per host matches observed parasite aggregation data well [28]. Note however, that the aggre- gation parameter, k, of the negative binomial will vary over time as the mean burden and the prevalence change due to chance events in the acquisition and loss of parasites and births and deaths of the human host. In other words, the value of kis dynamic. It also varies across the age classes due to their differing age dependent infection rates as described above. Egg produced contribute to an environmental reservoir of infection. Individuals contribute to the pool of infection according to their female worm burden, subject to the presence of males, at a rate in accordance with their age- specific contact rate. Because parameters describing the detailed reproductive steps (e.g. for reproduction via snail vectors in the case of schistosomiasis) are of poor quality or missing entirely we retain a straightforward determinis- tic model for the environmental reservoir. As before, a breakpoint due to sexual reproduction is present in the transmission dynamics with two stable states, endemic infection or parasite extinction, sepa- rated by an unstable equilibrium. In this case, the en- demic state is subject to considerable stochastic variation over time. The same variability, when close to the breakpoint, introduces an additional uncertainty into the dynamics in this region (Fig. 2). To take account of such effects, we run a large num- ber of repeat simulations (one thousand repeats) using identical parameters. Most of the results presented here are derived from the mean across repeats, allowing Fig. 1 An illustrative selection of worm burdens over time in five individuals set against the mean worm burden in the human population. X-axis : year of simulation. Y-axis : the number of parasites per individual host. Part of the population is treated and benefits immediately while untreated individuals benefit over time via 'herd effects 'through natural worm mortality as infectious material in the environment is reduced. Four children are born in year five and are eligible for treatment. Three are treated under a semi-systematic treatment setting, and attend most treatments. One systematically does not comply with treatment. One adult is ineligible and does not receive treatment. Treatments are annual with eight rounds from year 10 onwards (parameter values as defined in Table 2)Farrell et al. Parasites & Vectors (2017) 10:291 Page 4 of 12quantification of the overall behaviour while still ac- counting for stochastic (= chance) effects producing a range of outcomes. Probabilities of elimination under the specified conditions are equal to the proportion of repeats which result in extinction of both parasites and infectious material in the long term within the defined habitat. While treatment in the deterministic model necessarily combines drug efficacy and treatment coverage, an individual-based model can separate these factors. Drug efficacy is given a single value describing the probability of worm mortality as a result of treatment. The stochastic simulations are event-driven. At any given time point, the time step to the next event is ran- domly drawn from an exponential distribution with the parameter of the exponent given by the rate at which an event occurs. These rates are defined in Table 1. The population biology parameters employed in the simulations described in the results section are as defined in Table 2 for both Ascaris lumbricoides and Schistosoma mansoni. These derive from field epidemiological in India lumbricoides ) and Kenya ( S. mansoni ). Themethods used to obtain these estimates are described in [11] and [10]. Treatment and compliance The model permits tailoring of individual treatment over multiple rounds of administration. Here treatment refers to treated age groups as well as a compliance pattern. We consider three types of compliance patterns: random compliance , in which the attending individuals are se- lected randomly at each treatment round; systematic non-compliance , in which individuals are assigned a life- long \"complier \"or\"non-complier \"status and thus either attend all treatments or none; and semi-systematic com- pliance as an intermediary between the two previous patterns. Under a semi-systematic compliance setting individ- uals each attend treatment according to a lifetime pro- pensity to comply with treatment - capturing the effect of a range of personal and sociological factors, such as family circumstance or physical difficulty of access to treatment. We follow a formulation by Plaisier and col- leagues [22] (see also Additional file 1: Figure S1). Each Fig. 2 An illustration of five simulation repeats, showing stochastic variability and the impact of treatment. X-axis: year of simulation.

At each treatment, the individual 's probability of at- tending is ai(1-C)/C, where Cis the overall coverage. A property of this formulation is that at each treatment the average likelihood of attending across the eligible popu- lation is equal to Cand so overall coverage is consistent between treatment scenarios. We assume that both of the parasites investigated will be treated according to disease-specific WHO guidelines. Coverage to account for schistosomiasis treatment of \"at risk \"adults is not specified by WHO and is here set at 30%, following deterministic predictions of what level of adult coverage may result in interrupting parasite trans- mission for the defined intrinsic level of transmission in the community (the value of R 0in Table 2). Rather than covering every possible situation we thereby produce several alternative scenarios in order to investigate the variety of impacts that compliance and systematic non- compliance may have. A note on terminology The use and meaning of the terms compliance ,coverage and elimination varies in the published epidemiological literature [16], and these terms may be used differently in different country treatment guidelines. Unless stated otherwise, definitions applied here are as follows; Coverage : the proportion of the whole eligible popula- tion that actually receives treatment at a given treatment round. This definition is sometimes referred to else- where as compliance to distinguish between treatment being allocated and actually being taken. It is of funda- mental importance that \"true \"coverage is measured ac- curately in treatment programmes. However, there is no need for a distinction in our computational model of transmission. Systematic non-compliance : a proportion of the population remains untreated across consecutive treat- ment rounds. For modelling purposes, we do notdistinguish between the reasons treatment was not taken by any individual. Elimination : the WHO 's guidelines on STH and schistosomiasis make reference to elimination as a pub- lic health problem . This requires only highly effective control and is not the same as disease elimination in the formal sense of having reduced transmission of disease to zero in a specific area [29]. Though we use the WHO 's guidelines on treatment in our modelling, elim- ination in our context is in the more rigorous sense, breaking transmission without reoccurrence of infection in simulated settings. Results Impact of systematic non-compliance The simulations well illustrate the view that individuals who systematically do not comply with MDA treatment over a number of years, may provide a reservoir of infec- tion in the population. However, while systematic non- compliance may be an issue in individual morbidity where infections go untreated, and equally clearly non- compliance is a programmatic issue insofar as achievable coverage is reduced, it does not necessarily follow that systematic non-compliance will substantially interfere with elimination efforts through its impact on transmis- sion dynamics alone if coverage is well above the level required to break transmission as predicted by determin- istic models. Focusing on the WHO targets for treatment of 75% coverage for eligible children, we examine a worst case scenario in which one portion of the population is treated at each round, and another comprises systematically non- complying individuals who never receive treatment. The results are presented in Fig. 3 for Ascaris and in Fig. 4 for S. mansoni as the probability of the interrup- tion of transmission and parasite elimination after vari- ous rounds of treatment at a fixed coverage levels for random and systematic non-compliance. The different parasites exhibit different responses when the non-com- pliance scenario is compared with random treatment, InTable 2 Parameter definitions and values. andare stated across the age groups 0 -2, 2 -5, 5 -15, 15 -70+.

Parasites & Vectors (2017) 10:291 Page 6 of 12the case of Ascaris the negative impact is notable but perhaps modest. The simulations based on the stochastic models suggest that breaking transmission is still pos- sible in a reasonable time-frame, requiring only a modest increase in the number of rounds (Fig. 3). For example, after 10 rounds of treatment the probability of elimin- ation is roughly 90% in the case of random treatment at each round, while for systematic non-compliance it is just of 50% for the identical number of rounds of treat- ment. Given that this an extreme non-compliance set- ting - 25% of the population never attends - it would seem that the impact on transmission dynamics of any reservoir-of-infection effect on the chances of elimin- ation within a local area given a well-mixed population (any one person spreads infective stages throughout thepopulation 's habitat) is relatively limited. In part this is related to the magnitude of R 0(it is a moderate trans- mission intensity with a value of 2.12), and in part the short lifespan of the parasite in humans (1 year) reduces the impact of non-compliers providing a reservoir of infection. In contrast as shown in Fig. 4, in an S. mansoni -en- demic area, the impact of the same systematic compli- ance pattern is far greater, with elimination essentially not achievable even after 20 rounds of annual treatment. Note that this results even when the magnitude of R 0 places this example in a low transmission setting with R0= 1.55 (Table 2). Although a number of factors determine the differ- ences in transmission dynamics between species,Fig. 3 The dependence of probability of elimination of A. lumbricoides on the number of annual treatment rounds.

Parameter values as defined in Table 2Farrell et al. Parasites & Vectors (2017) 10:291 Page 7 of 12parasite lifespan is a very strong influence in the differ- ential effect of systematic non-compliance. For example, it has a major influence on the 'bounce back 'time post cessation of MDA, with longer lifespan parasites boun- cing back more slowly [21]. In the context of compliance to treatment long parasite lifespan would allow for a longer-lasting reservoir of infection in systematically non-complying sections of the population. It is difficult to isolate the effect of parasite lifespan within models of parasite transmission dynamics because of its central role in determining the magnitude of the basic repro- ductive number, R 0. Reproductively mature adult worm lifespan lies in the numerator (the death rate is in the denominator) of R 0, and hence without adjusting other parameter values, such as the infection rate, . The results presented in Fig. 4 for S. mansoni serve to illustrate how important individual compliance over se- quential rounds of treatment is to determining the im- pact of MDA, as opposed to simple measures of coverage as commonly recorded by government health departments in endemic regions. Impact of partial non-compliance to treatment There have been a few published studies that attempt to ascertain a picture of patterns of individual compli- ance to MDA in a longitudinal context [16]. As out- lined in the methods section Plaisier and colleagues [22] discuss a formulation for a compliance pattern - termed semi-systematic compliance - which takes into account the personal propensity of individual mem- bers of a population to attend successive MDA treat- ment rounds [22]. We compare this formulation to an assumption of randomly-allocated treatment with no personal propensity to non-compliance. As illus- trated in Figs. 5 ( Ascaris )a n d6( S. mansoni )b yreference to the probability of elimination post a given number of rounds of treatment at the WHO target level of 75% coverage for Pre-SAC and SAC, the size of the effect of compliance pattern on the probability of elimination depends strongly on the type of infection being targeted by MDA. While the duration of treatment required to eliminate Ascaris is nearly identical under both compliance patterns, elim- ination of S. mansoni requires a considerably longer treatment programme under a semi-systematic com- pliance pattern. However, note that elimination of As- caris is possible for a partial non-compliance pattern after many rounds of treatment. Indirect benefits of MDA programmes for non-compliers Systematically non-complying members of the popula- tion will still benefit from decreases in population-wide infection burden (in a population exposed to a single pool of infectious material), due to the reduction in the pool of infectious material due to treatment in the com- pliers. Reductions in egg production in the treated popu- lation are sufficient to reduce rates of infection in all individuals (Fig. 7) over time. These 'indirect benefits ' are realised at a pace that is surprisingly rapid as illus- trated in Fig. 7 for Ascaris and Fig. 8 for S. mansoni . These figures record both the mean worm burden per host and the proportion of untreated (pre-SAC and SAC) children suffering from a high parasite burden at the start of MDA. This latter variable roughly declines by 50% over the first 18 months of treatment and 50% again over the following 18 months (Figs. 7 and 8). Discussion Systematic non-compliance to MDA treatment to con- trol helminth infections may be important in some Fig. 5 The dependence of probability of elimination of A. lumbricoides on the number of annual treatment rounds. X-axis : the number of treatment rounds. Y-axis : the proportion of 1000 repeats in which elimination is achieved, in a random treatment scenario (all individuals treated at random, 75% pre-SAC and SAC coverage) and a semi-systematic treatment scenario (individuals attend according to a personal propensity, 75% pre-SAC and SAC coverage). Parameter values as defined in Table 2Farrell et al. Parasites & Vectors (2017) 10:291 Page 8 of 12circumstances and for specific types of infection. Clearly, non-compliance is an important factor to be addressed in efforts to increase treatment coverage especially if in the coming years health policy targets shift from mor- bidity control to transmission elimination. However, the impact of attendance patterns, rather than simple cover- age, is poorly understood in many health policy circles. A key question is should the priority be placed on reach- ing all members of a community, or simply on maximis- ing coverage regardless of who is treated? The simulation results reported in this paper begin to pro- vide a template for answering this important question.Our findings indicate that the answer is conditional on the helminth infection being targeted and on the underlying transmission intensity in a defined location. MDA aimed at A. lumbricoides elimination would likely benefit much less from the direct targeting of systematically non-complying in- dividuals than is the case for treatment programmes for S. mansoni infection. In the former case the same resources w o u l db eb e t t e rf o c u s s e do ni n c r e a s i n gc o v e r a g eb yw h a t e v e r means available. Conversely it seems clear that reaching as many untreated individuals as possible should be made a particularly high policy priority when the aim is S. mansoni elimination. In both the parasites examined in our simulationFig. 6 The dependence of probability of elimination of S. mansoni on the number of annual treatment rounds. X-axis : the number of treatment rounds.

The definition of high parasite burden is given in [32]Farrell et al. Parasites & Vectors (2017) 10:291 Page 9 of 12scenarios, adult parasite lifespan is a key consideration. For long lifespans, non-compliers output infective stages into the environment for long periods. This is the case for schisto- somes and importantly for the filarial worms which may have lifespans of around 10 years [21]. Within the soil transmitted nematode species the life- spans of Ascaris and Trichuris are relatively short, esti- mated at around 1-2 years and 2-3 years respectively [30], while that of the two hookworm species are estimated variously at around 1 -3 years ( Ancylostoma duodenale ), 3 -10 years ( to as much as 18 years [31]. This would suggest for this group of helminths, systematic non-compliance is of greater im- portance for hookworm than the other species. The optimum route to transmission elimination may therefore vary between helminth species, even within the soil-transmitted helminths, depending on the degree of non-compliance and the prevailing transmission in- tensity in a given location. This will be crucial in decid- ing whether systematic non-compliance is a problem substantial enough to warrant specific action in elimin- ation efforts for particular helminth infections, as opposed to simply trying to increase overall coverage and compliance. If transmission intensity is high, high coverage will be required over many years to move to- wards transmission elimination. In practice, it is generally very difficult to identify indi- vidual non-compliers on the ground without detailed studies in monitoring and evaluation programmes that have a longitudinal component following individual be- haviour at each round of MDA. In general the major de- terrent to detailed longitudinal studies is cost. Even where it is known that an individual has repeatedly missed an- nual treatment, successive visits by distributors to ensure treatment will often be prohibitively time-consuming and hence costly. A broader rather than targeted strategy ofmaximising coverage may be more appropriate depending on the parasitic infection and local circumstances. From an epidemiological research perspective, it is surprising that so few longitudinal studies of compliance of individuals to treatment in MDA programmes, whether for STH, schistosomes, lymphatic filariasis or onchocerciasis, have been undertaken [16]. In order to better model the impact of non-compliance and thus better inform the design of treatment and monitoring and evaluation programmes, a more detailed under- standing of who is treated in MDA programmes, and when, is essential. Here we have made necessary as- sumptions on the treatment pattern, and in the absence of good data examined three simple scenarios; namely, all individuals are either always treated or always un- treated, all individuals may be treated with a personal propensity to attend, and all individuals are treated at random. In reality, some proportion of individuals or groups of individuals might remain entirely untreated while the remaining population might be treated in a pattern somewhat akin to a personal attendance propen- sity. As well illustrated by our analyses, which pattern prevails in a given setting matters, especially for long lived helminth species. This in turns relates to how we interpret the observed pattern of MDA impact. High coverage may be recorded but if systematic non-compliance prevails in a significant proportion of children, impact on reinfection rates may be limited. Future monitoring and evaluation pro- grammes must pay greater attention to recording not only overall coverage, but also the proportion of people who take treatment at each round it is offered. Conclusions We have described a stochastic individual based model for helminth transmission and MDA treatment. OverallFig. 8 Grouped mean parasite burdens in an S. mansoni -endemic area.

Parameter values as defined in Table 2Farrell et al. Parasites & Vectors (2017) 10:291 Page 10 of 12conclusions from this model on elimination time required (rounds of MDA) at various levels of coverage in eligible children are in excellent agreement with earlier findings derived from age structured deterministic models based on sets of partial differential equations [10, 11]. The sto- chastic models, however, provide considerably greater scope for the inclusion of individual variation between people in exposure to infection and compliance to treat- ment. They provide a powerful tool for exploring the im- pact of treatment patterns on how well MDA controls both morbidity and transmission. Future collection of full individual-level compliance data longitudinally over mul- tiple treatment rounds could be used to inform more de- tailed country- or region-specific models and provide more detailed guidance on optimum treatment.
