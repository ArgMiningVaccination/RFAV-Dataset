We offer telehealth, in office talk therapy, Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP) and wellness group services. Psychological approaches paired with body healing such as guided meditation and deep breathing allows for transformational healing. We practice from a place of authentic connection and meet each client in their present reality. We act as the bridge between hope and change. Presence of Mind Therapy combines clinical approaches such as CBT and Psychodynamic approaches with alternative healing modalities such as meditation and mantra. Individuals are not inherently flawed, but instead part of larger systems that need healing. We can help you reduce anxiety, improve mood, strengthen relationships and improve self-confidence. Spiritual exploration offers a sense of connection to a power greater such as Nature, the Universe, Source and Self. Spirituality can improve feelings of safety, protection, connectedness and love. Every human deserves to feel these things. Spiritual work can also improve self-worth and connection to one's identity. The connection between mind and body is integral to healing. We store emotional pain and trauma in our bodies and replay old tapes all the time. Using clinical theory such as Polyvagal as well as ancient technologies such as chakra work and meditation we can help you re-learn how to feel and heal. Within our safe spaces you will develop trust with your therapist at a pace that feels comfortable. Once the therapeutic relationship has been established your therapist will begin to explore the many layers that are uniquely you. You will be informed and guided as you reframe issues to better align with the life and identity that you desire. Pairing evidenced-based treatment strategies with spiritual approaches, you will gain clarity around the past, grow mindfulness and gratitude for the present, and feel empowered to design your future.
