Description of Integrative Therapy Modalities Experience CranioSacral Therapy CranioSacral Therapy is a light touch, whole-body assessment and treatment protocol developed by Dr. John E. Upledger, DO, OMM as an effective method to support and nourish the central nervous and fascial systems for the purpose of improving overall health and well-being. CranioSacral Therapy is a complementary method of hands-on-bodywork which works with supporting and rejuvenating the body's natural biological systems and unique rhythms by evaluating and addressing imbalances at the source. CranioSacral Therapy has been found effective in rebalancing, improving body systems functions and experiencing positive health results and outcomes. Because CranioSacral therapy is supportive in relaxing and restoration, it is an effective treatment for many health conditions. Examples of health issues which benefit from CranioSacral therapy include chronic stress, pain and injury management, anxiety/depression, ADD/ADHD, learning disabilities, immune system support and other chronic health conditions. Evidence based studies show CranioSacral Therapy can make a positive impact and improve the quality of daily lives.
