New Tdap School Law Signed by Governor On September 29th, during California's worst pertussis epidemic in more than 60 years, Governor Schwarzenegger signed AB 354 Chapter 434, 2010 requiring Tdap booster vaccination for California students. Under the new law, all 7th12th grade students in school year 201112 will need to have received a dose of Tdap before starting classes. In subsequent years, the requirement will apply only to 7th graders. The law is a welcome tool in preventing future outbreaks of pertussis in California. CDPH sent out an Early Alert to Providers and an Early Alert to Schools on September 30. The alerts emphasize that all children 10 years and older should receive a dose of Tdap, if they haven't already, to get protection against pertussis disease and meet the future school requirement. Over the coming months, CDPH will offer communication guidance, templates, and technical assistance to help health care providers, school personnel, and parents meet the new requirements. Initial materials include Frequently Asked Questions for schools and parents , phone script templates for schools and providers, and educational flyers. Branch staff are developing forms and State regulations to assist schools with new documentation requirements. Stay tuned for details on a December 8th webinar for school nurses and school personnel. More informing activities will kick off during Preteen Vaccine Week February 1319. To keep current on informing materials, visit the Immunization Branch's School Requirements page or the EZIZ website . 1 CAIR News CAIR Surviving State Budget Cuts The State budget announced in late October has resulted in the loss of over half of the annual budget for the California Immunization Registry (CAIR).

It's Time to Start Planning NIIW/TIM 2011 National Infant Immunization Week (NIIW) in April and Toddler Immunization Month (May) are annual observances in California. They serve as opportunities to hold events and capture media attention highlighting the importance of infant and toddler immunizations. Local Health Departments, coalitions and community groups have successfully collaborated each year to host creative events and activities. California's high number of pertussis hospitalizations and deaths in 2010 disproportionally affected infants. The 2011 NIIW/TIM campaign will be an especially important time to encourage infant and toddler immunizations. The first 2011 NIIW/TIM planning call will be Wednesday, December 1st at 2:00pm . Contact Jenny.Bare@cdph.ca.gov to be added to the meeting notification list. IZ Branch News and Honors Vaccination Week is Going Global National Infant Immunization Week (NIIW) is going global. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that, in 2010, 113 countries in the Americas, Europe, and Eastern Mediterranean held Vaccination Week activities. In 2011 the WHO Africa Region, with almost 50 countries, will join the movement...with some help from Immunization Branch staff! Last September, WHO and Ministry of Health staff from more than a dozen African countries, representatives from the US, PAHO, WHO/EURO, and WHO/EMRO met in Accra, Ghana to strategize roll out of \"Vaccination Week\" throughout Africa. Suzi Bouveron, Immunization Branch Health Educator, and Michelle Basket, CDC Communications Specialist shared their experiences with planning NIIW/Vaccination Week in the Americas (VWA) in the US and on the US/Mexico border. The twoday workshop focused on a strategic framework to assist African countries in starting their Vaccination Week observances. Most importantly, participating countries began pooling resources and coordinating efforts to create synergy. Participants returned to their countries armed with tools and resources they will use to plan and launch activities. The Immunization Branch is proud to have been able to share expertise with international colleagues in planning this historic public health initiative. For 2011, California immunization advocates can truly \"think global\" as they plan innovative local NIIW activities that, if successful, could be adopted worldwide. 4 NPHIC Awards: California Brings Home Gold, Sliver, and Bronze And the winner is...California!

Local Spotlight San Diego IZ Coalition's Community Parent Forums How can public health advocates engage parents with concerns about immunization? In a friendly group setting! Since 2008, the San Diego Immunization Coalition (SDIC) has pioneered a \"forum\" that brings parents and experts together to discuss immunization questions and misconceptions in a respectful dialogue\u2014an alternative to solo research on the Internet. The events have been held in a variety of locations to better reach diverse audiences, including parents of autistic children. 5 To develop this program, SDIC worked with two exceptional local speakers: infectious disease specialist and pediatrician, Dr. Mark Sawyer, and acclaimed autism researcher Dr. Eric Courchesne. Event organizers emphasize that speakers' empathy for parents is equally as important as their expertise for connecting with their audience. In September 2010, SDIC held its sixth forum in El Cajon where 60 parents packed the local community center. Onsite child care made it easier for busy parents to attend. New this time was outreach to the local Arab population and provision of simultaneous Arabic translation. Previous events have offered Spanish translation and Somali translation, sometimes purchased, sometimes donated. SDIC staff shared their model at the National Conference on Immunization and Health (NCIH) in Chicago earlier this year. Trend evaluations indicate that some parents have a more favorable attitude towards immunizations after participating in a forum. The program is designed to be adaptable and replicable. How can a local coalition establish their own parent forum series? The California Immunization Coalition has just released Answering Vaccine Questions at Community Parent Forums: A HowTo Guide , which addresses tips for locating expert speakers, finding a location, cultivating community partners, and templates for promoting and evaluating the event. The Immunization Branch applauds this model program and encourages its use in California. For more information, contact Tania.Farley@sdcounty.ca.gov or Tammy.Pilisuk@cdph.ca.gov . Fresno County's Pertussis Epidemic Response Local health departments bear primary responsibility for monitoring vaccine preventable disease in California. This year, as of November 2, Fresno had reported 505 pertussis cases, including an infant who died, with other cases still under investigation. Here, Fresno County Public Health Department (FCPHD) staff describe their response. Routine county surveillance activities identified an increase in confirmed pertussis cases between January 1 through April 7, 2010. FCPHD officials reacted quickly, sending out a news release that encouraged the public to get immunized against pertussis if immunizations were not uptodate. The Department also provided detailed guidance to school districts, medical professionals, clinics, and hospitals. FCPHD staff fielded a steady stream of media inquiries. On July 23, New America Media held one of three statewide Pertussis Roundtable events in Fresno. The event attracted all major local television, radio, and print outlets. Dr. Edward L. Moreno, FCPHD Director and Health Officer, and Dr. Juan Ruiz from CDPH gave presentations, which became key resources for the media. Pertussis became the leading news story, with FPHD staff interviewed 22 times in English, Spanish, and Hmong. FCDPH staff took full advantage of the Tdap Expansion Program to conduct eight Tdap clinics, coordinated by a massvaccinator. Those clinics alone have provided nearly 500 doses to date\u2014about onesixth of those given by FCHPD this year. Three more Tdap clinics are planned before the end of 2010. Fresno's experience highlights the critical roles of communication, partnership, and coordination. The Immunization Branch thanks the FCPHD for sharing their strategies and insights.

Adolescents \u0083 Tdap may be administered regardless of interval after the last tetanus or diphtheria containing vaccine. This is now consistent with our CDPH July 2010 Pertussis Recommendations. \u0083 ACIP continues to recommend routine adolescent immunizations at age 11 to 12 years of age. Seniors \u0083 Adults age 65 and older who have, or anticipate, close contact with an infant <12 months of age (e.g., grandparents, greatgrandparents, child care providers, and health care workers) are recommended to receive a single dose of Tdap. \u0083 Adults age 65 and older may be given a single dose of Tdap vaccine in place of a tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine, for those who have not previously received Tdap. UnderVaccinated Children Ages 710 \u0083 Children ages 710 who aren't fully immunized against pertussis (and who do not have a contraindication for pertussis vaccine) should receive a dose of Tdap. If additional doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoidcontaining vaccines are needed, then children in this age range should be vaccinated according to catchup guidance. Note: Guidance on revaccinating children who received Tdap prior to age 11 is forthcoming. \u0017 Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine Updates Adolescents \u0083 ACIP continues to recommend meningococcal conjugate vaccine at age 1112 years. A booster dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine is recommended for all adolescents at age 16 years. \u0083 For adolescents who are first vaccinated between 13 and 15 years of age, a booster dose is recommended 5 years after the first dose through age 21. HighRisk Persons \u0083 ACIP recommends a twodose primary series of meningococcal conjugate vaccine for high risk persons (e.g., asplenia, persistent complement deficiency, HIV infection) followed by a booster dose at the recommended interval. For additional details see the ACIP website . IZ Branch Staff Update Renee Mehra recently joined the Branch's Registry and Assessment section as a Population Assessment Coordinator.
