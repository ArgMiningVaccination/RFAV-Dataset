It's ideal for those looking to ground themselves in the physical present through an exploration of how their thoughts and emotional processes manifest themselves physically. Too often we don't think of the physical body in the context of understanding our emotions, despite the fact that our body is an integral part of who we are as human beings. Breathwork, mindfulness, yoga, and expressive art therapies are combined with components of cognitive behavioral therapy to provide a deeper insight into how your thoughts and emotions are linked to your physical being. Premarital preparation focuses on building a solid foundation for couples who are engaged, living together, or in a long-term relationship. It's ideal for couples looking to get to know one another on a deeper level and explore the facets of your relationship that are strengths, as well the areas of your relationship that present an opportunity for growth. Couples engaging in premarital preparation don't need to be in distress, but must be open to actively looking to strengthen their relationship before marriage. Topics explored in premarital preparation include communication, conflict resolution, family, sexual expectations, and financial management, among many other topics. Exploring sexuality and relationship issues within a therapeutic context can be intimidating, especially if clients have concerns they'll be judged or misunderstood by their therapist. At Balanced Life Counseling, we understand that relationships, sexuality, and gender are deeply personal experiences. The areas in which our therapists specialize includes, but are not limited to, clients who practice ethical non-monogamy, open relationships, open marriages, Kink, BDSM, or power exchanges. This can also include sexual orientation, gender identity, and LGBTQ issues. Ongoing individual therapy can be short-term or long-term service depending on your individual needs. These sessions typically last 55 minutes long and focus on your individual needs at each and every session. We'll always meet you on your level and will be here to help you work through any challenge you face. 3111 W Armitage Ave, Suites 200-204 Chicago, IL Mon-Thurs: 8:00 AM - 8:00 PM, by appointment only Fri-Sun: By appointment only Getting Here: The office is conveniently located at the Armitage and Albany #73 bus stop and we are a short walk from the California and Logan Square Blue Line stops.
