Safety Essential oils are very concentrated and highly volatile. Never use essential oils undiluted, in eyes or mucus membranes. Do not take internally unless working with a qualified healthcare practitioner. Keep away from children and pets. Before using perform a small patch test on your inner forearm or back. Apply a small quantity of properly diluted essential oil and cover with a bandage. If you experience any irritation use carrier oil or cream to further dilute the essential oil on the skin, and wash with soap and water. If no irritation occurs after 48 hours, it is safe to use on your skin. Learn more about using essential oils [here](https://blog.mountainroseherbs.com/5-essential-oil-guides).
