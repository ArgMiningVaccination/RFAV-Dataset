Public Resource Links to Information regarding COVID-19 Testing & Vaccination access LSU Health Shreveport (LSUHS) has been leading Louisiana and much of the nation in its COVID-19 response. Beginning in March of 2020 with the creation of the [Emerging Viral Threat Lab](/fs/pages/2934), a high-capacity, PCR lab which quickly enabled robust COVID-19 testing in north Louisiana. This noteworthy accomplishment was followed by life-saving clinical trials, expanded testing and ultimately large scale community vaccination clinics to include outreach to the medically underserved. LSU Health Shreveport has been nationally and internationally recognized for their significant contributions to genomic sequencing of the virus, including the discovery of seven new lineages of the SARS-CoV-2 virus circulating in the U.S. in late 2020.

They hope to help fill a nationwide shortage of such tests. (AAMC.org) Forbes.com - Biomedical researchers at Louisiana State University Health Shreveport set up an Emerging Viral threat Lab to process COVID-19 tests with a short turnaround time. On Wednesday morning, LSU Health Shreveport held a virtual press conference to announce that it has established a COVID-19 testing lab. Officially, the testing lab facility will be known as the Emerging Viral Threat Lab (EVT). LSU Health Shreveport has established the Emerging Viral Threat (EVT) Laboratory to address the need for faster detection and processing of COVID-19 tests. Dr. G. E. Ghali, chancellor of LSUHS, said during a Wednesday press conference that, \"Around the 17 of March, I approached the governor and said we have a few road blocks to this and we need your help. Without any questions he jumped right in and created an executive order and by March 25, today, the lab is up and running.\" The EVT Lab is the first in north Louisiana approved by CMS to conduct and analyze tests to determine if an individual has COVID-19. During a virtual press conference Wednesday morning, Chancellor G. E. Ghali said the facts around Louisiana's confirmed cases are \"really scary\" because studies show the state has the fastest growth rate of confirmed cases in the entire world, third in per capita, and the steepness parallels that of Italy and Spain. Top scientists at LSUHS have created the Emerging Viral Threat Lab in a remarkable amount of time to take on the global pandemic. The (EVT) Lab can initially test 50 samples per day and expects to tests in the hundreds by end of the week and into next week. The test results are determined with 24 to 48 hours. Having an academic medical center is a \"gem\" touted frequently throughout north Louisiana and beyond. While many in the nation are fearful of having appropriate access to testing and quality care during the Covid-19 pandemic, thanks to LSU Health Shreveport, north Louisiana is infinitely better positioned than most communities to face Covid-19.

Realizing the need for more testing in rural and other underserved locations in Northwest Louisiana, the Caddo Parish Commission voted to provide up to $175,000 to LSU Health Shreveport for the Clinic's mobile unit. The allocation will assist with operations and testing. Expanded testing is north Louisiana will occur thanks to a $125,000 gift by Inferno Manufacturing Corporation. Phase two in the fight against COVID-19 is ramping up. The fight began with testing, now it's the race to find a treatment and eventually a vaccine. Convalescent plasma is so far showing great promise. LSU Health Shreveport has become one of the leaders in the fight against COVID-19, through its healthcare services, testing and innovative research.The work likely will earn the medical facility a place in the history books as 2020 will undoubtedly be known as the year of the coronavirus.

It was a battle between the LSUHS medical students and allied health students to see who could rally around their school and community to donate the most units. For the majority of the first month of the outbreak in the State of Louisiana, Caddo Parish and Shreveport led the way in completed tests. That trend has now been joined by the way that LSU Health Shreveport is attacking the virus in the effort to defeat COVID-19. It's not a typical blood drive. It's a battle between the medical students and allied health students to see who can rally around their school and community to donate the most units. Research from LSU Health Shreveport has shown that nitric oxide is a strong protector against tissue hypoxia. \"It's just really a raging phenomenon that occurs in the lung and if we can just calm that down a little bit and allow the body's natural systems to come in an heal it, that's the real goal,\" said Scott.

Chancellor G. E. Ghali joins other medical professionals in NW LA to discuss COVID-19 as it relates to our community on KTBS-3 News. On Wednesday morning, LSU Health Shreveport held a virtual press conference to announce that it has established a COVID-19 testing lab. Officially, the testing lab facility will be known as the Emerging Viral Threat Lab (EVT). LSU Health Shreveport has established the Emerging Viral Threat (EVT) Laboratory to address the need for faster detection and processing of COVID-19 tests. Dr. G. E. Ghali, chancellor of LSUHS, said during a Wednesday press conference that, \"Around the 17 of March, I approached the governor and said we have a few road blocks to this and we need your help. Without any questions he jumped right in and created an executive order and by March 25, today, the lab is up and running.\" The EVT Lab is the first in north Louisiana approved by CMS to conduct and analyze tests to determine if an individual has COVID-19. During a virtual press conference Wednesday morning, Chancellor G. E. Ghali said the facts around Louisiana's confirmed cases are \"really scary\" because studies show the state has the fastest growth rate of confirmed cases in the entire world, third in per capita, and the steepness parallels that of Italy and Spain. Top scientists at LSUHS have created the Emerging Viral Threat Lab in a remarkable amount of time to take on the global pandemic. The (EVT) Lab can initially test 50 samples per day and expects to tests in the hundreds by end of the week and into next week. The test results are determined with 24 to 48 hours.
