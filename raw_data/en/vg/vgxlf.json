The information comes m ostly fro m arc hives and publicatio ns; in terview s w ith com munity m embers and ot her const ituents - of ten on t rips t o spe cific sites - supp ly missing data. Th is study also identifies the need for further research (htt p://www.cr.nps.gov/ ethnograph y/parks/approach es/index.htm ). Doing an Ethnograph ic Overview and Assessment for Biscayne National Park (BISC) presented special problem s. It is a park \"w ithout a gate,\" open l ocall y to access b y foo t and b y water, yet it is literal ly w ithin the \" gateway\" to L atin A merica; it is little wonder t hat vi sitors - o r refugees - enteri ng B ISC might ea sily be unaware that they have com e int o a nati onal park. It is a natura l resource park of open wa ters and islets, yet it is surrounded by the spra wling, burgeoning metropo lis of great er M iam i. It is sit uate d in what w as on e of t he last fronti ers of t he low er forty-eight Uni ted States yet has one of the longest histories of European contact in the nation. It is a park that permits comm ercial fishing and has a long-standing resident population in some very unusu al dwel lings i n the wat er, \"Stiltsville,\" yet it is a locale for bot h qui et family out ings on shore and sometimes riotous recreation on the sea. It is a park situated in what had become one of the most culturally diverse and dynamic regions of the country at the end of the twen tieth century. Given these circum stances , just i den tifying sta keh older groups is in itself a challenge. Hence, through census records, th is study gav e close attentio n to th e rap idly changing demographic character of the surrounding population. Likewise, the activities of thos e who mak e their living at least in pa rt from the fishery resources of the park wa rranted careful attention to the landing statis tics of th e are a. R ecreatio nal fis hing in the park meant th at in th e ab sence of reliab le statistics, resear chers had to und ertake som e sm all scal e pil ot st udy surveys in the fiel d. In combi nation with these special requirements for the BISC e thno graphic ov erview a nd assessment, the study required a thor oughgoing survey of the published literature on the cultures of the various peoples currently associated with the park - from t hos e who l ived in the area before th ere was eve n a M iam i to th ose who arrive d by plane an d boat ye ster day to join their c ompatrio ts w ho immigra ted to s outh Florida only a few years or decades earlie r. For a n ew park, in a n ewly develo ped reg ion of the country, with an eve r ch anging eth nic m ix and body of \"traditio ns\" - including park usage - an eth nographic overview and assessment is always a w ork in progress. Even so, no matter how much and ho w soo n this report m ight need to be upd ated in fut ure years, it does provide a baseli ne for un dersta nding t he co mplex h uman environment of BISC a nd the multiple comm unities that have a stake in the park. It is important to k eep in mind, however, that th e rep ort pro vides but a s tarting point to schol arly an d scientific writing on the m any ethnic and other groups that give m eaning to t he ethn ograph ic re sou rces of the park . For some gro ups, e.g., the Sem inoles, much has been written; for oth ers, e.g., commercial fis herm en of var ious eth nicities , the eth nographic literatu re is just Bisca yne l Park Ethnogr aphic Overvie w and A ssessmen t There were m any topics - bey ond the con straint s of pro ject time and b udget - t hat w e wished the report might have been able to pursue further. These included the Jewish heritage of Miami Beach ; pop ulat ions from other Lati n A merican co untries, e .g., Brazil and the D ominican Repu blic; the general dev elopm ent of \"tourism culture\" in the r egion; the r ole of hors e racing, jai-alai, and tri bal gam ing op erat ions in the cult ural mix of which BISC is a part ; con troversie s surroundi ng v arious Afr o-Caribbea n re ligions t hat might find t heir way to the pa rk; the cl ash of \"Yankee\" and \"Cracker\" culture with the ever mo re international character of the Miami area; and much mor e - not the least of whi ch is how t he park mi ght better relate its mi ssion and its resources to the compli cated mix of pe oples and cultures lo cally, nat ional ly, and, indee d, intern ation ally which surround the park. Bu t an e thnographic overview and assessm ent is only a beginning. The exceptionally able author s of the study pr ovide, in the end, a very sound and well focuse d set of recom menda tions for further research. Som e of these hav e already beg un to be real ized thro ugh the subs equent Fish ery Managem ent Plan for BISC . In tur n, this repo rt and the data summariz ed within it have alrea dy proven useful to park management in a va riety of area s. Not the least of these is t he p otent ial use of the doc ument by n ew park em ploy ees as a \"primer\" on the character of the surrounding comm unity. Though com munities and cult ures everyw here are a lways ch anging, w e ho pe that this repo rt will prove helpful to empl oyees, contractors, managers, and visitors alike in understanding the human environment for Biscayne National Park at the beginning of the twen ty-first century. J. Antho ny Paredes, Regional Ethn Resources ice RK IN SO CIAL C ONTEXT: AN ET HNOGRAPHIC OVER VIEW AND AS SESSMENT Located bet ween m etropo litan M iam i-Dade C oun ty an d the upp er Key s com munity of Key Largo, Bis cayne N ation al P ark (BISC) occupies about 173,000 acr es of divers e an d dramatic natural and cultural resources. About 95 percent of the total area of the park is covered by wat er, ranging from t he mangrove-lined ma inland coast to the protected wa ters of Biscayne Bay , to san d and coral k eys and bey ond to coral reefs an d the F lorida Stra its. BISC resources attract nearly 500 ,000 person s each y ear. These visitors are fr om nearby com munities such as Miam i and Homeste ad, but t hey also trave l from other part s of the U nite d Stat es, Can ada, Eur ope, Asi a, and other wor ldwi de locations to dive the coral reefs and shipwr ecks, fish the flats, sail the channe ls, view the wildlife, hike and camp on the keys, and otherwise enjoy the natura l an d cultural re sources of BISC. The s ocial and cult ural landscape su rround ing BIS C is as r ich and as diver se as t he p ark's natural resources. The Mi ami Circle archeological site, located at the mo uth of the Mi ami River, is a prehistoric archeological site that wa s inha bited for more than 2,000 years by Tequesta Indians. Offsho re, the w reck of the HMS Fowey, an eighteenth-century Engl ish vessel, is in rel atively shal low water almost within s ight of down town M iami. On near by Boca Chita Key is a stunni ng ol d lighthouse that was part of the H oneywel l family com pound a nd on Porgy Key to the sout h is the hom e site of Parson Jones, an early Black entreprene ur in this region. His family bought the island and developed a thriving citrus farm ing bus iness in the earl y part of t he last century. There a re other A merican In dian and p ioneer sit es scatt ered throug hout the of fshore keys, and many ot her wrecks dot the oce an bot toms of BISC's r eefs. Spanish, French, English, and other ex plorers and settlers have also left their m ark on this lands cape, as hav e the m ore re cent migrants from New Y ork, Denve r, Havana, and beyond. Fro m Mardi Gras and Su per Bo wls to Santer ia and C racker story-t elling fest the surro unding r egion i s a rich a nd di verse mix of t raditions a nd l ifestyles. Res idents of these comm unities most obviously interact with BI SC by providing visitors to the Park. However, the Turkey Point Nuclear P ower Plant, nearb y agricultural fie lds that resu lt in runo ff into t he B ay, com mercia l fishing, the lobbying of concerned en vironmental ists, day-boat cruisers, and sponge poachers each interact with BI SC r esources in ways that have management implications. The purpose of this report is to provide some insight about the cultural context of BISC and the management im plicatio ns of that co ntext. This Biscayne Na tional Park Ethnographic Ove rview a nd As sessment provides a gen eral description of the social and cultural context of BISC a nd discusses current user groups and their activities w ithin the Park. As an overview , dis cussion of social an d cultural c ontext is in terms of broad themes rather than in-depth detail about beliefs, customs, lifestyles, and patterns of social interac tion . This overview also emphasizes cultu ral gr oups specific to th e ge ographic area surroun ding as represented lable ethn ograph ic lit erat ure. There are other cult ural and so cial groups in the great er M iam i-Dade are a, but t he em phasis i n this report is on those et hnic groups t hat are well represented in the exist ing li terature. The disc ussi on of user groups categorizes activity types among visitors and describes their interactions with BI SC resources. This discussion emphasizes com mercia l fishing an d other w ater-based com mercia l and recreational use s of BISC re sour ces. Limit ed obser vations a re also include d regarding how1-2 Bisca yne Nationa l Park Ethnogr aphic Overvie w and A ssessmen t part icula r ethnic groups us e BIS C resources. A revi ew of ex isting reports, academ ic literat ure, and U.S. Bur eau of Censu s da ta com bined wit h limited ethnogra phic fieldwork is the ba sis for the discussion of users, their ac tivities, an d concerns about B ISC resources. T he eth nographic fieldwor k (d escribed in Se ction 5) focused on i dentifying current sociocultural conditions and issues associated with user groups and other interested parties. The report also identifies some of the major gaps i n social and cultural knowl edge about surrounding comm unities and discus ses how existing infor mation m ight be u seful for BISC m anagers. The t reatment of gaps in the lit erat ure and in overal l kn owledge abo ut shoul d be consi dered preliminary. Non etheless, this is a starting poi nt for understanding both what is known and what is y et to b e developed about th e overall ethnographic context of B ISC. The r emaining se ctions of the r epor t hav e the f ollowing cont ents: Section 2 provides a h istorical and socioecon omic overv iew of the area and co mmunities adjacent to BISC. Tw o m ajor topics a re presented: - A brief historical overvi ew of sou th Florida and the region adja cent t o the P ark - An overview of the contemporary Miami-Dade County demography and economy The h istory d iscussion is a broad o verv iew that est abli shes the m ajor h istorical trends that resulted in the current social and cultural context of modern-day M iami-Dade Cou nty. The summary of the demography and economy de scribes current population structure and major compon ents of the regional economy. Section 3 is a s ummary of eth nographic literatu re fo r selec ted cultural g roups for south Flor ida in ge neral and M iami- Dade Count y in particular. Regional com monal ities are first reviewed, f ollow ed by a sum mary discuss ion for the foll owing et hnic groups: A merican N icar aguans, H aitians. Also discus sed are a gro up of non-eth nic ru ral w hites k nown specifically in Florida as \"Crackers\" (For a fu ll definition of the term as it pertains to south Fl orida, and the culture that surrounds the group , see Secti on 3.6). These populat ions are major cult ural groups within com munities surrounding th e Park. Their ex perie nces as new and old re sidents of the reg ion illus trate a wide ran ge of cultural and social issues that m ay also influence new immigra nts to M iam i- Dade Cou nty. Section 4 is a description of user activities as expressed in documents particular to BISC. This d iscussion emphasizes t he role of com mercia l and re creat ional fishing as w ell as other types of water-b ased commercial an d rec reatio nal ac tivities. T hese documents, p rimarily government and academic reports a nd papers, do no t necess arily represent a ll types of users and acti vities, only those represented in som e existi ng lit erat ure. Section 5 ident ifies users and a ctivity pa tterns as a suppl ement to the di scus sion i n Sec tion 4. There is a p relim inary discussion of co nnection s betw een eth nic groups and activity patt erns w ithin BIS C, but t his discuss ion raises as many questi ons as it answ ers. Given that ethnographic m ethods receive d lim ited a pplicatio n for th is project, the em phasis in thisNatio nal Park Serv ice 1-3secti on is the gap s in inform ation abou t issues and dat a that sho uld be developed in future work.

Similarly, the current demogra phic trends a nd econom ic tant cha racteristics of the sociocultural environment of BISC. Thi s section is a brief overview of both the history and curren t socioeconomic co ndition s of south Florida an d specifically Miam i-Dade County. T his information is a prelude both to the discussion of sociocultural groups (Section 3) and the activities o f BISC users (Section 4 and Section 5). 2.1 A Bri ef Historical Overview Histo rian s group south Florida histo rica l periods in vario us ways, but a c ommon gro uping is1 terri and st ateho od; post-Civil War to W orld War II (WWII); and W WII to the pr esent. Th is section sum marizes major historical them es for each t ime pe riod. 2.1.1Pre-contact Abor iginal Per iod Nea r the mouth of the Miami River, recent development activities uncovered a site that archeologists h ave interp reted as part of an ancient town occupied by an aborigin al p eople known as the T equesta. About 40 square f eet of t his arch eological site, which is on more t han 2 acres of land, revealed 24 basins in the bedrock that wer e surrounded by a circle of about 300 other basins all eged t o be pos tholes. This site is believ ed to be betw een 1, 700 and 2,000 years old (Carr and Ricisak 2000: 282). However, this site does not date to the ear liest inhabi tants of this region. Pa leoindians probably we re in Fl orida since about 10,000 to 12,000 B.C. The discoveries by Roy al at Warm Mineral Springs in southwes tern Fl orida (Roya l and Clark 1960) and later archeological w ork by Claus en (Claus en et al. 19 75) in the 1970s and Cockrell (Cock rell and Murphy 1978) in the late 1970s and through the 1980s at both Warm Springs and Little Salt Springs indicat e hum an rem ains t hat dat e to at least 10,000 B.C . These ear ly peop les came fro m unknown place s and traveled in an area where the coastline was significantly different than it is today. By approximately 5000 B.C., the climatic conditions and phy siography of Florida began to stabilize, and populations of Paleoindians began to increase. By about 3000 B.C., the climate w as comparable to p resent-day condition s, an d the shorelin e als o approxi- mated wha t it is today (Milanich 19 96:4-5). Stone tools, a wel l-developed pottery tradition, and a cu lture th at ex ploited f resh and saltwater sh ellfis h appears to ch arac terize the peoples of this time. By 1000 B.C., there were signs of settlements with sand mou nd burials, and by 800 A.D. there wer e indicat ions of la rger sett ents and the oducti on ivation o f dom esticated plants (Milinach 1996:9). From n orth to south, the Paleoindian populations showe d different adaptations t o their env ironment, and regional cultures dev eloped. In s outh o expl oited marin e resources are termed the g lades culture (Flor ida Ant hropological Society 1997). These people lived in the same areas later inha bited by the Tequesta, who occu pied t he s ite on the M iam i River that i s no w known as the M iam i Circle. It is estimated that the population of aboriginal inha bitants of Florida numbered about 350,000 by the t ime Ponce de Leon sa iled into the v icinity of Biscayne Ba y. Of t hese inhabi tants, about 150,000 lived in the west, central, and southern parts of wha t is now the State of Fl orida (Milanich 1996: 14). After this time, disease and war ravaged the Nat ive popul ation, causing a significant decline ( Dobyns 1983). Today, shel l midde ns, pot tery, t ools, and ot her suc h artifac ts are the rem ains res 1982; Goggin 1998). onization In the spri ng of 1513, P once de Leon w as probabl y the f irst Europe an t o expl ore what is now the vi cinit y of Biscay ne Bay. H e nam ed the are a Los M arti res (the martyrs) because the rocky keys were sai d to rem ind h im of m en w ho were suffer ing (G ann on 1996:20). It appears that host ilities between Ponce de Leon a nd N atives of the r egion w ere common in early enco unters. Indeed, subsequent exp lorer s, such as P anfil o de N arva ez and H ernand o de S oto, landed vessels and crew and initiated expl orations of coa sts and i nterior regions a nd t hey a lso enco untered ho stile inhabit ants. Sub stantia l resist ance t o Spanish and ot her ex plorers appears to h ave inhibited th e development of p erm anent settlem ents. T he exp lorat ions in 1562, when Jean Rib aut landed near what is now St. Augu stine. Th e French made additional efforts to es tablish a colony (Lyon 1996:40-42), but conflicts wit h the Spanish as wel l as wit h N atives thwa rted their efforts. The Spanish explorer Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s fought with the French explorers, and it was he who establish ed the firs t per manent Flo rida co lony in 1565 at St. A ugustine . The Spanish also had some success with establishing missions in Fl orida and up the Carolina coast. One of these , know n as Mayaim i, was established in 1567 at a site that later became the City of M iam i. By about 159 0, there w ere ga rrison s on the w est and east coasts of F lorida. Mission activity ext ended into the seventeenth century, but conflict among French, Spanish, and Natives continu ed, and Florida was charac terize d as a \"land of con stan t war\" (Bushnell 1996: 74). Th rough m issionizing a ctivity by t he Fr ench a nd ot hers, the Nat ive popul ations of Florida becam e exposed t o disea se and o ther influences, w hich caused a po pulat ion d ecrease. A res ult w as tha t the Spanish, French, Dutch, English, an d others had lim ited lab or to b uild settlements. The first significant appearance of the English was by Sir Francis Drake who raid ed the Spanish colony of St. Augustine in 1586. However, the Spanish rem ained large ly in con trol of Florida despit e the inc ursions of other E uropean pow ers, until the Spanish ceded Flor ida to the Engl ish after the Seven Years' War (Fabel 1996: 134). The Engl ish spl it Florida into Ea st and West territories wi th capitals at St. Aug ustine and Pensacola, respectively. Howe ver, tropical fevers, difficult terrain, ongoing problems wi th Am erican Indians, and limited e conomic o pportun ity in hibited th e development of m ajor English colonies. By 1778, Engl and w as once again at war with Spai n, and Fl orida was the pr ize. Th e Spa nish attacked wes t Florida and continued wes twar d into what is now Loui siana. In east Florida, the Eng lish enlisted the help of Cre ek and Choc taw N ative Am ericans in their battles against theNatio nal Park Serv ice 2-3French, bu t the Spanish were persisten t and formidable. In 1783, the En glish ceded Florida to Spain in t he T reat y of Paris, w hich was part of the se ttlem ent t hat ended the R evolut ionary W ar. In what is c ommonly known as the second Spanish perio d in Florida, the po pulatio n began to increase du e to Spanish land grants and increased economic op portun ity ass ociated with tobac co, indigo, and lumber (Coker and Parker 1996: 152). Yet pea ce in Flor ida was shor t lived, as the Uni ted States began to show interest in French and Spanish holdings in the region. In 1814, Andr ew Jackson led troops into Florida, and Spain eventually ceded Florida to the U.S. in 1821. By t hen, the le gacy of expl oration and colonization i n Flor ida a heteroge nous pop- ulation of British, Spa nish, Fre nch, Indi ans, peopl e of African des cent, and ot her nat ional ities. 2.1.3Am erican Indians and P eoples of African Des cent During t he period of explorat ion and colon ization and thro ugh stateho od and the C ivil War, American Indi ans remained, and peopl es of African des cent beca me pr ominent in Flor ida history. A tho rough discuss ion o f this h istory is bey ond the sco pe of th e historical overvi ew presen ted h ere. Sou rces el aborati ng that history sh ould b e con sult ed for a more deta iled description of the history of these peoples in Florida (e.g., Col burn and Landers 199 5; Covington 1993; Wrigh t 1986). This discussion briefly summariz es some ex istin g literatu re to emphasize the importan ce of these gr oups in the early histo ry of Florida. Landers (1996:167ff) suggests that peoples of African descent most lik ely entered Florida with the Spanish. Ponce de Leon, De So to, and other Sp anish explorers were acc ompanied by both free and ensl aved Blacks from Spai n. Subse quent ly, African slave labor was part of the pr ocess of Spanish colonization, especially when Am erican Indian populations began to decline. The population of peoples of African descent in Flor ida increased bec ause of cont inued impor tation of slaves and an influx of escaped slaves from the Carolinas and elsewhere. By 1814, some estimates place Black s at abo ut 5 7 percent of F lorida's populatio n (Landers 1996:178). W ith the pr esence of the Engl ish, slavery became m ore pr evalent and subse quent ly the pr esence of larger populat ions of freed sla ves w as a conc ern of slave owners in stat es adja cent t o Florida. Some slaves escaped and joined the Seminoles and other Am erican Indian groups, prompt ing furt her h ostil ity between the U nite d Stat es and p eop les i n Florida. As U.S. incu rsion ex tend ed into Florida, slavery became more prevalent and many formerly free Africans fled to Cu ba and elsewhere in the Carib bean (Landers 1996:180-181). The political situation in the Colonies resulted in pushing some southeastern Na tive Am ericans into nort hern Flor ida. Th ese groups c alled them selves saminoli or refugees because they w ere displace d from their hom elands . By the mid-1700s, th ese In dians were well es tablish ed in north Florida (G arbari no 1989). The C reek wars of 181 3 in the sta tes no rth o f Florida drove additional populations of Am erican Indians south into Florida. T he saminoli and lat er populations of Creeks are am ong th e an cestors of th e ea rly Seminoles in Florida. T his tran sitio n of Creek to S eminole is summariz ed in Seminole trib al h isto ry as follow s: Creek W ar of 1813- 14, the brut al repression and disastrous treaty for ced upon them by Gen eral Andr ew J ackson sent thou sands of the most determined warriors and their families mi grating southwa rd to take refuge in Spanish Flor ida. Th ere, they j oined t he de scendant s of many ot her tribes whose2-4 Bisca yne Nationa l Park Ethnogr aphic Overvie w and A ssessmen tmembers had lived all across the Florida forests for thou sands of years. The Indians w ho con stituted the n ucleus of this Florida group thoug ht of t hem selves as yat' siminoli or \"free peo ple, \" bec ause for centuri es t heir ancestors had resist ed the at tempts of t he S pan iards to con quer and c onvert them , as w ell as the attempt s of the English to take their lands and use them a s military pa wns. Soon, White Americans w ould begin t o call all of t he In dians in F lorida by that name: \"Seminoles.\" (Seminole Tribe of Florida 2002) The U nite d Stat es pursu ed a policy of rem oval of Indians from Florida t hro ugh three identi fied \"Seminole wars.\" The first of these was in about 1817-1818, the second from a bout 1835-1842, and the third was in the tim e perio d of 1855-1858. O sceola, C ooacoochee, O ctiarc he, B illy Bowlegs, and other Seminole leaders fought substantial battles against U.S. troops, but in the end alm ost 4,0 00 Seminole were relo cated to land s in O klahoma, leavin g what w as believ ed to be les s than 300 Sem inole in Flor ida. These remaining Sem inole relocated to the re mote Everglad es and Big C ypress areas of Florida, of ten res iding on sm all islan ds w here the ir presence was difficult to de tect. Ultimately, the Un ited States established r eservations f or Florida Seminole in what are n ow Broward and Palm Beach counties. 2.1.4Terr itory, Statehoo d, and t he Ci vil War Andrew Jackso n was dispatched to devel op the terr itory o f Florida, where in 18 24, Tallahassee was established a s its ca pital. Imm igrants from nea rby s tates and elsewhere, includ ing t hose from t he southeast who wer e later known a s \"Cra ckers,\" began to swell the population and by 1840, it is estimated that Florida had a popul ation of abou t 55, 000. East , central, and w est Florida were more populous than south Florida where less development occurred. During this period of expa nsion, two issue s dom inated: the r emoval of the Sem inole from lands they occ u- pied, a nd access to l ands for Plantat ions were est abli shed and slav es wer e major sources of labor fo r land owne rs. In 1845, Florida was admi tted as the twen ty- seventh St ate of the Uni on and William Moseley wa s elected the first governor. Che ap land and opportunities for economi c growt h fu eled a population boom and, by t he end of the 1850s, the populat ion w as abou t 140,000 . Ec onomic grow th w as built on the s lave labor of Florida' s cott on plan tations . Indeed , slav ery appears to have been an essen tial part of t he eco nomy as well as t he p olitical con cern of post- stateho od Florida (Sch co ncern was expressed by Fl orida's vote for secession from t he Uni on in 1861 a nd its joining the Confe deracy at the st art of the Civ il War. Florida, in par ticular sout h Florida, was a major source of salt an d beef for the Confederate ar mies during th e Civil W ar. T his fact resu lted in the only major Civil W ar b attle in Florida: U nion troo ps engaged Florida fo rces at Olustee in an at tempt to disr upt the t ranspo rt of sup plies north to Confederat e arm ies. The U nion forces wer e driven back, but there wer e few reasons for Floridians to be cheerful given the poverty and social disrupti on that accom pan ied Florida's part icipati on in t he w ar. After 186 5, Florida a s well as the r emainder of the Sout h w as in di re econom ic condi tions unt il the l ate 1870s . 2.1.5Post-Ci vil War to W orld W ar I I Florida suffered with the r est of the South during reconstruction. Howe ver, as political and social conditions began to stabilize, the economy be gan to recover. Citrus crops, cattle, andNatio nal Park Serv ice 2-5other agri dom econ omy. T he p opulation rem ained concentrated in about 1 0 cities , bu t by 1880, there was a populatio n of ab out 2 60,000, nearly half of whom w ere black. Ke y W est was the largest city (abo ut 10,000), followe d closely by Jacksonville and Pen sacola (Proctor 1996:272). By 1896, the re nowned developer, Henry Morrison F lagler , finish ed a ra ilroad li nk to the fle dgling cit y of Miam i. In 1 912, the link to K ey West was complete. W ith the se develo pments, m any of the tran sportation impediments to sou th Florida's grow th were rem oved. Only the arri val of t he autom obile would h ave a great er effect on populatio n and commerce in Florida. Florida's populatio n increased substan tiall y, with the major ity o f growth coming from white immigrants. Duri ng t his time, there was a lso a concomit ant relative decrease in the bl ack population. Miami became a center for tourism a nd population growt h in south Fl orida. By 1900, the population of Florida was almost 530,000, with Da de Cou nty growi ng more than 500 percent since 1890 (Pr octor 1996: 282). In t he e arly part of the t wentieth cent ury, the st ory of sou th Florida is one o f spectacul ar land d evel opment i n M iam i Beach and the rest of coasta l Florida.

No pla ce escaped the boom of the 1920s, th ough no place experie nced it m ore p rofoundly than the low er ea st coast of t he p enins ula ( Derr 1989:181). The boom went bust in 1926 and many who made real estate fortunes were left penni less, but Miam i, Florida, was esta blished as a world class tourist desti nati on and o ne o f the s hining cit ies of the United S tates. The Great Depression compounded some of the effects of the rea l estate bust, but a strong a gricultural base, WPA projects, and t ourism kept fueling t he e ngines of growth. By the outbreak of W WII, Flo rida's populatio n was about 1 .9 m illion . 2.1.6Post-World W ar II to the Present Economic and et hnic div ersif icat ion, ph eno menal pop ulat ion grow th, and urb anizat ion are only som e of the trends that characterize Florida since WWII. Af ter WWII, many of the hundre ds of thousa nds of military per sonnel who t rained in Flor ida returned to either live or vacation. By 1950, the population was about 2.8 million, by 19 60 it was nearly 5 million, and by 1990 it was 11 million. Air con ditioning m ade som e of t he grow th possible a s did the effort s at mosquito eradication and control. And, unlike past patterns of growt h, south Fl orida was the center o f the new populatio n boom (Derr 1989:337-338). Much of this growth was the result of widespread migration. Cuba ns, Haitians, and other ethnic groups from t he Car ibbean and central America became important components of south Florida, and especially the Mi ami popul ation. However, Cuba ns w ere among t he m ost prominent of the Car ibbea n immigrants. Many Cubans l eft bec ause of the r ise of Fidel Castro and t hey f ound sa fe hav en be cause of2-6 Bisca yne Nationa l Park Ethnogr ssessmen tfavora ble im migra tion policies result ing from cold w ar-related te nsions betw een the U nite d Stat es, Ru ssia, and C uba. Miami and south Fl orida in general have one of the most ethnically diverse populations in the United St ates. Another char acteristic of thi s popula tion growth has bee n the concent ration of residents i n urb an areas. Before t he m ajor po pulat ion boo m of the twenti eth century, Florida's popul ation w as predominant ly rural. Most recently, Florida has dev eloped one of the m ost urban and age d population s in the United S ates . M ore th an 18 percent of th e populatio n in 1990 was older than 65 (Mohl and M orm ino 199 6:422 -23), and i n som e of th e sou thern cou ntie s the percentage ranges from 30 to 50 percent ( Derr 1989:339). Econ omically, the s tate, and especially sout hern Flor ida, has diversified from its pr evious c attle, citrus, an d tourism base. Technol ogy, tourism, and es pecially ser vice indust ry employm ent are major features of the r egion's econom y. Today, Miami i s not onl y a major U.S. center, but it is kn own as a \"capita l\" of t he C aribbean, a truly int ernat ional cit y that is ethn ically and cu ltural ly diver se. gives M iami and sout hern Flor ida a unique a mbiance, but one t hat escapes a clear-cut characterization. One author 's description captures this compl exity: From the e arly 1960s through the present there has been substan tial im migra tion from nor thern s tates, as we ll as from La tin Am erica and the Ca ribbean. Hispanics, w ho current ly accoun t for over one-half of D ade C oun ty's populat ion, have con tributed t o M iam i's em ergence as a m ajor L atin A merican com mercial and cul tural r esult, Florida's l argest city cont ains a majority La tin Am erican population, a l arge Black mi nority wi th a significant Car ibbean island element, and a la rge Jewish population. The result is the gradual de velo pment of a u nique loc al cu lture w hich synthesizes aspects of all cult ures. For exam ple, Miam ians are likely t o share a caf\u00e9 cub ano on their w ay to a bar mitzvah, whe re they m ay kiss each ot her on the cheek in greeting and danc e to reggae (Bucuvala s 20 00). 2.1.7The Hi story of Biscayne Nat ional Par k Leyn es and Cullison (199 8), in their review of BISC historical resources, discuss the h istorical background a nd de velopm ent of Biscayne Bay a nd M iami. Their work shoul d be consul ted for a mo re detailed analysis of the interaction of BISC and the development of south Florida. Some of the major points of t heir analysis rega rding the history and h istorical resources of B ISC are highlighted below. Aboriginal Hi story As no ted earl ier, the en virons of B iscayn e Bay have been inhabit ed by aboriginal peop les since at least 10,000 years ago. Within BIS C, archeological eviden ce of earl y habit ation ex ists on Sand s Key and at other sites around t he pe rimeter of Biscayne Ba y (Leyne s and C ullison 1998: 10). Juan Ponce de Leon, in abou t 1513, encountered Teque sta Indi ans at the m outh of t he M iami Riv er, which flows i nto Biscayne Bay, but the Tequ esta seemingly disappeared from t his region early in the historic period. Other aboriginal peoples visited the area, but it appears there wer e no permanent residences in the vici nity of t he B ay or w hat i s no w BIS C. Although some Sem inole est ablishedNatio nal Park Serv ice 2-7residenc e at Ochupocr assa in 1820, it appea rs that no Sem inole lived on lands that are now part of BISC (Leynes and Cullison 1998:11). H owe ver, Na tive Am ericans probably ha ve used the resour ces of Biscayne Ba y and its environs for as long as t hey h ave inha bited t he ar ea. That is, they lived in t he vicinity o r tra veled through areas adj acent t o the m odern-day BIS C and us ed resources as indicated by the various middens and other artifacts that are found in BISC. Earl y European History Sailing vessels used the straits of Florida as a passage from the Gulf into the Atlantic. Some vessels sank or ran aground, circumstances that prompted som e early ent reprene urs to de velop salvage operations. So me of these wr ecks are part of the historic resources of the park, including th e Spanish ves sel Nuestra Sen ora d e Populo (1733) and the British wa rship HMS Fow ey (Leyne s and C ullison 1998: 11). Th e salvage ope rato rs, who ere Am erican Indi ans, Spani Baha mians, and Euro-Ame ricans, lived primarily in tempor ary ca mps. These salvage or wrecking ope rations w ere som ewhat slowed by t he const ruction of lighthouses and t he us e of stea mships rat her than saili ng vessels. Salva ge o perat ions con tinued in the area, until halt ed in 1921 by the Wrecking License Registry (Leynes and Cullis on 1998:13). D uring th e ea rly Spanish and British periods in south Fl orida, the region was sparsely populated. Af ter the Americans took control of Florida there wa s some s ettlement, but as late as 1877, wh en Commodore M unroe reached B iscayn e Bay, there were sti ll only a hand ful of set tlers (L eyn es and C ullison 1998:14) . Agriculture was the im petus for the dev elopm ent of much of the lands after the Am ericans took control, and this was also the case in south Fl orida and the environs of Biscayne Bay, wher e pineapple plantations thrived. Slaves and other laborers we re brought in to wor k on these plantations and the population of the region began growi ng. Plantation and Elliott Keys wer e major centers for these pineapple plantations. So il depletion resulted in a change from pinea pples t o lim es and then to other crop s suc h as lem ons, peaches, and other tropical fruits. By the late 1800s, home steading, especially on El liott Key , added to the ng populatio n. Flagler's Rai lroad, the Gr owth o f Miami and Bi scayne Bay Most of sou thern Florida w as diffi cult to reach un til the co mpletion o f the rail road betw een Jacksonville and Mi ami by He nry Flagler, who had been urged on by Julia Tuttle, a Mi ami landowner and en trepreneur. Flagl er had a major resort hotel in St. Augustine and had a sim ilar vision for Miami, which woul d be aided by t he pr esence of easy transpor tation vi a the r ailroad. The comple tion of the r ailroad beg an a process of peopl e flowing into Miami. The popu lation swelled from 500 i n 1896, to 15, 000 in 1915, to m ore than 71, 000 by 1925. Th is was t he pe riod when Miam i and Biscayne Bay b egan to devel op as an \"A merican R iviera. \" T his n ew playground drew ol d and new millionaires, including Car l Fisher and others who built fishing lodges, hotel s, golf courses , and m ansion s in Miam i and it s environs . The K eys o f Biscayn e Bay becam e part of t his \"m illionaire's playgroun d.\" For example, Boca C hita Key b ecam e a r etreat for the H oneywel ls wh o bui lt an ar ray of structures, includ ing a lighthouse, which ar e now important hist orical resources currentl y located i n BISC (Ley nes and C ullison 1998:26-37). Biscayne Bay continued to be part of the Riviera image associated wi th south Fl orida. The status of the bay, first as a Na tional Monume nt in 1968, and then as a national park in 1974, reinforces early images of escape into the environment that Flagler, Fisher, the Honeywe lls, and2-8 Bisca yne creat e.

Miami- Dade Coun ty by itself was h ome to 52.6 percent o f the total in 1990 (874 ,569 person s) (FA IR 2001b). The 2000 Cen sus recorded 2,670,828 fo reign-born re sidents in the state, constituting 16.7 percent of the state's overall population. Thi s figure represented an increase of 60.6 percent above the 1990 foreig n-born populatio n of 1,662,601 residents. The amount of in crease was the fourth highest in the country. Howe ver, the rate of increase in the foreign-born pop ulation was not among the 25 high est in the co untry (FA IR 2001a). A co mparison of the increase in the immigrant population from 1990 with the change in the overal l popu lation during the sam e period show s that immigra nt sett lem ent dir ectly accoun ted for about one-third (33.1 percent) of t he Sta te's overal l popu lation increase over t hat decade. The 2000 Census found tha t 38.6 pe rcent of Flo rida's foreig n-born populatio n had arrive d in the st ate since 1990. This demon strates the e ffects of the cu rrent mass immigration, although it is a low er share t han the n ational av erage (43.7 percen t). As of 1990, Flor ida had the third largest num ber of immigrants and the fourth highest concentration of immigrants nationally (FAIR 20 01a). Add itionally, immigrants born in Cub a made up 3 0 percent of the st ate's total immigra nt pop ulat ion. Severa l Haitians (382 + percent), and M exican s (304 + percent). Of the rest of Florida' s 10 largest nati onal groups, only Italians (10th) had registered a decline over the decade (-2 percent). Pop ulations of European imm igrants were registering declines elsewhere in the country over the same period. Some of this increase may ha ve been attributable to re-migration from el sewher e in the country (FAIR 2001a). Immigra tion fi gures from 1990 also ref lect ed many of the illegal aliens wh o had arr ived earl ier but had since gained l egal status.

The effect of immigration on population change is still greater whe n the children of the im migra nts are born here after their paren ts' arriva l and are in cluded with the ir parents in the calculation.

Acc ording to the 2 000 Census, w hile M iam i-Dade C oun ty sh owed a pop ulat ion inc rease of 12.3 percent between 1990-99, the outflow of residents was so great (236,078) that if it wer e not for newly arriving immigrants (abou t 337, 200), the cou nty's popul ation w ould be shri nking despite a net increase in residents and desp ite natur al change (12 9,000 more birt hs than deat hs).

Income a nd E mployment There are numerous ways to measure economic well-being. Economists frequently use income as a key measurement. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) produces most of the income statistics g ene rated by t he Fede ral Gove rnm ent, and r esearch ers consi der BEA data of high quality, alb eit slig htly d ated . To examine in come leve ls over tim e within Miam i-Dade County and surrounding areas, two standard income indicators are used: Per Capita Personal Income (PCPI) and Me dian Ho usehold Income. BEA defines PCPI as total personal income (income received from empl oyment, investments, and government transfer payment s) divided by the population. The U .S. Bureau of t he C ensus defines H ous eho ld Inco me as t he s um of m oney incom e recei ved in t he p revi ous calend ar year by all househ old m embers 15 years old and o ver, including h ous eho ld m embers n ot related to t he h ous eho lder, peop le living al one, and o thers in non-family households. The U.S. Bureau of the Census defines the median household income as the figure that shows h alf of the hou seholds having higher annu al incomes than this value, and half ha ving l ower incom es. As shown in T able 2. 9, in 1999, Miami- Dade C ounty had a per capita persona l incom e of $24,492, whi ch wa s 7.9 percent below t he Florida average of $26,593, and 12 percent below t he nati onal aver age of $27 ,843 (F lorida, in turn, was 4.4 percent bel ow the n ational av erage) . In com parison, in 199 0, the average per capit a person al incom e within Miam i-Dade C oun ty was approximately 4.9 percent below t hat of Florida (whi ch in turn wa s 1.4 percent above the nati onal aver age of $19 ,572).

This trend was evident in 1990, with Browar d, Collier, an d Monroe Counties sh owing per capita personal income levels of 1 7.6 p ercent, 40.7 percent, and 16 percent, respectively , abo ve th at of Miam i-Dade County. In 1999, the per capita personal income i n Miam i-Dade Cou nty ranke d 20th in Fl orida by cou nty, whereas in 19 90, the co unty rank ed 15 th in the stat e (U .S. Bureau of t he C ensus 2 001a). The average a nnual grow th rate of per capit a person al incom e within Miam i-Dade C oun ty over the p ast decade h as been 3.1 percent (BE A 2000). As of 1997 the median household in come w ithin Miam i-Dade C ounty, at $ 30,000, was 8.8 percent below that of th e state ( a census m odel-b ased estimate- the most rec ent figu res curren tly availab le). In comparis on, in 1990, the median household in come within Miam i-Dade County was approximately 4.3 percent below t hat of the State of Florida (whi ch in turn wa s 8.6 percent below the the national average of $30,056). Between 1990 and 1997, median household income in Florida dropp ed from 8.2 percent t o 11.2 percent below the n ational av erage. In 1997, Bro ward, Collier, a nd Monroe Counties had median household income leve ls of 15.1 percent, 24.1 percent, and 10.6 percent, respectively, above that of Florida (U.S. Bureau of the Census 2001a). This represented, particu larly in the cas e of Broward and Monroe counties, a significa nt chan ge from 1990 when Brow ard, Collier, a nd M onroe coun ties had m edian household income levels 14.3 percent below, 19.1 percent above, and 6.36 percent below, respecti vely, that of Florida (U.S. Bureau of t he C ensus 1 990). As shown above, d uring the last dec ade, in relatio n to th e nation al ave rage, the per c apita personal in come lis ted for Florida ro se only slig htly (1 .0 pe rcent) w hile th e median household income fell further (3.0 percent). Over the sam e perio d, per cap ita and median household incomes within Miam i-Dade County, b oth below the state ave rage in 1990, also fell fu rther (1 .6 percent and 0.6 perce nt, respecti vely). Co mparing M iam i-Dade C oun ty w ith the n ational averages, as of 1999, per capita incom es were 12.0 percent below the national average, and as of 1997 (the latest figures available), median ho usehold incomes wer e 18.9 percent below t he nati onal aver age (U .S. Bureau of t he C ensus 1 990). There are a num ber of unde rlying f actors that coul d cont ribute to the l ower-than- average incom e levels de scribed abov e. One fa ctor is the large popul ation of younge r individua ls be low 18 and between 18 to 24 years who e arn significantly less than ol der groups. Th e ot her factor is direc tly re lated to th e prevalen ce and gro wth of low-wage servic e sector jo bs and the inability of the ec onomy, in the face of an influx of immigra tion , to cope with the demands of a rap idly growi ng population. Empl oyment As shown in Table 2.10, whi le mirroring the national decline in unemployment levels during the last decade, u nem ploy ment level s within Miam i-Dade C oun ty have conti nuous ly ranked ab ove the State and national averages, and all contiguous counties.

Since this recent job growth has tended to be concentrated in the comparatively low- paying services sector, it may partly explain the dichotomy between the relative levels of employ- ment increases and the fall in incomes over the same time period within M iami-Dade Cou nty.

It is one of the most ethnically diverse and culturally complex metropolitan area s in the United S tates, as expressed in the multi-eth nic popul ations t hat include American Indi ans, Cuba ns, African Americans, and H ispanics from the Carib bean and Central Americ a.

Underly ing th ese discussions of particu lar eth nic groups, there is also di scus sion of som e com monal ities in the region, but these topics a re less developed than the cultural characteristics of particular populations. Thr ee topics regarding comm onality stand out in the existing literature: tourism cu lture, neighbo rhoo d and shar ed activities. 3.1.1Touri Even befo re Flagler built the ra ilroad sou th int o M iam i and the K eys, south F lorida had been a touris t destination. The railroad only mad e it easier for thos e from t he northeast and elsewhere in the United States to vis it the beaches and enjoy the trop ical clim ate o f south Florida. Although always prom oted as a tropical paradise, the re ality of insects and s ummer heat a nd hum idity somet imes anged tourists' minds: w hat had on ce been the fantasy and playla nd for t he very rich so on becam e a destinatio n and residenc e for a wider rang e of peopl e seeking t he pr omise of the Fl orida getaway . Tourists, seasonal residents, and others just passing through contributed to the construction of a co mmunity an d reg ion tha t caters to th eir n eeds. T heme parks, Seminole alligator wrestling shows, condominiums, national parks, and retirement comm unities became part of t he social and cult ural landscape of sou th Florida. In fact , tourism in sou th Florida has influenced the development of servic e industry jobs and the demand for un skilled and semi- skilled labor (cf. Strong 1991). As important, Miami cultivated an image of a restful but exciting place blessed by exot ic na tural resources. Th is image was bol stered by t he v acation hom es of some of the wea lthy a nd power ful families of Am erican industry, such as the Honeywe lls, who built home s and compou nds on places such a s Boca Chi ta Ke y. Yet , the less wea lthy a nd powerful als o sought vacatio n or retirem ent ho mes in south Florida, res ultin g in a surge in condom inium bui lding and the growth of re tirement com munities.

Ten sion developed surroun ding im ages of an ideal past and the current reality of Miami-Dade Cou nty. The se tensions we re sufficient for some residents to leave and search elsewher e for the ideal Florida dream (Por tes and Stepick 1993). H owe ver, this influx of Ca ribbean and Cen tral Am erican immigra nts and refugees has also developed a new cultural as w ell as a new econ omic re ality. M iam i has become n ot simply a tourist destination, but it also functions as the capital of the Caribbean. There are transnational corporations that cater to the Car ibbean market and there are immigrants, suc h as Haitians, who h ave consolida ted stro ng ec onomic ties with their hom eland. This emerg ing soc ial cont ext will interact with the t ourist culture of Miami a nd sout h Flor ida to pro duce a new iterat ion o f com munity cu lture. Yet, as t hese new iterations em erge, there rem ains a st rong base of tourism cult ure sup ported by images of an ex otic place w ith a tr opical clim ate, on ly now with a Disneyworld thrown into the mix. The overall cu ltural m ilieu in south Florida has tou rism valu es, beliefs , images, an d socioeconomic re alities th at give this region its distin ctive charac ter. 3.1.2Nei ghbor nei ghbor hood seg regation is a feat ure commonly not ed in the l iterature about Miam i-Dade County (e.g., M ohl 19 91; Dunn 1997; Portes and Stepick 1993). Bla cks live in particular neighbo rhoo ds, and the residents of Little Havana, Little Haiti, Little Managua, and other clea rly defined ethnic neigh borho ods have a history of k eeping to t hem selves. The s ocial history of B lacks i n M iami cl early show s that the Cauca sian power structure in M iami m ade specific polici es designed to con tain B lacks in cert ain p arts of the cit y. T his type o f resi den tial segregat ion is ch aracteristic of the region. It prom otes con tinuit y between co mmunity so cial structure and local cult ure. That i s, the values, belie fs, and lifest yles peo ple h ave are the on es shared by their ne ighbors and often supported by community or ne ighborhood specific organizations, such as those in m any Cuban neighb orh oods. T his co ntinuit y of social space and cult ural traditions sup ports the creat ion o f enclave s and the life styles of et hnic groups that might ot herwise exper ience stronge r pressures for acculturation. Y et, nei ghbor hood segregation is not alway s voluntary, as indicated in the expe riences of Miami Bla cks (Dunn 1997), and it can also engender \"have\" an d \"have-not\" sentiments. In this type of social and cultural environment, state or county parks or even na tional parks such as BISC m ay not be perceived as \"com mon\" sp aces op en to al l, but rather a s terri tory t hat is unk nown or pla ces that \"others\" gather. This t ype of neigh borho od segregat ion al so p rom otes a m ore rest ricted view of the relationship of social and phy sical space that may restrain visitation to places outside the fam iliar en viro nment of th e \"local S har ed Ac Bucuvalas, Bulger, and Ke nne dy (1994 ) sugge st that there are folk traditions based in the env ironmental cha racteristics that cont ribute to a uni que M iami soc iocul tural milieu. Som e of these folk traditions revolve around the harvesting of ma rine resources such as fish, shrimp, lobst er, and cr abs. They a lso sugge st that the dist inction between com mercial and per sona l use activities is not clear in the M iami a rea (Bu cuvalas, Bul ger, and Kennedy 1994: 138).

This m ay be a regional characteristic, but just as significant is the presence of these activities among different ethnic groups. For example, snagging mullet, hoo k and line for barracuda, trapping for spiny lobster , or u sing tro t line s for cr abs in the Bay are ac tivities th at are c ommon across eth nic groups, although som e groups may hav e culturally spe cific ha rvest methods.

These are common activitie s that are in suppor t of the ha rvesting of marine re sour ces in the region (Bu cuvalas, Bul ger, and Kennedy 1994:148-154). Buc uval as et al. also suggest that tr opical agri cult ure an d horses also characterize this regional culture (Bucuvalas, Bulger, and Ke nnedy 1994:154-162). P rior to Hu rricane An drew, agriculture in this region was an import ant econom ic act ivity with uni que pr oduct s.

Th ere are also Seminole reservations at Big Cypr ess, Brighton, Hollywoo d, Tampa, and Immokalee, and the Florida State Res ervation, whi ch is also partially located in nearby Browa rd Coun ty. In 1993, there w ere a pproximately 2,300 person s on the S eminole T ribal rolls, and in 19 94 there w ere an estimated 369 enrolled membe rs of the Miccosukee Tribe. The latter have three different reservation s: th e Tamiam i Trail w est of M iami; Krom e Ave nue, w hich is near th e Tamiam i Trail reserva tion; and A lligat or A lley w est of Fort Lauderdale. Bo th the S eminole and M iccosuk ee have tradit ional use conn ections with Everglades National Park and t he Big C ypress N ational Preserve, but as of April 23, 2003 there does no t appear to be a similar connection to BISC. Currently, there ar e appr oxim ately 4,000 A merican Indi ans in the cou nty, but cur rent census data do not indicate the exact numbers of Seminole and Miccosukee. The re are cultural resources in BISC a ssociated wi th Te que sta Indians, but at present there are no significant cultural resources associ ated with the Se minole or Miccos ukee . Non etheless, bot h of t hese tribal groups hav e a prom inent place in A merican Indi an cul ture in Fl orida. Th is pr esentation is limited, and those seeking a more thorough treatment of the history and traditions of the Sem inole and M iccosukee should consult ethno graphic and historical materials suc h mmunity, 19 86; Harry A.

An alternat ive view is expressed by Wickm an (1999), who s uggests that so uth Fl orida Na tive Am ericans are not necessarily Cr eeks who moved sou th, but rat her they are a people indigeno us to t he region. T his is a m ore con troversia l view , bu t on e th at W ickman forcefully argu es based on eth nohisto rica l an d eth nographic resear ch with Sem inole in Florida. M ost sch olars, including W ickm an, w ould agree t hatNatio nal Park Serv ice 3-5regardless of origin , the perio d of the th ree Seminole w ars was a turb ulent and rich perio d in the history of these peo ples t hat r esult ed in the em ergence of h istorical ly im portant l eaders such as O sceola, as w ell as d ram atic so cial and cult ural changes that forev er chang ed their way of li fe. After 1858, these remnant groups r emained sm all and i solated, and ge nerally av oided cont act with non-Natives. However, spo radic contact did occu r, and eventual ly the S eminole began trading pelts, feathers, and other animal products with Am ericans and Eur opeans in the 1870s (Ker sey 1975). Fu rthermore, they began to have some contact with travelers and others who made their way into Florida. This co ntact included m issionaries w ho becam e ver y acti ve among these Natives during the late nineteenth century; some Natives were more receptive than others to these missionizing activities. It was the early twentieth century before the Seminole became settled on reservation lands set aside for them at Big Cypr ess and Dania, and then in the 1930s the Brighton reservation was established. The opening of the Tamiami Trail also brought non- Natives into increasi ng co ntact with the N atives and there ensued an em ergent indus try supplying palmetto dolls and other artifacts to tourists and travelers. The re also appeared the precursors to th e \"tourist villages \" tha t dis played, or s ome say sensation alize d, the Seminole and the ir lifew ays. These tourist villages beca me one al ternative to reservation life while ot hers simply chose not to live on the reservations. One such group lived along the Tamiami Trail and they became known as \"Trail In dians.\" They are d escrib ed as generally more c onservative tha n the ir reservation and tourist village relatives, and m ore likely to participate in traditional activities, such as t he G reen C orn D ance, a and other reser vation In dians h ad significa nt con flicts w ith their non -Indian neighbor s regarding land use, hunt ing and fishing rights, and proper ty rights. In 1957, a group of primarily reservation-based Indians wer e granted tribal status as the Seminole. Some of the Trail Indians chose not to particip ate in this triba l rec ognition but subsequently p etition ed to have a distin ct identity with reservation lands along th e Tamiam i Trail. T hese are the present- day M iccosuk ee Indians w ho reside in Miam i-Dade Coun ty. T oday the dist incti ons betw een the M iccosuk ee and the Sem inole ar e both p olitical and cu ltural . Yet, they also s hare a common Creek heritag e as well as common histo ry in the ir ad aptations since the Seminole wars. 3.2.2Lifestyles and Culture Traditional Creek s ociety was based on cl an s tructure. Th ese clans were matrilineal, that is, traced t hro ugh the m other, and excluded marriage within the clan. Sem inole and M iccosuk ee society have r etained a C reek-based clan str ucture (Spo ehr 19 41). Although som e cla ns have become e xtinct, today the Seminole identify eight clans: Panther, Bear, Deer, Wind, Bigtown, Bird, Snake , and Ot ter. Th ere ha s be en de terioration of clan mar riage pr ohibi tions bec ause of simple demographic facts. Along with this change, it now s eems that althou gh this cl an structure con tinues to exist, the n uclear fam ily app ears a s the m ost important unit of soc ial organization amon g pr esent-day Sem inole and M iccos ukee (Bucuv alas, Bul ger, and Kennedy 1994).

The M iccosuk ee T ribe has a similar tr ibal and business cou ncil and a busin ess co rporat ion that receives Fede ral, state, and pr ivate mon ies. Present-day Seminole and Miccosukee engage in a var iety of economi c activities including cattle ran ching, ga ming, an d tou rism. The M iccosukee T ribe \"owns and operates a res taura nt, gift shop, general store, service station, and Indian Vi llage on the Tamiami Trail Res ervation; an Indian Ga ming facility and Toba cco shop on the Krome Ave nue reservations; and a filling service gas station and plaza on the Alligator Alley Reservation\" (Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida 2002). The re are some indications that gaming and associated activities contribute about 90 percent of the income t o the Miccosukee Tribe. Tr ibal members participate in these activities and derive the majority of their income f rom t ourism a nd gaming activities. Among the nearby Seminole, gaming and tourism represent an equally significant source of income ( Gol dstein and Testerman 1998) . Som e of t hese tourist-related activities include alligator wrestling, museum exhibits, arts and crafts sho ps, exhibition villages, restaurants wit h traditional foods, hunting and fish ing t ours, and \"s wamp safari s.\" T hese types of cult ure-based t ourist activities have sustained the Seminole and Miccosukee since the turn of the century, and they continue to be significa nt sources o f inco me and acti vity for the present day (W est 1999). Religion am ong the Sem inole and M iccosuk ee has blend ed Christi anit y and tradit ional beli efs and p ract Sturt evant 1954a; Buswell 1982). early activities , Europeans and Americ ans have attem pted to convert the Am erican Indians in Fl orida to Christian be liefs and practices. At the turn of the century, Chr istianity appears to ha ve taken root among some Florida Seminole. Episcopal and Baptist churches we re built on the Big Cypr ess and Dania reservations and by the middle of the twentieth cent ury, Christianity was well established a mong t he Fl orida Seminol e. Som e groups con tinued to maint ain tra ditional b eliefs, but at the sam e tim e tradi tional b eliefs and p ract ices based in Creek he ritage coexi sted with Christianity (Bu cuvalas, Bul ger, and Kennedy 1994). The se traditional beliefs share some comm on features of Am erican Indian cosmology, story; em phasis on h arm ony with the land and other peo ples; visions as a source of personal insight, pow er, and co mmunicat ion w ith a diet y; ri tes of passage; trickster stories; belief in the spirits pervading all things; and a shaman or medicine man who l ed ceremonies and provided a source of comm unication with the \"great spirits\" and the o (H 7).Natio nal Park Serv ice 3-7A si gnificant feature of traditional religious beliefs and practices among Seminole and Miccos ukee is a ceremony know n as the Gree n C orn D ance (Capron 1953). Deri ved from traditional Creek pra ctices, this ceremony of thanksg iving and rene wal retains it s meaning f or many American Indians. This ritual is still practiced among the Miccosukee as well as on some Seminole reservations, althou gh with the arrival of Chr istianity in the later nineteenth century, it ceased to be a regular practice for some Seminole (Cov ington 1993). The dance is about a 4- to 7- day ce remony and is usua lly held som etime between late April and June. In general, these cerem onies are closed t o out siders. The purpo se of the dance i s to cel ebrat e a crop o f new corn, hence the name \"green corn.\" A traditional medicine man sets the day for the start of the cerem ony at a loc ation in the wilde rness. A circ ular dance area is prepared , and gro ups build tradit ional chickees (thatched roof hous es with cyp ress fram es) around this focal point. Ritual bathing and purification through consumption of emetic drinks, stickball games, fasting and feastin g, d ancing, sweat b aths, an d consumption of \"new corn\" are e ssential featur es of this ceremony (St urtevant 1954a ; Bucu valas, Bul ger, and Kennedy 1994) . Tra ditional ly, this type of cerem ony prom oted group tion and Among present-day Sem inole and M iccosuk ee, the G reen C orn D ance rem ains an ess enti al expression of t heir cult ure and w ay of lif e. Historica lly, there h ave been two major la ngu age groups am ong Florida Indians: M uskogee and Mikasuki. The M uskogee language is primarily associated with the present-day Seminole and Mikasuki with the Miccosukee. The 1990 Cen sus indicated that there are about 496 Muskogee speakers with 33 mo nolingual out of 1,200 individuals. Of the Mi ccosukee, 98 percent speak M ikasuk i, with 25 percent monolingual. English as well as N ative langu ages are taug ht in lo cal schools, but among the reservation s there appear to be differences in the daily use of these languages. Again, the m ore t radit ional M iccosuk ee appear t o us e their l anguage, wher e residents on re servations su ch as Hollywoo d us e their language less. Language remains an importan t part o f the cultural identity of these groups, but as the older generatio n passes, it rem ains to be seen how widel y Native langu ages w ill persi st among Sem inole and M iccosuk ee speakers. Another centra l them e in t he ethn ograph ic literat ure about t he S eminole and M iccosuk ee peoples is the practice of traditional medicine that traditio nal m edicin e coexists with western m edicine, and m edicine m en a nd w omen st ill hav e viable roles in these soci eties. Elders or \"gifted\" persons use herbs, ro ots, an d other p roducts o f nature to ad dress health issue s. However, as wit h ot her aspects of Seminol e and Miccos ukee cul ture, the knowle dge p associat ed w ith tra ditional m edicine ar e con sidered t o be inform ation for tr ibal members and not out siders. Conseque ntly, there is som e infor mation r egarding t he us es of plants and nat ural product s as remedi es, and l ess infor mation abou t the cer emonies, practices, and meanings of trad ition al m edicin e as it is p racticed tod ay. 3.2.3Sociocultural Issues For m any Am erican Indi ans, maintaining cu ltural traditions a nd i dent ity is an impor tant soci o- cultural issue . The or moder nization i s ongoi ng for many t ribal groups and oft en r esult s in social disrupti ons and psychoso cial prob lem s that have yne Nationa ilies , an communities . are w ell d ocumented in anges in tradit ional ways of life. Today, both the Sem inole and M iccos ukee maintain cul tural traditions a nd a distinct cultural and political identity. Tr aditional food, dress, crafts, music, language, and other aspects of culture remain part of the daily traditions. Howe ver, there are changes in the Ever glades ecosyst em that affect traditional hunt ing, fishing, and a griculture. T here are also adapta tions such as gam ing and resort hotels t hat provide new resources as w ell as new chal leng es for tribal members. Maintaining t heir culture whil e adapting t o the m oder nization of A merican so ciet y in gen eral is perhaps the great est challenge and the largest socioc ultural issue for the Seminole and Miccosukee. Maint aining or asserting their cultural identity and traditional rights are among the more promi nent issues that may affect the interaction of BISC with the S eminole and M iccosuk ee i n the M iam i-Dade are a. Importantly, the inc reased economic status of these trib es may also result in the ab ility to devote m ore tim e an d effort to issues su ch as cult ural resources and tradit ional w ays of life. Moreover, these types of issues may h ave i ncreasing im portance as Sem inole and M iccosuk ee con tinue t o adapt t o n ew soci ocul tural circumstances and find meaning in cultural and natural resources that were onc e part of the ir histo ry. 3.3 Cuban-Am ericans Cuba and Florida ar e separat ed by som e 90 m iles of water, but w ithin the h eart of M iam i thrives a soci ety and culture that is reminiscent of a pre-Castro Cuba n lifestyle.

The se different phases w ere f ueled by eco nomic or sociop olitical conditions in Cub a, especially the 1959 Cuban revolut ion, i n w hich Bati sta was deposed by forces led by F idel Castro. Prior t o the C uban revolutio n, the Spanish Americ an War and the Machado dictato rship also pushed immigra nts to the Un ited States.

Alt hough t he num ber of immigration wa ves described v aries, there is general agreement that each wave can b e characterized by particular sociocultural characteristics. For purposes of this assessment, we can identify five different pha ses of immigration: the first covers the time period prior to 1959; the s econ d, the period betw een 19 59 and 1 961; the third betw een 19 62 and 1 973; the M ariel period bet ween 1973 a nd 1980; and t he post 1980 per iod. Next the ch arac teristics of each of these phase s and i mmigrant soci ocul tural cha racteristics a re briefly des cribed. Phase I - Pre -1959 R evolution In the lat ter part of t he n ineteenth century, Cuban s who immigra ted to t he U nite d Stat es generally we nt to Ne w Y ork or other cities of the Nor theast. It is estimated that during the 1890s, there were l ess than 2 0 C uban s residing in t he M iam i area. Sub sequently, polit ical turm oil i n C uba and the S panish-A merican W ar push ed im migra nts int o the no rtheastern Unite d Stat es as w ell as int o Florida. Another grou p of C uban s asso ciat ed w ith the cigar- making industry also established themselves in the Tampa area. Howe ver, it was not until the mid-1930 s that the C uban pop ulat ion in F lorida increased primarily as a r esult of po litical turb ulence in the ir homelan d. A group of relative ly afflu ent Cubans estab lish ed residence in the M iam i Beach area , while a les s affluent gro up of student activis ts es tablish ed a co lony in downtow n M iam i. Litt le Havana becam e ho me for m any of t hese im migra nts, and they proceeded to establish themselves as property owne rs and bus iness persons (Boswe ll and Cur tis 1991:45). D espi te ongoing political turmoil in Cub a, ties betwee n M iami and Havana increased with re gular com mercial flights be tween the t wo cities, which fa cilitated com merce that furt her soli dified links bet ween M iam i and H avana C uban s. Th e Cuban pop ulat ion grew prim arily as a result of the ongoing political turmoil and, as before, the refugees we re ofte n educated professionals and successful businessmen. The Miami Cuban comm unity also became home to several exiled past leaders, i ncludin g Geral do Machado and C arlos P rio. Indeed, i t was Prio who led a gro up of Cubans out o f Biscayne Bay in 1957 to b egin the figh t again st B atista that eventually resulted in the se cond pha se of Cuba n m igration t o the Un ited States. Pha se II - 1959-1961 It is e stim ated tha t there were about 2 0,000 Cubans in Miam i in 1958 (Boswell an d Curtis 1991:145). However, this changed wi th Ca stro's overthrow of Batista and his subseque nt political and ec onom ic act ions. This resulted in a new w ave of Cuba n immigration t o Fl orida and particularly M iami. Thi s Pha se II immigration resulted in 250,00 persons settling in the United States between 1959 a nd 1961. Th is group i s often char acterized as the \"g olden e xiles\"3-12 Bisca yne Overvie w and A ssessmen tbecause they were com pose d of attorneys, physi cians, and ot her professional and busi ness persons who we re wel l educated. The y brought with them wea lth and business acume n and they foun d an established Cu ban comm unity in whi ch to reestablish their business and professional lives. The preexist ing Cuba n com munity in Little Havana, although sm all, facilitated reestablishing their businesses if not their cultural lives. In fa ct, it is argued that the establish ed community in combination with the fin ancial res ources of th ese im migra nts provided employment and business opportunities that mitigated pressures for assimilation and facilitated re tention of Cuban culture. Pha se III - 1962-1973 The third ph ase of immigra tion b etween 19 62 and 1 973 is ch aracterized by a m ore heterogeneou s po pulat ion. By this ti me, Castro instituted l imitations on the finan cial resources that refugees could take with them and thus, those arriving in this wave did not have the same econ omic capit al as did ear lier immigra nts. This group i s descri bed as being co mposed o f more trade smen, mechanics, fish erm en, an d cler ks w ho had les s formal education tha n the ir predecessor s. Fewer men a nd m ore child ren and women t han pr evious wav es also char acterizes this wave (Soruco 1996: 8). An other difference for this wave is their dispersion to different are as of the U nite d Stat es. This d ispersion w as an intended feat ure of t he C uban Refugee Pro gram that w as to address their i mmigra tion to Florida, and M iam i in particula r. Under provisions of this program , Cuban immigra nts w ere gi ven financial and o ther incen tives to relocate from M iami to Ne w Y ork, New Jersey, and other states. Be twee n 1962 and 1973, approximately 300,000 Cubans were relo cated away fro m Miam i un der th e au spices of this program (Per ez 1992: 87). However, by a s early as 1972, there was a \"return flow\" phenom enon in whi ch thos e who we re relocated elsewher e began returning to Mia mi: \"Data from t he 1980 Cen sus indicate that 55 percent of the Cuba ns who mov ed to Mia mi betwee n 1975 and 1980 arrive d from another state, as o pposed to arriv ing from a fo reig n country\" (Boswell and Curtis 1991:141). These m igra tions to Miami were m otivated m ore by person al ties and cult ural imperative s than by the prospect of e conomic enhancement. Phase IV - 19 73-198 0 M ariel After 197 2, the high t ide of immigra tion receded un til about 198 0 when Castro op ened the po rt of M ariel to em igra tion that result ed in abou t 125,000 addit ional C uban s enteri ng the U nite d Stat es. As with prior w aves, this grou p had uniq ue ch aracteristics: a bout 60 percent were m ale, 22 percent women, 18 percent minors (Po rtes and Ste pick 199 3). Others s uggest t hat t his w ave of immigrants represented Cu ba's population compos ition of construction and manufacturing workers, who w ere you nge r and cont ained more Bl acks a nd M prior waves immigra nts (Soruco 1996:9). Castro also released inm ates from prison and som e from mental institutio ns, an d this w ave of im migra nts became charac terize d as crim inals, misfits, \"s cum,\" and otherwise socially undesirable individuals. Howe ver, only about 15 percent of the 125,000 immigra nts had crim inal records and 4 percent ap pear to h ave ser ved prison time for offenses that w ould n ot have re sult ed in prison term s in the U nited Stat es (Bo swell and C urtis 199 1:154 ). However, this elem ent of th is immigra nt wave rec eive d significant att ention in the press to generall y stigm atize t he en tire M ariel group (S uroco 1996). There is som e suggesti on that Cuban immigrants were a lso sti gmatized by the M ariel (Bo swell and C urtis 199 1:154 -155 ).National Park Service 3-13Ultimately, som e M ariel immigra nts w ere det ained and im prison ed and others w ere r eturned to Cuba. Pha se V - Pos t-1980 After the 1980s, the United States instituted new i mmigration policies that chang ed the f low of Cuban immigrants. Furthermore, there had been p ressure t o ch ange the 19 66 Cuban -American Adjustment Act , whi ch allows Cu bans to become l egal immigrants after one year. In 1984, the United States and Cuba negotiated agreements that were intende d to nor malize migration fr om Cuba to the Uni ted States by allowi ng up to 20,000 immigrants, 3,000 political prisoners, and 2,000 immediat e fam ily members for a t otal of 25 ,000 per year. This agreem ent w as susp end ed by Castro in 1987 and subsequently reinstat ed. However, betw een 19 84 and1 994, the U nite d Stat es issued o nly abo ut 11,000 im migra tion visas. Socioecon omic cond itions in Cuba changed during the m id-1990 s, and in respon se to unrest relat ed to t hese con ditions , Castro al low ed Cuba ns to leave in small boats and other craft. The results we re chaotic, and ultimately the Unite d Stat es and C astro nego tiated a m ore orderly process for this wave of r efugees (Gonz ales-Pando 1998). Thi s 1995 agreem ent limi ted immigration to the Uni ted States and permitted thos e who f eared political persecution. Thi s agreement allows a bout 4,000 persons a year t o en ter the U nite d Stat es, a nd all Cu ban s can app ly for a lottery under the S pecial Cuban Migration Progr am tha t allows up to 20,000 additional persons. About 30,000 r efugees from Cuba en tered t he U nite d Stat es as a re sult of t he 1 994 ex odus from Cuba. Th e sociocu ltural char acteristics of these immigrants are less well described i n the literature than pr ior waves of immigra nts. However, they are individuals w ith relat ives in F lorida or elsew here w ho were seeking relief from the s ocial and eco nomic cond itions in C uba po st di ssolution o f the S oviet Uni on. Some have suggested that these immigrants have more in comm on with the post-1959 and p re-Mariel Cuban immigra nts (cf.

The h eart of this area is SW Eighth St reet, otherwise know n as Cal le Ocho , along with the area bet ween 12th an d 27t h Avenues. Most of the comm ercial establishments are on Calle Ocho, and a large portion of the remainder of the area is residential.

O ne is the practice o f mutual as sistance and the other is an \"ethnic encl ave\" that influenced the soc ioeconom ic condi tions f or Cuba n-Americans. Th e process of mutual assistance is expresse d in municipios, a featur e o f C uban so ciety im migra nts reconst ituted in the Un ited States. These organizations, know n as Los M unicipios de Cu ba en el Ex ilio (Cuban Municipali ties i n Exile), are a n etwork of m utual assist ance group s that existed in Cuba.

The se types of organi zations offered ne w immigrants an exi sting networ k of contacts and mutual support that buffered the transition i nto a new soci al and cul tural milieu. Toda y these organizations hav e grown into a source of political power and influence, but they retain an important function of promot ing social solidarity wi thin the Cuba n comm unity.

Suc h organizat ions also ind icat e a com munity that is trying t o recreate a soci al env ironment similar to their hom eland. The C uban com munity in M iam i also form ed w hat can be ter med an ethnic en clav e that fur ther assisted their adaptation to new soc ioeconomi c circumst ances. Acc ording to Pe rez, quoting Por tes and Bach (1985:203), an enclave is \"a distinctive economi c formation, characterized by the spatial concentration of immi grants who organize a variety of enterprises to serve their own ethnic market and t he g ene ral popul ation\" ( Port es 1987: 90). Boswel l and C urtis (1 991) a lso suggest that C ubans estab lish ed a true e conomic enclav e in Miam i. Miam i's Hispanics have establish ed their own economic enclav e that caters particu larly (but n ot on ly) to th e Latin Americ an market. In this enclav e, it is p ossible to tran sact all business n egoti ations in Sp anish and to use Latin business custom s, thus making it easie r for newly-arrived im migra nts to b ecome in corporated quickly into th e H ispanic economi c mainstream. The initial capital and entrepreneurial skills used to establish the enclav e were provided by the earliest waves of im migra nts w ho left C uba in the early 1960s. The later flows o f refugees sustained its grow th and allowe d it to reach a sufficie nt size for econ omies of scale to b e devel oped. As m ore recent waves con tributed im migra nts w ho were som ewhat l ess e ducated and less sk illed, theyNational Park Service 3-15provided a cross secti on of la borers t hat w ould all ow for a more vert ically int egrat ed local ethnic econo my to develop (Bo swell and C urtis 199 1:151 ). This enc lave process su stains t he l ifestyle of Miami- Dade Cubans. Th ey a re ow ners of constru ctio n, fin ance, retail, and wholesale b usinesses, an d the y supply goods and servic es to other im migra nts as w ell as t he larger Miami po pulat ion. H owever, it is t he \" insti tutional completen ess\" of this ethnic en clav e that is un ique: a nearly full ran ge of services and products exists that allow s individual s to l ive within their ow n co mmunities (Perez 19 92:91). Such an enclave clearly provides economi c as well as social benefits, since not only familiar goods and services are available, but also e mploym ent and soci al suppor t in the form of existing ne tworks. Perez also suggests that the enclave has assisted the overall economic circumst ances of Hispanics b y all owing for cult ural ly appropriate part icipati on of fem ales in t he labor m arket (Perez 199 2:92). That is, within the enclave where fam ily and fri end ship con tacts ex ist, women find oppor tunities that might otherwise not exist. The e ffect is to hav e a relatively hig h ra te of particip ation by fem ales in the Cuban work force, an d this dir ectly c ontribu tes to the ir econ omic st atus. Th e enclave a lso otes t he rete ntion of tr adit ional cult ure, but pressures for ass imilation and accult urat ion ex ist within Cuban com munities, and there ar e report ed inte Lopez 20 00). However, differences betwee n adults and adolescents regarding traditional values are comm on among diverse social and cul tural groups. Althou gh the Cuba n enclave is described as promot ing social solidarity, economi c mobility, cultural ex pression, as well as mitigatin g assimilation pressures, there are c ritics who argu e it has adverse ef fect other i populat ions , part icula rly Blacks (Mohl 1991 ; Dunn 1997). The \" special st atus\" accorded earl y Cuban immigra nts as political refugees, which has caus ed som e tensions with other C aribbean im migra nts, especial ly H aitians, allow ed for financial assistance and ot her incent ives that were not available to ot her immigrants or minori ty groups. This aided the f ormation of encl aves that promoted the econom ic su ccess of Miami- Dade Cuba ns. In f act, Dunn (1997) argues that Cuba n succ ess is dir ectly related to the lack of succ ess amon g M iami Bl acks: The Cuba n influx succeeded not only in di verting attention from Miami Blacks during the crucial integration period, but also by virtue of their greater social acceptability and entreprene urial ski lls.

Spani sh in Miami- Dade Count y bec ame a political if not a cultural issue for C uban s. In 1973, an ordinanc e was passed in D ade C oun ty that identi fied the C oun ty as bilingua l. This political acknow ledg ment of the r eality of Spani sh as a significant lang uage issue in the comm unity was responded to with a g rass-roots ca mpaign in 1980 w ith the intention of establishing an \"Engl ish onl y\" pol icy for the cou nty (Cast ro 1992: 119). The effect of this pol icy was to prohibit the u se of public monies for language use other than Eng lish, including the banning of fire safety information pamphlets in Spanish, Spanish marriage ceremonies, and Spani sh si gns f or publ ic transpor tation. This initiative was not suppor ted by a wide spectrum of Anglos or Black s, but it did pass and indicated some of the ten sions within Dade County regarding the emergence of Hispanics as a powerful political, economic, an d cultural fo rce, with language being the auditory expression of that p resenc e.

These Cuban Jews are par t of a growing po pulatio n of Hispanic Jew s who are im migra ting from various Latin Am erican countries. Betwee n 5,000 and 6,000 Hispanic Jews are estimated to be in Miami and about 3 ,000 of those are C uban (Roth 1999). It is es timated tha t abo ut 9 0 percent of all Jew s in Cuba im migra ted to t he U nite d Stat es in t he early 196 0s, about 5,000 person rdic and Ashke nazic elements are represented in this co mmunity.

T he s pecific i ssues of rel igiosity are not as vi gorou sly discus sed a nd, as w ith Cuban Catholi cs, the e mphasi s is on hom eland and diaspor a. Th ese are the types of issue s that reflect the h istorical realities of a displaced popul ation. Rel igion bec omes anot her cultural expr ession or reflection of concerns about home land, culture, and identity. Santeria Santeria or La Reg la Lukumi is a religious tradition based in the spiritual beliefs of the Yor uba or Lu kumi people of West Africa. The Lu kumi wer e transported to the Ca ribbean and elsewher e as slaves, especially by t he e arly Spani sh expl orers of the r egion. Santeria (Way o f the S aint s) deriv es it s nam e from the p ract ice of sla ves convert ed to C atholicism who were observed praying to saints in stea d of to C hrist. These Yoruba disguised the practice o f their native b elief s by praying to the saints, an d this is part o f the origin of the blending of Catholic and Yor uba traditions that is now sa id to be practiced by betwee n 75,000 to 100,000 persons in southeast Florida. Many of these practitioners can reportedly be traced to the persons who came to s outh Florida fro m the Mariel im migra tion . The p rimary deit y of Santeri a is th e rem ote god kn own as O lodum are, but deit ies kno wn as orishas are the subject s for many of the da ily rituals and pr actices among Sa nteria believers. These orishas function m uch l ike saints in Catholi cism, wherein saints intercede on beha lf of hum ans to solve life problems or protect hum ans from har m and m isfortune. Th e blendi ng of Catholic an d Santeria tra ditions is w ell illust rated in O chun, who is t he o risha of l ove, femininity, and ri vers, and i s sai d to assist women in chi ldbirth. Th e Cat holi c manifestation of Ochun is Ou r Lady of C harit y, w ho is the patron saint of C uba. Th e com monly evoked orishas are assoc iated w ith the forces of nature over w hich they are believ ed to have con trol: Elegba, road and door s; Ogun, iron, war, and l abor ; Oshosi, hunt ing a nd track ing; Obat ala, father of other orishas and cr eativity and justice; Oya, winds; Yemaya, seas and l akes; Shang o, lightning, fire, and t hunder ; and Orunm ila, wisdom and di vination. Orishas also hav e an as soci ated color or co lors; a nu mber, fo od, an d dance; an d an em blem or other manifestation . A s in Catholicism, there is an associated feast day associated for each orisha. Huma ns invoke the power s of the orishas through rituals of sacrifice and praise. Divination (Ifa), possession, and dance rituals know n as bembes are essen tial aspects of Santeri a, as is the us e of herb s and other \"botanical s\" in rit uals and for medicinal purpo ses. San teria pract ices are usually presided over by a pri est or priest ess. ( Canizares 199 3). Celebrations and Customs Among H ispanics, including Cubans, the impor tance of the family is expre ssed in the esence of celebrations a nd r ituals associ ated with key l ife events. For Cuba ns, life cycl e events suc h as baptism , birt hdays, and the passage of girl s into adolescence ( quin cea\u00f1 era) are marked by Sim ilarly, for a dult s, m arriage s are of ten formal religious cerem onies with elab orate b anquets after wards. W akes are h eld for departed frien ds an d fam ily, and the ir grave sites are visited on ho ly days and secular holidays, such as Mot her's or Father's Da y and the deceased's birthda y. In both Hialeah and Little Havana, there are speciality mer chants whoNational Park Service 3-19cater to the dem and fo r the flow ers, dresses, t uxedos , catering, and other accou term ents t hat accompany the se celebratio ns and rem embrances. Soci al life for Miami- Dade's Cuban com munities also i nclude s th e celebration of various secular and religious holidays. Cel ebration of New Yea r's Da y is often accompa nied by the practice of emptyi ng a bucket of water into the st reet to rid house s of the t roubles of the pa st year. January 28 is a day for parades and celebration of the birthda y of Jose Marti, a hero of the Cuban independence mo vement against the Spanish at the turn of the last century. The Miami Carnaval is the Mardi Gras, an d more, o f M iam i-Dade C ounty, w hich is c eleb rated with parades, Latin mus ic and dance, feasts, with a few religious overtones asso ciated wi th the observance of L ent. Other significant holidays include M ay 20 , which celebra tes C uba's independenc e from Spai n and December 28, the Day of the Innoce nts (when King Herod is said to have killed innocent babies). The tone of this holiday is secular, having the char acteristics of April Fool 's day in American Culture (Bu cuvalas, Bulger, and Kenne dy 1994:90-93). Culture is also ex pressed in ever yday foo d, m usic, and o ther entert ainm ent. The everyday foods of Cuban-Americ ans ex press the inters ection of African and Carib bean traditio ns with yam s, pl anta ins, okra, and grains ch aracteristic ditions . Tradit ional m eals are beans, ric e, an d a m eat d ish, with pork the preferre d meat, fo llow ed by beef and chicken. Sm all family-owned g rocery stores know n as Bodeg as sell caf\u00e9 cuba no, a staple of Cuba n life; fresh fruits; rice and blac k beans; and perhaps a tamarind fruit drink. Bo degas are pervasive and reflect the re establishm ent of C uba n culture in sout h Flor ida (Bucuv alas, Bul ger, and Kennedy 1994:82:84). In the neighb orh oods o f Hialeah and Little Havana, visitors are likely t o hear a variety of Latin and especially Cub an mus ic. As with food, this music expresses both Sp anish, African, and blended traditions. Some of the African traditions are expressed in rich musi c and dance associated wi th the practice of Santeria, bu t Salsa music rich wi th trumpe ts and trombones is a core form of music expression in Cuban neighborhoods. Other popular forms of entert ainm ent i nclude p laying dom inoes and f ishing, especiall y with a han d line (kn own as jojo fi shing) (Bucuvalas, Bulger, and K enn edy 1994:94-96). 3.3.3Sociocultural Issues Exile Culture A them e that pervades Cuba n culture in Flor ida is the notion of a peopl e in e xile who expect to ret urn to t heir ho meland. This i s term ed \"exile cult ure. \" C uban s have been ch aracterized as preoccupied with the political, e conomic, and social issues in their homelan d, but esp ecially political issues. Perez suggests four characteristics of exile ideology: 1. The primacy of issues and concerns that d eal with the political status of the hom eland. 2. Unco mprom ising struggle ag ainst an d hostility to ward th e current Cuban government. 3. Lack of debate allowe d about the \"exile ideology\" within for the Repu blican amon g Cuba ns within Miam i. (Perez 1992:95-96). He als o suggests this ide ology is su stain ed by the prep ion, t he p resence am ong those perso ns of t hose w ho left more for polit ical reas ons, an d the presence of the en clav e th at facilitates communication and focus about ex ile ideology (P erez 199 2:98-99 ). Part of \"exile cu lture\" has alw ays been the belief tha t return to C uba was imminent. In part, holding on to this belie f also en tails the no tion that part icipation in the A merican p olitical process or registering to vote or otherwise inve sting in the exiled hom e was l ess than pa triotic. Howe ver, after the Bay of Pi gs and the persistence of Ca stro in p olitical power , Cuba n- Am ericans began a new pr ocess of participating in social, economi c, and political arenas in a way they ha d not previously: By the later part of the 1970s, the old dilemma betwee n compe ting allegiances to Cu ba and the U nite d Stat es w as fi nall y overcom e, open ing t he w ay to m assive A merican citizenship an d voter regi stration d rives. During t he d ecade, the n umber of C uban s who became Americ an citize ns m ore th an doubled. It w ould be m isleading, h owever, to assume th at all t hose who adopted United States citize nship had actually rep lace d the ir sens e of ident ity as Cuba n exi les for that of ethnic immigrants (Gonza les-Pando 1998:60). Exile cult ure rem ains a signifi cant issue among Cuban s in Miam i-Dade Coun ty as evi den ced by community re sponses to the retur n of Elian Gonzalez to h is father in Cuba. T hat is, ex ile culture frames the i nterpretation of events in par ticular ways and suggests the m orals, values, and acti ons that should b e taken in an event such as t he E lian G onzale z case. Som e auth ors have suggested that, as the waves of im migra nts w ho fled from the Castro re volutio n pass, ex ile cult ure m ay dim inish in it s intensit y (P erez 199 2). Assimilation For a minori ty immigrant popul ation, th a cul blendi ng i nto or \"ass imilating\" into t he d ominant cult ure as part of t he \" melting po t\" pro cess in A merican culture. Assim ilation i s a conce rn f or Cuba n as well as all other immigrants in M iami- Dade Count y, but the literature suggests som e particular issue s abou t Cuba n assimilation. One i ssue conce rns how the e nclave econom y suppor ts the m aintenance of Cuba n identity, lang uage usage, an d lifes tyle . The ex isten ce of the allo ws individuals an d fam ilies to lis ten to Cuban music, eat eth nic fo ods, speak the ir native language, co nduct bu siness in a cu lturally familiar style, an d to o therw ise maintain a C uban fram e of ref erence in eve ryday life. E xile culture also works a gainst assimilation by est ablishing a frame of reference that in the pa st promot ed the notion of eventual return to Cu ba; this perspective inhibited assimilation into the dominant culture. Similarly, the first wav es of post-revolutionary immigrants wer e older and more established in their own c ulture and this inhibited assimilation (Perez 1992:93). Am ong the Americ an-born children of im migra nts, the re is evid ence of selec tive ad option of aspects of do minant cult ure and co ncern within Cuban families about the erosion of traditional culture.National Park Service 3-21However, the process of assim ilation am ong Cuban youth suggests t hat a Cuban -American identity is emerging, alo ng with concerns about \"which culture\" and \"what ide ntity\" represents authen tic experience g., Bett inger- Lopez 20 00). Econom ic Encl ave The ec onomic e nclave establish ed by Cuban refu gees in Miam i has rec eive d considerab le attenti on in academ ic literat ure (e.g., Porte s and Bach 1985). Porte s and Bach suggest t hat an eco nomic enclave is a particular structure in w hich there is a \"spa tial conce ntration of immigrants who organize a variety of enterprises to serve their own e thnic market and the general populat ion\" (Porte s and Bach 1985:203). The ex istence o f hum an and monetary capit al established a rang e of busi ness es and services among Cuban i mmigrants that also r esulted in additional employm ent and busi ness oppor tunities for new w aves of immigrants. Th ese businesses es tabli shed a foun dation o n which a wide range of small bus inesses an d pro fession al servi ces developed to serve new immigrants. The literature also suggests that Cuban s ow n more businesses and have a better socioeconomic st atus than other immigrants (Perez 1992). The econom ic enclave pr ocess is a partial expl anation for the su ccess of Miami Cubans si nce it also explains the economic basis for their upward mob ility in south Fl orida society in general. As noted earl ier, the en clav e has p rovided t he range o f servi ces and opp ortunit ies t hat have allowed Cuba ns to sust ain cultural practices and ways of life they l eft behi nd i n their hom eland. This has not only buffered the effects of discrimination and assimilation but also asserts a cultural presence that author s suggest defines the cultural milieu that is Mi ami-Dade Cou nty. Thi s cultural presence itself reinforces the enclave process and validates the ways of life and tradit ions of C uban herit age i n the presen ce of a dom inant cult ure. 3.4 African icans The lit erat ure rega rding peo ples of A frican American des cent i n so uth Florida addresses African Am ericans as we ll as Haitians, Cuba ns, Bahamians, and other Caribbean peoples. The existing literature usually refers to these peopl es as \"Blacks\" ( e.g., Mohl 1991; Dunn 1997). For consistency with the se conven tion s, w e refer t o the African Americ an populatio ns in Miam i- Dade C oun ty as B lacks. This p opulat ion is disti ngu ished from Haitians, Cuban s, and other groups t hat also hav e Afr ican anc estry, but who are ethnic ally distinct from African Americans. Howe ver, the literature indicates that Blacks from t he Bahamas, Haiti, and elsew here in the Caribbea n hav e intermarried with A merican Bl ack r esulting o f custom s and tradit ions . W e no te w here these c ross-fertilization issues are impor tant, but this discus sion foc on e Americans. 3.4.1Pop ulation and Soci al History Popu lation Preliminary 2000 Cen sus results indicate there are approximately 457,214 Af rican Am ericans in M iam i-Dade C oun ty, or abou t 20 percent of the 200 0 Census tot al pop ulat ion. In 19 90 there wer e about 360,000 Blacks or about 22 percent of the population. Since the turn of the century, the range of the Black population in M iami-Dade Cou nty ha s been betwee n 26 Bisca yne Nationa aphic ssessmen tand 3 5 percent ( 1910), with a low of 17 percent in 1980 (M ohl 1991 :112). Several sou rces regarding black demography in M iami-Dade Cou nty (Mohl 1991; Dun n and Stepick 19 97) suggest the followi ng no tewor thy i ssues in b lack pop ulation trends and compos ition: 1)There is a h isto ry of stead y gro wth in the black populatio n in south Florida an d particu larly Miami- Dade Count y since the e arly pa rt of this century.

Interstate migration accounted for the majority of this growt h, with Geo rgia, the Carolinas, and states of the northeast being primary sources of migrants. Blacks were drawn to so uth Florida and M iam i because of w ork o pportunit ies, prim arily in the tourist indus try and railroads. These early migrants worked primarily as uns killed laborers (M ohl 1991 :118). 3)Blacks are m ore con centra ted in so uth Florida an d especiall y Miam i, but overa ll, Florida's black po pulat ion h as decreased w hereas Miam i-Dade's black po pulat ion h as increased (Dunn 1997:335-336). Be tween 1970-1980, the black populatio n grew by 47 percent, a rate exceeded o nly b y Atlanta, Georgia. Miam i becam e 1 of on ly 16 major m etropo litan areas with a black populatio n of more th an 300,000 (Dunn and Stepick 1992:50). 4)In recent decades, Miami-Dade's black population has increased as a result of immigration, primarily from Caribbea n immigrants. In 1980 abou t 20 percent of the bl ack popul ation was foreign bor n (Dunn and Stepick 1992: 49). Th is trend cont inued throug h the 1980s: By 1990, one in fou r Dade Blac ks was born in the Carib bean, prim arily in Haiti and the West Indies. There were 117,000 foreig n-born Black s in Dade County in 19 90, about 30 percent o f the total . The b ulk of these, abou t 99,000 or 25 p er- cent . . . , were born in the C aribbean, i ncludin g Puert o Rico (D unn 1997:336 ).National Park Service 3-23Table 3.4.

Rega rding t his trend Dunn note s: The pa st decade app ears to hav e been marked by t wo cont rasting but not cont radictory mov ements of the Black po pulat ions . On one h and, t here h as been an ex pan sion of t he p opulat ion and size o f majorit y-Black areas; on the o ther, there was a more wid espread move ment of Blacks into formerly all-White areas.

Dunn also notes th at ne ighborhood racial se grega tion is a c harac teris tic o f black residence with more than 80 percent of the black population living in ne arly co ntiguous comm unities; current residential and population patterns suggest this trend will continue (Dunn 1997:341-342).

However, there is wh at appears to be a myth, or per haps j ust shal low history, about the pr esence of a black pirate who roa med Biscayne Ba y and env irons. Dunn q uotes the logs of Commodor e Ral ph Monroe , one of the e arly expl orers and r esident s of Biscayne Ba y as follows: We enter ed Biscay ne B ay through Caesar' s Creek, a long and w inding ch ann el. . . . Here we wer e again investe d wit h the spi rit of piracy, for this was the st ronghol d of Black Cea sar, a giant negro , who t ook toll from pa ssing vessels along the reef. . . . (Dunn 1997:10). Black C aesar, who may have been the Black Sem inole Joh n Caesar, suggests t hat Blacks h ave been part of the soci al history of sout h Fl orida since the days of the earliest Spa nish expl orers. They worked as domestics and con structed o utposts fo r the S pan ish; som etimes they escaped and live d w ith American In dians. Th e \"Black Sem inoles\" (Porte r 1996) becam e a r ecogn ized group among the Sem inole, part icipati ng fully in the tradit ions and s ocial life of t he tri be. Th ey also fought alon gside other S eminole in the Second Seminole W ar. Thro ugh out t he early and lat er peri ods of ex plorat ion and developm ent, black slaves a s well a s freemen we re part of the population who o ften he ld the tough jobs of clearing and developing the land. Dur ing the British period (1763-1784), large indigo, rice, sugar, and cotton plantations were established, and large numbe rs of slaves from Sierra Leone were brought in to work. At the conc lusion of the Am erican Revolution, Florida returned Spa nish cont rol . . . advan tage of t he ch aos of w ar and the s ubsequent colonial t ransfer to escape British control. Unt old numbe rs found sanctuary among the Seminole nation. . . . Others . . . claimed refuge among t he i ncom ing Spa niards on t he g rounds of religious con versi on . . . (Lan 3-25The black populatio n continu ed to g row as the Spanish ruled Florida betw een 1784-1821. This increase occurred from na tural population growt h, the importation of new sl aves, and t he migra tion from other st ates of runaw ay and ex-slaves seeking refuge i n Florida. The K eys as well as other part s of Florida w ere a lso a desti nati on for Bah amian Blacks, w ho also co ntri buted to Florida's grow ing black po pulat ion (M ohl 1991 ). Som e est imates sugges t that B lacks were abou t 27 percent of the pop ulat ion, and by 1814, this n umber rose to about 57 p ercent ( Landers 1996:178). With the arrival of the Am ericans after the war of 1812, the social climate for Blacks deteriorated. Black troops had fought against the Am ericans, and sentiments about free Blacks among the Americans resulted in the emigration of some Blacks to both Cuba and Mexico. Free Blacks suf fered si gnificant dis crim inat ion unde r American ru le, and t he sl ave popu lation swelled as la nd was clea red o surprisi Florida's secess ion d he C ivil War was a m arker of t he im portance of slaves i n the st ate. However, after t he w ar, the freed sla ves found their l ives no t much im proved as they w orked as sharecr oppers and tenan t farm ers and, as the ra il lines pus hed sou th, they also fo und w ork as labor ers. By t he t urn of the t wentieth cent ury, civil rights pr omised as part of Reconst ruction rem ained t o be im plem ented. Although Blacks w ere a signifi cant propo rtion o f the tota l populat ion, at the 1 885 State Constitutional Conventi on, only 8 of the t otal 108 delegat es w ere Black (Proctor 1996:274-275). Civil rights wer e further eroded by es tablishing a poll tax and mandated sch ool segre gation. In the n ew state, the p rom ises of L incoln w ere not ones that were uniformly implemented, and ci vil rights cont inued as a significant issue for Flor ida's black popul ations. Unt il the 1960s, a slavery mentality persisted among the White residents of M iam i and elsewher e in Flor ida (Dunn a nd St epick 1992) . Civil rights were ignor ed or unde rmined and, in the worst cas es, Blac ks were subject to rac ially motivated vio lence: Forced to live in a se gregated and unjust so ciety, B lack s were freq uently s ubjected to lynch ings a nd mob violence. Bet ween 19 00 and 1 917 app roximately ninety Black m en and women were lynched in the State. Their \"misdeed s\" ranged from insulting White women, t o a refusal to give up la nd, to all eged rape and m urder. . . . Whites w ere respon sible for m ore t han fifty lyn chings b etween 19 18 and 1 930 (Jones 1 996:379 ). Nonet heless, after 1900 many Bla cks Sout hern states migrated ic oppor tunities. Car olinas, as well as the Nort heast were sour ces of migrants to Florida whe re they found wor k on the railroads, in the tourist industry, and in the fields a nd ca ttle ranches of Florida's agricultural indust ry. At t he sa me time, Bahamians also migra ted into south Florida seeking economic opportun ities. Of the 966 identified Black s in the 1 900 Census for M iam i, about 212 (22 p ercent) were B ahamians, 392 (4 1 percent) were native-born B lacks, and the remainder wer e fr om t he Ca rolinas, Alabama, Virginia, and elsew here. As they w ere in slave times, Blacks becam e an e ssen tial part of the labor force that was nece ssary to develop F lorida in t he tw enti eth century. Although black em ploy ment w as mostly in the l abor and se rvice indust ries, there was a lso a black pr ofessional class of phy sicians, attorneys, teachers, and business owne rs that developed betwee n the turn of the century and the early 1960s. Howe ver, the socioeconomi c status of most black Fl oridians rem A ssessmen tAfter M iam i was incorpo rated in 1896, there was al ready an establi shed black co mmunity that began to grow immediately after the turn of the century. Sout h M iami, Homestead, and Fl orida City we re among the earliest black se ttlements. By 1910, Blacks wer e 42 percent of the popul ation. Foll owing conf licts with their neighbor s, som e of whom were whit e, an or dinance was passed that ess enti ally esta blished raci al zon ing. Blacks becam e concentra ted in what w as termed \"colored town,\" wh ich later became Overtown just on the outskirts of downtown Miami. A Baha mian-based black comm unity developed in Coconut Grove to the sou th and a lso along the railroad tracks towa rd Hom estead whe re black farmers took up residence. Blacks becam e con centra ted in these area s as a resul t of this racial zon ing, a nd a pat tern of residenti al segregatio n became charac teris tic o f M iam i (M ohl 1991:123). As the city d eveloped and demands for business space increased, there were further ef forts to relocate and concentrate Blacks in areas away from Overtown, which was adjacent to the central Miami busi ness district. Th is include d the const ruction of Interstate 95 (I-95), which disp laced Bl acks f rom Over town to m ake room for the i nterstate and t o cr eate room for expa nsion of the busi ness district (Dunn 1997:157) . Th e Li berty Squar e area, nor thwest of Miami, was designated for new bl ack residences in a hou sing project known as Liberty Ci ty. This fu rther expressed a pat tern of intent ional segrega tion o f Blacks into part icula r neigh borho ods, pri marily in t he areas no rthwest of M iam i, that w as evi den t in t he interv al betw een 1940 and the 1960s (Mohl 1991:134). T he overall effe ct of these po licie s was to c reate the current pattern of residential segregation in M iami-Dade Cou nty. The effects of this pattern of residential segregation include a heightening of racial tensions betw een B lacks and Whites, as w ell as C uban s (M ohl 1991 ), and un derm ining the polit ical effectiveness of the black populations in M iami. Dunn and Stepick (1992) note that 60 percent of the black po pulat ion liv ed in un incorp orat ed area s with lim ited polit ical pow er. Further- more, the practice of electing county comm issioners at large further limited the ability of Blacks to exercise political power since they we re concentrated in areas w here their votes could be fragmented. Stack and W arren also suggest that \"the fact that the majority of the black popu- lation resides in hi ghly segregated yet spatially isolated neighbo rhoo ds, Dade Count y . . . . makes it difficult for any effective grass roots political mobilization t o occ ur . . . \" (Stack and Warren 1992: 170). Resident ial segregation also cont ributed to di minished e co- nomic opportunities along with the effects of racial and job discrimination expe rienced by Blacks in M iami-Dade Cou nty. Thi s is in stark contrast to the socioeconomi c success of Cub- ans and this cont rast is itself problematic for Blacks in Miami who ha ve been char acterized as: . . . the most frustrated residents of the city. Cub ans have prospered economi cally and have gained political control over much of local government . A go od portion of the working cl ass Anglo com munity has s imply left, but most Blacks hav e no place in which to flee. While so me Black's have truly b ecom e econ omically bett er off si nce the val of Cuba n immigrants . . . , most Blacks have seen Cuban immigrants leap past them. One third of the b lack p opulat ion rem ains locked in poverty and for m any con ditions are getting w orse (D unn an d Stepick 19 92:54). Econ omic and po litical frust ration w percepti ons of li mited so cial opp ortunit ies ar e comm on characterizations of the social history of Blacks in M iami-Dade Cou nty.National Park Service 3-27Another do minant t hem e in black social history con cerns racial tensions and civil unrest oft en related to social ineq uities i n so uth Florida: Prior to the civil rights move ment in Dade Count y, Black peopl e wer e truly sec ond cl ass citizens. R elations betw een B lack an d W hite peo ple i n D ade C oun ty were cordial, as long as Black people understood that they we re not the social equa ls of Whites. The 'Whites only' signs, as pr evalent in M iami a s they were in ot her sout hern ci ties, stood everywhere as rem inders in cas e someone fo rgot (D unn 1997:171). Vot ing r ights, job a nd housi ng discrimination, school and r esident ial segregation, and pol ice brutality we re key issues that motivated the civil rights mov ement of the early 1960s among Miami' s black com munities (Dunn 1997; Mohl 1991). Much of Miami was segr egated, including the area's valued beaches. Blacks wer e confined to using Virginia Key Beach and anot her bea ch a t Convoy Poi nt where the H eadquar ters Building for BISC is currently located. However, violat ions of civi l rights w ent beyo nd these obvious form s of discr imination at beaches and other locations. A grou p of civil rights leaders emerged dur ing this time who m ade significant strides in addressing some of the most flagrant violations of civil rights (Dunn 1997:174ff.). Howe ver, the influx of Cuba n refugees wa s perceived by some B lacks as blunting their efforts for addressing civil rights issues and ultimately distracting Miami officials from resolution of key pr oblems of conce rn to M iami Bl tion short-circ uited the economic, p olitical, and social gains Blacks wer e making elsewher e in the civil rights era. The exile 'invasion' . . . touche d off thirty years of petition and conf lict between Bl acks a nd H ispanics over job s, re sidential sp ace, go vernment services, an d political p ower in the south Florida ar ea . . Bl acks a nd ot her racial and ethnic groups is a notewort hy char acteristic of recent black social history in Dade Coun ty (Mohl 1991). A result of these tensions was a seri es of riots, the first of whi ch oc curred in 1968, with sub seque nt major events in 1980, 1982, and 1989, and w hat Dunn cal ls \"mini-distur ban ces\" i n 197 0, 1971, and 197 9 (Dunn 1997:245ff). The 1968 riots had roots in these past tensions, but the precipitating event was the arrest and mistreatment of a black yout h by Miami poli ce. This riot ende d wh en Nat ional Guard troops and the Sheriff's office wer e called in to stop violence that killed several Blacks. The precipitating event for the 1980 riot was the trial and acquittal of Miami police officers in the beati ng d eath of an unarm ed m otorcyclist nam ed A rthur McDuffie . Dunn su ggests t he riot was not in re sponse to M cDuffie's death, rathe r \"It jus tice s convict thos e who c omm itted it; and more than that, it was the intentional exclusion of Blacks from the t rial jury that inflamed m any bl ack people\" (Dunn 1997: 268). Th is four-day riot resulted in vio lence, loo ting , multip le d eath s, an d in excess of 100 million dollars in property damage. Th e 1982 riot was precipitated by a police shoot ing of a black man a nd t he 1989 r iot was sparked by another po lice sh ooting of two black m en (D unn 1997:246 -314 ). As the twentieth century came to a close, Blacks in M iami- Dade made progress in vot ing r ights, school de segregatio n, political em powerm ent, and so me socioeconomic ad van cement. Residential seg regation still ex ists, bu t Blac ks in to and A ssessmen toccupied only by Whites o r H ispanics. Yet, auth ors writing about th e socioeconomic circumst ances of Blacks in Miami and Dade Coun ty ha ve not predicted a radical shift. Dun n suggests a present and future that is co nsistent with themes in other w riting s about M iami- Dade Blacks: . . . it shoul d be clear that Blacks ar e not likely to move ahead by gr eat leaps a nd bounds in the ne xt century. If history is to be o ur teacher , Blacks wil l cont inue to m ake gains, but it w ill be a gra dual pr ocess punctuated by gre at e vents an d individ uals w ho will shap e the future in w ays we cannot yet imagine. By t he ye ar 2096 m ost Black Dade residents probably wi ll be foreign born, or at least of foreign-born ancestry, and the influence of the C aribbean w ill carry t he d ay. African A mericans m ay find them selves an ethnic m inorit y am ong other Black peo ple (Du nn 1997:373). 3.4.2Lifestyles and Cul ture There is lim ited litera ture regarding the tradition s an d lifew ays of ethnic A frican Americ ans in south Florida. They are no t mention ed in Bucuvalas , Bulger, and Kenney's work on south Florida folkli fe, although there is a discuss ion of the Bah amian an d West- Indian tra ditions that are part of the black culture of Miami-Dade Coun ty. Other literature focuses on the socioeconomi c, political, and civil rights issues wi thin black comm unities, but lifest yles and cult ure ar e less developed . Som e of t he m ulticult ural tradit ions and historical materials that indicat e elements of black cult ure rel evant for t his d iscussion are revi ewed h ere. Black Lifestyles in Miami Alongs ide discri minat ion, t he K lu Klux K lan, and sch ool and housing s egregat ion, t here w as ano ther s ide t o lif e in O vert own an d C oco nut Grove between 1930 and 1 960 that exp resses black culture in M iami. Dance, music, and theater thrived in Ov ertown. Dun n (1997:143-163) describes a segregated com munity in which the famous and not-so-famous black ent ertainers, athletes, and a rtists pr ovided ent ertainment for black as we ll as white resident s. A sect ion known as the Aven ue became a fo cal po int for this typ e of en tertain ment: Because of the high quality o f en tertain ment to be fo und in Colored Town during its heyday, Second Av enue betwee n S ixth and Ten th St reets gained a national and international reputation as Mi ami's Li ttle Broadwa y. . . . For over three d ecades t he Aven ue became the place to b e seen in Miam i. Among the fam ous 'Sa tchmo' Armstrong, B essie Smith, Billie Ho liday, Nat King Cole, Count Basie, Josephine Baker, B.B. King, Samm y Davis Jr., James Brown, Sam and Dave, Dionne Warwick, Aretha Franklin, and many, many others (D unn 1997:144 -145 ). A rich mix ture of talent flowe d through Ov ertown a nd added to the cultural ambiance of the black comm unity. Howe ver, an undercurrent in Du nn's discussion of this cultural milieu is the pervasiven ess of rac ial iss ues and segregatio n as major the mes of black culture. W hen Louis Armstrong or Cab Ca lloway cam e to Mi ami, they stayed in all-black ho tels. Joe Lou is, the Heavyw eight W orld C ham pion , and Jack R obinso n, t he h all of fame baseball player,National Park Service 3-29experienced the sam e segregat ion as the black b usiness owners a nd laborers of Miam i. Whites cam e to O vert own to enjoy the perform ances of the black entert ainers and at hlete s, but there were law s proh ibiting mixed aud iences. G arth Reeves of t he Miam i Times new spap er quo ted by D unn obse rved: \"It was on t he l ocal books t hat we couldn't hav e mixed a udience s . . . but nobody paid muc h attention to it when there was a big-named entertainer in town. In fact, by abou t the m iddle of the set, Blacks and Whites were sitting all over! Th ey wer en't caring a bout color and r acial difference s\" (Dunn 1997: 149). Th ere wer e except ions, but the ca rryove r of slavery and the pr evalence of segregation fr amed t he cu lture of the bl ack com munity. For example, Dun n also comm ents on the origins of the Orange Blossom Classic, whi ch remains an important event in the black comm unity, noting that Blacks wer e prohibited from a ttending Ora nge Bowl activities so they organized a Coc onut Festival with its own f ootball game and parade. The elements of black cu lture described by Dunn are each framed by segregation and civil rights issues . What seem s to be m issing are di scus sion s of other elem ents of Black cult ure that expr ess values, traditions, and l ifestyles that are not necessar ily framed by t he hi story of slavery and discrim ination . Yet, just as C uban culture in Miam i-Dade is pervaded by the eve nts of exile, the s ignifi cance o f sla very and discrim inat ion m ay be the do minant fr ame of t he cu lture i. Buc uval as, Bulger, and Kenn edy (199 4) as well as D unn (19 97) note t hat t here are cul tural cele- brat ions within Miam i-Dade black com munities t hat have roots i n the tr adit ions of C aribbean immigrants from J amaica, the Bahamas, and elsewher e. The Goomba y festival held each June in Coco nut Grove represents t his b lending of tra ditions . Goombay is a multiday str eet celebra - tion. Parades, street dancing, music of all flavors, including Jonkonnu bands (a music style of drumming a nd si nging wit h ori gins in Jamai ca) from Miami a nd t he Ba ham as, as well as diverse African Americ an and Carib bean foods are all p art of the Goombay stree t celeb ratio ns. 3.4.3Sociocultural Issues The literatur e reg arding Black s in south Florida an d particu larly in Miam i-Dade C ounty issues that have been revi ewed above. The fo cus o f these issues is civil rights, segregation, and r acial tensi ons bet ween Bl acks a nd ot her ethnic and racial groups in M iam i-Dade. The m ost prom inent i ssues in t he lit erat ure ar e: 1)Poll taxes and other practices that prohibit full participation of African Americans in the election pr ocess. 2)Housing and job discrimination that have li mited the full part icipati on of A frican A mericans in the Miami-Dade economy. 3)Residential seg regation tha t in th e past fragm ented the political power of Blac ks in Miam i. 4)Preferential treatment of immigrant groups that is pe rceived to ha ve adversely affected the access o f Blacks to pub lic m onies and other governm ental assist ance. 5)Unfair treatment by police and other law enforcement agencies that has resulted in pas t riots and ongoi ng t ensi ons bet ween pol ice and m embers of black com munities.3-30 Bisca yne Nationa l Park Ethnogr aphic Overvie w and A ssessmen tIn the years since the civil rights mov ement, Blacks in M iami-Dade have made s ocial and economic progress. There are m ore b lack -owned businesses, m ore divers ity in employment, and less resident ial segregation. Yet, the dom inant them es that frame m any expressions of black culture remain rooted in concerns about equa lity, civil rights, and discrimination. 3.5 Nicaraguans and Ha itians Haitians and Nicaraguans represent a trend in the diversification of immigrants to Mia mi and south Fl orida. Each is also a proxy for different elements of this diversification, with H aitians representi ng a trend i n Caribbean immigra tion and Nicar aguans a tr end in C entra l Am erican imm igration. Ma ny Nicaraguans fled their homeland because of political upheaval and some authors (e.g., Bucuvalas, Bulger, and Kennedy 1994:101) suggest that Nicaraguans are the secon d lar gest H ispani c populat ion in so uth Florida and represent t he largest Nicar aguan population ou tside of M anagua. Many Haitian im migra nts al so fled t he s ociop olitical circ umstan ces in their co untry during an d after the 1 970s and have encountered differing lev els of succ ess adapting t o condi tions i n M iami. Nei ther Nicaraguans nor Haitian s are per fect proxies for the groups they are intended to represent in this discussion, but together these groups suggest the cultural compl exity resulting from i mmigration from C entral Am erican and the wider Caribbean. 3.5.1Popu lation The co mbinati on of lega l and i llegal immigra tion both H aitians and N icar aguans m akes an accurate determination of their p opulatio n difficult. H owever, the re are concentrations of e ach that can be u sed to es timate the popul ation of these groups. For example, the 1990 Censu s indicated about 40,000 pe ople in Li ttle Haiti, wher e many H aitians live, and about 82 percent of that p opulat ion was black. The 2000 Census numbers showed that N orth Miam i had a total populat ion o f 18,686 Haitians (Miami Dade Cou nty Depart ment of Plann ing and Z oning 20 02). There are est imates that bet ween 50 ,000 to 70,00 0 H aitians arr ived by boat in M iam i bet ween 1977-198 1 and another 5,000 to 10,000 by airplane (St epic k 1992:58). Th ere a re ot her esti mates that currently abou t 150,000 Haitians li ve in so uth Florida and ano ther 15 0,000 live in N ew Yor k (Stepick 1998:5). Thi s same wor k also suggests that the census has undercounted Hai tians and other minorities. Unl ike populations of Haitians in Ne w Y ork and other parts of the United States, the H aitians in sout h Flor ida are almost all recent immigrants. Boswell an d Curtis (19 91) cite d ata tha t estim ate ap proximately 101,000 Nicaraguans livin g in Miami in 1990, making them the second largest Hispanic population in M iami-Dade Cou nty. However, they also note that this estimate undercounts the actual number: \"Although the Metro -Dade Planning D epartm ent re were about 1 00,000 . . . living in Dade in 1990, most experts suspect that the true f igure is higher. T he correc t figu re is probably somewher e betwee n 110,000 and 150,000, althou gh some estimate it to be as high as 175,000\" (Boswell an d Curtis 1 991:148). C harac teris tic o f the segregation of neighborhoods in Miam i- Dade, Nicaraguan residenc e has be en c oncent rated in spec ific localities. Th e wea lthiest group resides in Key Biscayne, B rick ell, an d Kendall. T he \"middle cl ass\" groups tend to re side in Sweetwater a nd Fontai neb leau, and the less eco nomically w ell-off l ive in E ast Little Havana, Allap attah , and Hialeah (Boswell an d Curtis 1 991:148). T he \"Little M anagua\" of M iam i is inNational Park Service 3-31Sweetwater, and t his is the a rea most usua lly as soci ated with N icaraguans in M iami. Alt hough most immigrant groups e xhibi t internal popul ation di versity, this is especially char acteristic of Nicaraguan immigrants. Th ere are three ident ified ethnic subg roups: . . . the Creole peoples of the southern Atlantic coast, the M iskito p opulatio n of the Rio Coco a nd Puer to C abezas area, and t he M estizos of the Paci fic Coast . Th ese com munities do not have much con tact across cult ural lines. No over all Nicar aguan cult ural organizat ion un ites them , and, though they share som e food ways, t heir cult ural heritag es (Borlan d n.d.) As wit h H aitians, there was a small existing Nicaraguan com munity in Miami prior to 1980, but most of this population is of recent origin as described in the discussion of social history. 3.5.2Soci al History Haitians and N icaraguans a re significantly different popul ations, with di fferent lang uages, cus - toms, traditions, and his tory. Th ey sha re a com mon his tory of migration t o M iami- Dade County, alth ough the sociopolitical and socioeconomic reasons for these migra tion s differ. Y et, both of these groups are relatively recent migrants, and thus their social histories concern the circumstances of immigration and ada ptation to the M iami- Dade sociocul tural milieu. Also, for each group, adaptation to their new environment was influenced by ot her residents; in the case of Haitian s, the resid ent African Americ ans, and for Nicaraguans, re sident cans. Haitians and N icaraguans a re obvi ousl y different cultural groups, but they sha re com mon reasons for their imm igration to Miami-Dade County. Furthermore, the numbers and circum- stances of migration have been influenced to varying degrees by U.S. imm igration pol icies. These policie s are a com plex topic that is b eyo nd the scope of the d iscussion here other t han to n ote the ir in fluence on both the flow of im migra nts an d the ir statu s once the y arrive d. Nicaraguans Some of t he first major m igra tions of N icar aguans to t he U nite d Stat es were in the 1 930s, w hen individ uals fled the policie s of the Somoza g overnm ent. M ost of these im migra nts did not settle in Flor ida; rather, they t ook up re sidenc e in m ajor cities in the eas t (New York) a nd w est (Los Ange les). Subseque nt migration was motivated primarily by economi c conditions, during the interval betwee n1940 and the late 1970s, but the major Nicaraguan immigration started in the 1970s in respo nse to the em ergence and s uccess of t he co mmunist San dinista s. This first wave of im migra nts often had financial means: The f irst wave of Nicaraguan exi les was much l ike t he ear ly 'Golden Exil e' wave from Cuba in that it prised disp ropo rtionatel y of entr Nicar agua w ith reso urces that allow ed them to establi shed in M iam i. This b eachh ead of app roxim ately 15, 000 wealthy and m iddle class immigrants established a founda tion for the m asses of poorer N icaraguans who follow ed (Boswell an d Curtis 1 991:148). These were the im migrants who found residenc es in Key Bisc ayne and Bri ckell and som e also began purchasing condominiums i n the wes tern parts of Miami-Dade Coun ty (Por ssessmen tStepick 1993: 152). Aft er the Sa ndinistas took political power in 1979, a second wav e of immigrants headed for the Uni ted States. The se wer e the \"mi ddle class\" of Nicaragua, the white- colla r workers, profession als, and bu siness person s who foun d residence in S weetwater. The next wave of immigrants began in the mid-1980s and was compr ised of younger men trying to es cape m ilitary service, pe asants, an d other p ersons of w orking class socioeconomic background. The re was a final push of immigrants in 1988 and 1989 in response to the ongoing civil war in Nicaragua: . . . thousands of Nicaraguans began flowing up through Guatem ala an d Mexico to Texa s and on to Mia mi. The stream of new immigrants swe lled through the last months of 1988 until, at the beginning of 1989, it became a flood. Uni ted States Immigration and Naturalization Ser vice . . . officials estimated that as many as three hundr ed refugees a week had be en se ttling i n D ade Count y since the su mmer of 1988 ( Port es and Stepick 1993:150). s Nica raguan popul ation i ncreased from about 0.4 per cent of the populatio n to ab out 2 percent, and by 1990 it w as about 5 percent (B oswell an d Curtis 1991:148). A larger number of th e overal l popu lation o f N icar aguan im migra nts w ere accoun ted for by these less affl uent an d less ed ucat ed Nicar aguans, es pecial ly those in t he final 1988-1989 push. The literature about Ni caraguan immigra tion to Mia mi raises several issues about the resettlem ent pro cess: (1)The ro le o f Nicaraguan immigra nts in the loc al ec onomy. The first wave of N icar aguans h ad t he s kills and capit al to establi sh them selves i n business es or professions when they a rrived, but subse quent immigrants, and es pecially the l ast groups, were l ess sk illed and had fe wer resources. They foun d employ ment, but in M iam i's inform al econ omy of casual labor where w orkers w ere pai d in cash at very low wages. Nicar aguans fill ed a nee d for chea p unski lled labor in the l ocal econom y. Garment factories, const ruction j obs, agricultural labor, and unskilled factory labor wer e sources of wor k for men and women. Nicar aguans also developed s mall entrepren eurial enterprises, such as sel ling flow ers and other stre et ven dor operatio ns. (2)Local response t o this wave of immigrants. The r espons e of Anglos and Black s to Nicaraguan immigra nts w as influenc ed by the occ urrence of prior immi gration in Miami-Dade County. Between 1959 and 1989, Miami was in the process of transfor mation fr om a pre dom inately white com munity with a black minori ty, to a com munity in w hich Hispanics and other i mmigra nts w ere t he d ominant populat ion. W hites began a p rocess tha t co ntinu es to the present of m oving out o f M iam i-Dade C ounty in to Browar d County a nd elsewher e in Flor ida. Spa nish bec ame a significant lang uage in busi ness establishments, and among so me residents, resentment be gan t o d evelop about the displacement of the dominant culture with that of the Hispanic imm igrants. These same sent iments were expressed tow ards other im migra nts w ho arrive d during the same time pe riod. Blacks an d others w ho had b een in the role of unskilled laborers were to som e extent repla cedNational Park Service 3-33by N icaraguans, and t hey a lso r esponded with re sent ment. For example, Port es and Stepick quote a M iam i bla ck m an as sayin g, \"The b osses sh ould b e looking o ut for t he p eop le who have lived here for years. The y shouldn't allow t hese foreigners to come h ere and take our wor k\" (Portes and Stepick 1993:163). (3)The and Cuban relatio nships. Nicaraguans w ere not just fellow Hispanics for the e stablished Cuban c ommunity. Th ey a lso were exil es w ho fled their coun try in respo nse to th e em ergence of co mmunist polit ical regimes. The y thus shared an ethnic and political identity and a comm on language that was the basis for d evel oping ties b etween N icar aguans an d Cuban s. Nicar aguans b ecam e em ploy ees in Cuba n est ablishm ents and r esident s in C uba n nei ghbor hoods. Cubans e xercised their political power to assist Nicaraguans in the resettlement process. The y fostered policies and aid t hat m ade t he p rocess easi er, desp ite the re sentment of other group s and policies, described below, that were not favorable to Nicaraguan resettlement in the Un ited States. Th e pr ocess of integration into the economi c and social milieu of Miami was thus substantially aided by the character of the Nicaraguan-Cuba n re lationship: \"The incorporation of Nicaraguans into the exile moral comm unity in turn opened the wa y for their incorporation into the growi ng business en clav e. In both cases, the larger, more established Cu ban-Am erican comm unity, raguans. ... The pa rtnership was nev ertheless one- sided , for Cuban s were i n co mplet e con trol\" (Po rtes and S tepick 1 993:167 ). (4)Fed policy that affect o f Nicar aguan ex iles her exile gr oups. Unlike C uban refugees, the p olitical status o f Nicar aguan im migra nts and exile s has been more tenuous. Sp ecifically, U.S. im migra tion policy tow ard the m has varie d fro m acc eptance to advocating retur n to N icaragua once the San dinista g overnment was rep lace d by a m oderate political regime. Nicaraguans wer e thus not exiled in the same way as Cu bans; there existed the possibili ty of ret urn to t heir ho meland with a n on-com munist regi me. The p ossibility of ret urn is a significantly different orientation t o their lives in com parison t o their Cuba n count erparts. Moreov er, unl ike t he st atus a nd a ssistance granted to Cuba ns, Nicaraguans h ave ha d m ore of an overall tenuous status as immigrants, and this has undermined their local political power and statu s: . . . the hostility of the f gov ernment toward pe rmanent resettlement of Nicar aguans in the U nite d Stat es w eakened the grou p's voice in local affairs. Federal policy rendered the situation of the wor king-class arrivals still more precarious, forcing them into mi nimally paid and informal jobs. The struggle to be allowe d to remain in the United States also consumed much of the ene rgy of the com munity, preventing it from articula ting a dist inct poli ). Nicaraguans remain part of the Miami-Dade social landscape, and more recent policies of the federal g overnment, such as the Nicaragua Adjustment and Central A meric an Relief Act, establishe d some r elief for Nicaraguans who wi shed to stay in the Uni ted States legally. Additi onally, applic ations for T emporary Perm anen t Sta tus h ave been ex tend ed, a nd other3-34 Bisca yne Nationa and pro cedure s of immigra tion law have at tempted t o address the \" not quite exile\" statu s of many Nicaraguans residing in aguan L ifestyle and C ulture Most im migra nt gro ups are n ot ho mogenous, bu t Nicaraguans exhibit m ore cultu ral d ivers ity than Cuban or Haitians. As not ed previousl y, there are three dis tinct subg roups of Nicaraguans: 1)The Miskito speak their own l anguage in addition to Spanish and Engli sh. The se are the indigeno us p eop le of N icar agua w ho prim arily reside on the Atlantic coast of N icar agua. The ethnic Miskito of Miami often reside in apartments in the Miami Shores and Miami Beach areas of M iam i-Dade C ounty. The y are am ong the m ost angli cized of t he N icar aguan immigra nts (Borland n .d.). 2)The Cost e\u00f1os are Creole people who s peak En glish and often Spa nish. The Cost e\u00f1os, who are often professionals, have resided in M iami since the 1950s, primarily in Ca rol City and other nearby neighbo rhoo ds (Borland n.d.). The re are estimates of about 6,000 to 10,000 Creole a nd Miskit o in M iam i-Dade C oun ty, w ith the rem ainder of t he N icar aguan populat ion are Hispanic and spe ak Spani sh as their primary lang uage. In t heir hom eland, Mestizos are conce ntrated on t he Pac ific coa st of Nicaragua. M estizos a re the l argest segm ent of t he N icar aguan po pulation in M iam i and they tend ed to ar rive af ter 197 9 (P orte s and Stepick 1993). The Mestizo Ni caraguans tend to live in Swee twat er and the wor king clas s areas of Little H avan a an d Hialeah . The se three groups appear to live separate social and cultural lives with little interaction and without a unit ing cult ural organizat ion (B ucuvalas, Bulger, and K enn edy 1994; Borland n .d.). The re are two aspects of Nicaraguan culture discussed in the literature reviewed for this wor k: religious festivals and foodways. Although this may reflect the focused nature of this review, som e aut hors suggest t hat ot her key aspects of N icar aguan cult ure, such as occup ational traditions a nd cr aftsmanship, have bee n bl unted by t he ci rcumstances of immigration. For example, Borland o ffer s the foll owing ex ample: . . fishing crafts, and mahog any a nd rosewood carving and furniture making hav e pr ove d impracticable. For instance, on t he At lantic Coast the dory or dug out canoe r emains the m ajor means of transpor tation. Th us, any adu lt male who grew up there kn ows how to build a dory .

This type of example suggests a discon tinuit y between the current social circum stances of N icar agu ans and their cult ural The following summar ies of these Patronal Festivals are based on Bor land, n.d., pages 4-13.1 National Park Service 3-35traditions. Th e ne cessity to adapt unde r difficult circumstances focuses life on t he m ost immediate n eed s and lim its o pportun ities f or other expressions of cultu re. T his is not to suggest there is a dearth of Nicaraguan culture, only that current literature reviewed fo r th is wor k tends to focus on the cultural essentials of food and religion. Mestizo and Creole/ Miskit o N icar aguan s have different religious tradit ions . The lat ter a re Moravian, reflecting t he activities of Moravian missionar ies in their hom eland, and M estizos tradit ions , and for that ot her and Hispanic C atholic pract ices, emphasize \"pat ronal fest ivals\" t hat ar e associat ed with particula r towns. In M iam i these fest ivals have been adapted to local circum stances . They are of ten he ld in re nted halls or other larger spaces, they hav e some modif ied form of procession, and they also include music and dance. Each festival celebrates a patron saint and the celebration itself may last several days. The followi ng are the more prevalent patronal festival days with some o f the practices associated wi th each.1 San Sabastian, Janua ch aracteristic processional dance kn own as the El Tor o Hua co (the H uaco Bull). It is the most traditional dance per formed by Miami N icaraguans in t hese festivals. The dancers, \" . . . mostly children, for m two lines facing on e ano ther.

Thi s festival was originally sponsored by some Nicaraguan elite trying to provide a means of comm unity integration, but the effort failed and split into two e vents. One held by the elite is essentially a hor se show a nd social event. The other festival is he ld in Li ttle Havana and is attended by younger men. San Jeron imo, Septem ber.

The cel ebrat ion i s focu sed a roun d pri vate part ies held i n hom es where individual s are treated to Nica raguan food s and as ked t o recite rosaries and say pr ayers. Th ere is also a public celebration held in the evenings whe rein young people a nd others travel around shoutin g trad ition al sa yings and rec gifts yne ssessmen Moravian beliefs. The major celebration among these Nicaraguans occurs at Tha nks giving when there is a Harvest Fest ival. Palo de m ayo is a traditional Creole music and da nce associated with maypole ce lebrations, but ad apted to th e celeb ratio ns at the harve st fe stiva ls (Bucuvalas , Bulger, an d Kennedy 1994:109-110). A t these fe stiva ls, \" people simply dance to palo de mayo and reggae recording. In recent years, the palo de mayo dance has be com e so suggestive that many ol der Creoles scor n it as obsce ne\" ( Bucuvalas, Bul ger, and Kennedy 1994:110). Food is an im portant a spect of cult ure that reflects the p refer ences and p ract ices of a cult ural group. The literature regarding Nicaraguans reflects the different food traditions of Creole and Mestizo gro ups in Miam i. Nacat amales are the tra ditional foods o f the M estizo, w hich are combi nations of pork, cornmeal, and spices that are steamed or boiled in banana leaf. Por k, chicken, beef, along with friend pla ntai ns and gree n bananas ar e also tradit ional food s, as are por k rind sna cks known as vigoron. Many tradit ional food s are sold by N icarag uan street vendo rs kn own as fritangas in Little H avana a nd other part s of M iam i's Latin com munities. In cont rast, Creole traditions a re based more in the Car ibbea n st yle and use coco nut milk as a com mon ingredient in coo king. On e-pot m eals kn own as \"ron don\" include fi sh or m eat served on top of vegetables. The Creole p eoples do not ha ve th e same types of street p resence with their food s as do the M estizos, and as such, the dif ferences are onl y impor tant as indicators of the larger cultural differences among Nicaraguans in M iami-Dade Cou Nicaraguans in M iami-Dade Cou nty expressed in the literature review for this work are as follows: (1)Class and C ultural Div isions. The Nicaraguans of M iami- Dade represent at least three d ifferent cul tural gr oups. Addi tionally, there are class divisions among Nicaraguans that also fragment this comm unity, as indicated in the Santo Dom ingo de Guz man festival, wher e the more elite Nicaraguans and more wor king class Nicaraguans each instituted their own festivals. Thi s expresses a larger pattern of class di fference s among t he elite and working cl ass Nica raguans: \"Th e flood of wor king-class arrivals had erased t he relatively positive image of elite exiles, and many respon ded by dist ancing t hem selves from the new com ers . . . \" (P orte s and The ef fect of th e cultu ral an d clas s divisions has been a frag mented Nicaraguan community withou t the leadership that enabled Cu bans to successfully adapt after their immigration. (2)Stigmatization and Identit y Ambival ence. The later waves of Nicaraguan refugees wer e stigmatized in muc h the same way that Haitians were. Th ey wer e characterized as une duca ted, unski lled, dirty, and unde sirable. Th is type of stigmatization i n par t accou nts for the separati on of earlier waves of immigrants wh o had a more positive image in the comm unity. Ho wever, rather than becoming \"invisible,\" as some Haitian s have in res ponse to s imilar s tigm atizatio n, the res ponse of the N icaraguans was toNational Park Service 3-37emphasi ze class differen ces and t o som e degree subm erge their ident ity (Por tes and Stepick 1993). In response t o U.S. immigration policy, and i n part, because of t he a bility to return to Nica ragua after the fall of the Sandi nistas, Nicaraguans hav e not had the same \"exile\" ident ity as Cuba ns. The possibility o f retu rning home further added to ambivalen ce regarding Nicaraguan identity in M iam i-Dade. Stigmatization, immigration status, and class differences h ave e ach co ntri buted to conce rns about Nicaraguan ident ity amon g all classes and N icaraguan subg roups. (3)Undocum ented Status a nd It s Soci oeconom ic Consequence s. There have been a su bstan tial n umber o f undocumented Nicaraguans in Miam i-Dade County (Garvin 2000). T he effect of th is status is that these in divid uals often have been restricted to lowe r paying jobs and ongoing uncertainty about their ab ility for better paying jobs and advancement in the work f orce. Addit ional ly, this status ha s further adde d to the stigmatization of Nicaraguans and otherwise calls into qu estion their ability to ever be integrated into the social an d economic fa bric o f south Florida. Hai tians As with Cuban s, Bah amians, Trinidadians, and ot her C aribbean isla Haitians h ave had a presen ce in sou th Florida for an e xtend ed period of ti me (G ann on 1996). However, there was no m ajor conce ntration of Haitians in M iami- Dade Count y unt il large-scale flight from Haiti began in 1980. Then images of \"boat people\" filled television screens and newspaper st or- ies, som etimes w ith the tr agedy o f drow ning , as boats capsized in at tempts t o flee t o Florida. Stepick (199 8), Po rtes and S tepick (19 93), and Stepick (199 1) describe som e of the k ey issues of the Haitian immigration between 1980 and the mid-1990s, and t he se ttlement of these refug- ees in what is now Miami- Dade Count y. Although not the onl y impor tant issue of Haitian s o- cial history in M iami, it is critical to understand the Haitian expe rience in M iami-Dade Cou nty. Altho ugh Haitian s fleein g by boat arrive d as early as 1963, and the n aga in in 1973 and 1977, it was the p eriod betw een 1 977 and 19 81 that saw the great est influx of im migra nts t o Florida. During t his time pe riod, between 60, 000 to 80,000 Haitians arrived in F lorida either by boat or plane, the majority of them in hi ghly publ icized boat landings, thus becomi ng known H aitian a rrivals coi ncided with the M ariel exodus from Cuba . Th is was a time when M iami a nd ot her Florida resident s, as wel l as U.S. immigration pol icies, were not especially we lcomi ng (Stepick 1998). Unl ike the Cuba n or Nicaraguan immigrants, Haitians were not fleein g a c ommunist go vernment. Some fled for political reas ons and others certain ly for ec onomic re asons (Stepick 1998). H owever, oth ers suggest that a sim ple \" politic al- economi c\" dichotomy do es not explain a more compl ex situation: The r easons for mass m igration hav e en econom ic and pol itical op- pression. The United States Immigration and Naturalization Ser vice attempts to di cho- tomize t he t wo reason s, but they are real ly inex tricably l inked in that coun try. They are two sym ptoms of the sa me fatal disease. Many who w ere poor were also a t the m ercy of the rul ing class and their m ilitary con trol forces. Those w ho crit icized t ssessmen denied prop libert y, and even life, thereb y im poveri shing t heir fam ilies. Even a sim ple desire to seek eco nomic o pportunit y outsi de the isl and w as con strued as treasonab le activity, pun ishab le by (M osley-D ozier 9). tinue to leave their co untry and trave l to M iam i, although today the num bers are a relative trickle in com parison t o the 197 7-19 81 time period (cf. Viglucci 19 99). They were a t once pushed by socioeconomic and political issues, and pulled by their own images of Miami and Florida: The image of Miami rises like a specter over all of Haitian consciousness. Whatever one can accompl ish, obtain, or develop is dw arfe d and made insignifica nt by the po ssibili ties of M iam i. Miam i is the place w here yo u can earn a month's w ages in a day or a year's wages in a w eek. . . . (M ohl 1991:122). Howe ver, the images and dreams of Miami and Florida clashed wi th the realities Ha itians experie nced after th ey arrive d. T here are s everal is sues in the literature reg arding th is expe rience that are noteworthy: (1) the stigmatization of Ha itian refugees; (2) imm igration policies t hat i nfluenced the s tatus and identi ty of H aitian ref ugees; ( 3) H aitian ref ugee socioeconomic status ; and (4) relatio nships with Black s in Miam i. (1)Stigmatization of Haitian i mmigrants. Media images of arrivin g bo at people began a portray al of Haitian s as less than desirable immigra nts to s outh Florida: \"P barely seaw orthy craft evoked images buried deep in the A merican co llective mind. Like th e slav e ships of yore, these boats also carried a cargo of Black laborers . . . and nobody wanted them\" (Porte s 1993:51). Haitians were gen eral ly sti gmatized by media covera ge as noted by Stepick in his quotatio n from Robert L awless' 1992 work, Haiti's Ba d Pr ess: \"F ew people would disagree w ith the stat ement t hat fa vorable r epo rts abo ut Haiti are a s rare as po sitive dec larations on the nutritional value of canniba lism or the healing pow er of black magic\" 1998: 2). H aitians were as having hig h occur rences of tuberculosis and AIDS and they we re often stereotyped as practitioners of the occult including voodoo, which itself is significantly m isunderstood (Stepick 1998). T he overall effe ct w as to stigmatize H aitian ident ity, w hich had a ch illing effect on their integrat ion into local com munities and on their st atus as im migrants: \"M any Haitians lost their j obs, and negati ve stereotypes and fears of Haitians becam e firm ly em bedde d in the g ene ral sout h Flor ida popul ation. H aitians were pe rceived by m any t o be not onl y di sease-ridde n, but also peasants coul d onl t o the comm unity\" ( Stepick 1992: 58). This type of stigmatization al so r esulted in som e H aitians hid ing t heir ident ity or trying to pass for A frican A mericans (S tepick 1 992:199 8). (2)Immigration pol icy that influenced Haitian I dent ity and Status. In r esponse t o con cerns about Haitian r efugees, the I mmigration and Naturalization Ser vice instituted policie s to interce pt and otherw ise res trict the flo w of Haitian refu gees and to othe rwise discourage the stay of these refugees in the United States (Stepick 1992, 1998). Porte sNational Park Service 3-39and Stepick argu e th at the Cuban refu gees of the same tim e perio d were treated differently because of existing policies and perceptions regarding Haitian circumst ances of immigration: \"The difference between the Cubans and Haitian s stream ing in to M iam i had less to do with individu al m otivations than with the co untry they left beh ind, t he co mmunity that recei ved them, and the ir co lor\" (Portes and Stepick 1993:53). So me Haitian s were also jailed u pon the ir arrival in the U nited St ates and ot hers were deni ed w ork permits. There wer e pr essures from local groups who believed H aitians w ere undesirable a nd therefore t hey should b e depo rted (Stepick 1992: 60). Th e ne t effect of these pol icies and practices was to f urther stigmatize Haitians. Fur thermore, many of the H aitians in the c ounty fa ced immediate depor tation because of their nationality. Ul timately, some of these policies we re ackno wledged and reversed throug h legislation, s uch as the H aitian Ref ugee Fa irness Act of 1997. Th is act intende d to reverse policies of the pa st that were ba sed more on national ity, race, and l ang uage rath er th an the particu lar cir cumstan ces of the ref ugees. (3)Haitian r efugee socioeconom ic status. Haitians, even t hose who ha ve a reason able educat ion b y Haitian st andards, are not as educate d as som e other immigra nt groups, and this places t hem at a socioeco nomic disadvant age. Porte s and S tepick (199 3:57) cite statistics fo r Haitian im migra nts revea ling that for the 49 9 refugees they surveyed, the average was 4.6 years of education, 75 percent wer e single, about 35 percent wer e jailed on their arrival in the Uni ted States, 31 percent had been jobless in Hai ti, and 59 perce nt wer e at or below po verty level, whi le about 29 percent wer e receiving wel fare. Altho ugh these 49 9 cases are no t the w hole story, it is also suggested that the overall socioecon omic status o f many Haitian ref ugees w as rel atively low in com parison to C uban refugees and to U .S. res idents (S tepick 1998). T he effect of this is to place these refugees at a com parat ive disadvanta ge because o f lim ited educati on and job skills. Haitians h ave not f ared as well as Cuba ns and many ot her refugee gr oups. In fa ct, their ove rall soci has rem low , alth ough there is a H aitian middle cla ss tha t ha s prospered in Miam i. T his group is est imated to be abou t 15,000 to 20,00 0. H owever, the lit erat ure focuses o n the low er socioeconomic status of many Haitian s: For many , especial ly in the 198 0s, either n o op portunities w ere open o r the o nly w ork avai lable w as low wage, dead-end jobs. In a 198 3 su rvey of H aitian refugees . . . more than one-third had never wor ked since comi ng to the Uni ted States. Ne arly 30 percent of the m ales and more than 70 pe rcent of the were unem i nco rporat ion in so uth Florida's econo my has i mproved w ith tim e. Two years l ater w hen we re-surveyed t he sam e individual s in 1985, unem ploy ment had dropped by almost two- thirds. . . . By t he 1990s South Fl orida Haitian unemployment rates remained high, but they ha d begun to approximate tho se of African Am ericans (Stepick 1998:35). Furt hermore, it is su ggested that these circumstances resulted in a significant disadva ntage when combined with the stigmatization of Haitian identity: \"Haitians were not so much the bottom of the labor market as outside it; they we re neglected by public wel fare agencies and looked down o n by all other segments of the local comm unity, including Blacks\" (Por tes and Stepick yne ssessmen t(4)Relatio nships with Black s in Miam i. Haitian s are p redominately black and Stepick and others suggest this fact affec ted the ir immigration status and their integration into sou th Fl orida comm unities. Just as Cu bans assist ed N icar aguans i n their inclusion i nto Miam i-Dade society, Blacks o f Miam i also assiste d Haitians. Black leaders in C ongr ess and el sewher e, including M iami, not ed the di scrimination exper ience d by H aitians and put forth ef forts to cha nge pol icies and i ntervene on be half of Haitian s (Stepick 1998). H owever, the relatio nship betw een Miami Black s and Haitian s is com plex. On a gen eral level, report s would indicate that Blacks viewed Haitians as w ell as Nicar aguans an d other im migra nts as c ompe titors for the jobs they traditionall y held i n M iam i's econom y. Haitians were not eager to assum e a black ident ity in the United States because of the hi story of discrimination and sub juga tion t hat especially char acterized the e xper ience of Southern Blacks. Haitians also were largely segregated from black neighborhoods in their Little Haiti residences . There appears to be a cl ear ambival ence, as r eflected in ex isting terature, regarding Black s' acc eptance of H aitian s and Haitian s desire fo r separate id entity. T his ambival ence seem s esp ecial ly apparent i n y oun ger H aitians w ho sociali ze w ith A frican Americans in s chools (St epick 1 998). Lifestyle and C ulture Nicaraguans and Haitians each ha ve cultures and lifestyles that differ from t hos e of the dom inant culture of the Uni ted States in language, lifestyle, and other aspects of culture, but their cult ures of origin ar e on es that ar e rich, dive rse, and co mplex. A s these refugees have establish ed new residences in M iam i-Dade County, asp ects of t heir cultu re ha ve arrived with them. Ou r intent here is to provide an ov erview of wha t the literature describes as some o f the salient features of these cultures and lifestyles among these groups in M iami-Dade Cou nty. Haitian s in Miam i-Dade County Language Haiti is a bilingual country with Fre nch an d Cre ole being the primary languages. French is the lang uage of prestige and t he uppe r class and i t is also the lang uage that united the di verse groups brought to Hai ti from A frica. Cr eole is a French-based pidgin language with elements of the traditional lang uages of the Afr ican gr oups. It has a subj ect-verb-object word order, and m ost of the lexicon is French based, althou gh tonal inflections are less pronounced than in Fr ench. Until about the 1920s, Creole was primarily a spoken lang uage. In Haiti, abou t 90 pe rcent of the population speaks primarily Creole. In Miam i-Dade County, H aitian immigra nts recogni ze the n ecessit y to speak English. A lthough at home parents a nd children a re likely to speak Cre ole with on e another, Eng lish has been adopted as a necessity. Haitians also value speaking their lan guage as a means to maintain connections to their home country (Stepick 1998). Creole is also an important expressive medium for Haitians since it embodies some o f the traditions of African heritag e. F or ex ample, the re is a rich traditio n of pro verbs as w ell as children's folk tales, know n as kont, derive d from African traditions ( Bucuv alas, Bul ger, and Kennedy 1994:131).National Park Service 3-41Family Fam ily is an im portant v alue am ong H aitian im migra nts as it links individ uals in their new com munity as w ell as t heir ho meland. Fam ily values provide ex pectat ions about em otional support, financial support, and mutual assistance. The se expe ctations are not diminished by the distance betwee n individuals living in M iami and thos e living in Hait i. In fact, Haitians livin g in the United States are e xpected to s end money to o ther fa mily members livin g in the ir homelan d. Among those living in the United S tates, th ese valu es are s ometim es extended to individua ls wh o const itute a reconst ructed family (i.e., a family recompose d after immigration that m ay include bloo d or n on-blood relat ives). Fam ilies ar e also a basis for pat terns o f Haitian immigration: \"Hai tian individuals wi thin families immigrate seque ntially, as if each immigrant were a link in a chain betwee n Hai ti and the Uni ted States\" (Stepick 1998:16). Arriving immigra nts (kn own as \"just often find te mporary homes w ith relat ives; they are direct ed into j ob netw orks by rel atives, a nd otherw ise t heir inclusion into t heir new circum stances is aided if not buffered by a resident fam ily. T he d ominant t ies ar e to the nu clea r family, but these family membe rs may be separated by long distances either for short or long periods of time. Th e value of nucl ear family ties motivates individua ls to reconst itute those fam ilies and Haitian ho useh olds can appear t o b e fluid as t ies ar e renew ed and brok en according to changing immigration circumst ances. The se values about family and the circum stances of H aitian st atus w ithin the U nite d States have m ade for ho useh olds that are flex ible: Haitian hous ehol ds a nd and whe n ne cessary or convenient they incorporate a wide range of relatives and even non-relative s. Am ong t he nonpr ofessional classes, households, and the individ uals within t hem are also const antly on t he m ove , cha nging a ddr esses as house s be com e too small or i ndividuals m ove t o find their ow n quart ers (St epick 1 998:18). Religion Catholi cism is the dom inant Christian r eligion amon g Haitians, although Port es and Stepick (1993) suggest th at about 40 percent of Haitian immigra nts are Protestan t. However, the re is an ol d H aitian sa ying that \"Hai tians are 80 percent Catholic, 20 percent Protestantism, and 100 percent Vo doun\" (Bu cuvala s, Bulger , and K enn edy 1994:129). As with Cubans, C hristi an beliefs provide an important link to the H aitian ho meland and religion is also a significant resource for assist ance w ith adap tation to t he circum stances of immigra tion. T he lit erat ure abou t Haitian atholicism and P rote stants t akes seco nd place adit ional A frican religious pr actices that hav e merged with elements of C atholi cism. It is estimated that per haps 50 percent of H aitians pract ice Vodou n, m ore Vo doun exp resses a w orld vi ew that shape s the out look of a larger num ber of Haitians. Haitian Vo doun entai ls the b elief in a single diet y, but t here a re also other types of sp iritual beings including ancestral spirits and spirits representing the forces of life (e.g., health, childbirth, goo d fortune, evil, hap piness ). Som e of t hese spiri ts can p ossess p erson s, and others can be invoked to c ure illn ess. In fact, a major component of V oudon belief s concerns rituals3-42 Bisca yne Nationa l Park Ethnogr aphic Overvie w and A ssessmen tto cure individual s from illness o r injury by using h erbs and music-fi lled ceremonies to cure sicknes s or injury. Both men a nd w omen c an be Vodoun pr iests (houngan and mambo, respectively). Th ese priests pr eside ove r ce remonies, often hel d out door s in the ir hom eland, but m ore frequen tly in basem ents or living room s among Haitian im migra nts. The tra ditional cerem onies o ften are focused aroun d a poto mitin or center pole. Songs, and especially dr um music, evoke the loa spirit s who \"mou nt\" or possess individual s during the cerem ony. Sacri fice, often anim al sacrif ice, is also a part of these cerem onies, which is intended to app ease t he loa spirits (Davis 1985) . Th e pr actice of Vodoun a mong H aitians in the Un ited States is less obvious than its practice in their home land. As wi th man y other aspects of Haitian culture, there is a st igm a associat ed w ith Vodoun . Some authors suggest that t hese beli efs and p ract ices are among the m ost m isund erst ood aspects of H aitian cult ure (St epick 1 998). Litt le Haiti The center of Haitian cultural life in M iami-Dade Cou nty is Li ttle Haiti. It is located on the nort heast side of Miami, bounde d on t he west by I- 95, the e ast by Bi scayne Boul evard, I-95 on the s outh, and 87 street on the n orth. Little Haiti expresses som e of the art and arch itectureth of H aitian lifest yles. There are brightly c olored street signs in Fren ch and C reole with t hem es depicti ng H aitian l ife, as w ell rest aurant s and grocery st ores sel ling prefer red food s. Fish , rice, beans, dried conch, and a hot relish ca lled pim et are lik ely to b e fo und in both the restaura nts as w ell as t he groc ery stores. Str eet vendo rs are likely to be sel ling sw eet potato puddin g, puff pastri es, a nd tamarind or other t ropical f ruit drinks, while a rara drum mer on the corn er accom pan ies a vacc ines player (a type of flute) (Bucuvala s, Bulger , and K enn edy 1994:126-13 6). Little Haiti is at once a vibrant express ion o f the art , archit ecture, and so unds o f Haitian cult ure and also a rem inder o f the diffic ulties of Haitian immigra nts in t he United States . Little H aiti is also a p lace of multiple f amilies livin g in cra mped quarters and where workers are m ostly employ ed at the low est leve ls of Miam i-Dade's eco nomy. It is also a place where Haitians h ave tried to m ake t heir m ark, as indicat ed by num erous sm all business es sta rted by Haitian 3.5.3Sociocultural Issues A rang e soci ocul tural issue s for Haitians in Miami- Dade are reviewed by Port es and Stepick (1993) and Stepick (1998). The se issues can be organized into se veral themes concerning (1) social status and prej udice; (2) cult ural identi ty; (3) econo mic integra tion; and (4) the H aitian enclave. Here we outl ine the basic issues and refe r the reader t o the previous cit ations for m ore extende d di scus sions of these topics. (1)Soci al a nd judice Haitians hav e exper ience d subs tantial prejudice and di scrimination because they a re at once black, C reole/ Fren ch speakers, and im migra nts. They were j ailed more often than o ther refugees. Fede ral pol icy was i ntende d to excl ude them from reaching t he Un ited States and, once here, to deport them back to Hai ti, and other practices and polices regarding Haitians result ed in an \"o fficial unwelcoming\" (Stepick 19 98) by the U nite d Stat es. Haitians w ere unjustl y accus ed of h aving ex cessive ra tes of A IDS and TB, and otherw ise assum ed a pari ahNational Park 3-43status in the Un ited States. Stepick, following Lawle ss (1992), also e mphasizes the pow er of press cov erage to amplify pr ejudic Americans b ecause of such cove rage in conce rt with the eff ects of U.S. immigra tion p olicy and t he response of local com munities t o H aitians (Stepick 199 8:111 5). Indeed, noting that Blacks w ere among those who cam e to the aid of H aitian im migra nts, they also p articipate d in the \"unwe lcomi ng\" of t hese im migra nts. Among Blacks, \"T he w ord H aitian becam e an epit het, standing for orte s and Stepick 1993:191). H aitian s were thu s th e subject o f substan tial pre judice tha t adve rsely affect ed their overall socioeconomic status within Miami-Dade's econ omy an d so cial structure. (2)Cultu ral Id entity Haitians formed cul tural groups ( e.g., Sost ete Koukouy) to pr omote their heritage and l ifeways. The se groups wer e formed in respons e to stigma attached to Hai tian identity. H aitians attem pted to maintain their o wn cultural id entity rath er th an assume th at of the Black s in Miam i. In fact , they ofte n m ade special effort s to distinguish them selves fr om African Americans through the promot ion of cult ural groups and o pulle d down to th e ec onomic lev el o f native B lack s and of havin g th eir distinct immigrant ident ity subm erged into that of the ur ban u nder class\" (Port es and Stepick 1993:190). At the same time, some Haitians, often younger schoo l-age children and young adults , did assume a b lack ide ntity in res ponse to the prejud ice and stigm a attach ed to th eir Haitian herit age. Stepi ck (1 998) desc ribes a proc ess o f individuals \"co veri ng up \" their Haitian identity as they passed as U.S. Blacks or as Wh ites. Th is process of having one identity at home and anot her in the publi c ar ea is inher ently stressful. It also cont rasts wit h the e xper ience s of Haitians in other part s of the U nite d Stat es (Z eph ir 1996). (3)Econom ic Integration The social status and prejudice against Haitians limited their economi c opportunities. Many of the w orkin g class t ook jobs in the inform al econ omy in very low paying jobs. With lim ited opportun ity fo r upward mobility, H aitian s remained among th e poorest im migra nts in Miam i- Dade C oun ty.

(Step ick 1998:41). Port es 1993) a nd Stepick (1998) di scus s H aitian middl e class that is suc cessful and integra ted into t he eco nomic m ainstr eam . However, as a counterpoint, these sam e aut hors also note tha t in s ome in stan ces, th is m iddle cla ss appears invisible b ecause of their desire to hide th eir H aitian ide ntity. The term \"Cra cker,\" while now more widely kn own as a derogatory term for rural w hites, has a2 more specific-and less insulting-definition in Florida. The Florida Crackers are Whites of Celtic descent that first settled South Florida around the mid-eighteent h century, usually having migrated to the Florida Everglades from Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas (Library of Congress 2000) . 3-44 Bisca yne Nationa Ec onomic clav e Little H aiti m ay have develo ped as a cultural enclav e, but it is underdeveloped as an economic enclave. The success of the Cuba n enclave in Miami invites compa rison with ot her immigrant group s suc h as the N icar aguans an d H aitians. For Haitians t here are sever al fact ors cit ed as inhibiting the success of a Haitian economi c enclave. One factor is wha t could be termed the \"leakage\" of incom e from middle cl ass H aitians w ho con scious ly do not buy goo ds o r servi ces from other Haitians, nor do they employ other Haitians (Stepick 1998: 54-55). A second f actor is th e lo wer lev el of \"human cap ital\" (i.e., sk ills, ed ucation , train ing) am ong H aitian s in com parison t o Cuba ns (Port es and St epick 1993). Other factors are (1) the f ede ral assistance offered to Cubans that was not offered to H aitians and (2) the absence of linka ges to existing Haitian bu siness es (Stepick 1992: 77). In c ombination, Haitians have not built the same busi ness infrast ruct ure as t heir C uban neighb ors, nor h ave t hey had the op portunities for upw ard mobility that would hav e pr ovided resources for econom ic de velopm ent. Th e combination of these factors account for major reasons why ther e is no Hai tian economi c enclave. On t he other hand, Haitian businesses have developed strong ties wi th their home land and have success in supplying goods and services to that market. This has promoted the success of some Haitian enter prises, if not a H aitian econ omic enclav e (St epick 1 998). Cul ture in So uth Fl orida South Flori da and Miami-Dade Cou nty ha diverse \"non-ethnic\" population. Ger man- Americ ans, Ir ish-Americ ans, G reek-Americans, and ot her mixed ethnic, o r for purposes of this analysis \"non- ethnic ,\" ident ities exist her e as they do i n all other regions of the Un ited States. These pop ulat ions have w hat m ight b e term ed \"American cult ure\" or the belief s and ated with the m ajority the Uni ted States. Regi onal and l ocal variations exi st in A merican cultur e such \"so uthern cult ure\" cu lture\" in t he w este rn U nite d States. These regional and location variations have distinct customs, beliefs, and wo rldviews that express and give m eaning to part icula r lifestyles. In so uth Florida t here are sel f-defined define regi onal and local vari ations of American cult ure. While there is an extensive literat ure abou t \"So uthern cul ture\" (e. g., Owsley 19 49) in the U nite d Stat es, t his w ork d id no t unc over any extensive w orks about the Florida varia tion of \"southern cult ure\" other t han the erat ure abou t \"Crac kers.\" An d wh ile there m ay be gene ralized literature about \"redne cks\" or2 \"old family\" culture in other are as of the United States , this w ork also did not uncover a well- developed lit erat ure about t he Florida expression of these other va riations of A merican cultur e. A more exhaustive examination of the literature might reveal such specific works, but our search di d not yield such specific works. Conseque ntly, this section w ill focus on t he Fl orida expression of \"Cracker\" culture n ot be cause it represents a \" non-eth nic\" example fo r th is region, but rather because it seems to organize some of the diversi ty ab out rural, Southern, tradit ional w ays o f life.

The se are important cultural contributions to local comm unities, but they are also the most diffusely expressed in existing literature.

The term \"Cr ackers\" is a name given to a group of primarily Celtic origin who a ccompa nied the English into F lorida. T oday in south Florida, C rackers are n ot a w ell-d efin ed gro up who live in disti nct neig hbo rhoods or geograph ic ar eas. However, at one point in Florida history t hey were. In recent history, Cracker has referr ed to a lifest yle or cult ural orienta tion associat ed with living and icing a sel f-suffi cient way of liv ing in w hich peop le built their ow n style of ho mes and p rovided for t heir fam ilies by hun ting, fishing, and o therw ise l iving o ff the land. Fo r som e, \"Cracker\" is a slur r eferr ing t o rural living, poo r whites. Fo r ot hers it indicat es a \"nati ve Floridian \" who pioneered li fe in the rural are as of F lorida. Still others assoc iate the tes. \"Cra cker\" us uall y refers t o Caucasian Floridians w ho live in rural areas and hav e som e associ ation with an agricultural way of life. The description of \"Crackers\" here focus es on the life ways an d tradit ions of C rackers as exp ressed Popu lation Until the mid-nineteen th century , the South was less populated tha n the North and many early Southern settlers were Scots, Iris h, W elsh, an d others fro m what is o ften term ed the \"celtic fringe\" of the British Isles. In fact, some author s argue that the cultural differences betwee n the Northern and Southern colon ies and lat er states is a di rect result of differ ent cult ural groups that populat ed these regi ons (M cWhiney 1 988). Some of the C eltic em igra nts w ere kno wn as Cra ckers with the exact origin of that term being controversial, but apparently relating to the herding or farming practices of some of these emigrants. For example, \"Cr acker is one of the oldest epi thets for white Sou therners and has been use d to de scribe, among ot her folk types, both the st ereot ypical poor white farm er cracking corn a nd the p rosp erous farm er w ho owned a slave or two, farmed a nd r aised cattle and hogs, and use d a long wh ip w ith a t ip ca lled a cracker\" (Storter 2000:xv). Other authors suggest that th e name individ uals livin g in small \"cr acker houses these were individua ls lled at \"cr acking a cow w hip\" (Bucuvalas, Bu and Ke nne dy 1994:38-40). The term \"Cr acker\" appears to d escribe populations that lived in G eorgia as wel l as Florida who p racticed a farming and often a herding lifes tyle (M cWhiney 1988:51-104). Crackers fi rst appear i n Florida abou t the m id-1 8th century. Although they appear t o have settled throug hout Florida, they conc entrated i n Crac kers lived a distin ctive lifest yle, focused around cat tle, far ming, hun ting, f ishing, and so metimes moonshining. Their dist incti ve w ay of lif e appears t o have a ttract ed the at tenti on of m ore t han one traveler who c omm ented o n Fl orida C rackers. Fo r example, Bu cuvalas, Bu lger, and Kenne dy quot ngland traveler's obse rvation of Crackers: The entire trip that day wa s through an unsettled region, the only hum an beings living any where along the road being fo ur or fi ve fa milies of F lorida nat ives, the tallow y, leath er-s kinned sort \u2014 stupid, stolid, staring eyes, dead and lusterless; unke mpt hair, generally tow- colored; and such a shift less, slou ching mann er! Sim ply w hite savages - or li ving w hite mummies would, per haps, bet ter indicate their dead alive looks and act ions. Who, or what, these 'cra ckers' are, fro m whom descended, of what na tion ality, o r what be comes of them, is one among the many unsolved myst eries in this State. Stupid and shiftless, yet sly and vindictive, they a re a block i n the pathway o f civilization, settlement, and ent erprise wherever t hey exist (Bucuvala s, Bulger , and K enn edy 1994:38). This less than flat tering d escript ion o f Crackers is o ne that seem s com mon for t he ti me. Other scholars also suggest that So uthern Crackers, if no t So utherners in gen eral, w ere not well evaluated by their Nor thern brethren: Obs ervers reported that Southerners simply ha d a leisurely attitude towa rd life. In 1789, for exa mple, a visitor described Vir ginians as 'indol ent, rious, poor abun egroes,' who also w ence ' of Sout herners, especially the lazy ways of the 'cr ackers,' but most travele rs claim ed that b eing unhurried was typical of all sorts of Sou thern ers. 'The planter ta kes his time' n oted a visitor to the S outh. ' Leisure and ease are inmates of his roof. H e takes no not e of time. . . . A clock, almanac, and a goo d fire, are ha rd things to find in a planter's house. . . . The wor d, haste, Southerner's vocabulary' ( McWhiney 1 988:44-45 ). Southerners in general and Crackers in particular are described as prone to leisure if not lazy and overly fond of al coh ol, gaiety, and the sens ual pl easures of life. These charact erizations appear similar to English ass essm ents of Iri sh and o ther C eltic peopl es whom they con quered, ofte n describ ing an d depictin g th em as somewhat less than human. It see ms plau sible that the se early char acterizations of Sout herners and C rackers are Engl ish t Celtic peopl es in general. Nonet heless, such descriptions app ear often in travelers' tales and other literature about the early an d later Cra cker populations in the South, but t heir accuracy is w orth q uesti oning. Certainly am ong som e present- day F loridians, t he term Cracker i s no t derogatory, but rather a descripti on worn w ith considerable pride. For exam ple: The Florida Cracker developed a culture that wa s for the most part rural, clannish, leisure-loving, yet com bative - Cel tic in nat ure. Th is cu lture thrived in the wil derness that was south Fl orida and has been ha nded down t o the Crackers of today. As n ative white Floridians h ave r ecla imed their herit age, 'Crack er' is a label t hey wear with pride, proclaiming t heir origins by coverin g their car bum pers wit h 'Flor ida Native' stickers. Florida Cracker E.A. 'Frog Smi th' was asked a few ye ars ago what h e w ould be if he wasn't a Cracker. Hi s instant reply: 'Ashamed' (Bucuvalas, Bulger, and Ke nnedy 1994:38-39). Crackers w ere r anch ers, farmers, and fi sherm en i n south F lorida. They were a mong the lat er pion eers of south F lorida, but t hey were w ithout a doub t \"pion eers\" w ho clea red la nd, raised cattle, an d fished for a livin g while ex hibiting a dis cernable lifes pioneer histo ry impor present-day images and i dent ities of Flor ida Crackers. Yet, as Florida urbani zed,National Park Service 3-47Cracker w ays of life becam e less an everyday rea lity an d m ore of a ref erence t o native-born Floridians who practiced a varie ty o f urban and rur al lifes tyle s (cf. Derr 1 998). T his is not to suggest that C racker lifestyles no longer exist, but the Cracker way of life described in traditional literature is m ostly past. 3.6.2Lifestyles and Culture Tradit ional C racker culture is the fo cus o f this d iscussion of li fest yles and cu lture. M odern Crackers derive their current ways of life from these traditional practices and t hose who use Cracker as a descriptor of a nat ive Floridian i dent ity look to these traditions a s a sour ce of meaning for this i den tity. T his d iscussion focuses prim arily on prom inent fea tures of traditional Cracker cult ure as expressed in Buc uval as, Bulger, and K enn edy 's 199 4 discu ssion of C racker custom s and som of fam ilies (e.g. , Stort er 2 000; D enh am and B row n 2000). Cracker Archi tecture Cracker ar chitecture i s cited as distinctive and derived from their adapt ation to Florida's t ropical climate. However, there is som e variability in how Cracker ar chitecture is de scribed. For example, som e aut hors indicat e that i n re spo nse to the ho t and h umid Florida cl imate, Cracker houses were either one- or two-story open houses with a porch wrapping around at least two sides and som etimes around the en tire struct ure. Doors w ere ori ented so t hey cou ld be op ened for flow-throug h ve ntilation and window s were tall as were the ce ilings. Pea ked r oofs made from cyp ress so all owed for ven tilation (Bucu valas, Bulger, and K enn edy 1994:57-59). Other author s empha size that Cracker hou ses we re built for sum mertime conditions, high of f the ground t o improve circulation, and a side bene fit was that the r aised spa ce allowed a safe spot for livestock. These houses also are described as hav ing kitchens separated from the main house but connected by a \"dog trot.\" Those houses with \"dog trots\" had mo re of a figure \"H\" con structi on and these are oft en co nsidered \"cla ssic\" C racker st yle ho uses (Haase 199 2). Howe ver, regardless of the particular form of these hou ses, they we re oriented to increasi ng \"natural\" air conditioning and sheltering people and animals from t he sun whi le also providing an ou tdoor po rch for so cializing, sh elling peas, or j ust cooling off. Cracker Verbal Style Crackers are described a s a peopl e who app reciated col orful use of lang uage and st ory telling, traits rel ated to t heir C eltic ancestr y (M cWhiney 1 988). In vari ous part s of F lori da there are storytelling festivals that celeb rate the Cr acker propensity for telling stories and relating everyday hap pen ings in colorful w ays. There is al so an exp ansive pop ular literat ure of C racker tales (e.g., H aase 1992; Bruce 1996; Simmons an d Ogden 1998) as well as lists of expressions said to cha racterize Cracker speech. For example, the list below indicates som e Cra cker expr essions: \"Bea r Caught : Is w hen you get overheated and you can't breat he. A s though you had been runn ing from a bear and go t caugh t. Another w ord for sun stroke!

Cow Te nding, Fishing, and Moo nshining Cra ckers we re said to be reluctant agriculturalists, but they are kno wn to be among the first and most success ful ca ttle ranch ers in Florida. As with other aspects of their lifest yle, Cracker ranch ing styles are said to be related to Celtic cow -tend ing pract ices (M cWhiney 1 988:51-79 ). This style i s said t o favor open range grazi ng, t he us e of dogs and w hips to co ntrol and h elp herd the a nimals, and bur ning off the land to increase tende r grasses that cows ar e said to pr efer for grazing (B ucuvalas , Bu lger an d Kennedy 1994:39-43). In Florida, th e Crackers added horses to herd catt le and brands to keep track of their roam ing herds . Their horses becam e a recogn ized breed, t he C racker ho rse, that w as w ell adapte d to t he grazing and herding c onditions in Florida. Cracker preference s for open- range cattle grazing is also sa id to hav e resulted in its pe rsistence until 1949, whereas in othe r par ts of the United St ates open- range grazing di ed in the late 1920s . Ranching in the Cra cker tradition cont inues to be a n impor tant part of sout h Flor ida lifestyles, but as w ith m any other aspects of Florida cul ture, there is al so a thriv ing t ourist business that promotes C racker c owmen, trail rid es, and the swamp cowboy experie nce. Crackers were also adept fisher men who p articipated in com mercial as well as subsi stence fishing. T hey were kno wn for their preferences for cat fish and mullet in their diet , but t hey were also known t o consume take from t heir comm ercial catches including blue fish, snook, redfish, and s nap per. Alligat or and frog legs w ere also special tr eats asso ciat ed w ith Cracker pract ices of \"frogging\" and using marshmallows a nd dogs as bait to attract \"gators.\" In addition to the exot ic pr actices of frogg ing and \"gator\" hunt ing, Crackers are said to hav e pr acticed \"dr y stopNational Park Service 3-49fishing\" i n the sou th Flor ida swam ps a nd t he Eve rglades, usu ally done a t Spr ing hi gh t ides: At high tide the fish go into the grass and even back into the mangrove swa mp. I put the nets out and put stakes on them like a big fence. W hen the tide goes out it will be com pletely dr y in an hour and you will get everything that goe s ba ck in the m ang roves. While the t ide is out I pi ck up all the loose fish that are on t he m ud a nd cl ean the f ish out of the nets. Then the tide comes back in I pull the net back in the boat. I have caught many fish this way (Storter 2000:92). The consi derable angling a nd out door skills of Crackers also made them desirable as gu ides for fishing and hunti ng and many became wel l known f or their skills and abilities for finding and landi ng f ish. But , as gu ides, com mercial ang lers, or subsi stence fisher men, Crackers had unique belief s abo ut being su ccessful in t heir pursuits. As w ith their C eltic coun terpart s, Cracker fi sher- men were prone to vario us superstitions or as the ir Iris h counterp arts w ould say, Piseoga , that prescrib ed or proscribed certain action s that w ould eith er p rotect th em from harm or promote succ essful fishing. For example, \" . . . it is bad l uck t o leave dock on a Friday, say 'alligator' or 'bana na' on boar d, hav e a woman on boa rd, whistle on boa rd, turn the ha tch upsi de dow n, or bring a black suitcase on board\" (Bucuvalas, Bulger, and Kennedy 1994:49). The se types of belief s were com mon and in fact no dou bt re main a par t of C racker cult ure i n so uth Florida. Cracker fisher men a nd r anchers were know n for their poac hing and t hey eva luated it as pa rt of a lifestyle rather than as a violation of law. However, in addition to often being on the wrong side of t he law while p oach ing, they also were k nown as prolif ic \"m oonshiners\" or prod ucers of illicit alcoho l. Aga in, this is a tradition that is fundamental to Ce ltic ways of life, with on ly the ingredients var ying. F or th e Irish, poteen was and still is a v ariety of Celtic m oonshine made from pot atoes, while their Cracker cous ins use d cor n, sug ar, or whatever else was at hand. Poaching, moonshining, and, to a lesser extent, smuggling are the ornery expressions of Cracker cult ure for som e, while for ot hers the cult ure exem plified a l iving-off-t he-land li fest yle t hat exempli fied the se lf-sufficiency t hat Crackers so v alued. Celebrations In the past, Cracker celebrations and other elements of expressive culture revolved around family and religion. Famil y life cycl e even ts such as births, deaths, birthdays, and r eligious holida ys were among the most im portan t celebratio ns in the ir daily lives . This focus on fam ily and religion may not necessarily represent modern Cracker culture since today celebrations and fest ivals that ar e \"Cracker\" t end to celebrat e story-te lling and the ou tdoor and s kills of C rackers of days past. Events such as Cra cker Heritage Days in various comm unities and story telling cont ests and ce lebrations, as wel l as events suc h as Pionee r Days and C racker County Days, exempli fy more of a celebration of thing s pa st than a n expr ession of present-day beliefs, values, and practices . 3.6.3Sociocultural Issues Crackers in som e respect represent non-et hnic nat ive Florida pop ulat ions .

This section summ arizes some of th e findings from this liter ature a s a mean s to ill ustrate the range of to pics and issues conce rning us es of BISC r esources. 4.1 Ove rview BISC is a unique marine managed area , both in terms o f its ph ysical setting and its users. L ocated near the city of Home stead and adjacent to Mi ami's urban and suburban commu tural interests (Figure 13 ). Th ese include th e former Hom estead Ai r Forc e Ba se (AFB) , Florida Powe r and Light 's Turke y Point N uclear Powe r Plant, vari ous agri cultural area s, and other com mercia l and re sidential developm ents . Compounded with these interests are other proposed activities and developments that do or ma y affect the park's resources an d interests, p articular ly the fight o ver Stil tsvil le, the futur e of the Miami Cir cle, and proposed development on the realigned Ho mestead AFB. BISC acti vities such as fi shing and b oating, a nd its users h ave access to a variety of entrance points du e to the park's setting. Visitors can en ter the park via land at its m ain entrance at Co nvo y Po int near H omestead and at Black Point and B ayfron t Park Mar inas, whi ch abut the park; how ever, almos t all points of entry are on the water. Accordingly, a major ity of the uses associ ated with the park take pl ace in the c oastal and mar ine e nvironment. There a re two p rimary typ es of resources that BISC offers its users: natural resources and cu ltura l resources. Na tural resources refer to the coastal and ma rina flora and fauna, the coastal and ben thic formation s, and the gen eral physical con ditio ns of the park and its environs . Cultural resour ces refer to bot h submer ged a nd l and- based cultural resources, s uch a s artifacts, const ructions, a nd str uctures, including pr ehistor ic, colonial, and more recent items. This assessment study began with an extensive literature survey to identify the uses of BISC, and the preliminary research conducted focused on the history of the uses, the past and present partici pan ts, and c urrent use stan dards and practices. N o attem pt w as m ade to circum scribe uses to the traditional definition of active participation in re sour ce extraction or appreciation; i nste ad, we e xpa nded the definition to ident ify all stakehol ders and use s tha t may e xploit, app reciate, or com pete for BIS C resou rces. Th is study determin ed th at the p ark's n atural resources are primar ily utilized by commerc ial and re creational fishing inte rests, divers, boate rs and cr uisers, and land- based visitors/tourists. Indirect natural resource use s tha t may c onfl ict or compet e wi th BISC include avia tion us es at the form er Ho mestead AF B facil ity, Turk ey Po int N uclear Pow er Plant, and a gricultural interests. Use rs of the park's cu ltural resources are more difficult to define; th erefore, the park's m ajor cultura l resources will be described and th en th e majo r uses of those resources will be d escribed. These resources include Stiltsville, Tequesta sites on the park's isla nds (and l inks to the Miami Circl e outside th e Park), histo rical structures o n th e park's islands , BISC' s submer ged cu ltural resources or shipwre cks.

The erre d t for the invert ebrates are wood slate-traps for lobs ter and stone crab , wire traps for bl ue crab , and n ets for sh rimp. Bal lyhoo, primaril y a baitfish speci es, is al so caught using ne ts, and s napper-gr oup er a re ca ught mostly by hook-an d-line an gling, although the re is significant (recreational) spearfishing of these species as wel l. Whi le sharing some common species , the main dis tinction bet ween ba it shrimp and f ood shr imp is the ph ysical size of the individua l shrimp, with food s hrimp con siderably larger than bait shrimp. Comm ercial landings data in Florida are repor ted us ing a t rip ticket system. Fisherme n fill out trip ticket s, itemizing cat ch, trips, and ar ea fi shed. The larger reporti ng ar ea for Biscay ne Bay is Miami- Dade Co unty itself; however, there is a subset for the b ay, which i ncludes Bisca yne Bay , Bar nes Soun d, and Ca rd Soun d. The catch totals for the entire Miami -Dade Cou nty region have fluctuated between 1.3 and 2.2 million pounds for the period between 1990-2001 (FMRI 2002). Ove rall, there has been a net loss of 299 commerc ial fishing licenses in the indus try from 1994-1998. The num ber o f com mercially reg istered vessels has d ecrease d in the C ounty as we ll, from 1,353 vessels in 1989-1990 to 757 vessels in 1998-1999.

Th e total trips, which may ref lect addit ional effort as they i nclude multi ple- species trips, have similarly decli ned s ince the 199 1 peak, when there were 5,616 trips recorded. I n the most recent year , less than 3, 400 trips were recorded. As the numbers of trips hav e in creas ed in the early 1990s, the catch per trip ha s decreased. Th en, in the late 1990s, as the numbe r of trips d ecrease d, the c atch p er trip incre ased for a few years b efore declining aga in. I t is interes ting to note t hat some o f the b est catch per trip peri ods have b een r ecorded during t he year s wh en fishing effort has bee n at its low est ( 1998 and 1999). Amend ment three of the Florida Constit utio n, kn own as the net ban, was implem ented in July 1995 and made unlawf ul the use of entangling nets. As the net ban was intended to re duce press ure o n sever al key species of finfish, a decli ne in overa ll landin gs was expected, however long t erm benef its resul ting from the ne t ban wil l be rea lized th rough conti nued imp rovem ent to finfi sh stocks (Adams et al 2000). Figure 14: Finfish Cat ch and Ef fort , 199 0-200 1 Stone crab catches followed a patt ern of alterna tively increas ing and decreas ing catch cycl es (Figu re 15). For ex ample, land ings ex ceeded 100,000 po unds in 1994-95 bu t dropped to less than 60,000 pounds t he s ubsequent season. Als o, it appears that fishermen bega n taking mo re trips s ince the 1993-94 season, but efficiency did not imp rove unt il the 1 998-99 season.

By the late 1990s, how ever, catch continue d to d ecline, and it reached its lowest point in 2001, when onl y 11,750 pounds were l anded. Initially, effort re- mained at or nea r 1,000 trips per s eason in the late 19 90s, but it decreas ed consider ably by 2001. Stone crab s are landed from October 15 to May 15 ( FAC 68B-13 .005). Like spiny lobs ter, stone crabs are ca ugh t in wood sl ate-traps, and th is fishery is subject to a certificate pr ogram ( Florida Statute 370.13), starting in the 2 000-01 season. However, unl ike spiny l obst ers, which ar e harv ested who le, it is illega l to harves t whole s tone crab s; instead, only l egal sized claws a re remo ved, and t he inver tebrate is released.

William s (1997) reported that catch per unit effort (CPUE) has de cline d steadily d ue to the excess gear capitalizatio n in the fishery, bu t it is not know n whether this is t he c ase for B iscayn e Bay. As no ted by A ult et al. ( 2001), there is \"sparse literature\" on the stone crab fishery in the bay. Data trends from the Biscayne Bay regi on sh ow less than 8,000 pounds l anded in 1999, 7,800 pounds in 2000, and sl ightly m ore than 3,000 po unds in 2001. The blu e crab fishery ap pears to have incre ased a substantial am ount of eff ort since the e arly 1990s to the prese nt day. Trips increas ed from less than 100 in 1990 to over 1, 500 in 1996; there were alm ost 1,200 trips rec orded in 2001. Also , it seem s that only rec ently has the efficienc y in the f ishery imp roved, as dem onst rated by the i ncrea sed CPUE (or trip) for the 1 999 season as compared to p revious seaso ns; t hat trend has co ntinue d into 2000 and 2001. Figure 16: Blue Crab Cat ch and Ef fort , 199 0-200 1 Blue crabs have no season and can be caugh t year-round; the data displayed in Figure 16 show that whil e landin gs for invert ebrates in 1999 decli in Bisca yne Bay durin g the s ummer, they did not ceas e. This is becaus e the sum mer catches reflect exclus ively blue crab s. The bl ue crab fishery dat es back to the late 1800s in Flori da, but it was not until the 1950s that the curren t gear type - wire t raps - began to predo minate the f ishery . Landi ngs have remained low f or Biscay ne Bay c ompared to o ther re gions, but there ha s been a re cent incre ase (ac cording to Ault et al. [2001]). That increas e can be a ttributed to an increas e in the t otal number of fishermen and trips; con sequently, CPUE has dec lined in the fishery. In 1999, almost 120,000 poun ds of blue crab were landed in Biscayne Bay and almost 150,000 in Miami-Dade County (from a low of 82,000 pounds in 1998). In 2000, almost 190,000 pounds were l anded in Bis cayn e Bay ( more than the 140,000 pounds landed in Miami- Dade County), and the landin gs drop ped to 10 5,000 pounds in 2001. National Park Service 4-5Ault et al. (1997) found that blue crab s are mo stly target ed in the s outher n part s of the b ay a nd park, and t hat the t raps are locat ed almost exclus ively on s eagrasses in the s outhwest ern sho reline betw een Black Point M arina an d Turkey P oint Po wer P lant. Spin y lobst er landin gs in the M iami- Dade Co unty region ha ve decli ned s teadil y since peaki ng in the 1993-94 season. Effort too h as declined with catch, and 2001-02 was the lowes t year for lobs ter cat ch during t he preceding decade, when only 210,000 pounds were l anded ( com pared to 1993-94, w hen alm ost 700, 000 p ounds we re land ed). Figure 17: Lobst er Cat ch and Ef fort , 199 0-200 1 Spin y lobster is landed from the first week of August to the last week in Mar ch, although t he recrea tional season com mences a week pri or to the com mercia l season ( FAC 68B 24. 005). The predo minant gear type in the f ishery is the af orem entioned woo d slate-trap, a nd t he number of traps is s trictly con trolled under a mar ket-based certificate pr ogram ( Shivlani and Mil on 2000). The only othe r way t hat fishermen can com mercia lly ha rves t spiny lobs ter is by div ing for t he s pecies. Spiny lobster f ishing is allowed in a majorit y of the Bis cayn e Bay. However, under FAC 68B-1 1, no lobs ter fi shing is allowed in the B iscayn e Bay-Card Sound Spiny Lobst er San ctua ry. As n oted ab ove, spin y lobst er is not a very imp orta nt com mercia l species in the b ay, as over 90 p ercent of the an nual catch is landed in the Fl orida Keys . However, it does repres ent a ves tige of the region' s past history, and it remains imp orta nt for the few fi shermen who trap in the l ower part s of the b ay, including Car d Sound and Barnes Sound. In the 2 000-01 and 2001-02 seaso ns, fishers trap ping in B iscayn e Bay land ed 3,500 po unds and 4,000 po unds, resp ectively. Spin y lobst er are target ed in a varie ty of hab itats, but traps are usual ly set on s eagra sses or hard bottoms (near coral and pat ch reef s). Ault et al. (1997) found tha t over hal f of the t raps they obser ved in the park were l ocated on s eagra ss, a third on patch r eefs , and 14 percent on ba re substrate. Th e rese archers also no ted that t he t raps are loc ated either c lose to sho re (328 f eet) or out o n the eastern side of the ke ys in the p ark. Bait sh rimp catc hes ha ve inc rease d dramatically in the 1990s, f rom 50,000 po unds in 1990 t o alm ost 700, 000 p ounds in 2000.

H owever, 20 01 w as a medi ocre year, as catches only reached 360,000 poun ds (or the 199 3/94 levels), even thou gh effort wa s at 5,5 00 trips (2,500 t rips abo ve the 1993 seaso n). In f act, CPUE w as at it s low est4-6 Biscayne Nat ional Park Ethnographic Over view and Assessmentpoint in the past decade. Wh ether this represents an overfishing trend o r be determ ined Figure 18: Bai t Shri mp Catch and Ef fort , 199 0-200 1 Bait shrimping, an activity tha t ha s occurred in the bay since the early 1950s (Se idenfeld 1999), utilizes a trawl that is towed behind a vessel. Ove r time, the trawl has been modif ied into the so- called roll erframe ( which es sentially is a roller trawl t hat moves over seagra ss). Alt hough the system has been endorse d by t he S tate of Florida, there have been studies imp licating rollerframes for impacts to sponges and hard and soft corals (Ault et al. 1997; T ilmant 19 79). While the numbe r of vessels in the fishery increased since its incep tion, reaching a max imum of 46 boat s in 1986, that total has decreas ed to a dozen or more boat s curr ently. Unli ke in the crab and l obst er fisheri es, effort in the b ait shrimp fishery gener ally emanat es from Dinner Key and Black Point Marinas (from the cent ral bay). The f ishing ves sels, as note d above, work year round and can swe ep the shallo w (4 to 6 feet) bay bottom up to four times per year (Au lt et al. 1997). The sh rimp fishery , mainly food shr imp , has dramati cally increa sed i n the 199 0s, much t o the expen se of the catch/effort ratio. It appea rs that the numbe r of trips has greatly out paced catch in most yea rs, and the ratio has declin ed signif ican tly towards the end of the 1 990s, sugges ting Figure 19: Shri mp Catch and Ef fort , 199 0-200 1 a large b ut less efficient fishery . From the late 19 90s through 20 01, catch has decreas ed st eeply. In 2001, eve n tho ugh trip s incre ased (526 total trips) fro m the p revious ye ar (443 t otal t rips in 2000), catch st ill dropped from 220,000 pounds in 2000 to 90, 000 pounds in 2001.National Park Service 4-7Food shrim ping is c onducted primarily w ingn etters, so-ca lled due to the appeara nce of their fishing ves sels that skim nets on e ither s ide.

The bait shrimp fishery , in all three seasons shown ab ove f or Biscay ne Bay, as well as for t he repor ting pe riod of 1994-98, is the most import ant fishery in the region as determin ed by catch and ef fort.

Under t hese cir cum stances , BIS C requested that the M FC clo se the fishery (D iresta, Lo ckw ood, and C urry 1995). Sponging i s still allowed in other part s of Florida, but the re are regulat ions on gear, size, and area s. Spon gers may not dive for spon ges in most State wat ers, and they can only use standar dized gear a nd f ish a mini mum size (Flori da St atutes 370.17). In the Bis cayn e Bay ar ea,National Park Service 4-9spongers only use Barnes Sound and Card Sound, avoidin g the cent ral and upper bay (personal communication, Jo s\u00e9 O rdono). A 199 5 study on t he s ponge pop ulation within the park dete rmined t hat the com mercia l sponges harv ested previousl y by fishermen have low grow th ra tes.

Since t he 1991 closure , a few s pongers have illega lly harv ested sponges in BIS C, an d th ese user s have been banned f rom the park for all acti vities. However, these remain isolat ed inci dent s, and the us e is not perm itted. There i s spongin g allowed in t he B iscayn e Bay region tha t is not part of the park itself.

RECREATIONA L FISHING Rec reational fishing is am ong the most popul ar activities undertaken in BISC. Pr oviding a vari ety of habitats, the park host s thousands of recre ational fishing ves sels annual ly; the 1 997 total was es timated a t less than 33,000 fishing vessels. As p art of a boat surv ey, BIS C determined the char acteristics of the recreat ional fishery . The st udy f ound that most fishermen t end t o be recreational anglers, althou gh almost a fifth engage in s pearfishing, and almost 30 per cent go farther of fshore ( east of the park 's islands) . The area s that most fishermen use are along the r eef tract (ha rd bottom substrate) an d the area inside the bay near Adams Key (m ixed substrate).

Another study , whi ch exami ned data from 19 76 to 1991, determin ed the average characteristics of recrea tional angl ers (Harper, Bohns ack, and Lo ckwoo d, 200 0). However, it should be n oted that t he d ata used in the stud y predates Hurrica ne A ndrew , wh ich had dramatic and chronic effects on rec reatio nal ac tivities and p atterns in the reg ion (per son al co mmunication, M aria Villanueva) . In tha t study, th e resear chers found that recre ational trips yi eld approximatel y 9 fish/shellfish, and an gler means were ap proxim ately half that amo unt.

A 2 001 study by Au lt et al.

The res earche rs also not e the exi stence of \"serial overfishing ,\" whe ng eted now that t he p reviously va luab le ones have b een overfished. Muc h of this overfishing is blamed on the increase in the fishing effort in the re gion, which the study note s has increas ed by 444 percen t in the peri od bet ween 1964 and 1 998. Add ed to t his increas e has been a s igni fican t imp rovem ent i n fishing technology, assisting fishers to locat e an d harve st fish.

Alt hough the most frequent act ivities undertaken are nonco nsum ptive (such as nature view ing and wa lking), 31 percent of the visitor s do particip ate in recre ational fish ing. M oreover, a large maj orit y of the re spondent s, or 72 percent , view recreatio nal fishing as an ap propriate ac tivity in t he p ark (only 13 p ercent d isagre e). BOATING Pleasur e bo ating, o r cruising , rem ains am ong the most po pular water-based activit y in sou th Florida and in BISC. Althou gh it is often and correc othe is neve rtheless imp orta nt to exa mine boat ing as an overal l activity in the park and its envir ons. The nu mber o f registered vessels has inc rease d steadily in so uth Flo rida over the 1990s, reaching to a total of 50,163 registered vessels in Miami -Dade Cou nty in 1997 (Boat ing Re search Coun cil 2000). Of this total, almost 48,000 vessels are pleasu re craft, and ov er 50 per cent of these are betw een 16 to 26 feet in lengt h. Commercial vessels, wh ich inclu de fishing bo ats, com pris e 1,702 of the t otal , and a majorit y of these vessels are a lso in t he 1 6- to 26- foot ran ge. Finally, a m ajority of the ves sels (over 47 ,000) use a com bination of inboard an d/outb oard motors; less than 1,000 vessels are re gistere d as sailboa ts. Mostly local boat s (from Miami- Dade County) use BISC, as sugges ted by studies condu cted at the park (Lockwo od and Perr y 1997, 1998). In 1997, an est imated 50, 000 vess els used t he park for a va riety of act ivities (including f ishing, diving, and pas sage); of that total , almost 30,000 boats participated in fishing activities, and 9 0 per cent of thos e users wer e from M iami -Dade County. A 199 1 study condu cted to det ermine b Miami-Dade Co unty det ermined t hat most vessels are launched on boat ramps closest to their proposed destination, although ramp and marina preference is m ore related to proximity than eventual site preference (BRC 1991). Acco rdin gly, great er tha n half of th e boater s surv eyed in the st udy disclosed t hat they us ed th e ramp close to their hom e, and o ver 85 percent of the re spondent s who used ra mps in souther nNational Park Service 4-11Miam i-Dade County w ent to d estinations so uth o f Cap e Flo rida.

The mo del determin ed that boatin g into BI SC is highest from t hree southern mar inas: Mat heson Hamm ock, Bla ront Park . and nort hern ramps/ mar inas do not tend to visit the park. Althou gh these pa tterns may have changed since 1991 due to more vessel s and due to t he ef fects of Hurri cane Andrew, dat a from McClell an (1996) sugges t other wise. That study, which used overf lights com parin g the num ber o f boat trailers in the s outher n marin as and t he num ber of boat s in the park , dete rmined t hat it might be p ossible to estim ate the nu mber o f boats using the p ark by c ounting the bo at trailers.

Areas that were severel y scarr ed in BIS C incl ude the part s of the bay imm ediat ely west of Boca Chit a Key, Sands Cu t, Caesar Creek, and M idni ght Pas s in the sout hern boundary . W ith the except ion of the f irst site, all other s evere sca rring i s located within high traffic sites, conf irming the ef fects of ves sel dam age. The ef fects of larger vessel abuse were most preval ently obse rved wit h the groundin vessel M/T Igl oo Moon in Novem ber 1996 on the park' s coral reef s (BISC 200 0a). Damaging almost 500 square meter s of reef res ources, the ves sel injured both the coral reef and ot her organi sms i n the area . In Decem ber 2000, under the Par k System Resources Pr otect ion Act, the Nation al Pa rk Serv ice settled f or $1 million ( the large st settlem ent ever under the ac t). The se funds s hall be use d for res torat ion and remed iation in the affected area , as well as in othe r park area s. Althou gh not direc tly related to re source damage but to m aintain the \"env ironmental integr ity of park areas,\" the use of perso nal waterc raft (PW C) has bee n prohibited in B ISC effective A pril 20, 2000 ( 36 C FR 1, 3, 13) . Base d on potential reso urce impacts, user conflicts, and safet y concerns , BIS C and 12 othe r areas have been closed to all PW C use. They shal l remain close d to such act ivities unt il it is dete rmined, based on a var iety of park- specif ic char acteristics and objective s, that suc h use is again a ppropriate. Related to boating activity, divi ng is an impo rtant recreational activity in and around BISC. Apart f rom the lice nsed concessiona ire, there are the afore mentio ned private ve ssels t hat cru ise to and enjo y the co ral ree fs and other hard bottom habitats of the park and surro unding ar eas. In a re cent study completed by Johns et al. (2001), it was found that there were 3.25 million perso n-days spe nt snorke ling and div ing in natural and artif icial re efs in M iam i-Dade County from June 200 0 - M ay 200 1 (total use was 9 .17 million person- days , including a ctivities such a s4-12 Biscayne Nat ional Park Ethnographic Over view and Assessmentfishing and glass-bo ttom boating). The v isitors were willing to pay $47 m illion to protect these resources f rom wate r qual ity degradat ion, phys ical impacts, and overus e. Fi nally, over 6 0 percent wer e in favor of no-take zones in Miami -Dade Coun ty, and th e av erage per centage of coral ree fs no-take area preferre d was 30 pe rcent. While this stud y did not target B ISC u sers, the results demon strate user behavior in the greater Biscayne Bay area, and the views may b e indicative o f users w ithin the p ark. CULTURAL RESO URCES BISC co ntains a vari ety of cult ural resources, ran ging from anci ent pre-Colum bian s ites of the ances tors the Tequesta Ind ians , colonial and post -coloni al sub merged res ources, and historical bui ldin gs f rom the 190 0s. The park ifies, manages, and maint ains over 100 kno wn arc heo logical sites and 10 histo rica l structures (Ad ams et al. 1998). Tequest a sites have been ident ified in B ISC and are located o n Elli ott Key, Sands Key , Soldi er Key, and Tott en Key. Nearb y, but outs ide t he park , is the re cently discovered M iami Circl e. Thi s latter resource is of distinct regional impo rtance as it ma y have been a strong cent er- periphery tie to the les s dra matic but imp orta nt sites within the park . The M iami Circl e, locat ed on t he mainl and near the m outh o f the M iami River , is under M iami- Dade Co unty cont rol a nd was purchas ed usi ng S tate an d Co unty funds. The cir cle was dis covered during a routi ne archeo logical exc avatio n in Septem ber 1998 w hen M iam i-Dade C ounty arch eologists discovered unusual features cut i nto the ground of a ne w co nstruct ion s ite (Miami- Dade Park s 2000). Th e resu lting excavatio n yield ed a 38-f oot-diam eter c ircle cut int o the bed rock, as w ell as evidence of animal offerings and o ther art ifacts. It is believed that the circle m ay have s erved as a temple or cou ncil house. The cir cle r emains in excel lent condit ion an d is bel ieved to b e more t han 2,000 years old; BISC and archeol ogist s suspect that the T equest a may h ave t rave led betw een the island s and the Miam i Circle , thus linking the two area s as arch eological satellites. The futu re o f the M iam i Circle was no t secu re u ntil t he State o f Florida provided the C ounty with $1 5 mill ion f or t he $ 26.7 mill ion purchas e, and the County secured other funding a nd loans. W hile the c ircle does no t belon g to the p ark, the re was som e discu ssion in 1999 that it be joined with BI SC to secure fede ral funding; howe ver, the propos al, led by Sen ator Bob Graha m, failed witho ut any su pport in the U .S. House of Rep resen tatives. In ea rly 2001, the Sta te of Florida crea ted a group tha t will overs ee the long-t erm p lanning an d man agemen t of the Miami Circle site. Th e Mia mi Ci rcle Planning Gr oup - comprised of community lead ers, historia ns, arche ologists, and preser vatio nists - advises o fficials o n site interpret ation an d pu blic vi sitation pla nning iss ues. Am ong it s mem bers is the BIS C superi ntendent (Florida D epart ment of State 20 01). At i ts inaugural meeting in Augu st 2001, the g roup heard public comme nts, discussed the historical significance of the site, and consi dered current issues , including plans for in terpret ation, a draf t interim managem ent plan , and tempor ary facilities. Most recently, Senator Graham a gain called for the preservation of the M iami Circl e as part of Bisca yne National Park . He an nounced a U.S . Depart ment of the Interior plan to co nduct a feasibility study t o incorporate the s ite as par t of the N PS. The inclus ion wil l cons ider futur e funding a nd wo uld t ake 18 month s to co mplet e, once t he legislation i s approved (Thom as 2002). In addit ion to its intrinsic cult ural resource v alue, the Miami Circle could also provide an urban gateway to BISC. In several ways, such a presenceNational Park Service 4-13cou ld provide an interpretive br idge f or pre-Colum bian a nd conte mporary us e pat terns between the areas that are now urban Miami and BISC. In 1998, the p ark u pdated its inven tory o f subm erged cultural re sources to at least 83 sit es, with an estimat ed 30 to 40 sites that wer e still being evaluated (Ada ms e t al. 1998). The se sites range from historic s hipwrecks to other submerged cult ural artifacts. There a re also other historical sites on the p ark's keys, inclu ding m ore re cent st ructures. Finally, Stiltsville is a set of seven rema ining structures within the northwe stern boun dary in fact, that northern boun dary was expan ded in 1980 to include whi ch the S 199 Stiltsville's ori gins lie wit h a b arge t hat ran aground in the 1920s just south of Key Biscayne, whi ch was then used as a bait shop and restaurant. Var ious struc ture s we re er ected alongside the reno vated barg e, and slow ly a co mmunity of sorts developed. W hile p rivately c onstruc ted, the State of Florida d (subm erged) righ ts, and ements were reached between struct ure occu pant s and the state. The structures grew in s ize a nd in number an d peaked in 1965 at 24 houses ; therea fter b egan t he decline, w ith the State of Flo rida prohibiting all ne w construc tion an d Hurricane B etsy dest royin g 7 h ouses that same year . When t he N ational Park Service t ook poss ession of the ar ea including S tiltsville, the t erms of the exis ting leases, including t heir expira tion dat es, remained in effect. In 1992, Hurr icane An drew de stroyed all but 7 structures. Th e final leases on Stiltsville expired i n July 1999, but stands till agreements extended t he dat e to D ecem ber 31, 2000. As part of the d ecis ion m aking p rocess , a citizen s' ory com mittee was form ed to det ermine possible alternate p ublic uses for the struc ture s. The c ommittee m et three tim es in 2001-02 to consi der t he event ual disposi tion o f the S tiltsville struct ures , and t he s tands till agreement s were extended to April 2002 (later ext ended t o June 2 002). Finally, following cons ensus a mong t he vari ous s takeh olders in ear ly May 2 002, followed by a National Park Service Advisory Board public meeting on May 30, the struc ture s' fate was dec ided (BISC 2002). ag reement, previous lea seho lders will enjo y continue d access to the sites un der a sp ecial-use perm it until at least December 31, 2 002, w hile awaiting the completion of an am endment to the park's General Management Plan (GMP).

The se method s include participant observation within the park and a ttenda nce at publ ic meeting s. A lso, ind ivid uals w ere interview ed to elic it info rmation abou t four major topics: the nature of user ac tivities, the m eanings of park resour ces, the connection betwee n activities and user groups an d cultural groups in surrounding com munities; and, management issues and concerns among park users in 2001 and 2002. Fieldw ork w as con ducted in t wo periods of approx imately o ne week each. Individuals w ere selected for interviews f rom a listing of user groups, inte rested p arties, and pe rsons knowledgeable about t he p ark and it s resources. Additionally, park personnel were interviewed con cerning their kno wledge about user gr oup s and activities. Som e limited inter views were conducted wi th visitors to the park. Field notes were taken during these interviews bu t no electronic re cording s were m ade. Charac terizin g perception of the park from a lim ited n umber o f contacts is hazardous, bu t a them e emerges from field da ta that sug gests BISC is something of a n unknow n par k, a place people p ass through or use, but they may not ne cessarily know the y are in a \"N ation al P ark.\" In part, this is because the most usual access to the park is via private boats that depart from t he various coun ty m arinas o r pri vate dock s through out M iam i-Dade C oun ty an d adja cent ar ea (Figure 23) . As one pe rson sug gested: There's probably no other urb an area that h as so much park next to it, but it is a park that you a lmost hav e to hav e a boat to get to, that is one of the g reat thing s about it. Bu t when you leave your dock you are not thinking 'I am going to the park' because sometim es you ar e in it and sometim es you are no t. There is o nly one concessionaire and that is pr obably why t he park is not used all that much. You m ight not say that if you go out there on the w eekends, lots of boa ters, but the area is close, and it is like being in the Keys withou t all the hyp e of the Keys and all the people too! N othi ng is pristine do wn he re, maybe parts of the Everglades are as close to pristine as you get, but the park (BISC) is a place I like to tak e m y kids. . . . Anot her person observed that BISC's identity also may ge t confused wi th the nearby marine sanctuary, and b oate rs from Coun ty m arinas o ften m ay n ot kno w the ex act locat ion o f park boundaries, even if they are awar e of BISC's existence. Marine sanctuaries and parks adjacent to BISC ar e show n in Fig ure 24. With Ever glades National Par k also nea rby, BISC h as a less glamorous image, althou gh for some its lowe r visibility is part of its attraction.

There is a percept ion that t he p icnic are as are used p rimarily by Hispanics w ithout attenti on to des cribing t heir et hnicity. Sho rt-term exploratory ethno graphic field observations suggest that a good proportion of these wee kend picnickers are H ispanic, m ostly fam ilies with children. Park staff suggest that de spite effo rts to invite these visitors into the interpretative center, they prefer to enjoy the picnic areas and not ventur e upstai rs to parti cipat e in t p ark's educat ional eff orts. Park sta ff al so n ote t hat they continue out reach ef forts to include these and ot her casual visitors of these facilities. Casual tourists, bicycl ists, sailboar ders, and f isher men a comm on w eekend v isitors. Tou rists in family and other sma ll groups walk the sidewalks that are on the perimeter of theNatio nal Park Serv ice 5-7picnic grounds and then often venture onto the jetty that extends into the bay.

Sailb oarders laun ch from a sm all beach n ear the V isitor's C enter parking lot a nd take full advanta ge of on shore w inds that blow a cross the bay. Thi s area is relatively uncrowde d except for the occasional kayaker and the tw o or th ree small cra bbing boats c hecking th eir trap s marked by visible b lue and white floats. Fishermen us e several areas in the immediate vicinity of the Visitor's Ce nter, including the jetty. Th ese types of visitors are discus sed in m ore detail in ot her parts of this section, but here it is important to note that fishermen are among the usual group of daily and weekend visitors to the onshore areas of BISC. Some visitors to t his p rincipal on shore area of t he p ark t ake advanta ge of t he s ervi ces offered by the concessionaire who o perates tours to El liott and other K eys as well as snorkling and divi ng tri ps (Figure 27). The co nces sion aire offers t he casu al visitor w ithout a priv ate boat at leas t a lim ited o pportun ity to visit th e bay and Keys as well as the land area s of the park. W ith only one c onces sionai re, these types of trips a re limited, and w ithout a private vessel it is not possible to visit most areas of the park. 5.1 Recreat ional Fishing Recreational fishing is among t he m ost popul ar activities in the par k, and r ecreational use rs fish both fr om land- based canals wit hin pa rk bounda ries and on boat s in par k w aters. Pre vious stud ies on fisheries have focused mainly on the fishing activities undertaken while on the water, i.e., on vessels or using dive gear (Ault et al. 1997, 2001; Seidenfeld 19 99; Harper et al. 2000). While a n ex cellent, extensive dat a set exists for re crea tional fishing off bo ats in BIS C (see Lock wood and Perry 1 997, 1998; H arper et al. 2000), there is lit tle inform ation o n recreat ional fishing from canal bank s and off the sho reline in BISC. Interv iew and o bserva tion d ata were collect ed to describe var ious t ypes of recrea tional fi shing w ithin BIS C. These dat a indicat e that recreational fishing i n Biscayne Bay can be divided into three types: inshor e, offshore, and shoreli ne. I mportant insh ore fisheries exist on the flat s (i. e., shallow water sand and coral bottoms) and in d eeper w aters ar oun d co ral heads and o pen water. The o ffsho re fi shery occ urs outside the limits of the bay in de eper wat ers ne ar the Gul f Stream. The species so ught, fishing tech nology, a nd boats for each type o f fishing are di ffer ent. Sh oreli ne fishin g takes place at Convoy Point i n the canals t hat fl ow into B iscayn e Bay, as w ell as t he s horelines that ar e adjacent to these canals. Each of these types of sportfishing is briefly described below.1.0 Purpose and Need 5-8 Biscayne National Park Ethnographic Overview and Assessment Graphics 0K034 Biscayne National Park\\Figures\\Fig X Photographs2 (DBrady) 5/5/03Page 3Figure 27 Concessionaire Boats at Convoy Point Dock (top) and Afternoon Shoreline Fishing at a Canal Mouth Within Biscayne National Park (bottom) 1.0 Purpose and Need National Park Service 5-9 Graphics 0K034 Biscayne National Park\\Figures\\Fig X Photographs3 (DBrady) 5/5/03Figure 28 Canal Fishing Within Biscayne Bisca yne Nationa l Park Ethnogr aphic Overvie A ssessmen t5.1.1Shoreline Fishing On most wee kends or in the late afternoons during the wee k, people can be observed shor eline fishing at places such as Mowry Can al and Conv oy Point (Figures 27 and 28). Persons fishing may con sist of single i ndividuals , a parent and their children, and fam ily grou ps o r m ixed group s of m en and women. Th e charact eristics and activities of t hese shoreline fisherm en w ere determined by interviews wi th park enforcement personne l who pa trol the shoreline areas and by interview s with fisherm en at vario us shorelin e lo cation s within BISC. This w ork b egan w ith the identif icat ion o f canals and sh oreli ne s ites used by recreational fishers in BISC. This invol ved traveling t o ea ch a ccessible canal and shore line si te, starting wit h Bla ck Point Marin a, w hich includes the confluence of Black Creek a nd G oulds Canal s, M ilitary Canal, and M owry Canal, and en ding at Convoy Point near t he V isitor's C enter and H omeste ad Bayfront Park. Of the sites visited, only Black Po int Marina, Mowr y Ca nal, Conv oy Poi nt, and Bayfront Park are direct ly accessible t o land-based visit ors. Furt herm ore, no land-based fishing was observed in Bayfront Park during th e w eekend observatio n visits to id entify possible sampling sites. The absence of fishermen at Bayfront Park at these times ma y ha ve been a random o ccurrence, or it may be related to the park's entrance fee and limited sho reline oppor tunities for fishing. On ot her occa sions dur ing t his work, fisher men were obser ved on the s horeline at Bay front P ark. The s ites ch osen for t he oint M arina, Mowry Canal, and Convoy P oint because of t he w eekend pre senc e of fi sher men a t all of these locations. The former two areas are canal-based, and the latter contains an extensive shoreline conducive to fishing. A total of 65 interviews we re compl eted on four consecutive Sunday afternoons in Apr il of 2002. Sunda ys were the da ys se lected for interviews beca use this was the da y of the week t hat the m ost fisherm en w ere observed at these locati ons during the init ial observat ion p eriods to i denti fy possible in terview sites . Interview ers approached every other per son at these sites to particip ate in the i nterviews. Tw enty-two per sons were i nterviewed a t Black Point Marina, 22 a t Convoy Point, and 21 at Mowr y Ca nal. The interviews a ddressed the reasons for their visit to the particular site, their knowl edge of the area, the species they target, the changes obs erved in the fisher y, and whether the users knew t hat they were fishing wit hin BI SC. Obser vations were also recorded abo ut the o vera ll num ber and co mposition o f fishers present at each site . The result s of these inter views are sum marized by topic and sit e. The re ason for fi shing at th e particul ar site . Over 86 percent of the 65 persons chos e the particular site wher e they wer e fishing due to its proximity. Factors such as better fishing and cro wded co nditions did no t play a r ole in site select ion. In fact , the s econ d m ost-st ated reason for site selection (11 percent) was due to the site's amenit ies, suc h as picnic facilities, views, etc. The values were similar for all three sites, sug gesting that all sites are selected due to th eir p roximity ra ther th an other attrib utes . Frequency o f visits. Most of thos e interviewed (40 percent) reported fishing every we ek, followed by 28 per cent that fish once a m onth. An equa l percentage was visiting f or the first time. T hese fre quencies are similar ac ross sites . National Park Service 5-11Fishing at other sites. Most fishers reported using other sites, including others in Biscayne National Par k. A to tal of 72 percent use other areas, and 24. 6 and 26. 2 percent use Convoy Point and M owry C anal, respecti vely. Black P oint M arina is le ss p opular as a second ary site, as on ly 1.5 percent of t he 6 5 person s indicat ed it as such . Only 4 5 percent of f ishers at Black P oint M arina reported fish ing elsew here, co mpared t o 87 percent a nd 86 percent, at Convoy Point and Mowry Canal, respecti vely. Sixty-ei ght percent of C onvoy Point fi shers repor ted using M owry Canal, similar to the 67 percent of the Mowry Canal fisher s wh o use Convoy Point. Spe cies targe ted versus abundant sp ecies, an d changes in reso urce availability. Four out of fi ve angler s (or 82 percent) t arget snap pers, 59 percen t target jacks, 11 p ercent t arget barracuda, and 11 percent target other species (including sharks, pompano, mullet, and others). At each site , the s pecies t arget ed are si milar. Anglers at each l ocati on also repo rt snapper is t he p rimary t arget for fi shing effort . Anglers al so repo rt they per ceive that snappers are t he m ost abun dant species (55 percent) f ollowed by jacks (4 9 percent) , barracuda (31 percen t), and o thers (2 6 percent) . Generall y, species abun danc es w ere repor ted m ore frequent ly (for all spe cies) at Black Point Marina t han a t the ot her two sites. Convoy Poi nt displayed the l owest per centages of abu ndanc es, for either target ed or nontargeted species. A majority of fishers believe that there have been no changes in the fish abun danc e; however, 40 percent did st ate that t hey do n ot kno w if there h ave been changes. Inter estingly, am ong the ch anges n oticed, 23 percen t belie ve that t here are f ewer fish, a nd 8 percen t belie ve that fi sh size has declined. There are no sit e-specifi c differ ences con cerning abun danc e, and a majorit y from all three sit es report no perceive d changes. Personal an d ob served gear use . Every fisher surveyed stated that they use hoo k and line or pole gear. Five percent reported observing fishers using other gear, including variations on hook and line ge ar (c alled yo-yos) and cas t ne ts. The us e of fish caught. No o ne interviewed reported selling t heir catch. Eighty-nine percent reported eating their catch if of legal size. Almost all fishers who reported eating their cat ch quali fied their answ er by add ing t hat t hey release und er-s ized fish . Eleven percent rep orted tha t they relea se all fish . Catch -and-relea se fishing was more fr equently reporte d by fishers at Black P oint M arina (23 percent) t han at the ot her t wo site s (less t han 5 percent). Fisher numbers and s ite recruitment. M ost of the fisherm en at these sit es are l ocal residents, with an average of about 33 persons per site. Howe ver, the range is very hig h (from 20 t o 70 a nglers). About 22 per cent of the f isher s were introduce d to the si te throug h their family, and almost a third (32 percent) learned about the site via fri ends. Onl y 12 percent dis covered the site th rough road signs, an d an even lower per centage (6 percent) read about th e site in a brochure or fis hing literatu re. Participation in other activities apart from f ishing.

The higher percentage of awar eness among Conv oy Poi nt fishers Point has a number of signs welcomi ng visitors to Biscayne Nat ional Park. Finally, over 70 percent of Mowr y Canal and 77 percent of Conv oy Poi nt respondents had heard of Biscayne National Park, compa red to 55 percent of Black Po int Marin a fis hers. 5.1.2Sum mary Thi s wor k suggests there is a considerable concentration of anglers who use BISC canals and shore line for recreational fishing. The visitors at the si tes are ethnic ally diverse bu t do not show a co ncentration tow ards a single ethnic group ( when com pared with the County's demographic profile ). This work also deter mined that there are di ffer ences in t he level s of ex clusivi ty that fishing enjoys among sites, as some s ites are more suitable for multiple-use activities. Finally, this w ork co ncludes that w hile t here is m uch local knowledge t hat fi shers have about t he area, a sma ller percentage of them kno w they are fishing in BISC wat ers. While Black Po int Marina and C onvoy Point ar e clea rly marked as pub lic facil ities, there are no signs near M owry C anal that indicate the a rea is pa rt of BISC or i s otherwise publ ic land. Fishers are usually local residents. For example, fishers wh o travel to Black Point Marina alm ost n ever fis h in the other tw o sites (or in any other B ISC site s). Similarly, there is o nly excha nge among a nglers be tween the adjacent Mowry Canal and C onvoy Poi nt sites, and not betw een the more n orthern Black Point M arin a. When first exam ined, t he ethn icity of visitors at the can als and shoreli ne app ears skew ed tow ards Hispanics. However, it should be noted tha t Hispanics make up the major ity e thnic group in M iami-Dade Cou nty, comprising 57.3 percent of the 2.25 million residents (U.S. Bureau of the Cen sus 200 1b). African Am ericans and Ang lo-Am ericans make up 20.3 percent and 20.7 percent of the Coun ty's population, respectively. Of the 522 persons observed during the 12 observation sessions, 60.3 percent wer e Hispanics, 28.5 percent wer e African Am erican, and 11.1 pe rcent wer e Angl o-Am ericans. Thi s shows that, demographically, Ang lo-Am ericans are under represented, while African Americans are ove rrepresented. But, the st udy does not take into accoun t the subregion al dem ograph ics, nam ely of sou thern Miam i-Dade C oun ty, as most of t he resp onden ts in the study stat ed that they were local residents a nd select ed the sit es due to proximity; subregional demographics may well demonstrate that the visitors represent a cross-section of the area's ethnicity. Altho ugh site selection is determ ined large ly by proximity (as stated by the respondents), s ite fidel ity and r epeat visits are related strongly to the types of activities in whi ch the fishersNational Park Service 5-13part icipate . Fo r exam ple, Convoy Point fi shers report ed the low est abun danc es of ta rget ed species; how ever, this group a lso st ated participating i n the m ost nonfi shing a ctivities. Therefore, Convoy Point B, which has an extensive shoreli ne w ith picnic faci lities, provides more than a fishing exper ience , com pared to Mowry Point and Black Point Marina. These latter sites are ca nal-based, and t hey do not offer many ot her amenities. Accord ingly, although several respondents at B lack Point Marin a do particip ate in other nonfishing ac tivities, a litt le more th an a th ird at Mowry Point do anything else but fis h. These differences are im portan t, as they dem onstrate that w hile fi shing m ay be the ostens ible r eason for vi sitation, t here are other reasons for site selection in BISC. This is reinforced by the fact that a majority of the fisher s di d not repor t either selling or retaining a ll fish. Ins tead, most respondent s release undersized fish, a nd a sm aller percentage releases all fish. Park law enforcem ent person nel report that retention of undersize fish continues to be a prob lem, and their observations regarding consumpti on of caught fish being a primary objective of shore line fishing is consi stent with int erview fi ndings. 5.1.3Inshore Fishing Unfortun for this assessment, it w as not feas ible to p erform the same ty pe of data collect ion for insh ore recrea tional fi shing as for sh oreli ne fishin g since insh ore fishin g takes place in boats in the bay. H owe ver, interviews wi th BI SC st aff and with individuals who part icipate in insh ore fishing p rovided an outli ne o f inshore fi shing act ivities. There are guided and ungu ided inshore fisher men. The ungui ded fisher men fish w ithin t he ba y and env irons for a wide va riety of fin fish as w ell as lob ster and crabs. Most of t hese fisherm en us e con venti onal gear, although there are som e who spear fish and still others who fly fi sh. There is al so a guided com ponen t of t he ins hore fi shery t hat focuses o n flat s fishing for bon efish, tarpon , and o ther gam efish tackle, in cluding fly fishing gear. Inshor e guided fishing is ex emplified by the bonefishery. Bo nefish (Albula vulpes ) feed in shallow water on sh rimp, cra bs, and o ther c rustaceans, as w ell as other fi sh. Bo nefish are usually not eat en, but t hey are a highly p rized gam efish. The bon efish of Biscay ne Bay a re noted for their size, averaging 7 p lus po unds, whi ch attracts angler s seeking these larger fish. Fish erm en w ho fish for bon efish may also t arget tarpon , kingfish , sno ok, perm it, and other species o f opportunit y. The number of bonefish guides vari es from season to seaso n, but t here appears to be about a dozen full-time operators, and perhaps three times that many part-time or occasion al guides. Guides from Islam orada also fi sh in Biscay ne Bay bec ause of it s reputa- tion for larger fish. Guides often spe cialize in either fly fishing or conv entional gear, although there are guides who wil l use both gear types. Som e are locals wh o hav e guided for many ye ars, whi le others are seasonal guides from ou tside of the area who m ay fish Biscayne Bay in the winter and A laska in the sum mer. The gui de popul ation app ears to be c omprised primarily of white, middle- aged m en. Bon efish guides t ypically use sm all boats in the 18- t o 25-foot ra nge, pow ered by outboar ds, and adapted to shal low water fishing. Th ese vessels are typically kept on trailers. Fish ing is don e on a half- day o r ful l-day b asis, with the form er being m ore po pular. Homestead, Bayf ront, Black Point , or Matheson H amm ock M arinas each has bonef ish gui des. More popu lar fishing a reas are the f lats on t he e ast or west sides of the ba y, or the se awar d side of Elliott Key. Early morning is preferred, although bonef ishing is highly d ependent on t ides,1.0 Purpose and Need 5-14 Biscayne National Park Ethnographic Overview and Assessment Graphics 0K034 Biscayne National Park\\Figures\\Fig X Photographs4 (DBrady) 5/5/03Page 3Figure 29 Point and Homestead Bayfront Marinas National Park Service 5-15since the fish tend to feed on moving t ides. Once on t he fi shing groun ds, t he m otor i s tur ned off an d the boat is m oved by means of a 20-foot-lon g graphite po le w ith a \"f oot\" to prevent it from sinking into th e bottom. The gu ides' res ponsibility is to s pot the fis h and suggest to the ir clients how to p lace the ir lure or fly to en sure th e best ch ance of a tak e. Still w ater rep resents the be st condi tions bec ause it is impor tant to be a ble to se e the fish. At the sa me time, bonef ish and other flats species are h ighly sensitive to m ovem ent and flat, calm condition s present a special challenge for anglers since they are more easily observed by bonefish at this time. Many anglers prefer a slight cho p on the water since this obscures the fish's vision but allows t he angler to still see the fish. The guides pole their boats through likely sand and grass flats seeking fish, then m ove bet ween fishing a reas using t heir motors. Most guides wo rk alone and take one or two customers at a time. The vast majority of cust omers are single fisher men, but there ar e a few parties com pose d of husba nd a nd w ife, or husband, wife, an d children. C lien ts are typ ically white, m iddle-c lass people fro m south Florida, but not necessarily from t he immediate park vicinity. Ra tes vary depending on the reputation and expe rience of a particular guide, but full days range from $375 to $60 0 per day. A numbe r of people who p articipate in the bonefish fishery, both as guides and fishermen, belong to the Miami Rod and Reel Club. This organization promotes catch and relea se technique s, has f ishing a nd env ironmental education pr ograms for bot h youngst ers and a dults, and hold s a num ber of fishing t ournam ents. Ungu ided insh ore fishing i s a major pastt ime of BISC users. Boaters ar e also s ometimes casual fishermen, but fi shing in the bay is an important type of use among residents of nearby com munities. Th e count y m arinas as well as pr ivate docki ng f acilities are the m ajor poi nts of access for fis herm en who may fish fro m alm ost an y typ e of powered, sail, or p addled ves sel, although fishing from a pow ered boat i s the usual m ode for i nshore fisherm en. Cruisi ng n ear San ds C ut, thro wing a l ine from the dock s near Stiltsville, or anch ored in b oats near Ch ristm as Point, fisherm en catch gray and mangrove snapper, sea trout, a vari ety of jacks, as well as other species such a s ba rrac uda . Shri mp are a preferred live bait for inshore fisher men, although artificial lures thro wn with spinn ing or bait cast ing t ackle ar e pop ular fishing t actics. It appears these fish ar e caught to eat, although t here are repor ts that som e recreational fisher men c atch an excess of their limits and sell th ese fish for commercial purposes.

Blue crab fisherm en use skiffs in the 15 - to 20 -foot range, powered by outboard motors . These small craft are ty pically kept on trailers . Most blu e crab fisherm en who use park waters laun ch the ir skiffs from Black P oint, but som e m ay laun ch from Matheson Hammock and H omeste ad Bayfront as w ell. Fr om the ir sk iffs, these fis herm en typically set 80 to 20 0 trap s; the averag e is approx imately 100 . They might r etrieve one-q uart er to on e-half of t heir t raps each ti me they go ou t. Blue crab fisher men ope rate in shal low water in the v icinity of estuaries, canals, etc. They typ ically sell ca tch to fis hmarkets, p articu larly the Golden Rule Fishmarket. Most participant s in the bl ue crab fisher y are pa rt time; per haps 30 percent are full time. Most are Anglo, although som e men of C uban ethnicity also particip ate. M ost are lon g-tim e res idents in the local area. Preliminary research suggests ages of these fishermen va ry from the 20s to the 50s.

Wingnet ters typically do not fish within BISC as it is too f ar sout h of t heir base of oper ations, alth ough some use of the northern edge of the park is re ported . The wingnet boats have a framework that supports a dip net on each side of the vessel. The fram ework is low ered i nto the water, and the boat powers slow ly int o the sch ools of shrim p as they rise to the surface.

This has been describ ed as the most inten se commercial fishery use of th e park. Especially in the summertim e, the ves sels work the western side of the bay in the gras ses relatively close to the m ainla nd shore. The vess els t hat us e the p ark are con centra ted in Black P oint and D inner Key (Figure 32), althou gh there are also one or two v essels in the Car d Sou nd area that use BISC wat ers (Figure 33). The largest single concentration is at Black Po int, with pe rhaps 12 or 13 vessels operat ing out of t hat m arina, a nd all of t hese vessels operat e as f ull-time com mercia l operations (Fig ure 34). At least on e vessel owne r owns multiple vessels in this fishery. Although t he fisher y has s ome hi storical depth, interview dat a suggest that onl y a very few of the current partic ipants have fished it for m ore th an a de cade. Unlike th e foo d shrimp fishery, the bait shrimp fishery has no closed season and is re ported ly pursued seven days a week, year round. M arkets f or the shrimp cau ght in th is fishery are b ait and t ackle stores, and catch is typically \"pre-sold\" through existing supply agreements. The stores supplied wi th ba it from Biscayne Bay range from Key West to we ll north of Miami, and stores may bu y from more than one fishing ope ration to hedg e ag ainst a drop i n per formance from a ny one operation. Trawl tows are typically 15 to 30 minutes in duration, with ca tch retained i n tanks on boar d after being sorted on pi cking t rays to allow for the r elease of byca tch species. The financial return on ef fort varies significantly du ring the year as, according to one owner, \" you m ake m oney in the winter, an d [just] p ay the bills in the summer.\"1.0 Purpose and Need National Park Service 5-23 Graphics 0K034 Biscayne National A ssessmen tWith the hydraulic s ystem on board, a vessel can be ru n by just the captain , but typically a m ate is added in the winter time to he lp ha ndle the increase in volume , at least whe n fishing on the weekends.

Stiltsville is a group of seven structures built on pilings or stilts (Figure 35). At one time there wer e more than 25 structures, but the harsh saltwat er environment and the occasional hurricane has red uced the number o ver the years . The arc hitectu re va ries , bu t all are rus tic wood and plywood stru ctures, somewhat sim ilar to va cation cab ins. Stiltsville is lo cated in shallows i n the extreme north end of the park, east-southeast of Matheson Hamm ock, and southwest of K ey Biscayne. M ost of these ho uses are leas ed by small groups of people; one is leas ed by The M iam i Springs Powerboat C lub, and another is leas ed by an extended fam ily. All curren t struc ture s are o f relative ly recent orig in, and two attem pts at listin g the struct ures singly or as a gro up on the Nation al R egister have been unsuccessful. Most Stiltsville users are long- time ar ea resident s who use the st ructures as weekend r etreats. It is al so n ot unusu al to ob serve b oats ti ed up to the docks of som e struct ures and p eop le other than the regular occu pan ts fishing o ff the d ock s. One S tiltsville occu pan t noted that as long as people respe ct the pr oper ty, suc h casual use is acc eptable. So me occupants als o encourage civic and other organizations t o use their proper ties for special events or outings. For example, Boy Sco uts, Girl Scouts, var ious ch urch groups , the M iam i Cham ber of C ommerce, Disabled Veterans, Shak e-A-L eg Sail ing C lub (for disabled children), and other groups have used Stiltsville prop erties for w eeken ds o r ot her ou tings. Som e Sti ltsville occu pan ts sugges t that these prop erties offer an opportunity for the leaseholders to exercise comm unity service by shar ing t heir facilities with these com munity gr oups.

Is is also possible to o bserve cro wds of young people loungi ng on t he de cks a nd docks, listening t o music , and ot herwise soci alizing, swim ming, fishing, or jus t relax ing an d watch ing passing bo ats. Since most of t hese struc ture s are w ithin easy reach o f M iam i-based boaters, these struct ures al so can be a base of operat ions for a day of divin g, fis jus t ex Interv iews with two Stiltsville lea seholders and two other p erson s who are in the s ame netw ork as these leas eholder suggest th at the se properties rep resent a co nnection with the Miam i, so uth Flor ida, and Keys cul ture that existed prior to the influx of immigrants and t he e mergence ofNational Park Service 5-25Latin and Carrib ean influences on al cu lture \"their cult ure\" and \" their history\" in a social environm ent where other el ements of t radit ional lifestyles have faded into the background.

On almost any da y, but especially on w eekends, the harbor at Boca Chi ta is filled wi th po wer boats or sailboats. Boaters tie up next to one another an d share d rinks, m eals , and conversation . Others picnic on the grounds nearb y, visit the l ighthouse, or expl ore the i sland. Boa ters from the inter-coastal waterway a lso cr uise throug h par k waters, som e on t heir way to ot her destinations wh ile ot hers anchor in the lee of Elliott, Boca Chi ta, or sometimes Ad ams Ke y. Miam i boate rs usually come o ut of one of the nearby Coun ty m arinas an d eit her cruise t hro ugh the p ark or fi nd an anch oring spo t such as Sands Cut. This popular spot is a destina tion for kayakers, sm all an d large power b oats, as well as sail boats of vari ous sizes. Visitors from Key L argo and so uth as w ell as t he H omeste ad area sometime anchor near Caesar Creek betwee n Ol d Rhode s Key and Ada ms Key and Elliott Key. Others use this and other passages to the outer reefs, sometimes stopping at one of the 25 mooring b uoy s at 11 differ ent coral reef or shipw reck locat ions where bo aters t ie up or anch or. The se are pleasant spots for snorkling, fishing, or just relaxing. The wide variety of boaters who use Biscayne National Park can be roughly categorized into \"powe rboaters\" and \"sailors,\" and each of these groups is briefly described below. 5.4.1Pow erboaters Most of t he p owerboats obs erved i n park w aters ar e small craft in t he 1 8- to 30-foot ra nge. Virtually all hav e pl aning hul ls. Th ese boa ts are typically pow ered by re latively large, two- stroke ou tboar d m otors. Most hav e a forede ck and at least a cud dy ca bin (a small cabin bel ow dec ks wit h limited spa ce for shel ter or amenities) to pr ovide som e accom moda tion spa ce for ove rnight trips. Most hav e a vee ber th forward and a port a-potty; som e hav e ga lleys. Most of the power boat s usi ng pa rk waters are kept on t railers. Powerboat e nthus iasts com e from a wide ra nge o f ethnic and so cioecon omic classes. M ost ar e long-time residents. On t he other hand, power boat groundings are perceived by persons interview ed for this w ork as a substan tial enviro nmental problem caused by novice bo aters . A large area south of Key Biscayne and north of Ragged Keys known as the \"safety valve,\" consists of sh oals, with another large co mplex of sh oals located around Totten Key and east of Old Rhode s Ke y. Ou tside of Old Rhode s Key is another large shoal area called Ca esar Creek Bank. Novice boaters often possess only minimal n avig ation skills an d run agro und in the se area s. 5-26 Bisca yne Nationa l Park Ethnogr tead Bayfront bottoms and w ater qual ity occu rs when t he boa ters attempt to p ower o ut. There are n umerous fish and div e destinations around the park, bu t when on boatin g-only outings, som etimes there is no a ctual destination. Oft en boa ters simply cr uise around i nside and outside of Biscayne Bay and take in the sights and the fresh air. At other times, boaters visit favorite anchora ges and cov es such a s \"the sandbar \" (on the leeward side of Sands Cut), Boca Chita, Sands Cut, and A dams Key. The sandba r is a sh oal where num erous boat ers anchor on weekends. Th ey raft up, sit in lawnc hairs in the shallow wa ter, wade around, and socialize. At places like Boca Chi ta and Ada ms Ke y, boaters somet imes go ashore to explore or go for a walk. Most said that they did not use park facilities very often but did operat e in park wa ters. The most subst antial powerboat ing cl ubs ope rating i n the pa rk area are the M iami Spr ings Powerboat C lub and the Dinner K ey Cruisin g Club. 5.4.2Sailors Sail boats ob served in park w aters var y from dingh ies to large craft in the o ver 50-foot r ange.

Sma ller sailboats have a vee berth forwar d and a porta-potty; som e have gal leys con sisting of a on e-burner stove, a small sink , and an icebox . Large m odern sailboats typically have berths for several sailors, a galley with a refrigerator, a head wi th a shower, an d a large main salon. In c ontrast to sm aller pow erboat s, bot h sm all and l arge sailboat s are designe d to be l ived in for at least a few da ys at a time. W hile smaller planing p owe rboats travel at speeds of 30 to 50 knot s, smaller sailboat s hav e a top speed unde r good sea condi tions of perhaps 5 or 6 knot s. While a small pow erboat may well take 2 or 3 hours to travel 100 miles, it might t ake a s mall sailboat 24 hours, so overnight acc ommodation s are m ore es sential on a sa ilboat. Sail ors co me from a wide ra nge o f ethnic an d socioecon omic cl asses, but based upo n interv iew data and participant obser vation, most seem to be white, middle-class, middle-aged men. Most are long-t ime resi den ts of the Miam i-Dade are a. Most said t hat t hey did no t use park facil ities very often but do f requent ly sail in the pa rk and throug h the pa rk on t he way t o of fshore waters. Sail ors sug gest t hat BISC is a great place t o sail becaus e the air a nd water are alw ays warm , there is usually good wind, and the area offers beautiful s cenery. Smaller sailboat s are often kept on t railers, but very few sailboat s longe r than 25 f eet fit well on trailers becaus e of deep b allast keel s. Larger sail boats that are regul arly operat ed in park w aters are k ept in marin as at C randon, Matheson Hammock, Blac k Point, and Homestead Bayfront. In addition , nu merous sailboats ar e kept at yacht club docks and mooring buoys. The most important sailing organizations operating in the park area are the Cor al Ree f Yac ht Club, the Coconut Grove Sail ing C lub, the K ey B iscayn e Yacht C lub, and the U nite d Stat es Sailing Cen ter. The latter is a new organization based in Coc onut Grove whos e focus is training Olympic sailing t eam s. T he oth er org anizations are more or le ss typical yach t clubs wit h you th program s, di ngy , PHRF, and o ne-design racing prog ram s, m ost of w hich focus on around -the- buoy r aces that typically take place in the park. In a ddition, each of the ya cht clubs host s a number o f an nual social an d civic eve nts. The major annual sailin g ev ent that tak es place in the park is th e Colum bus Day Regatta. This is a multi-club even t coor dinated by the Marine Cou ncil, a local advocacy group for marine inte rest s in M iam i-Dade Coun ty. It is app arent ly Florida's oldest sail ing race, feat uring num er- ous c lasses and t rophie s. It is not a heavily sponsor ed event, but rather an unpr etentious r ace for families and ordinary sailors. T he iro ny is th at this low -key rac e has, acc ording to its organizers, beco me unwillingly associat ed with a huge raucous part y. The part y has oversh a- dow ed the r egatta and has cau sed law enforcement and publ ic health and sa fety conce rns for the park as we ll as other jurisdictions. Be cause of these concerns and wha t many in the yachting comm unity perceive as very negative publicity, the future of the regatta is uncertain. 5.5 Tow Bo at Ope rations Another type of use o f BISC is re presen ted by severa l tow boat com pan ies i n the area t hat freque ntly oper ate in par k waters. Som e are associ ated with national organizations l ike Se aTow and Tow Boat/US (Figure 36). The mos t commo n type of watercraft used as tow boats within theNational Park Service 5-29park are 2 0- to 25-foot vessels powered w ith two large outboard mo tors, in the 100- to 200- horse power range. Howev er, some larger inboar d di esel-power ed vessels are also a vailable. Dead ba tteries in smal l craft of both xpe rience d and novi ce boa ters accou nt for most of the tow boat activity . The tow boats usually jumpstart the dead battery or, if that fails, then the boat is towe d to its home por t. One o perator suggested that app roximately 10 percent of his calls con sist of requests to refl oat vessels that have run hard aground in various shoa l areas. This is t he most comp licated and lucrative part of the tow bu siness even t hough i t is a very smal l per centage of calls. Groundings occur primarily in three shoal co mplexe s in the park. The large st shoal area within the park is l ocated south of K ey B iscayn e and n orth of Ragged K eys. Th is ar ea encom passes Stiltsville an d Biscayne Channel to ward the north, and Soldie r Key toward the south. A small compl ex of shoal s is located wes t of Lewi s Cut and includes Feather bed Ba nk. I n the s outh portio n of the park is a lar ge complex o f shoals loc ated aro und Totten Key and west of Old Rhodes Key. Outsi de Old Rhode s Keys i s a large shoal called Cae sar Cre ek Ba nk. Most groundings wi thin the p ark appa rently ta ke pl ace in the nor ther n shoal compl ex, pr obably because of its proximity to the city of Miami. Mo st often, people who run aground on the se shoals ar e no vice powerbo aters and/o r new to the area. They often p ossess only m inimal navigation ski lls and se ama nship. Consi derable dama ge to s eagrass wa ter qua lity occu rs if/when the y attempt to a pply hig h power when starting from a dead stop; the power ful propel ler cut s into t he bott om and t hrows u p silt, sand, a nd se agrass. Sailors also r un a ground, but less frequently. This may be because sailing requires more training and skill just to get the boat to go in the desired direction. Novice sailo rs tend to be mo re cau tious and have higher lev els of seamanshi p by the time the y ve ntur e into unknown wa ters. Sa ilors also ca use less damage to the bot tom when they d o run aground because th ey go much slower and th e keel or centerboard of a sailboat is much l ower tha n the p ropeller, so only the keel hits the bott om. Typicall y on a hard groundin g within the park , the t ow boat operat or noti fies the park and t he park s ends someo ne out to ass ess the s ituation. The t ow operat or and t he park repres entative discu ss the p redicament and decide the be st way to take the bo at off with m inim al damage to the b ottom. If the grounded ves sel is a large one, it is lightened by taking of f fuel a nd wate r. Som e situations requi re removal of the propeller and t he pla cem ent of airbags to add buo yancy. Tow boat op erators generally expressed satisfaction with the park procedures. The y did sug gest that chann els might be b etter marked b y pla cing b uoys cl ose together so boat ers can ea sily see from one to the next (e.g., 400 yards ) and b y light ing all cha nnel buoys . Als o, increa sed b oate r education was suggested as a way of minimizing groundings and damage to the bay bottom. In sociocul tural terms, tow oper ators may be seen as inheritors of a l ocal tradition of mak ing a living off mariners in distress in the ar ea th at is now B ISC. Unli ke wrecke rs of old, how ever, towboat avoidi han profi ting by them af ter the fact. 5.6 Spo rt Diving There i s one dive operat ion wit h excl usive ri ghts via a concess ionai re agreement t o op erat e a dive sho p and div ing charters w ithin the p ark. Th is op eratio n is loc ated within the D ante Fasc ell Visi tor Center at the park headquar ters plex Convoy Point ssessmen tother Scub a divers and fr ee diver s (al so referre d to as sno rkeler s or sk in divers) access the park using t heir own ve ssels. Addit ional ly, there are several dive shops outside the pa rk that also serve the sport diving comm unity. There are substanti al season al differ ences in spo rt divi ng in south Flori da and al so d ifferences betwee n scuba and free divers in terms of dive locations and party demographics. Not many divers use the a rea between Labor Day and Thanksg iving. The best unde rwat er visibility tends to b e in Jun e an d July . According to interview data, t he vas t major ity o f scuba divers using the park tend to b e south Florida residents, perhaps 80 percent, and most are whi te, middle-class males. Increasing numbers of Hispanics and women are par ticip atin g in s port divin g, however. A pproximately half of t he d ivers using the ch arter fa cilities w ithin the park com e as part of dive cl ub acti vities and many ot hers com e to the par k as a fu nction of dive shop- sponsor ed trips. Of t he g roups that come t o the park from outsid e of the area, most are from t he Gul f Coa st. The se scuba parties typ ically go south of Boca Chita, t o Adams Key or outside th e keys, fo r ex ample to B all Buoy Ree f, Pacific Ree f, or to Mand alay W reck. Free div ing as a sp ecific focal activity within the park ten ds to be dominated by tou rists, 6 0 to 70 percent of w hom are from the Unite d Stat es and Canada. Most of t hese are white, middle- class men or families. In the fall, winter, and spring, 80 percent of the free divers using the park- licensed char ter facilities are tourists. In the sum mer, more locals participate in free div ing, althou gh they are still in the minority. Free dive rs tend to go to mor e shallow di ve spots like One Mile Ree f, One Half-Mile Ree f, and Marker 3. In foul wea ther, both scuba and free diving parties go to di ve spot s inside the Keys. A num ber of recreational boa ters wh o use the pa rk also free dive a s an adjunct t o other act ivities (such as p icnicking o r social izing). Divers comm ented on the good reef development in the park and good park resource management; some suggested that the park has the healthiest marine environment from Mi ami to the Dry Tort ugas.

The re are others, less visible, but still with significant interests in BISC . In this section i nterviews and pa rticipant obse rvation w ith two ot her groups, Miam i Bla cks and Old Fam ily M iam i, are briefl y described. Fieldw ork also indicate s there m ay be other less visible interest and user groups that require further consideration. 5.8.1South Fl orida Bl acks Blacks are not conspicuous users of national parks in general, and this is also a reality for the relations hip of sou th Florida Blacks w ith BISC . However, there are two dir ssessmen tcon nections b etween B lacks in M iam i and sou th Flori da and B ISC . One is t he P arson Jon es property nea r Jones La goon on Porg y K ey a nd t he ot her is the pa rk area in the i mmediate vicinity of the Visitor's Ce nter. The area near the Visitor's Ce nter wa s once one of two segregated all-black bea ches in the Miami region, the other being Virginia Key Be ach. Each of these sit es ex presses a different and co ntra sting type o f cult ural con nection w ith p ark resour ces. The P arson Jon es sit e is a n aban doned house on the edge of Jones Lagoon that includes other features such a s a hand- dug channe l, remnant s of k ey li me plantations, and ot her out buildings and features. Th e site is cu lturally impor tant for multiple reasons, including its representation of an ol der land- owning sou th Flor ida family living in the Keys who se member s were suc cessful agricultural entrepreneurs and also notable because they we re black. Su ccessful black land owners in the Fl orida Keys w ere unusua l at the t urn of the century. Th is history of Parson Jones and his fam ily is a backd rop for the em ergi ng m eaning of this sit e for south F lorida's black comm unity. Parson Jon es arr ived in the M iam i area from his birt h state of N orth C aroli na. H e worked at various j obs, including bui lding house s, that allowed him to accumulate enough ca sh to buy Porgy Key i n sout h Bis cayne Ba y in 1897. He and his wife Moselle and his two sons Lanc elot and A rthur moved to their n ew prop erty in 1902. They later acq uired l and o n both O ld R hodes and Totten K ey and event uall y had m ore t han 250 acres of prop erty us ed for li me and o ther citru s planting s as well as pineapples. Parson's wife Moselle died in 1925, and he subsequently sold h is pro perty on Totten Key for approximately $250,000. Parson died in 1932 leavin g his esta te to his two so ns. Lan celot lived on Porgy K ey un til 1992 when Hurri cane A ndrew destroy ed his h ome. P ark Rangers tell s tories of his evacuation fro m his p roperty and his continued residence on the Keys until he finally relocated to M iami whe re he died in 1997. Lancelot was also a \"local f igure\" w ho lived off the l and and sea , did som e spo ngin g, but w as perhaps most well kno wn as a bonefish guide. He guided War ren Har ding, Lynd on John son, Richar d Nixon, and ot her statesmen and indust rialists who hunt ed bonef ish in the e nvirons of Biscayne Bay. Loc al fisher man also fished wi th La ncelot and report that he had uncanny abilities to find wary bonefish in the shallow f lats of Biscayne Bay. The Parson Jones site along with the Virginia Key Beach site are of interest to some l ocal Blacks because each represents elements of the history of Blacks in sou th Fl orida. Virginia Beach, like American B each n ear Jacksonville, Florida, exp resses the segregat ion o f Blacks in the history of this reg ion. On the other han d, the P arson Jon es h ome sit e represents t he s tory o f a successful black entrepreneur who, like other Old South Fl orida families, lived in the Keys and enjoyed t he sou th Flor ida lifestyle . Th e hi story of the J ones f amil y m ay be interpreted as a contrast to h isto ry of black s in Florida who experie nced segregatio n and inter-rac ial co nflict. Tha t is, the Jones's story represents the perseverance of a black family in a hosti le social and natural env ironment who, in the w ords of one black obser ver of the si te, \"throug h their actions, these peop le transcen d the heigh ts and depths of our cult ure. \" The Jon es sit e is i nterpret ed as a black contribu tion to th e development of s outh Florida an d of the rela tion ship of Black s to the land as owne rs and not slave laborers or sharecroppers wi th no investment in the land. The Jones site may be symbolic of the desire of Blacks to ha ve a stake in environmental issues and Nation al P arks and the ir m anagement. It may also symbolize uccessful an oppr essive socia l env ironment. Th e relationship of the si te to the wide r black comm unity and other non-black interests in south Florida is a developing process. Cur rently,National Park Service 5-33 Jones Fam ily Hom esite M arker there are e fforts to develo p awaren ess ab out the particu larly the histo ry it repr esents both as an aspect of park h istory and as an exp ression of the black experience in sou th Florida. The other site in BISC of particular hist orical interest for Blacks is the grounds around the current Park H eadqu arters and Visitor's Ce nter. At one was a \"Blacks Onl y\" beach muc h like Am erican Beach and Virginia Ke y Beach. Thi s wa s a place whe re Blacks gathered to swim, picnic, and enjoy their weeken ds. One form er user of this beach described the us e of the a rea as follows: You see the harbor over there, that is wh ere people used to swim, yeah, we would come here on the weekend, on Sunday after C hurch sometim es it w ould be for birth day parties , you would see your cousins and have a picnic. W e would have collard gre ens and barbecue and we would get th e land crabs that u sed to be here and cook the m too . Peop le would dan ce, it would b e 'showtime' for peo ple t o strut their st uff. It was a get away place for us, a little fishing, a little danc ing, a good time. There w ere young kids too along with the adults, and we wou ld play games dodge-ball, strike and run , and stingam arie. And peo ple w ould go fishing with a cane p ole out here for mulle t and thin gs. Then we m ight sometim es have a fis h fry. Some people, like my mother and sister, they wou ld go out to El liott Key and cam p, som etimes they would stay a week right nex t door at the marina, t hat w as the white b each. . . . Then in the sixties th ey integra ted the beach next do or. 5-34 Bisca yne Nationa l Park Ethnogr aphic Overvie w and A ssessmen tIt use d to be t his getaway pl ace, and now it still is, only for different peopl e. You see more Hispanics he re now , they com e from Hialeah and ot her places because here they don' t hav e to worry abou t drive-bys, it is a safe spot with less violence than whe re they live. So, I guess it is not a lot different than when I was growi ng up, a safe spot for getaways. Blacks are still occasional users of the environs around the Visitor's Ce nter, but as a recent visitor's study indicates, Blacks account for about 2 percent of the BISC's visitors (Simmons and Littlejohn 2002). Thi s present-day user volume appears to be a strong contrast with the com mon weeken d getaway use of the park described in the gentl eman's statement abo ve. Park staf f ob servatio ns, sup ported by limited pa rticip ant observatio n at the Visito r Center, su ggests that Hispanics a re now more common w eekend v isitors than a re Blacks. Blacks st ill fish fr om Convoy Point and strol l thro ugh the ar ea enjoying the view s, but groups of H ispanics app ear to be the m ost num erous users. This m ay be related to the regi on's sh ifting dem ograph y. It may also b e rel ated to ot her cultural factors re garding ho w Blacks p ercei ve and use p ublic spaces such as national parks. If the Jones site provides some cultural investment of Blacks in BISC, this is a step towa rd changing perceptions that places su ch as BISC c an once again be wee kend getaw ays for Black s as well as others. BISC also presents a u nique interp retive o pportun ity w ith the Parson Jones site offshore representing a different set of circumst ances than that seen in the segregated beach site on the mainland, with bot h contributing to the com plex picture of black local expe riences in the twen tieth century. 5.8.2 Old Family Miami Before BISC w as a national park, Boca Ch ita, Elliott, and other Keys were sites for weekend homes and p erm ane nt residenc es that r anged from shacks to m ansion s. Som e of t hese were occupied by \"ol d family\" or the long-term residents of the region whi le others we re owne d by outsiders w ho visited for vacat ions or extended stays. Howe ver, old family residents developed strong ties to the region and made south Fl orida their home. As a segment of Miami society, old f amily is a s elf-e xplanator y descriptor o f residents with a histo ry of m ultip le generat ions in t he M iam i area. These fam ilies t end to be white and in the middle to upper soci oeconom ic class. Old fa milies oft en have an int erest in BISC and i ts resources be cause of past and ongoing activities tha t ha ve d eveloped a se nse of attach ment to the place and its resources. For on e such fam ily this sen se of at tachm ent has a foun dation in p ast as w ell as present-day connec tions wit h the ba y and Keys. My family has been using the park before it was the park or the mo nument. We used t o go for walks on the beaches out on the K eys, look ing for bottles a nd neat trash . W e would fish and we did some divin g to o, it was just a natura l plac e to go because the area is so close. The re have never been that many peop le there becaus e of al l of t he h ype about t he keys [the m ore sou thern Keys b elow Key Largo]. Biscayne still does not have recognition; there is almost zero reputation. Peop le would ta lk abo ut it as Biscayn e Bay o r Elli ott Key, but usual ly no t as Biscayne N ation al P ark. I want my kids to be able to enjoy it the way I did whe n I was a kid with my family. My kids h ave bee n on t he wat er since they were two w eeks ol d. We go fishing, w e go divi ng, w e visit the beach es, we take our bo at out t o just exp lore.National Park Service 5-35The re is a big allure in boating, you can just get away , it is not like getting in the car and driving, there is a kind of freedom in boat ing that y ou don' t get from other things. And when you ar e out th ere, the water is warm and it is us ually calm. The re is just nothing like laying there on the boat with the colors radiating all around you. If you g et hot you j ust roll off into the wat er and cool off, watch the fish swim and enjoy it. That's the kind of place it w as for me as a kid, that is how it is for m y kids, and that's h ow I want it to be for their k ids, a p lace they can go and enjoy w hat I di d w ith m y fat her. BISC is important becaus e it is inte rtwined with past and p resent f amily ex periences as w ell as hop es and expe ctations about wha t the future should be. For some old families, this family and human h istory is as im portant a feat ure of BIS C as it s natural history. For exam ple: I thin k they [BISC managers] w ant it to be 'environm ental ly prist ine' but i t has never been that way. The place has a human hi story too and that is as important as it s natural history. But I don 't see anyo ne there i nterest ed in that . I am frust rated by it. There needs to be a sense of o wnersh ip of t he p lace that i sn't there now, there needs to be a feeling from t he heart of caring for the place and being g enuinel y interested it. I would like t o se e them develop som e ki nd of interp retative p rogram and the relatio nship of that to the park. It is im portan t, but I d on't think the y see th at as im portan t. This expr essed frustration i s pe rhaps connect ed to ot her Miami- BISC iss ues, but it also indicates a sens e of history and attachment to BISC re sour ces that predates the f ormation of the area a s a monument and t hen later a nati onal park. For old fam ilies, BIS C and it s managers are the newcome rs who d o not alway s seem to be caring for the full range of natural and histo rica l res ources associated with the park. Su ch fee lings may also motivate co mmunity responses to the Stiltsville properties . For example, one leaseholder with connection s to o ld family gr oups i ndicated: You c an see Stiltsville from downt own M iami. When I look out there it is like the M iam i of a differ ent t ime. I just don 't think the N ational Park Service gi ves a whit abou t that. Their rationale is that these are not \"natural \" so therefore t hat is not the way it should be. When they don't ex ist, the n the park will be \"to tally natura l\" an d it has not been tha t way for a lo ng tim e. T hat is a k ind of purist atti- tude that ignor es the r eality. Now , I am a big su pporter of National Par ks, but a place is just not totally nat ural once you ha ve put a road or som ething throug h there and it is no lon ger that w ay. Biscay ne is on the edge o f this aq uatic inter- state highwa y and it is never going to be a pristine natural environment. Thi s line between the totally natural and t he h uman just does not exist there. Those st ruc- tures, people like them, they look ne at, they ar e important to us and our history, they need to fin d some way to fix this situ ation and live w ith the m out th ere. This stat ement about St iltsville expresses att achm ent t o the h uman h istory as w ell as the n atural history of the region. Th is history is, for som e old fam ily grou ps, ex pressed in ph ysical structures such a s Stiltsville, the Boca Chita com plex, and fo r others in the nat ural resources of BISC. However, it would be a mistake to sug gest that Stiltsville is sup por ted by al l members of what m ight be t erm ed the old fam ily group in M iam i. For exam ple, another perso n interv iewed5-36 Bisca yne can also be ch aracterized as old fam ily was m ore equ ivocal about Sti ltsville: I am not a great supporter of private hol dings in the park and I tend to favor non- consumpti ve activities there. But the Park Service gave lessees too m uch l atitude in 1988 a nd 1990, there was j ust too m uch waf fling a nd t hat did not help. I know peopl e feel that 'big gove rnm ent' is taking som ething from them and t hat is a problem, but I st ill don' t think t hey [St iltsville] are ne cessarily a good t hing for the bay, but then you do have the culture of the people who l ive there bumping against th e Park Service and it gets m essy. . . . The old family doe s not so much sha re a comm on view about Stiltsville or wreck diving, or any other particular use of park resour ces as they shar e a historical perspective abou t the m eanings of their particular uses of the pa rk. Whether it is the St iltsville suppor ter, the be ach com bers, or t he o ld-time fam ilies of Elli ott and A dam s Keys, t hey appear to con struct present- day attachments to BI SC from their own fa mily an d co mmunity exp eriences. BISC was once the front yard of densel y popul ated urban e nvironment, and peopl e used this front yard in various ways and de veloped different meanings a bout and a ttachments to these resources based on their c omm unity and individual expe riences. Fo r these Miami residents, BISC i s a relative new com mer to the community an d the new com er's investm ent i n the n atural and h uman resources associated wi th the park is a developing story. 5.8.3 Contem porary S eminole and Miccosukee C onnections with the Park Park staff expressed a specific interest in the perceived associations of the Seminole and Miccosukee with BI SC. Cons eque ntly, these groups wer e contacted to participate in the ethnogra phic interviews for the project. Unfor tuna tely, no i nterviews w ith re presentatives of the M iccos ukee Tribe c ould be sched uled. One r epresentative of the Sem iole Tribe of Florida was int ervi ewed, but before any con clusions can b e draw n about contem porary N ative American at tachments to BISC re sour ces, more data nee d to be collected. However, based on som e contempor ary document s and the one interview, som e limited findings c an be repor ted. Tribes hav e environmental, pol itical, historical, and ot her interests in the na tural resources of sou th Florida. However, the socioeco nomic con ditions of each o f these tribes h ave cons umed significa nt time and resources leaving only limited opportunity for in volvem ent in o ther types of conce rns. Con seque ntly, when t ribes do not respond t o letters of inquir y or reque sts for input regarding land m anagement issue s, this doe s not nec essarily mean a lack of interest since time and resou rces are likely co nsumed by more im mediat e issue s. Nonetheless, t ribes are sens itive to the process of consul ting with them unde r the pr ovisions of historic pr eservation laws and other Ex ecuti ve Orders that prescribe t he co nsultation p rocess b etween tr ibes and the federal gov ernment. There is an expec tation of consul tation abou t land managment issue s of concern to the tribes and there is also an expe ctation a bout respecting tribal processes and traditions a bout suc h cont acts. One of the most promi nent issues other than the necessity for attention to process in dealing with the tribes is a developing view that contemporary Florida Na tive Am ericans have a long history of attachment to and residence within south Fl orida, including the environs of Biscayne Bay . \"Peop le feel as if this is their homeland, their t erri tory, t hey know the land w ell, but t hey see th e world by water firs t. Their fr ame of the world is w ater.\" T his view is th e m ost w ellNational Park Service 5-37dev eloped in Pat ricia Wickm an's most recent work that argues that Seminol e history in Flor ida is one th at pre dates the tim e when Native A meric ans were tho ught to h ave been destro yed in Florida by vari ous natura l and hum an a gencies. Wickm an argues t hat t he view of Sem inoles as being a group r econst ituted after the 1500s f rom the r emnant s of popul ations f rom out side Florida that su ffered from di sease, famine, and invaders undermines their past and present con nections to t he land. She argues that ethnograph ic and et hnohistorical dat a indicat e that Florida is in fact t he \" homeland\" of the Sem inole and other N ative Americans in F lorida. Wickm an il lust rates and c loses h er a rgum ent w ith a q uote fr om a tribal el der: Out the Trail, all my life I have heard the elders tell us about the memories of the peo ple fr om long b efore t he w ars. And the old peo ple spo ke of ichi bomet as our final home, and they knew the area very w ell. The ancestors knew which are as wer e high and dry, whe re the hammocks wer e, whe re to find the food, and where to build the cam ps. T he k nowledge of ichi bomet has been with our people for a long l ong t ime. An d ichi bomet was was more than just the nos e of the d eer. It was that thin, long land whe re the soft, fresh, breezes woul d bl ow over us and set ou r spirits free. When we all lived in tha t land , ou r spirits w ould be ab le to blow gently ove r into the ot her world, to the W est, without even havi ng t o cr oss ove r physic ally. They kn ew abou t Flor ida, and our peopl e were he re for a long, long ti me before t he w hite peo ple t hink we were ( Wickm an 19 99: 221). It is the n ature of s cholarship to reexam ine and develop new interpret ations as D r. Wickm an does , but this is a long- term process that will certainly invol ve critique by ot her schol ars. Howe ver, the practical implications of her argume nt and the statements of the Seminoles she consul ted with to const ruct it are that these peopl e posse ss a sens e of attachment to this region as t heir ho meland and not som e accidenta l way point dict ated by histori cal circum stances beyond the control of their ancestors. Thi s wor ldview pr omot es a sense of attachment to and investment in the management of resources such as BISC a nd Everglades Na tional Park. As t he soci al and ec onom ic condi tions of the t ribes improve , it is likely they will take more direct interest in those i ssue s of direct cul tural impor tance to them , whether the i ssue s are about cultural resources or particular management topics.5-38 Bisca yne Nationa l Park Ethnogr ssessmen tNatio nal ice 6-16.0 SUM MARY : BISCAYNE NATI ONAL P ARK ETHNOGRAP HIC CONTEXT AND RES OURC E M ANA GEM ENT ISSUES BISC i s an area of contrasts. From nor th to south, the geology of the p ark ranges from sa nd barri er i slands to coral Key s. From west to east, the eco logical diver sity o f the p ark encompa sses coastal mangroves, the protected wa ters of the bay, a chain of Keys and, finally, fringin g coral reefs and deeper waters in the open Atlantic. The hum an uses of the park are as diverse as its resources. To the north of the park is the urban M iami metropolitan area, and toward the southern end of the pa rk a \"restored wilderness \" ca n be f ound. While not a true wilderness, th e park abounds with natura l areas that show few obvious signs of hum an pr esence to the unt rained e ye. Th e pa rk is at once the ba ckya rd playground t o one of the g reat cities of the Un ited States, and a set of natural and cul tural resour ces of great aesthetic and conse rvation value. e pa rk provides sust enance to shor eline fi sher s wh o use it to put food on t heir tables, and it provides at least a port ion o f a l iving to fishing guides, com mercial f ishers, and others who cater to the t ourism trade. It is a r ecreat ional re sidenc e for i ndividuals w ho may stay a day or two as cam pers or for a few w ho are occu pan ts of Stil tsville. The comm unities adjacent to B ISC a re changing. M iami ha s u ndergone significant demographic change in recent years and is a truly cosmopolitan center. In many ways, Miami is as m uch the northern fringe o f Lati n America as i t is the s outhern fringe of urban America. Significant causes of this evolving reality include global as wel l as local factors. The growt h and dominance o f a Cu ban -American p opulat ion in the area can b e dire ctly tra ced to C old W ar- related populatio n flows, an d Haitian and Nicaraguan immigra tion to th e special relatio nship Miam i has to th e Caribbean and its ec onomy. BI SC itself h as proven a cro ssroads in this change. For example, Haitian immigra nts on crude v essels desp erat e to ent er the U nite d Stat es have com e int o BISC where the Gulf St ream passes closest t o American sh ores. Th e sam e area that was earlier the pla yground of the richest of the r ich in America when weal thy fa milies from the Nor theast wou ld vacation on the Key s is now at times a passionate destination goal of the poorest of th e poor seeking a n ew start an d a new life in this country. While this report, by design an ethno graphic overview and assessm ent, focused on existing literat ure, it is cl ear that t here are par k us e pat terns and assoc iated com munity co nnections represented in the existi ng literat ure. For exam ple, it is kno wn that the local Mexican-Americ an community h as gro wn in recent years , and based on anecdotal evid ence it would appea r that there is at least som e use of the pa rk by this com munity for shor eline f ishing. In c ontrast, Cuba n-Americans of ten u se the Keys wit hin t he pa rk as a recreational destination site. Th ese two com munities or popul ations, while sharing a n H ispanic her itage, appea r to use two di fferent areas of the park (onshore and offshore, respectively), accessed by two di fferent means (vehicle and ve ssel), for two di fferent (amon g ot her) primary use s (consumpti ve use of resources versus n on-cons umptive use). As suggestive as these initial findings m ay be, ho wever, the M exican-Americ an use of th e park is all b ut in visible in existing documents. In fac t, researc h for this project shows that at lea st a good portion of shore b ased users of the park (e.g., 86 percent of the fishers co ntacted at Mowr y Canal) do not kno w they ar e in a national park. Thi s, obviously, presents management challenges to BISC st aff. In general, the fact that BISC is a par k \"w ithout a front gate\" struct ures the relat ions hip o f the p ark t o the com munities i n the area. 6-2 Biscayne National Park Ethnog raphic O verview and Assessmen t It is al so im portant t o note t hat w hile t he p articula r mix of m anagem ent and com munity rela ted issues is un ique to BIS C, the ind ividual m anagem ent chall enges faced b y BISC managers are relatively com mon t hroug hout the nation al park syst em. In s ome ways, BISC re presents a microcosm of contemporary man agement compl exities. One example of this is Stiltsville. In- holdings are not uncommo n in national parks, and where these in-holdings overlap with a local ly val ued w ay of l ife, or are iconic of those lifew ays, managers are presen ted w ith special challenges. In the case of Stiltsville, the structures do not qua lify as historic, nor, apparently, do t heir uses qua lify a s types of 'traditional use ' unde r National Par k Serv ice guidelines. Howe ver, the structures are clearly symbol ic of a portion of the south Fl orida expe rience, and their existence harken s back to an earli er (if som ewhat rom anti cized) era. While t he s truct ures them selves are not used as a pub lic resource, t he p ark w ill be diff erent, and so me say diminished, when these structures are g one. P ark management and others with vested interes ts still struggle w ith issues of pub lic and priva te acces s to com monly held resou rces, as m anagers do at oth er p arks. T he proximity to Miam i and relatively extensive pres s co verage makes this a re latively high profil e issue. BISC also represen ts differ ent things to differ ent com munities, and even d ifferent experiences of single com munities. For example, to African A mericans of t he area, BIS C embodies a history of segregation, in the form of a historic black-only beach on the contemporary site of the visitor's center, and of economi c and social triumph i n a r epressive society, in the form of the Parson Jones hom esite offshore on the Keys. That these two cont empor aneou s sites exist within the park is a valuable story that rem ains to be furt her devel oped. That t he s ociocu ltural differences parallel mainland and offshore resource contrasts is also an important part of the story, and a th eme that carries through to stor ies of oth er gro ups an d their varied relatio ns to the park. It is also cl ear that the dem ographi c char acteristics of t he v isitors to BISC do not reflect those of the communities o f the area. While n ot un expected, given the fac t that na tion al p arks in general derive visitors from far and wide, the cont rasts are still striking. Statistics c ompiled on participants in BISC sc hoo l outreach pr ograms appear to mi rror the demographics of the comm unities at large, and these are very different from t hos e characterizing persons seen at the visitor center or e lsew here in the park, wh ether m easured by visitor s urveys or casual observat ion. The dynamics of t his situat ion are surel y co mplex, and m ade al l the m ore compl icated by the differential types of access required to visit different parts of the park. BISC i s also a m aritime crossroads as we ll as a destination. The Intercoastal Waterway runs through Bi scayne Bay wi thin the park, and Hawk Cha nne l is a shipping lane that traverses BISC on the outside of the Keys. While wreckers and salvors no lon ger ply its w aters , ind ivid uals still can and do make a livin g off of those in distre ss on the sea, bu t in m odern tim es this normally translates to tow com pani es assisting pl easure boa ters. An other cont empor ary incarnation of historic sal vors m ay be seen in t hose w ho would privat ize t he ex cavat ion (or e ven w idespread exploration) of historically significant shipwrecks within the park. A ha rd-fought battle in a num ber of parks (and elsewher e), the tensi on bet ween those who bel ieve that to leave a wreck untouche d is to aba ndon it to destruction by the ocea n and those who bel ieve that to sa lvage it is to d estroy its in tegrity and the refore its c ontinu ing va lue, is p resent in BISC as well. Preservation of these wrecks requires continuing vigilance on the part of park personne l. The com mon presenc e of U .S. Cus toms, U.S. Coa st Gua rd, Immigra tion and Natural ization S ervi ce,Natio ice 6-3and other federal law enf orcement officers in the a rea also a ttest to the fa ct that BISC al so remains a crossroads for the smug gling trade. As the backdoor to Mia mi and gateway to the United States from the Ba ham as, the Gulf of M exico, the Car ibbea n, and beyond, a variety of illegal trafficking occurs in the area. Although individual issues are shared with their fellow officers elsewher e, BISC la w enf orcement per sonnel face a const ellation of chal leng es not normal ly see n in ot her nat ional parks. Perhaps one event that best focuses a number of the issues faced by BISC m anagement is the annu al Col umbu s Da y Re gatta. While the centerpiece of this event is a sailing race, the event has gr own to include a huge floating par ty within t he par k that has becom e an eve nt in and of itself. To t he attendees at the party, the race and, indeed, the park itself, wou ld appear to b e very muc h a part of an unseen and unimportant background to the immediate socializing and recreatio nal opportun ities affo rded by the presence of large numbers of other boaters . As well as being a const ant law enforcement chal leng e, this particular event does not typify what most peopl e expe ct as a typical scene within the national park system. Howe ver, it is the logica l extensi on of what is seen i n BISC on a sm aller, more low-key sc ale on a n ongoi ng ba sis. BISC f aces continuing challenges becasue of the changing sociocultural context of the surroundi ng a rea. Th e popu lation of of the adj acent com munities cont inues to increase in average age, and with a changing population may come different resource use demands. The park app ears t o have \"dod ged a bullet \" with the dro pping of a prop osed reuse of H omeste ad AFB as a m ajor civilia n airp ort. This re use would have meant the intrus ion of high noise levels into the park on an ongoing basis, diminishing the solitude sought by ma ny BISC use rs. Continuing ch allenges are a ssociated w ith agricult ural prod ucti on in t he area a nd associat ed water and r unof f issue s. BISC re presents many t hing s to the di fferent com munities and popul ations i n the a rea. It is a little known p ark compa red to the nearby Ev erglades Nat ional Park. When viewed from t he observatio n deck at the Dante Fascell Visitor Center at Convoy Point, the low-lying Keys within the p ark are not as obvious or eye-cat ching as t he d owntow n M iam i skyline t hat appears t o float in the di stance to the nor th (Fi gure 37) . W hen on t he wat er in the pa rk and looki ng ba ck towa rd the mainland, the miles of coastal mangrove, vital to the heal th and wel l being of the Biscay ne B ay ecos ystem, are not as obvious as t he view -dom inat ing T urkey Point (nuclear) Power Plant on the southern edge of the park and the highest elevatio n featu re in the County located immediately behind (west) of the park at Blac k Point M arin a-the enormous lan dfill known as \"Mount Trashmore.\" Despite these rem inders tha t the are a ad jacen t to the park is not pristine, BISC r epresents an area and a set of resources that is vitally important to lo cal communities in a varie ty of ways, perhaps made all th e more so by adjacen t uses. W hile a number o f relatio nships betw een communities an d the park have become clear th rough this study, it has raised a number of issues that could benefit from f urther clarification in subseque nt studies. These include: A traditio nal us e study to fo cus on interge neratio nal co ntinu ity o f res ource use, particu larly by families who previously homes teaded in what is now t he park, as we ll as thos e who mak e their living in the park through comm ercial fishing. The \"old families\" of the area represent an important continuity of comm unity and resource relations that is not developed in the existin g literatu re. T his study could also explore c ontinu ity o f use issues related to 6-4 Biscayne National Park Ethnog raphic O verview and Assessmen t Stiltsville. While contact was attempted wi th ne arly all Stiltsville structure users, more in- depth work could serve to c ast light on issues th at are im portan t no t on ly to B ISC but to other units wi thin the national park system as we ll. Thi s could also help to inf orm the ongoing ad visory process as well. An ethnographic stud y of com mercial and quasi-c ommercial fisherie s within BISC. While we have la id out a typology of fisheries, there is still much work to be do ne to il lum inat e ties betw een particu lar gr oups and specific res ources within different areas of the park. It is clea r that dif feren t fisheries in differ ent ar eas ar e associat ed w ith different sociocult ural groups, but it is not clear how these ac tivities fit in with other socioeconomic struc ture s in those c ommunities, n or how they cont ribute to f amil y ec onom ies within t hose com munities. W ithin the m ajor cat egories of c ommercial fishing (b y sp ecies com plex), spor t char ter fishing, guided fishing (primarily on the flats), and subsi stence -type f ishing, there are clear patterns of differences by so ciocultural and ethnic factors that remain to be defin itively explored and described. Basic et hnograph ic re search o n us e pat terns in different are as in BISC. It is cl ear that uses co-vary with resource distrib utio n and access type, but system atic ex ploratio n of the ties to particular com munities and popul ations was not possi ble unde r this research. V isitor surveys h ave been c onducted and are a useful piece of t he p uzzle, but supp lem entar y ethnographic re search could fill in a number o f the ga ps in un derstanding th e rela tion ship betw een the park and the adjacen t co mmunities. 1.0 Purpose and Need National Park Service 6-5 Graphics 0K034 Biscayne National Park\\Figures\\Fig X Photographs11 (DBrady) 5/5/03Figure 37 The Miami Skyline as seen from Biscayne National Park (top) and Turkey Point Power Plant looking south from Biscayne National Park Shoreline (bottom) 6-6 Biscayne National Park Ethnog raphic O verview and Assessmen t Nationa l Park Service 7 - 1 7.0 BIBLIOGRAPHY Ada ms, Chuck, St eve Jacob, a nd Suza nna Smi th 2000 What Happe ned Af ter the Net Ban?

It i s intended as an o verview of the c onnec tions o f surrounding c ommunities with BISC. Th is ov erview combines a re view of existing liter ature with lim ited e thno graphic intervie wing to describe the uses and sociocultural context o f BISC r esources. The c omplete development o f the round e of iverse gro ups, while desi rable, was ass essed the scop e of avai lable proje ct resources. Consequent ly, a research strategy was used to dev elop s ufficient backgroun d and ethnograph ic informat ion for a general overview of both the mu lti-cultural environment of Miami-Dade Coun ty and a preli minary assessment of cult ural groups within com munit ies sur rounding BI SC. This wo rk should be consi dered a s tarting po int for BIS C m anagers and s taff to assess the socia l and cultural c hara cteristics of surrounding communities and their connec tions w ith B ISC re sources. The re maind er o f this sectio n discu sses three issue s: 1. The res earch strategy t hat informed th e decis ions about how to achi eve a n overv iew within available reso urces. 2. The choices f or examinat ion of the exist ing literat ure ab out BIS C's sociocu ltural conte xt and the use of its resou rces. 3. The imp lement ation of ethnographic dat a coll ection, including s amp ling s trategies and intervie w metho ds. RESEARC H S The quest ions g implementa tion of this study are: \"What com munit ies or groups are associated with the park?\" \"Who i s using the park now? any traditionally asso- ciated are they using the park?\" and, \"How does the park fit into the lives of mem bers o f surrounding c ommunities?\" Using bo th down\" and \"botto m up\" ap proaches, literature revie w and primary data collectio n metho ds were combined to ad dress these q ues- ions. The \"to p down\" approach beg ins with a br oad ethno graphic treatm ent o f the M iam i- Dade Co unty ar ea, while the \"bot tom up\" approach ident ifies part icula r us es and us ers of the park a nd f ollows t he leads gener ated by t hose us es/user s to part icular groups, com munit ies, and cult ures associa ted with the park . The com bination of the t wo approaches res ulted in the con nection of some us ers with comm unities and a de scription of the sociocul tural con text of BISC. Du ring t he i nitial year of th is project , wo rk focu sed on t he \" bottom up\" approach. Literat ure rega rding the us es and s ociocu ltural conte xt of the park was ex amined. The wo rk also included a limited numbe r of ethnograph ic interviews designed to un derstand the range of uses and t he grou ps, com munit ies, and cult ures associa ted with those us es. The \" top dow n\" approach, that is , the e thno graphic charac teriza tion an d conside ratio n of the lar ger co mmunity adjacen t co mmunity co ntext, wa s de velo ped in m ore d etail in the follo wing ye ar. The d ecision to beg in w ith the bo ttom-up approach resu lted fro m sever al conside ratio ns. First , the M iam i-Dade County area en compasses a large , sprawling, cosmopolitan m etro polis. It isA p p e n d i x 1 - 2 Biscayne Nat ional Park Ethnographic Over view and Assessmenthom e to a la rge r ange of co mmunit ies, group s, and cult ures . Without s ome ba sic unders tandin g of gro ups li kely to be as socia ted with park, the et hnographic e ffort cou ld be diffuse a nd t he resources too limited to develop usable information about commu nity associations with BISC. Second, given the comp osition of the project team, a decision was made to maximize t he resources available from t he Ros enstiel School of M arine & At mosph eric S cience (RSM AS) /Univer sity of Miami com ponent early in the s tudy process. This would bot h in volve thos e team m emb ers in the ongoing research and pr oduce some pr elimin ary informat ion for park staff and manag ers ea rly in the study process. This inf ormation would then be av ailable for other efforts such a s revision of the General Managem ent Plan and the Fishery Managem ent Plan . Thir d, this strategy would invol ve park staff at the ear liest point in the process and en sure that BIS C's manager 's needs were i dent ified ear ly. EXAM INA TION OF TH E EXISTIN L ITERA TURE Devel oping the his wo rk requir ed m aking choices about al locat ing resources b etween t he l iterat ure ab out t he uses and us ers of BIS C's mari ne r esources and t he literat ure ab out t he cult ural groups in surrounding com munit ies. A signif ican t porti on of BISC is com posed of wate r that is acces sed b y co mmercia l and recrea tional user s. The com mercia l user s are pri marily fishermen who take shrimp, cra b, and a vari ety of fin fish. Recreat ional user s inclu de sailo rs, po wer bo aters, cru isers o f the Inter-Co astal f isherm en, d ivers, beachcom bers, treasurer hunter s, and ot her r ecreat ioni sts who vi sit BIS C's shoreli nes and waters. The lit eratu re abou t these t ypes of users is primarily in academic pu blications and in non-publ ished reports for government agenci es. The cult ural group s wit hin the en virons of the BISC are ext ensive and the literature regarding thos e groups is dispersed in local mus eum archives, acad emic bo oks and jou rnals, theses, dissertation s, new spapers, m agazine s, unpubli shed reports , films, and ot her media. Examini ng the existing literat ure rega rdin g the use of BISC's mar ine resources and the cul tural gro ups in sur rounding comm unities thus presen ted a decisio n about emphasi s and depth of coverage. Examinat ion of the l iterat ure about the uses of BISC's marine resources is emphasi zed us ing a \"bottom-up\" view that understand ing u ses and user s wo uld point t o connec tions w ith surro unding c ommunities. of the av ailable res ources ( 264 of the t otal 336 hours ) for t he l iterat ure rev iew were allocated to this task. The r ema ining seventy-two hou rs (about 21 per cent) wer e allocated for an e xaminat ion of ethnographic l iterat ure. This e mphasis on exi sting uses reve als the connec tions o f users w ith B ISC re sources, a key pie ce of information that can c ontribute to understand ing the soc ial ide ntities of users and their c onnec tions t o surro unding c ommunities. The discussion of the literature is presented in two s eparate chapters, one for a review of \"exi sting uses \" and anot her a bout BI SC's sociocult ural conte xt. The l ater cha pter is, as not ed previousl y, a mo re l imit ed discus sion usi ng t he \" top dow n\" strategy t o descri be the sociocultural c hara cteristics o f cultur al gro ups in nearby c ommunities. This d iscu ssion is limited be cause reso urces we re insu fficient to develop the d epth and bread th of p otentially avai lable inform ation. In fact, a thorough exam ination of the Miami-Dade County sociocultural context is a substantial task: this is one of the w orld' s most divers e and co mplex multi cult ural envi ronments , includ Europeans, Carib bean Islanders , and vari ous peop les from Cent ral and S outh Am erica an d other regi ons of the world. Devel oping the existing literature abo ut the history , cultu re, and social charac teristics fo r any one o f these groups woul d require a thor ough search of mus eum ar chives, book s, journals, theses,National Park Service A p p e n d i x 1 - 3 dissertations, sc holarly notes, a nd other unpublished documents. T he completion o f a thorough revie w for a ll the major gr oup s wit hin sur rounding com munit ies was e valuated as beyond w hat could be accom plished f or this wo rk. The f ocu s of this assessment is on a few prom inent cult ural groups in surrounding com munit ies that expres s the dive rsity of the multi cult ural envi ronment of the re gion. Th ese groups are : Cubans , Haitians, Nicar s, African Am ericans , Native Am ericans , and Crack ers. There a re many o ther p ossible cu ltura l gro ups to uropeans; R ussians; ily northern-areas of the Un ited States and Ca nad a; and a hos t of others. Th e focus selected is intended to illustrate a range of socia l and cult ural issues for group s of long s tandin g and thos e who are new imm igrants to Miami -Dade Coun ty. The se groups are also well represented in the available literature about the folk-life, sociology , and anthropol ogy of surrounding com munit ies. The rea dily ava ilable sources re gardin g these groups al so of ten com pile substantial amo unts of previ ously publi shed f indings , making r eview of t he sociocultural c hara cteristics re garding the se gro ups relatively efficient. For each of the s elected group s, inform ation i s summarized about so cial hist ory an d dem ography, . Wh ile books regarding the folk-life and anthropology of these groups were the primary sources, there was some limit ed revi ew of journal s. However, the resources are not avai lable to ident ify, acquire , and revi ew theses, dissertations , and ot ly works. Nonet heless, this revi re ader wit h an introduc tion t o the cult ural groups dis cuss ed, and i t should ass ist BIS C managers and s taff in unders tanding some of the b road cult ural themes wit hin com munit ies surr ounding park . USI INTERVI EW S TO D EVELOP I NFORM ATI ON ABOUT BI SC USERS The \"b ottom-up\" s trategy was also appli ed in ident ifying types of us es and us er gr oup s by condu cting et hnographic i ntervi ews. These intervi ntend ed to ascer tain local perspec tives about types of uses of the park , assessment s of res ources, and management concerns . Durin g the first project yea r, two ethnographers conduc ted about 22 intervi ews, and during t he following y ear, anot her 19 int ervi ews were com plet ed by t wo ethnographers . Usi ng a mo dified et hnographic ew app roach ( descri bed below), anot her 6 5 shoreli ne a nd cana l fishermen were also intervi ewed i n the project 's second year . Approxim ately 25 person- days were used t o co llect the et hnographic dat a an d an addit ional 8 person- days were use d for the shoreli ne a nd cana l fisherman i ntervi ews. The s amp ling approach and f orm at for bot h the ethnographic and fishermen interviews is described below. Ethnographi c Int ervi ews: Sam pling and Form at The kno wledge of park staff was o ur starting po int f or identification of perso ns to inc lude in the et hnographic i ntervi ews. Par k staff have first-hand kn owledge of the ra nge of user s who visit BISC and t hey a re also a valu able so urce of inform ation abo ut u ser gr oup issues. Staf f in differen t depart ments (including t he uperint Planning, ural Resources) were cont acted to i nquir e ab out t he typesA p p e n d i x 1 - 4 Biscayne Nat ional Park Ethnographic Over view and Assessmentof user s and the contact inform ation f or in divi duals who belong t o group s that might have a perspect ive on the p ark and i ts resources . A li st of indivi duals and t heir associa ted group s were compiled from these c ontacts. The gro ups ide ntified inclu ded: recre n, boater erato rs, shore line fisherme n, commercial fis hermen, and envir onmentalists. Additiona lly, park staff also su ggested there w ere others w ho do not nece ssarily rep resent a \"user gro up,\" but t hey a re \"intere sted par ties.\" That is, these ind ivid uals have c onnec tions to larger socia l and cult ural groups in Miami- Dade Co unty and its env irons t hat expres s an interest in p ark issue s. These groups were identified as: the Sem inole and Miccosuke e Tribes; tified from cont acts with BI SC staff wer e categorized accor ding to us er groups (fisherm en, commercial fishermen, etc.). In almost all instances, there were multiple individ uals iden tified for each group. Tel eph one calls to arrange interviews wer e ma de to per sons from each group; within the group pho ne cal ls were placed unt il a pers on was r eached who agreed to an i ntervi ew. The purpose of the project , how the i ndivi duals name was acqui red, and t he gener al topics we wish ed to address in the int ervi ew were explai ned. A few persons pref erre d a telephone int ervi ew, b ut the majori ty of these in tervi ews were f ace-t o-face. There were no refusals to p articip ate in these interv iews. The form at fo r these intervie ws was ethno graphic; that is, w ithin broad topic ar eas, ind ivid uals wer e encour aged to de scribe their use of the park, man agemen t conce rns, and ot her types of connec tions w ith pa rk reso urces. The e thno grapher's task in t hese type s of interview s is t o encourage t he pers on in tervi ewed to descri be f rom their point of view how they v iew t he park and us e its resources. Interviews wer e recorded in field notes, and then became the basis for the inform ation presen ted in the d escription o f users and interested parties in C hap ter 5 o f this report. Fisherm an I ntervi ews; Sam pling, a nd Form at Early discuss ions wit h BIS C st aff sugges ted a s pecial interes t in the f ishermen who fi sh the canals and sho relin es within park bo undaries.

Others sugg ested these users mig ht be pr imar ily recreational fisherme n who accessed park waters on weekends from nea r-by com munit ies. We responded to concerns amo ng park staff by working with the Univer sity of Miami to devel op intercept intervi ews wit h weeken d fishermen al ong t he canals and sho reline of the p ark. Interview s were conducted primarily o n w eekend s beca use park s taff indicat ed th is was t he t ime of t he mo st usa ge. This obse rvat ion was supported by casua l visits by ethnographers to the cana ls nea r the p ark on weekends and w eekday s. The s ites selected for these intercept interviews are: Black Point Marina, whi ch include s the con fluence of Black Creek and Goulds Canal s; Military Canal ; Mowry Canal ; Co nvoy Point nea r the Visitor's Cen ter; and Hom estead Ba yfront Park. On c onsecutive Sundays dur ing the mont h of Apr il 2002, these sites wer e visited by two Span ish-speaking interviewe rs. Every other person encountered at each site was asked to partic ipate in an int erview abo ut their fishing p ractices. A tot al of 65 persons were in tervi ewed; 22 at Black Point Marina; 22 at Convoy Point ; and 2 1 at M owry C anal.

The con tent of the interviews addr essed the reasons for visiting a particular site, knowl edg e of the ar ea, specie s target ed, percei ved changes in the fishery , and i f user s knew t hat they were fishing within B ISC. R esponses were recorded in written n otes a nd then compiled by site as a basis to describ e shoreli ne and canal fishing in BIS C. The r espons es were organi zed int o tables for frequency counts of responses to the topics address ed in the int ervi ews. Given the na ture of the sampl e and the exploratory pur pos e of the interviews , there was no reason to con duct any statistical analysis. The inform ation pres ented in Chapter 5 is thus a descri ptive s ummary that can b e a b asis for addit ional wo rk, but it is by no m eans a def initive descripti on of the extent of shoreline and canal fishing in BISC.A p p e n d i x 1 - 6 Biscayne Nat ional Park Ethnographic Over view and AssessmentAPPENDI X 2 North MiamiOpa-locka HialeahHialeah BeachNorth Bay Village MiamiMiami Springs GablesWest Miami South Miami HomesteadFlorida CityUnincorporated County Miami-Dade County Jurisdictions Near Biscayne National Park 00034 Biscayne/GIS/jurisdictions.apr 12/22/00Biscayne National Park Ethnographic OverviewSources: Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission, Biscayne National Park 35000 0 BiscayneMIAMI Biscayne National ParkEverglades National Park 5 0 5Miles National Wetlands Inventory 00034 Biscayne/GIS/national wetland.apr 12/22/00Biscayne National Park Ethnographic OverviewSources: Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission, Biscayne National Park 35000 0 35000Feet Scale: 1\" 874 Florida City Atlantic Ocean 4 0 4Miles Bottom Community Types in the Biscayne National Park Area 00034 Biscayne/GIS/bottom communities.apr 12/22/00Biscayne National Park Ethnographic OverviewSources: Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission, Biscayne National Park 20000 0 20000Feet Scale: 1\" = 35,000' (1:420,000)RoadsNational Park Highway #SCitiesBiscayne National ParkLEGEND Bottom Community Types BARE BOTTOM Carbonate Sand Unknown Bottom Unknown Bottom-Banks Unknown Bottom-Dredged Unknown Bottom-Restoration CORAL Individual Patch Reef Aggregated Patch Reefs Patch Reef with Halo HARDBOTTOM Soft Corals, Sponges, Algae Hardbottom with Perceptible Segrass Hardbottom Perceptable Segrass-Banks in Hardbottom Mod to Dense,Continuous Beds Mod to Dense,Continuous Beds-Banks Mod Dense,Continuous to Dense Patches in Matrix of Sparse Seagrass Dense Patches in Matrix of Sparse Seagrass Bathymetry 00034 Biscayne/GIS/bathymetry.apr 12/22/00Biscayne National Park Ethnographic OverviewSources: Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission, Biscayne National Park 20000 0 20000Feet Scale: 1\" National ParkFeet Below Sea LevelLEGEND 0 to 3 ft 3 to 6 ft 6 to 12 ft 12 to 18 ft 18 to 30 ftAs t he nation 's prin cipal conservation agency, the Department of the In terior has responsibility fo r most o f our nationally owned pub lic lands and natura l resources.
