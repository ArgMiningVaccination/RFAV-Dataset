It aims to make the bloodstream free of toxins. To clean a person's heart from all the toxins and harmful materials and make him free of heart diseases, SAAOL uses various techniques. The technique we use is called Chelation Therapy or EDTA Detoxification, a highly successful technique, which we have discussed below. The patient needs to be physically stable, for the detoxification therapy to be successful. Maintaining long-term health requires the assistance of trained healthcare professionals during detox programs, which is done by SAAOL. Side effects experienced by some can be severe or mild, accordingly. Some of them are: - Fever or Shivering - Headache - Fatigue - Palpitation - Vomiting - Irregular blood pressure - Nausea - Muscle aches - Abdomen pain - Loose Motion - Dizziness - Reaction/ Rashes - High Creatinine What is SAAOL Detox? SAAOL Detox Therapy (SDT) is a body detoxification therapy that employs a tried-and-true mix of intravenous allopathic medications. This therapy not only detoxifies the body of heavy metals and pollutants, but it also provides the body with micronutrients, which help to revitalize our bodies. This therapy, like a useful substance, helps to reduce blockages in the arteries of the heart. Along with lifestyle improvements, we should augment this therapy with certain powerful Ayurvedic medicines such as Cardiocure and homeopathic medicines such as SAAOL Heart Drops, which can help reverse heart disease. By SAAOL, this therapy is also known as BCA or Bio Chemical Angioplasty. SDT is a mix of Allopathic Detox medicine called EDTA along with all possible ways to remove toxins from our body. It has Ayurveda, homeopathy, herbal drinks, Unani, and naturopathy components too. After successfully treating many heart patients in the last twenty-six years, we found that this Detox works much more effectively not only in removing toxins from the body but also in the reversal of blockages. The most important ingredient of this therapy is intravenous EDTA, an Indian government-approved anti-toxic medicine that helps remove metal poisoning and other kinds of toxins from the body. Eligibility for detoxification - If someone is suffering from constipation for a long period, regular headaches, muscle pain or fatigue, food allergies, rosacea, or acne, then this treatment is helpful. - Pregnant women should avoid detoxification but if they want it then should get it done before getting pregnant. - Someone who is an alcohol or drug addict or has habituated their body from them for a long period. - Anyone who wants health benefits or overall better health. Why a heart patient needs Detoxification Therapy? For a perfectly healthy body, cleansing the body is important and detoxification is one of the best ways to achieve this. Normal detoxification can also be done at home but it would be hard since you have to follow a strict and hard procedure for a long time, which requires a lot of discipline and isn't possible for most people to get done on their own. But our detoxification is far better than the normal body detox. We decrease the risk of heart disease through our detoxification therapy, which is a problem for most people. Our EDTA or chelation therapy cleans the toxins and harmful substances from a person's heart and minimizes the risk of heart disease in the future. What is Chelation Therapy or EDTA Detoxification? Body cleansing or detoxing the impurities can easily be done with the use of EDTA. This therapy is used to remove heavy metals, like lead, mercury, etc., from the blood and is known as chelation therapy. It'll purify your blood and a better blood flow will be enjoyed by your body. It can also help in treating conditions like autism, Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart diseases, Parkinson's, etc. EDTA means Ethylenediamine Tetraacetic Acid, a type of medication injection involved in the treatment and is called a chelating agent or a chelator. How to detox body ? On alternate days, we provide an intravenous (IV) drip of Normal Saline or Ringer Lactate, with a mixture of EDTA, blood thinners, vitamins, anti-oxidants, PH balancing medicines, and diuretics distributed in the body. The duration of every therapeutic session is 2-3 hours and a dose of 20-30 drips is given to the patients. We check the renal functions at regular intervals to adjust future doses. However, before beginning therapy, we obtain consent from each patient. For the previous 25 years, we have consistently witnessed a minimum reduction of 5-15% in our patients' blockages using this therapy, albeit the outcomes vary from person to person. We have a registry of many heart patients who have greatly benefited from this therapy. Scientific backup of SAAOL Detox: The most predominant component of this therapy is intravenous (IV) EDTA, which is an anti-toxic medicine approved by the Indian government (part of the IP drug or Indian Pharmacopeia). For many years, it has been a key factor in the removal of metal and other types of toxins from modern medical establishments. EDTA, or Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetic Acid treatment, is widely used in the United States, and the National Institute of Health (NIH) conducted a comprehensive scientific trial on it, proving that it has no side effects and reduces morbidity and death in cardiac patients. TACT study results were published in JAMA (Journal of American Medical Association) in 2013. It was a multi-centric, Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved EDTA for the treatment of metal poisoning. Ayurvedic, Allopathic, and Homeopathic supplements of SDT: SAAOL advises that allopathic treatments should be continued both during and after this therapy. They aid in the reduction of lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) in the blood. Avoid eating meat and oily meals. After the therapy, we also recommend an anti-oxidant supplement (Antox Plus), which contains a lot of minerals and vitamins. To aid in the reversal of heart disease, an Ayurvedic supplement (Cardiocure) and a homeopathic supplement (SAAOL Heart Drop) have been produced. Another medicine is Comfort, a homeopathic drug that detoxifies the body by clearing the intestines. Antidote/Benefits of chelation therapy or EDTA: Ingesting bits of lead paint, and polluted water and air in the body can be a cause of heavy metal poisoning. Chelation therapy or EDTA detox is a way of body detoxification therapy. The type of metals which can be removed from the body with the help of this therapy are: - Arsenic - Iron - Mercury - Lead - Nickel - Copper Body detox common misconceptions: It is claimed that detox diets help you lose weight, boost your health, and get rid of toxins in your body. They frequently entail the consumption of laxatives, diuretics, vitamins, minerals, and other items with purported detoxifying effects. We made body detox even easier. Popular detox diets rarely specify the precise toxins they intend to eliminate or the method by which they supposedly do so. There is little data to back up the use of these diets for long-term weight loss or toxicity removal. Detox diets, therefore, don't add anything to what your body can already do naturally; however, you can enhance this process. Some safety detox tips: To execute body detoxification safely, you must follow these tips naturally at your home. - Change to natural cleaning supplies: Using natural cleaning items like baking soda and vinegar instead of commercial cleaning solutions can decrease your exposure to potentially harmful chemicals. - Using cilantro in your cooking: Certain pollutants, like heavy metals like lead and chemicals like phthalates and pesticides, are better excreted when cilantro is consumed. - Consume foods with sulfur: The excretion of heavy metals like cadmium is facilitated by foods high in sulfur, such as onions, broccoli, and garlic. - Elect for all-natural skin care: By using natural deodorants, cosmetics, shampoos, and other personal care items, your exposure to chemicals can be decreased. - Encourage glutathione: Consuming foods high in sulfur, such as eggs, broccoli, etc, improves the body's production of glutathione, a crucial antioxidant that is crucial to detoxification. - Utilize chlorella: The algae chlorella may help the body better eliminate pollutants such as heavy metals and has several nutritional advantages as suggested by various animal studies. Recovery Time It is dependent on the condition and needs of your body. Generally, it continues from three to ten days. The most severe symptoms would be seen within the first two days of the treatment. The treatment will last until the patient regain his mental as well as physical stability and the symptoms completely fade away. "}
