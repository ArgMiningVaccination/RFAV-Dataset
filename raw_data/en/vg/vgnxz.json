But if you want your metabolism to burn faster than ever before; if you want to shape the body you've always wanted; then The Eat-Clean Diet Workout is for you.Think fitness comes only with hour upon hour of exercise? Nope! Tosca will show you that you can have a better body than you ever dreamed possible, in 30 minutes a day, four days a week. Don't believe it? You will, 'cause Tosca's workout will get you there. This is the best weight training book I have ever read in my life. And I've read it through twice now, making it doubly the best weight training book I've ever read. Truth be told, it's only the second weight training book I've ever read, but I liked it a lot better than the first. Plus I love Tosca Reno. She's a smokin' hot 50ish year old lady. (Is she 50 now? I think so.) I have been utterly voiceless for over a month now, because my computer keyboard is no longer functioning. I can type, but only with an onscreen keyboard and a mouse, which I am thankfully not using right now. So instead of typing away emails, I have dedicated my extra spare time to carving out my amazingly awesome abs, which would impress even the most uneasily impressed. People even call me \"Abs\" as a nickname. (Probably it's just short for \"Abby\", but I'm not positive so I'll assume it's because of my stomach muscles.) Unfortunately, my six pack is covered by a little layer of flab and stretched out skin. So... you can't actually see anything. Bummer. Oh! Guess what I can do? Pull ups! I can do three pull ups in a row, no problemo. I saw Tosca Reno doing them in this book and thought I would give it a shot, and I can do them too! My husband didn't believe me, because I am petite and small-ish. But then he saw my incredible amazingness and applauded. This one is a tough one to call. I've been lifting weights for over 30 years. If you are an experienced weight lifter, this book is far too simplistic. But, if you are more of a novice, it is one of the best books I've seen on the market. Why? Two main reasons. First, the exercises listed are not so numerous as to overwhelm the novice, but they are highly effective. Second, Reno actually explains how variations in certain positions target different areas of the muscle. Not all books do that - they tell you the variation will hit the muscle in another area, but not WHAT area. The Eat-Clean Diet certainly seems sensible. I'm interested in some at-home weight training, during these COVID-19 times. I belive this book contains a lot of solid advice. Unfortunately for me, I want to use dumbbells at home - but this workout book is geared toward using a full range of gym equipment including barbells, dumbbells, weight bench, resistance machines. Since I am not going into a gym during these COVID-19 times, this book was only partly helpful to me. The philosophy about reps, sets, training days, and nutrition was all helpful, but the book does not contain many dumbbell exercises that are suitable to my new exercises of at-home weight training. I'm giving it two stars purely out of prejudice. I think that some of the exercises Reno recommends are dangerous, especially for people just starting out (step away from the Smith Machine, people, seriously) and some of the advice is just plain goofy (if you think you have big thighs already, don't do squats) and some of the advice is dangerous (wear a weightlifting belt). That being said, there's some valuable stuff here. The photographs are clear and beautiful, the explanations are clear and easy to understand, and the philosophy behind the book is excellent (strong women are healthy). This book has a lot of great information on lifting and \"eating clean\". I like that the book tends to be geared to a little bit 'older' excerciser. Tosca Reno did not start lifting weights or start a serious routine until she hit the dreaded 40. So she is inspirational to many. I did find one humorous part in the book that suggests that one should never gain large amounts of weight because its like an over-inflated balloon that will never regain its tight elasticity. It made me laugh to think of my 5 over-inflated preganancies and what its left me with.... I started thumbing through this one last night, and so far am impressed with the information she gives you. Correct posture, procedure, etc. A good reference book to have around if you use weights as part of your fitness routine. Loved this book. What Tosca has to say about nutrition and working out is really common sense. You just need to put it into practice. Her series of books is the reason I planted a small vegetable garden "}
