Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer.[ Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because cancer therapy side effects may persist or develop months or years after treatment. For specific information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Incidence and Epidemiology Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood. More than 650 cases are diagnosed each year in the United States.[ Population-based studies of screening for infants with neuroblastoma have demonstrated that spontaneous regression of neuroblastoma without clinical detection in the first year of life is at least as prevalent as clinically detected neuroblastoma.[ The incidence of neuroblastoma is slightly lower in Black children than in White children.[ Epidemiological studies have shown that environmental or other exposures have not been unequivocally associated with increased or decreased incidences of neuroblastoma.[ Anatomy Neuroblastoma originates in the adrenal medulla and paraspinal or periaortic regions where sympathetic nervous system tissue is present (see Figure 1). Figure 1. Neuroblastoma may be found in the adrenal glands and paraspinal nerve tissue from the neck to the pelvis. Neuroblastoma Screening Familial neuroblastoma and genetic predisposition Studies analyzing constitutional DNA in rare cohorts of patients with familial neuroblastoma have provided insight into the complex genetic basis for tumor initiation. About 1% to 2% of patients with neuroblastoma have a family history of the disease. These children are, on average, younger (9 months at diagnosis) than patients without a family history, and about 20% of these patients have multifocal primary neuroblastoma. Germline mutations. Several germline mutations have been associated with a genetic predisposition to neuroblastoma, including the following: Other cancer predisposition syndromes. Children with gene aberrations associated with other cancer predisposition syndromes may be at increased risk of developing neuroblastoma and other malignancies. The following syndromes primarily involve genes in the canonical RAS pathway: In addition, neuroblastoma has been described in patients with the following syndromes: Sporadic neuroblastoma may also have an increased incidence resulting from less potent germline predispositions. Genome-wide association studies have identified several common genomic variables (single nucleotide polymorphisms) with modest effect size that are associated with increased risk of developing neuroblastoma. Most of these genomic risk variables are significantly associated with distinct neuroblastoma phenotypes (i.e., high-risk vs. low-risk disease).[ Neuroblastoma predisposition and surveillance Screening recommendations from the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) emerged from the 2016 Childhood Cancer Predisposition Workshop. The AACR recommends that the following individuals undergo biochemical and radiographic surveillance for early detection of tumors in the first 10 years of life:[ Surveillance consists of the following:[ Surveillance begins at birth or at diagnosis of neuroblastoma predisposition and continues every 3 months until age 6 years, then every 6 months until age 10 years. Patients with Costello syndrome may have elevated urinary catecholamines in the absence of a catecholamine-secreting tumor, so only high or significantly rising levels should prompt investigation beyond ultrasonography and chest x-ray.[ About 5% of children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have mutations that cause decreased activity of CDKN1C. A review of all large studies of genetically subtyped Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome found 70 children with the CDKN1C mutation, 4.6% of whom developed neuroblastoma. There were no cases of Wilms tumor or hepatoblastoma. There is little experience with screening these children for neuroblastoma, so there are no generally accepted guidelines. However, the authors of the study suggest screening with urinary VMA/HVA every 4 to 6 months. Patients with other genetic subtypes of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have a prevalence of neuroblastoma of less than 1%. No neuroblastic tumors were found among 123 children with the genotype gain of methylation at imprinting control region 1.[ General Population Current data do not support neuroblastoma screening in the general public. Screening at the ages of 3 weeks, 6 months, or 1 year did not lead to a reduced incidence of advanced-stage neuroblastoma with unfavorable biological characteristics in older children, nor did it reduce overall mortality from neuroblastoma.[ Evidence (against neuroblastoma screening): Clinical Presentation The most frequent signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma in children are caused by tumor mass and metastases and include the following: The clinical presentation of neuroblastoma in adolescents is similar to that in children. The only exception is that bone marrow involvement occurs less frequently in adolescents, and there is a greater frequency of metastases in unusual sites such as lung or brain.[ Opsoclonus/myoclonus syndrome Paraneoplastic neurological findings, including cerebellar ataxia or opsoclonus/myoclonus, occur rarely in children with neuroblastoma.[ The usual presentation is the onset of progressive neurological dysfunction over a few days before a neuroblastoma is discovered. However, on occasion, neurological symptoms arise long after removal of the primary tumor.[ The opsoclonus/myoclonus syndrome appears to be caused by an immunologic mechanism that is not yet fully characterized.[ Genomic copy number profiles were analyzed in 44 cases of neuroblastoma associated with opsoclonus/myoclonus syndrome. Because there were no tumor relapses or disease-related deaths, the overall genomic profile was not prognostically significant.[ Some patients may rapidly respond neurologically to immune interventions or simply to removal of the neuroblastoma, but in many cases, improvement may be slow and partial. The improvement in acutely presenting motor deficits and ataxia seen with immunological therapy is not clearly associated with improvement in long-term neuropsychological disability, which primarily consists of cognitive and behavioral deficits. The long-term benefits of rapid improvement resulting from treatment, whether of symptoms or of the underlying neuroblastoma, are unclear, but rapid improvement appears to be worthwhile.[ Treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormones or corticosteroids can be effective for acute symptoms, but some patients do not respond to corticosteroids.[ The Children's Oncology Group (COG) has completed the first randomized, open-label, phase III study of patients with opsoclonus/myoclonus ataxia syndrome.[ Diagnosis Diagnostic evaluation of neuroblastoma includes the following: Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scanning is a critical part of the standard diagnostic evaluation of neuroblastoma, for both the primary tumor and sites of metastases.[ In contrast to urine, serum catecholamines are not routinely used in the diagnosis of neuroblastoma except in unusual circumstances. For patients older than 18 months with stage 4 disease, bone marrow with extensive tumor involvement combined with elevated catecholamine metabolites may be adequate for diagnosis and assigning risk/treatment group. However, INPC cannot be determined from tumor metastatic to bone marrow. Testing for MYCN amplification may be successfully performed on involved bone marrow if there is at least 30% tumor involvement. However, every attempt should be made to obtain an adequate biopsy from the primary tumor. For information about the use of biopsy in patients younger than 1 year, see the Observation and Spontaneous Regression of Fetal/Neonatal Neuroblastoma section. The diagnosis of neuroblastoma requires the involvement of pathologists who are familiar with childhood tumors. Some neuroblastomas cannot be differentiated morphologically, via conventional light microscopy with hematoxylin and eosin staining alone, from other small round blue cell tumors of childhood, such as lymphomas, primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and rhabdomyosarcomas. In such cases, immunohistochemical and cytogenetic analysis may be needed to diagnose a specific small round blue cell tumor. The minimum criterion for a diagnosis of neuroblastoma, as established by international agreement, is that diagnosis must be based on one of the following: Observation and Spontaneous Regression of Fetal/Neonatal Neuroblastoma The phenomenon of spontaneous regression has been well described in infants with neuroblastoma, especially in infants with the INSS 4S/INRG MS pattern of metastatic spread.[ Spontaneous regression generally occurs in tumors with the following features:[ Additional features associated with spontaneous regression include the lack of telomerase expression,[ Studies have suggested that selected infants who appear to have asymptomatic, small, low-stage adrenal neuroblastoma detected by screening or during prenatal or incidental ultrasonography often have tumors that spontaneously regress. These patients may be observed safely without surgical intervention or tissue diagnosis.[ Evidence (observation [spontaneous regression]): Prognostic Factors The prognosis for patients with neuroblastoma is related to the following: Some of these prognostic factors have been combined to create risk groups to help define treatment. For more information, see the sections on International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS) and Children's Oncology Group (COG) Neuroblastoma Risk Grouping. Treatment era Between 1975 and 2017, the 5-year survival rate for neuroblastoma in the United States increased from 86% to 91% for children younger than 1 year and from 34% to 83% for children aged 1 to 14 years.[ Age at diagnosis Infants and children The effect of age at diagnosis on 5-year survival is profound. In the COG ANBL00B1 (NCT00904241) study of 4,832 patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma, those younger than 18 months had a 5-year EFS rate of 82% and an OS rate of 91%. In comparison, patients aged 18 months or older had a 5-year EFS rate of 64% and an OS rate of 74%.[ According to the National Childhood Cancer Registry (NCCR), the 5-year relative survival rates from 2011 to 2017 were as follows:[ The effect of patient age on prognosis is strongly influenced by clinical and pathobiological factors, as evidenced by the following: Adolescents and young adults Adolescents and adults rarely develop neuroblastoma, accounting for less than 5% of all cases. When neuroblastoma occurs in this age range, it shows a more indolent clinical course than neuroblastoma in younger patients, and it shows de novo chemotherapy resistance.[ Although adolescent and young adult patients have infrequent MYCN amplification (9% in patients aged 10-21 years), older children with advanced disease have a poor rate of survival. Tumors from the adolescent and young adult population commonly have segmental chromosomal aberrations, and ALK and ATRX mutations are much more frequent.[ The 5-year OS rate for adolescent and young adult patients (aged 15-39 years) is 38%.[ Adults The biology of adult-onset neuroblastoma appears to differ from the biology of pediatric or adolescent neuroblastoma based on a single-institution series of 44 patients (aged 18-71 years).[ Tumor histology Neuroblastoma tumor histology has a significant impact on prognosis and risk group assignment. For more information, see the Classification of Neuroblastic Tumors section and Table 3. In the ANBL00B1 (NCT00904241) study of 4,832 patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma, 52% of patients were classified as favorable and 48% as unfavorable, according to the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification (INPC). For patients with tumors classified as favorable, the 5-year EFS rate was 88%, and the 5-year OS rate was 96%. For patients with tumors classified as unfavorable, the 5-year EFS rate was 55%, and the 5-year OS rate was 66% (P < .0001).[ Histological characteristics considered prognostically favorable include the following: High mitosis/karyorrhexis index and undifferentiated tumor cells are considered prognostically unfavorable histological characteristics, but the prognostic value is age dependent.[ A COG study (P9641 [NCT00003119]) investigated the effect of histology, among other factors, on outcome. Of 915 children with stage 1 and stage 2 neuroblastoma without MYCN amplification, 87% were treated with initial surgery and observation. Patients (13%) who had or were at risk of developing symptomatic disease, or who had less than 50% tumor resection at diagnosis, or who had unresectable progressive disease after surgery alone, were treated with chemotherapy and surgery. Those with favorable histological features reported a 5-year EFS rate of 90% to 94% and an OS rate of 99% to 100%. Those with unfavorable histology had an EFS rate of 80% to 86% and an OS rate of 89% to 93%.[ A study using data from the INRG Data Commons evaluated the prognostic strength of the underlying INPC histological criteria. The independent prognostic ability of age, histological category, mitosis-karyorrhexis index (MKI), and grade was demonstrated. Four age-related, histological prognostic groups were identified (aged <18 months with low vs. high MKI, and aged 18 months with differentiated vs. undifferentiated/poorly differentiated tumors). Compared with survival trees generated with established COG risk criteria, an additional prognostic subgroup was identified and validated when individual histological features were analyzed in lieu of INPC. Thus, replacing INPC with individual histological features in the future COG risk classification may eliminate the duplication of the prognostic contribution of age, facilitate international harmonization of risk classification, and provide a schema for more precise prognostication and refined therapeutic approaches.[ Biological features For more information, see the Genomic and Biological Features of Neuroblastoma section. Site of primary tumor Clinical and biological features of neuroblastoma differ by primary tumor site. In a study of data on 8,389 patients in clinical trials and compiled by the International Risk Group Project, the following results were observed, confirming the results from much smaller, previous studies with less complete clinical and biological data:[ Using the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effect Treatments (TARGET) and genome-wide association study data sets, a study compared the genomic and epigenomic data of primary diagnostic neuroblastomas originating in the adrenal gland (n = 646) with that of neuroblastomas originating in the thoracic sympathetic ganglia (n = 118). Neuroblastomas arising in the adrenal gland were more likely to harbor structural DNA aberrations such as MYCN amplification, whereas thoracic tumors showed defects in mitotic checkpoints resulting in hyperdiploidy. Thoracic tumors were more likely to harbor gain-of-function ALK aberrations than were adrenal tumors among all cases (OR, 1.89; P = .04), and among cases without MYCN amplification (OR, 2.86; P = .003). Because 16% of thoracic tumors harbor ALK mutations, routine sequencing for these mutations in this setting should be considered.[ In the TARGET cohort, 70% of patients with adrenal primary tumors and 51% of patients with thoracic primary tumors were stage 4. In the genome-wide association study without MYCN amplification, 43% of patients with adrenal primary tumors and 17% of patients with thoracic primary tumors were stage 4. By multivariate analysis, adrenal site was an independent predictor of worse outcome in the genome-wide association study cohort but not in the TARGET cohort after adjusting for MYCN amplification status, disease stage, and age of at least 18 months. Adrenal neuroblastoma was not an independent predictor of worse EFS by similar multivariable analysis for either the genome-wide association study or TARGET cohorts.[ It is not clear whether the effect of primary neuroblastoma tumor site on prognosis is entirely dependent on the differences in tumor biology associated with tumor site. Multifocal neuroblastoma occurs rarely, usually in infants, and generally has a good prognosis.[ Stage of disease Several imaged-based and surgery-based systems were used for assigning disease stage before the 1990s. In an effort to compare results obtained throughout the world, a surgical pathological staging system, termed the International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS), was developed.[ For the patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma enrolled in the ANBL00B1 (NCT00904241) study, the 5-years EFS and OS rates, according to INRGSS stage, were the following:[ For more information, see the following sections: Response to treatment Response to treatment has been associated with outcome. In patients with intermediate-risk disease who had a poor response to initial therapy in the COG ANBL0531 (NCT00499616) study, 6 of 20 patients subsequently developed progressive or recurrent disease, and one patient died.[ In patients with high-risk disease, the persistence of neuroblastoma cells in bone marrow after induction chemotherapy, for example, is associated with a poor prognosis. Sensitive techniques that detect minimal residual disease may be used to assess prognosis.[ In an analysis of patients from four consecutive COG high-risk trials, an end-induction response of partial response (PR) or better, according to the 1993 International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria,[ A treatment-associated decrease in mitosis and an increase in histological differentiation of the primary tumor are also prognostic of response.[ The accuracy of prognostication based on decrease in primary tumor size is less clear. In a study conducted by seven large international centers, 229 high-risk patients were treated in a variety of ways. Treatment included chemotherapy, surgical removal of the primary tumor, radiation to the tumor bed, high-dose myeloablative therapy plus stem cell transplant, and, in most cases, isotretinoin and anti-GD2 antibody immunotherapy enhanced by cytokines. Primary tumor response was measured after induction chemotherapy in three ways: as 30% or greater reduction in the longest dimension, 50% or greater reduction in tumor volume, or 65% or greater reduction in tumor volume (calculated from three tumor dimensions, a conventional radiological technique). The measurements were performed at diagnosis and after induction chemotherapy before primary tumor resection. None of the methods of measuring primary tumor response at end of induction chemotherapy predicted survival.[ Levels of LDH and ferritin Higher serum LDH and ferritin values conferred worse 5-year EFS and OS rates in a large international cohort of patients diagnosed with neuroblastoma (n > 8,575) from 1990 to 2016. Higher serum values for LDH and ferritin also conferred worse 3-year EFS and OS rates in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma after 2009. In a multivariate analysis that adjusted for age at diagnosis, MYCN status, and INSS stage 4 disease, LDH and ferritin maintained independent prognostic ability (P < .0001).[ Although not critically evaluated in the original INRG classification system, subsequent analysis of the INRG Data Commons has clearly demonstrated independent statistical significance of the levels of serum ferritin and LDH on prognosis in all patients and in high-risk patients, including in the time period between 2010 and 2016. Therefore, it was suggested that these two easily obtainable lab values be incorporated into the prognostic classification system of the INRG.[ References: Molecular features of neuroblastoma Children with neuroblastoma can be divided into subsets with different predicted risks of relapse on the basis of clinical factors and biological markers at the time of diagnosis. Key genomic characteristics of high-risk neuroblastoma that are discussed following: Segmental comparative genomic hybridization. These aberrations are seen in most high-risk and/or stage 4 neuroblastoma tumors.[ In an analysis of localized, resectable, non-MYC amplified neuroblastoma, cases from two consecutive European studies and a North American cohort (including INSS stages 1, 2A, and 2B) were analyzed for segmental chromosome aberrations (namely gain of 1q, 2p, and 17q and loss of 1p, 3p, 4p, and 11q). The study revealed a different prognostic impact of tumor genomics depending on patient age (<18 months or >18 months). Patients were treated with surgery alone regardless of a tumor residuum.[ In a study of children older than 12 months who had unresectable primary neuroblastomas without metastases, segmental chromosomal aberrations were found in most patients. Older children were more likely to have them and to have more of them per tumor cell. In children aged 12 to 18 months, the presence of segmental chromosomal aberrations had a significant effect on EFS but not on OS. However, in children older than 18 months, there was a significant difference in OS between children with segmental chromosomal aberrations (67%) and histology.[ Segmental chromosomal aberrations are also predictive of recurrence in infants with localized unresectable or metastatic neuroblastoma without MYCN gene amplification.[ In an analysis of intermediate-risk patients in a Children's Oncology Group (COG) study, 11q loss, but not 1p loss, was associated with reduced EFS but not OS (11q loss and no 11q loss: 3-year respectively; P = .09).[ In a multivariable analysis of 407 patients from four consecutive COG high-risk trials, 11q loss of heterozygosity was shown to be a significant predictor of progressive disease, and lack of 11q loss of heterozygosity was associated with both higher rates of end-induction complete response and end-induction partial response.[ An international collaboration studied 556 patients with high-risk neuroblastoma and identified two types of segmental copy number aberrations that were associated with extremely poor outcome. Distal 6q losses were found in 6% of patients and were associated with a 10-year survival rate of only 3.4%. Amplifications of regions not encompassing the MYCN locus, in addition to MYCN amplification, were detected in 18% of the patients and were associated with a 10-year survival rate of 5.8%.[ MYCNgene amplification neuroblastoma tumors.[ In all stages of disease, amplification of the MYCN gene strongly predicts a poorer prognosis, in both time to tumor progression and OS, in almost all multivariate regression analyses of prognostic factors.[ Within the localized-tumor MYCN-amplified cohort, patients with hyperdiploid tumors have better outcomes than do patients with diploid tumors.[ Most unfavorable clinical and pathobiological features are associated, to some degree, with MYCN amplification. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis of 7,102 patients in the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) study, pooled segmental chromosomal aberrations and gains of 17q were poor prognostic features, even when not associated with MYCN amplification. However, another poor prognostic feature, segmental chromosomal aberrations 11q, are almost entirely mutually exclusive of MYCN amplification.[ In a cohort of 6,223 patients from the INRG database with known MYCN status, the OS hazard ratio (HR) associated with MYCN amplification was 6.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7-7.0; P < .001). The greatest adverse prognostic impact of MYCN amplification for OS was in the youngest patients (aged <18 months: HR, 19.6; aged 18 months: HR, 3.0). Patients whose outcome was most impacted by MYCN status were those with otherwise favorable features, including age younger than 18 months, high mitosis karrhyohexis index, and low ferritin.[ Intratumoral heterogeneous MYCN amplification (hetMNA) refers to the coexistence of MYCN-amplified cells as a cluster or as single scattered cells and non-MYCN-amplified tumor cells. HetMNA has been reported infrequently. It can occur spatially within the tumor as well as between the tumor and the metastasis at the same time or temporally during the disease course. The International Society of Paediatric Oncology Europe Neuroblastoma (SIOPEN) biology group investigated the prognostic significance of this neuroblastoma subtype. Tumor tissue from 99 patients identified as having hetMNA and diagnosed between 1991 and 2015 was analyzed to elucidate the prognostic significance of MYCN-amplified clones in otherwise non-MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas. Patients younger than 18 months showed a better outcome in all stages compared with older patients. The genomic background correlated significantly with relapse frequency and OS. No relapses occurred in cases of only numerical chromosomal aberrations. This study suggests that hetMNA tumors be evaluated in the context of the genomic tumor background in combination with the clinical pattern, including the patient's age and disease stage. Future studies are needed in patients younger than 18 months who have localized disease with hetMNA.[ FOXR2activation FOXR2 gene expression is observed in approximately 8% of neuroblastoma cases. FOXR2 gene expression is normally absent postnatally, with the exception of male reproductive tissues.[ Neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation is observed at comparable rates in high-risk and non-high-risk cases.[ Exonic mutations in neuroblastoma (includingALKmutations and amplification) Compared with adult cancers, pediatric neuroblastoma tumors show a low number of mutations per genome that affect protein sequence (10-20 per genome).[ Figure 2. Data tracks (rows) facilitate the comparison of clinical and genomic data across cases with neuroblastoma (columns). The data sources and sequencing technology used were whole-exome sequencing (WES) from whole-genome amplification (WGA) (light purple), WES from native DNA (dark purple), Illumina WGS (green), and Complete Genomics WGS (yellow). Striped blocks indicate cases analyzed using two approaches. The clinical variables included were sex (male, blue; female, pink) and age (brown spectrum). Copy number alterations indicates ploidy measured by flow cytometry (with hyperdiploid meaning DNA index >1) and clinically relevant copy number alterations derived from sequence data. Significantly mutated genes are those with statistically significant mutation counts given the background mutation rate, gene size, and expression in neuroblastoma. Germline indicates genes with significant numbers of germline ClinVar variants or loss-of-function cancer gene variants in our cohort. DNA repair indicates genes that may be associated with an increased mutation frequency in two apparently hypermutated tumors.

The ALK gene provides instructions for making a cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase, expressed at significant levels only in developing embryonic and neonatal brains. ALK is the exonic mutation found most commonly in neuroblastoma. Germline mutations in ALK have been identified as the major cause of hereditary neuroblastoma. Somatically acquired ALK-activating exonic mutations are also found as oncogenic drivers in neuroblastoma.[ Two large cohort studies examined the clinical correlates and prognostic significance of ALK alterations. One study from the COG examined ALK status in 1,596 diagnostic neuroblastoma samples across all risk groups.[ In a study that compared the genomic data of primary diagnostic neuroblastomas originating in the adrenal gland (n = 646) with that of neuroblastomas originating in the thoracic sympathetic ganglia (n = 118), 16% of thoracic tumors harbored ALK mutations.[ Small-molecule ALK kinase inhibitors such as lorlatinib (added to conventional therapy) are being tested in patients with recurrent ALK-mutated neuroblastoma (NCT03107988) and in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma with activated ALK (COG ANBL1531).[ Genomic evolution of exonic mutations There are limited data regarding the genomic evolution of exonic mutations from diagnosis to relapse for neuroblastoma. Whole-genome sequencing was applied to 23 paired diagnostic and relapsed neuroblastoma tumor samples to define somatic genetic alterations associated with relapse,[ In addition, three relapse samples showed structural alterations involving MAPK pathway genes consistent with pathway activation, so aberrations in this pathway were detected in 18 of 23 (78%) relapse samples. Aberrations were found in ALK (n = 10), NF1 (n = 2), and one each in NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, BRAF, PTPN11, and FGFR1. Even with deep sequencing, 7 of the 18 alterations were not detectable in the primary tumor, highlighting the evolution of mutations presumably leading to relapse and the importance of genomic evaluations of tissues obtained at relapse. Given the widespread metastatic nature of high-risk and relapsed neuroblastoma, use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) technologies may reveal additional genomic alterations not found in conventional tumor biopsies. Moreover, these approaches have demonstrated the ability to detect resistant mutations in patients with neuroblastoma who were treated with ALK inhibitors.[ A report that evaluated telomere maintenance mechanisms found that the proportion of cases with alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) activation was markedly higher in a cohort of relapsed patients than a cohort of newly diagnosed patients (48% vs. 10%, respectively).[ In a deep-sequencing study, 276 neuroblastoma samples (comprised of all stages and from patients of all ages at diagnosis) underwent very deep (33,000X) sequencing of just two amplified ALK mutational hot spots, which revealed 4.8% clonal mutations and an additional 5% subclonal mutations. This finding suggests that subclonal ALK gene mutations are common.[ Genomic alterations promoting telomere maintenance Lengthening of telomeres, the tips of chromosomes, promotes cell survival. Telomeres otherwise shorten with each cell replication, eventually resulting in the cell's inability to replicate. Patients whose tumors lack telomere maintenance mechanisms have an excellent prognosis, while patients whose tumors harbored telomere maintenance mechanisms have a substantially worse prognosis.[ ALT-positive tumors in pediatric populations rarely present before the age of 18 months and occur almost exclusively in older children (median age at diagnosis, approximately 8 years).[ The prognosis for high-risk patients with ALT activation is as poor as that for patients with MYCN amplification for EFS;[ Additional biological factors associated with prognosis MYC and MYCN expression Immunostaining for MYC and MYCN proteins on a restricted subset of 357 undifferentiated/poorly differentiated neuroblastoma tumors demonstrated that elevated MYC/MYCN protein expression is prognostically significant.[ Neurotrophin receptor kinases Expression of neurotrophin receptor kinases their ligands vary between high-risk and low-risk tumors. TrkA is found on low-risk tumors, and absence of its ligand NGF is postulated to lead to spontaneous tumor regression. In contrast, TrkB is found in high-risk tumors that also express its ligand, BDNF, which promotes neuroblastoma cell growth and survival.[ Immune system inhibition Anti-GD2 antibodies, along with modulation of the immune system to enhance the antibody's antineuroblastoma activity, are often used to help treat patients with neuroblastoma. The clinical effectiveness of one such antibody led to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of dinutuximab. The patient response to immunotherapy may be caused, in part, by variation in immune function among patients. One anti-GD2 antibody, termed 3F8, used for treating neuroblastoma exclusively at one institution, utilizes natural killer cells to kill the neuroblastoma cells. However, the natural killer cells can be inhibited by the interaction of HLA antigens and killer immunoglobulin receptor (KIR) subtypes.[ References: Neuroblastomas are classified as one of the small round blue cell tumors of childhood. They are a heterogenous group of tumors composed of cellular aggregates with different degrees of differentiation, from mature ganglioneuromas to less mature ganglioneuroblastomas to immature neuroblastomas, reflecting the varying malignant potential of these tumors.[ There are two classification systems for neuroblastoma: International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification (INPC) System The INPC system was derived from the experience with the original Shimada classification, and the two systems are compared in Table 1. The INPC involves evaluation of tumor specimens obtained before therapy for the following morphological features:[ Favorable and unfavorable prognoses are defined on the basis of these histological parameters and patient age. The prognostic significance of this classification system, and of related systems using similar criteria, has been confirmed in several studies (see Table 1).[ a Reprinted with permission.

The tumors generally do not express MYCN, even with the gene being amplified, and these patients have a more favorable prognosis than do patients whose tumors are MYCN amplified and overexpress MYCN.[ The individual components of INPC data from the INRG Data Commons (18,865 patients) were analyzed, and the analysis validated the independent prognostic ability of age at diagnosis, histological category, MKI, and grade of differentiation. Four histological prognostic groups of patients were identified (aged <18 months with low vs. high MKI; aged >18 months with differentiating vs. undifferentiating/poorly differentiating tumors). Also, by using a risk schema devoid of the confounding of age and INPC, this analysis identified a novel and unfavorable subgroup of patients older than 547 days with stage 1 or 2, MYCN-nonamplified, intermediate or high MKI diploid tumors who had a very poor event-free survival (EFS) rate (EFS rate, 46%).[ International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) Classification System The INRG used a survival-tree analysis to compare 35 prognostic factors in more than 8,800 patients with neuroblastoma from a variety of clinical trials. The underlying histological features in the INPC (Shimada system) were included in the analysis:[ Because patient age is used in all risk stratification systems, a cellular classification system that did not employ patient age was desirable, and underlying histological criteria, rather than INPC or Shimada Classification, was used in the final decision tree. Histological findings discriminated prognostic groups most clearly in two subsets of patients, as shown in Table 2. = neuroblastoma; OS = overall survival.| | a Adapted from Cohn et al.[ | |INSS the INRG Risk Classification Schema. For more information, see Table 4. References: Staging Evaluation Approximately 70% of patients with neuroblastoma have metastatic disease at diagnosis. A thorough evaluation for metastatic disease is performed before therapy initiation. The studies described below are typically performed.[ Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan The extent of metastatic disease is assessed by MIBG scan, which is applicable to all sites of disease, including soft tissue, bone marrow, and cortical bone. Approximately 90% of neuroblastomas will be MIBG avid. The MIBG scan has a sensitivity and specificity of 90% to 99%, and MIBG avidity is equally distributed between primary and metastatic sites.[ Imaging with 123I-MIBG is optimal for identifying soft tissue and bony metastases. It was shown to be superior to positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) in one prospective comparison.[ Baseline MIBG scans performed at diagnosis provide an excellent method for monitoring disease response and performing posttherapy surveillance.[ Curie and SIOPEN scoring methods Multiple groups have investigated a semiquantitative scoring method to evaluate disease extent and prognostic value. The most common scoring methods in use for evaluation of disease extent and response are the Curie and the International Society of Paediatric Oncology Europe Neuroblastoma (SIOPEN) methods. The prognostic significance of postinduction Curie scores has been validated in an independent cohort of patients.[ The German Pediatric Oncology Group compared the prognostic value of the Curie and SIOPEN scoring methods in a retrospective study of 58 patients with stage 4 neuroblastoma who were older than 1 year. They demonstrated very similar results. At diagnosis, a Curie score of 2 or lower and a SIOPEN score of 4 or lower (best cutoff) correlated with significantly better EFS and overall survival (OS) rates, compared with higher scores. After four cycles of induction chemotherapy, patients with a complete response by SIOPEN and Curie scoring had a better outcome than did patients with residual uptake in metastases. However, subsequent resolution of MIBG-positive metastases occurring between the fourth and sixth cycles of chemotherapy did not affect prognosis.[ The cited clinical trials did not include postinduction-phase assessments of Curie or SIOPEN scores after transplant and immunotherapy. Cutoffs and outcomes associated with those assessments may differ from the preinduction and postinduction scores. PET scan Fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose PET scans are used to evaluate extent of disease in patients with tumors that are not MIBG avid.[ Other staging tests and procedures Other tests and procedures used to stage neuroblastoma include the following: Lumbar puncture is avoided because central nervous system (CNS) metastasis at diagnosis is rare,[ Neuroblastoma Staging Systems Combinations of prognostic factors (clinical and biological features) have been used for decades to risk-stratify patients and inform treatment assignment.[ International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) The International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) was developed and adopted by the COG in 1986 and by cooperative groups in Europe and Japan in 1993. The INSS is a postsurgical staging system that uses tumor location with respect to midline structures, lymph node status, and, importantly, extent of upfront surgical resection to determine whether a locoregional tumor is INSS stage 1, 2A, 2B, or 3.[ International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS) To create a staging system independent of surgical resection extent, the INRGSS was developed in 2005 using image-defined risk factors (IDRFs) to categorize locoregional tumors as L1 (IDRFs absent), L2 (IDRFs present), M (metastatic), or MS (the equivalent of 4S in the INSS). Presence of IDRFs has been associated with an increase in intraoperative complications, incomplete tumor resection, and worse survival in numerous studies.[ |Stage||Description| |IDRFs risk factors; INSS | a Adapted from Monclair et al.[ | |L1||Localized tumor not involving vital structures as defined by the list of IDRFsa and confined to one body compartment.| |L2||Locoregional tumor with presence of one or more IDRFs.a| |M||Distant metastatic disease (except stage MS).| |MS||Metastatic disease in children younger than 18 months with metastases confined to skin, liver, and/or bone marrow. The primary tumor can be INSS stage 1, 2, or 3.| IDRFs, as defined in the original literature, include the following:[ COG IDRFs, using an anatomical localization approach, include the following:[ Assessment of surgical resectability should include IDRFs. The more IDRFs present, the higher the morbidity of the operation and the lower the chance of complete resection. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not always effective in eliminating IDRFs, as seen in a retrospective study in the European Unresectable Neuroblastoma trial from 2001 to 2006 that examined data from 143 patients with INSS stage 3 neuroblastoma who were older than 1 year without MYCN amplification. All patients had surgical risk factors that deemed the tumors unresectable. In a centrally reviewed subset, unfavorable histology by International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification was found in 53% of patients. At diagnosis, 228 IDRFs were identified.[ The INRGSS has incorporated this staging system into a risk grouping system using multiple other parameters at diagnosis.[ The INRGSS simplifies stages into L1, L2, M, or MS. Localized tumors are classified as stage L1 or L2 disease on the basis of whether one or more of the 20 IDRFs are present.[ The INRG collaboration has also defined techniques for detecting and quantifying neuroblastoma in bone marrow, both at diagnosis and after treatment. Quantification of bone marrow metastatic disease may result in more accurate assessment of response to treatment,[ The decision by the INRG Task Force to replace the category of 4S disease with that of the new MS definition was based on reports in which small numbers of infants with L2 primary tumors and 4S metastatic patterns, including those aged 12 to 18 months, had favorable outcomes.[ By combining the INRGSS, age, and biological factors, each patient is assigned an INRG risk group that is prognostic of outcome and guides the appropriate risk-based treatment approach. The validity of the INRGSS was explored in the following retrospective studies of localized neuroblastoma with previously defined INSS stage without MYCN amplification: Most international protocols have begun to incorporate the collection and use of IDRFs to define INRG stage, which is used in risk stratification and assignment of therapy.[ Children's Oncology Group (COG) Neuroblastoma Risk Grouping The COG ANBL00B1 (NCT00904241) biology study serves as the infrastructure for rapid and reliable acquisition of tumor prognostic markers used for risk classification and clinical trial eligibility. For more information about the COG risk categories, see Table 5. For more information about eligibility for low-risk patients in the ANBL1232 trial, see the Treatment options under clinical evaluation section in the Low-Risk Neuroblastoma section. For information about eligibility for intermediate-risk patients in the ANBL1232 trial, see the Treatment options under clinical evaluation section in the Intermediate-Risk Neuroblastoma section. For information about eligibility for high-risk patients in the ANBL1531 trial, see the Treatment Options Under Clinical Evaluation section in the Treatment of High-Risk Neuroblastoma section. International Neuroblastoma Risk Grouping (INRG) The INRG classification schema assigns neuroblastoma patients to one of 16 pretreatment risk groups on the basis of INRG stage, age, histological category, grade of tumor differentiation, MYCN amplification, 11q aberration (the only segmental chromosomal aberration studied), and ploidy. Four levels of risk were defined according to outcomes among 8,800 patients with high-quality data, as they had been entered in clinical trials (see Table 4). Because the 2006 neuroblastoma risk classification system had not been modified to include INRGSS, a comprehensive analysis was performed of IDRF data collected from patients enrolled in the ANBL00B1 (NCT00904241) biology study. The COG analyzed almost 5,000 patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma who were enrolled in the ANBL00B1 study between 2007 and 2017 and treated with more modern therapy. In addition to using the INRGSS, segmental chromosomal status of 1q was examined with the above prognostic factors.[ In the overall risk grouping, histology is an important risk determinant for all stage L1 and L2 tumors, and grade of differentiation discriminates among neuroblastomas and nodular ganglioneuroblastomas in patients older than 18 months. The goals of the INRG are to increase international collaboration and classify patients uniformly so that the results of clinical trials conducted around the world can be compared.[ |INRG Stage||Histological = ganglioneuroblastoma; = not amplified.| | a Reprinted with permission. \u00a9 (2015) American Society of Clinical Oncology.

The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of pediatric patients with cancer.[ References: Treatment is risk based. In the Children's Oncology Group (COG) risk system, each child is assigned to a low-risk, intermediate-risk, or high-risk group on the basis of the following factors:[ Assessment of risk for low-stage MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma is controversial because it is so rare. A study of 87 patients with INSS stage 1 or stage 2 MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma pooled from several clinical trial groups demonstrated no effect of age, stage, or initial treatment on outcome. The event-free survival (EFS) rate was 53%, and the overall survival (OS) rate was 72%. Survival was superior in patients whose tumors were hyperdiploid rather than diploid (EFS rate, 15%).[ The COG considers infants with stage 4 and stage 4S disease with MYCN amplification to be at high risk.[ For more information about the COG risk categories, see Table 5. Other biological factors that influenced treatment selection in some previous COG studies included unbalanced 11q loss of heterozygosity and loss of heterozygosity for chromosome |Risk||Stage||Age||MYCNstatus||DNA ploidy||INPC||Other| |Amp = favorable histology; INPC = International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification; UH = unfavorable histology.| | a Adapted from Liang et al.[ | |b Low-risk group symptomatic| Generally, treatment is based on whether the tumor is classified as low, intermediate, or high risk, as follows: Table 6 summarizes the treatment options for patients with low-risk, intermediate-risk, high-risk, and stage with or without |Chemotherapy with or without surgery(for symptomatic disease or unresectable after surgery).| |Radiation tandem cycles of myeloablative therapy and SCT, radiation therapy, and dinutuximab, with favorable tumor biology).| |Chemotherapy(for symptomatic patients or those with unfavorable biology).| |Radiation therapy(rarely for patients with symptoms related to hepatomegaly metastatic disease).| Revised International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC) INRC is used to assess response to treatment.[ The overall INRC response criteria are defined as follows:[ Care should be taken in interpreting the development of metastatic disease in an infant who was initially considered to have stage 1 or 2 disease. If the pattern of metastases in such a patient is consistent with a 4S pattern of disease (involvement of skin, liver, and/or bone marrow, the latter less than 10% involved), these patients are not classified as having progressive/metastatic disease, which would typically be a criterion for removal from protocol therapy. Instead, these patients are managed as stage 4S patients. Controversy exists regarding the necessity of measuring the primary tumor response in all three dimensions or whether the single longest dimension, as in RECIST tumor response determination, is equally useful.[ Surgery In patients without metastatic disease, the standard of care is to perform an initial surgery, on the basis of the stage and the risk group, to accomplish the following: The COG reported that expectant observation in infants younger than 6 months with small (L1) adrenal masses resulted in an excellent EFS and OS while avoiding surgical intervention in a large majority of patients.[ In patients with L1 tumors (defined as having no image-defined surgical risk factors), the tumors are resectable and resection is less likely to result in surgical complications. Whether there is any advantage to gross-total resection of the primary tumor mass after chemotherapy in stage 4 patients older than 18 months remains controversial.[ For more information about image-defined risk factors, see the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS) section. Radiation Therapy In the current treatment paradigm, radiation therapy for patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk neuroblastoma is reserved for symptomatic life-threatening or organ-threatening tumor bulk that did not respond rapidly enough to chemotherapy. Common situations in which radiation therapy is used in these patients include the following: Radiation therapy has become part of the standard of care for patients with high-risk disease and is usually delivered after high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue. For more information, see the Treatment of High-Risk Neuroblastoma section. Limiting the use of radiation therapy in infants with neuroblastoma (who generally have non-high-risk disease) is supported by long-term follow-up data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. This study demonstrated higher rates of second malignant neoplasms and significant chronic health conditions in infants who were treated with radiation therapy.[ Treatment of Spinal Cord Compression Spinal cord compression is considered a medical emergency. Patients receive immediate treatment because neurological recovery is more likely when symptoms are present for a relatively short time before diagnosis and treatment. Recovery also depends on the severity of neurological defects (weakness vs. paralysis). Neurological outcome appears to be similar whether cord compression is treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery, although radiation therapy is used less frequently than in the past. The completed COG neuroblastoma clinical trials recommended immediate chemotherapy for cord compression in low-risk or intermediate-risk patients.[ Children with severe spinal cord compression that does not promptly improve or those with worsening symptoms may benefit from neurosurgical intervention. Laminectomy may result in later kyphoscoliosis and may not eliminate the need for chemotherapy.[ The burden of long-term health problems in survivors of neuroblastoma with intraspinal extension is high. In a systematic review of 28 studies of treatment and outcome of patients with intraspinal extension, the severity of the symptoms at diagnosis and the treatment modalities were most associated with the presence of long-term health problems. In particular, the severity of neurological motor deficits was most likely to predict neurological outcome.[ In a series of 34 infants with symptomatic epidural spinal cord compression, both surgery and chemotherapy provided unsatisfactory results once paraplegia had been established. The frequency of grade 3 motor deficits and bowel dysfunction increased with a longer symptom duration interval. Most infants with symptomatic epidural spinal cord compression developed sequelae, which were severe in about one-half of patients.[ Surveillance During and After Treatment Although the role of surveillance imaging for detection of neuroblastoma relapse has not been well studied, most patients will undergo regular imaging tests after completing therapy. Many patients who relapse do not have their disease detected by scans, but rather present with symptoms. Factors such as risk stratification, disease sites, biomolecular markers, and cumulative radiation dose may be considered in surveillance after treatment.[ In a series of 183 patients diagnosed with neuroblastoma, 50 patients experienced recurrence or progression. Relapsed disease was detected in most patients by symptoms/examination, MIBG scan, urinary catecholamines, and/or x-rays or ultrasonography.[ Cross-sectional imaging with CT scans is controversial because of the amount of radiation received and the low proportion of relapses detected with this modality.[ References: Low-Risk Neuroblastoma Low-risk neuroblastoma represents nearly one-half of all newly diagnosed patients. The success of previous Children's Oncology Group (COG) clinical trials has contributed to the continued reduction in therapy for select patients with neuroblastoma. According to the COG risk categorization, patients with low-risk disease generally have low-stage disease (International Neuroblastoma Staging System [INSS] stage 1, 2A, or 2B, and International Neuroblastoma Risk Group [INRGSS] stage L1) and the tumors are MYCN-nonamplified, hyperdiploid, and have favorable histology. For more information about the COG risk categories, see Table 5. For more information about low-stage disease, see the Treatment of INSS Stage 4S and INRG Stage MS Neuroblastoma section. Treatment options for low-risk neuroblastoma For patients with localized disease that appears to be resectable (either based on the absence of image-defined risk factors [L1] or on the surgeon's expertise), the tumor should be resected by an experienced surgeon. If the biology is confirmed to be favorable, residual disease after surgery is not considered a risk factor for relapse and chemotherapy is not indicated. Several studies have shown that patients with favorable biology and residual disease have excellent outcomes, with event-free survival (EFS) rates exceeding 90% and overall survival (OS) rates ranging from 99% to 100%.[ Some patients with presumed neuroblastoma have been observed without biopsy. The COG is studying this strategy further in the ANBL1232 (NCT02176967) trial.[ Treatment options for low-risk neuroblastoma include the following: Surgery followed by observation Treatment for patients categorized as low risk may be surgery alone. For more information, see Table 5. Evidence (surgery followed by observation): Observation with or without biopsy Observation without biopsy has been used to treat perinatal neuroblastoma with small adrenal tumors. A COG study determined that selected small INSS stage 1 or stage 2 adrenal masses, presumed to be neuroblastoma, detected in infants younger than 6 months by screening or incidental ultrasonography, may safely be observed without obtaining a definitive histological diagnosis and without surgical intervention. This technique avoids potential complications of surgery in newborn patients.[ Evidence (observation without biopsy): Controversy exists about the need to attempt resection, at the time of diagnosis or later, in asymptomatic infants aged 12 months or younger with apparent stage 2B and stage 3 MYCN-nonamplified and favorable-biology disease. In a German clinical trial, some of these patients were observed after biopsy or partial resection without chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Many patients did not progress locally and never underwent a first or additional resection.[ Chemotherapy with or without surgery Chemotherapy with or without surgery is used to treat the following: Evidence (for removal of chemotherapy): Treatment options under clinical evaluation Information about National Cancer Institute (NCI)-supported clinical trials can be found on the NCI website.

Intermediate-Risk Neuroblastoma According to the COG risk classification, intermediate risk includes the following: A subset of 4S patients were included and classified as intermediate risk if they had diploid tumor or unfavorable histology and no MYCN amplification. For more information about the COG risk categories, see Table 5. The COG-A3961 (NCT00003093) intermediate-risk study results,[ For more information about the classification schema for intermediate-risk neuroblastoma, see the International Neuroblastoma Risk Grouping (INRG) section. For more information about 4S and MS tumors, see the Treatment of INSS Stage 4S and INRG Stage MS Neuroblastoma section. Treatment options for intermediate-risk neuroblastoma Treatment options for intermediate-risk neuroblastoma include the following: Chemotherapy with or without surgery Patients categorized as intermediate risk have been successfully treated with complete surgical resection and two, four, or eight cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen consists of carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide. The cumulative dose of each agent is kept low to minimize long-term effects from the chemotherapy regimen (ANBL0531 [NCT00499616]). As a rule, patients whose tumors had unfavorable biology received eight cycles of chemotherapy, compared with either two or four cycles for patients whose tumors had favorable biology. In cases of abdominal neuroblastoma thought to involve a kidney, nephrectomy is not undertaken before a course of chemotherapy has been given.[ Whether initial chemotherapy is indicated for all intermediate-risk infants with localized neuroblastoma requires further study. Evidence (chemotherapy with or without surgery): Surgery and observation (in infants) The need for chemotherapy in all asymptomatic infants with stage 3 or stage 4 disease is controversial, as some European studies have shown favorable outcomes with surgery and observation.[ Evidence (surgery and observation in infants): Radiation therapy Radiation therapy for children with intermediate-risk disease is reserved for patients with progressive disease during treatment with chemotherapy or progressive unresectable disease after treatment with chemotherapy. In a prospective randomized COG trial that tested reduced-intensity chemotherapy for patients with intermediate-risk neuroblastoma, only 12 of 479 patients (2.5%) received local radiation therapy (21 Gy). One patient had stage 4S disease, five patients had stage 3 disease, and six patients had stage 4 disease. Radiation therapy was administered for clinical deterioration despite initial therapy (eight patients), residual macroscopic disease and unfavorable biological features (three patients), or relapse after therapy (one patient).[ Treatment options under clinical evaluation Information about National Cancer Institute (NCI)-supported clinical trials can be found on the NCI website.

References: Patients most at risk for disease progression and mortality are older than 18 months, have metastatic disease or localized disease with unfavorable biology such as MYCN amplification, or have unfavorable histology. For more information about the Children's Oncology Group (COG) risk categories, see Table 5. Approximately 8% to 10% of infants with stage MS disease have MYCN-amplified tumors and are usually treated using high-risk protocols. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 60% and 64%, respectively, for the infants with stage MS disease and MYCN amplification (n = 23), among the 5,000 patients enrolled in the COG ANBL00B1 (NCT00904241) trial.[ For children with high-risk neuroblastoma who received current treatments, the 5-year OS rate was about 60% for patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2017.[ A study from the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) database found 146 patients with distant metastases limited to lymph nodes, termed stage 4N, who tended to have favorable-biology disease and a good outcome (5-year OS rate, 85%). This finding suggests that for this special subgroup of high-risk, stage 4 patients, less-intensive therapy might be considered.[ Treatment Options for High-Risk Neuroblastoma Outcomes for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma remain poor despite recent improvements in survival in randomized trials. Treatment options for high-risk neuroblastoma typically include the following: Chemotherapy, surgery, tandem cycles of myeloablative therapy and SCT, radiation therapy, and dinutuximab with GM-CSF and isotretinoin Treatment for patients with high-risk disease is generally divided into the following three phases: Induction phase The backbone of the most commonly used induction therapy includes dose-intensive cycles of cisplatin and etoposide alternating with vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin.[ Evidence (induction chemotherapy with or without additional treatments): After a response to induction chemotherapy, resection of the primary tumor is usually attempted. Whether a gross-total resection is beneficial either before or after induction chemotherapy is controversial.[ Evidence (resection of the primary tumor before or after chemotherapy): The potential benefit of aggressive surgical approaches in high-risk patients with metastatic disease to achieve complete tumor resection, either at the time of diagnosis or after chemotherapy, has not been unequivocally demonstrated. Several studies have reported that complete resection of the primary tumor at diagnosis improved survival. However, the outcome in these patients may be more dependent on the biology of the tumor, which itself may determine resectability, than on the extent of surgical resection.[ In stage 4 patients older than 18 months, controversy exists about whether there is any advantage to gross-total resection of the primary tumor after chemotherapy.[ At the end of induction therapy, patients with high-risk disease typically undergo a full disease evaluation. Management of patients with residual disease at the end of conventional induction therapy is not standardized. A retrospective study analyzed 201 patients with high-risk disease who had a partial response or less at the end of induction therapy. Patients were selected to immediately receive either high-dose chemotherapy (cohort 1), bridging therapy (usually chemoimmunotherapy of 131 I-MIBG) followed by high-dose chemotherapy (cohort 2), or additional therapy but not high-dose chemotherapy (cohort 3).[ These retrospective data suggest a role for bridging therapy in patients with incomplete response to conventional induction therapy. Consolidation phase The consolidation phase of high-risk regimens involves myeloablative chemotherapy and SCT, which attempts to eradicate minimal residual disease (MRD) using otherwise lethal doses of ablative chemotherapy rescued by autologous stem cells (collected during induction chemotherapy) to repopulate the bone marrow. Several large randomized controlled studies have shown an improvement in 3-year EFS rates for treatment with SCT (31%-47%) versus conventional chemotherapy (22%-31%).[ Evidence (myeloablative chemotherapy and stem cell rescue): For more information about transplantation, see Pediatric Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Pediatric Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy for Cancer. Radiation to the primary tumor site (whether or not a complete excision was obtained) is indicated after myeloablative therapy.[ Evidence (radiation therapy with a boost vs. radiation therapy without a boost for incomplete resection): Extensive lymph node irradiation, regardless of the extent of surgical resection preceding SCT, did not benefit patients for local progression or OS.[ Treatment of bony metastatic disease, delivered at the time of primary tumor bed irradiation, is also considered to maximize disease control. Radiation therapy to metastatic disease sites is determined on an individual basis or according to protocol guidelines for patients enrolled in studies. Many children present with widespread bony metastases. Because it is not feasible to irradiate all initial sites, the current practice is to treat the sites that have not responded, as assessed by MIBG before SCT.[ In a retrospective series of 159 children with high-risk stage M neuroblastoma, focal irradiation was delivered to all metastatic sites, regardless of response to chemotherapy, unless metastases were too numerous.[ These observations support the current paradigm of irradiating metastases that persist by MIBG uptake after induction chemotherapy in high-risk patients. Irradiation of more than 50% of the bone marrow is not advised.[ In cases where diffuse bone metastases remain after induction chemotherapy, high-dose chemotherapy is followed by reassessment before deciding on consolidative radiation therapy. Preliminary outcomes of proton radiation therapy to treat patients with high-risk neuroblastoma primary tumors have been published, demonstrating acceptable efficacy and toxicity.[ Postconsolidation phase Postconsolidation therapy is designed to treat potential MRD after SCT.[ Evidence (all treatments): On the basis of the SIOPEN data, the COG removed IL-2 from standard postconsolidation immunotherapy. In a separate prospective, randomized study, there was no advantage to purging harvested stem cells of neuroblastoma cells before transplantation.[ Radioactive MIBG therapy has been used to treat recurrent neuroblastoma with some success. This therapy has been shown to be safe and feasible to incorporate into the treatment regimen for newly diagnosed children with high-risk neuroblastoma.[ A multi-institution, phase II clinical trial of children with high-risk neuroblastoma explored maintenance therapy using difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor.[ Treatment Options Under Clinical Evaluation Information about National Cancer Institute (NCI)-supported clinical trials can be found on the NCI website. For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the ClinicalTrials.gov website. The following is an example of a national and/or institutional clinical trial that is currently being conducted: Patients with the ALK gene mutation or ALK amplification will receive nonrandomized COG standard induction chemotherapy with the ALK inhibitor crizotinib added, followed by further therapy on the standard COG treatment plan. Patients with MIBG nonavid, ALK nonaberrant tumors will receive standard current chemotherapy as in arm A above. The classification for the ANBL1531 trial is based on the INRG staging system. Boost radiation was discontinued in this trial because no clear benefit over historical controls was apparent.

References: International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) stage 4S patients are younger than 12 months and have an INSS stage 1 or stage 2 primary tumor. International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) stage MS patients are younger than 18 months with any stage of primary tumor. Both staging systems have the same definition of limited pattern of metastases. The decision by the INRG Task Force to replace the category of 4S disease with that of the new MS definition was based on reports in which small numbers of infants with L2 primary tumors and 4S metastatic patterns, including patients aged 12 to 18 months, had favorable outcomes.[ Infants with INRG stage MS disease have more favorable biology and superior outcomes despite receiving less aggressive therapy. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 86%, and the overall survival (OS) rate was 95%. For patients with MYCN-amplified tumors, the 5-year EFS rate was 60%, and the OS rate was 65%.[ Many patients with stage 4S/MS neuroblastoma do not require therapy. However, tumors with unfavorable biology or patients who are symptomatic because of evolving hepatomegaly and organ compromise are at increased risk of death and are treated with low-dose to moderate-dose chemotherapy. Eight percent to 10% of these patients will have MYCN amplification and are treated with high-risk treatment regimens.[ For more information about the Children's Oncology Group (COG) classification schema for stage 4S/MS neuroblastoma, see Table 5. Treatment Options for Stage 4S/MS Neuroblastoma There is no standard approach for the treatment of stage 4S/MS neuroblastoma. Treatment options for stage 4S/MS neuroblastoma include the following: Resection of the primary tumor is not associated with improved outcome.[ Observation with supportive care Observation with supportive care is used to treat asymptomatic patients with favorable tumor biology. The treatment of children with stage 4S/MS disease depends on clinical presentation.[ Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is used to treat symptomatic patients or patients with unfavorable biology. Patients with evidence of rapid tumor growth in the first several weeks of life require immediate intervention with chemotherapy to avoid potentially irreversible abdominal compartment syndrome and hepatic and/or renal failure.[ Infants diagnosed with INSS stage 4S/MS neuroblastoma, particularly those with hepatomegaly or those younger than 2 months with high-risk features or hepatomegaly, have the potential for rapid clinical deterioration and may benefit from early initiation of therapy.[ A scoring system to measure signs and symptoms of deterioration or compromise was developed to better assess this group of stage 4S patients.[ Various chemotherapy regimens (cyclophosphamide alone, carboplatin/etoposide, cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine) have been used to treat symptomatic patients. The approach is to administer the chemotherapy only as long as symptoms persist to avoid toxicity, which contributes to poorer survival. Additionally, lower doses of chemotherapy are often recommended for very young or low-weight infants, along with granulocyte colony-stimulating factors after each cycle of chemotherapy. Evidence (chemotherapy for 4S/MS disease): Emergent surgical abdominal decompression can be used to avoid respiratory deterioration and improve ventilation.[ Previously, chemotherapy toxicity was thought to be responsible for the poorer survival of patients with stage 4S disease; however, the use of chemotherapy on the COG-P9641 trial was restricted to specific clinical situations with a recommended number of cycles. The chemotherapy for patients with high symptom scores included two to four 3-day courses of carboplatin and etoposide. If symptoms persisted or progressive disease developed, up to four 5-day courses of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine were administered. One-half of the patients underwent complete or partial resection of the primary tumor. Radiation therapy (for patients with symptoms related to hepatomegaly from metastatic disease) In rare cases of marked hepatomegaly in symptomatic MS (4S) infants with neuroblastoma who were unresponsive to chemotherapy, very low-dose radiation therapy has been used. In a series of 41 symptomatic infants with MS disease, radiation therapy was administered to five infants, three of whom died.[ Treatment Options Under Clinical Evaluation Information about National Cancer Institute (NCI)-supported clinical trials can be found on the NCI website.

The following is an example of a national and/or institutional clinical trial that is currently being conducted: Patients with INRG MS tumors that have unfavorable histology or unfavorable genomic features with or without symptoms are treated according to a response-based algorithm to determine length of treatment. For INRG MS patients under observation without chemotherapy, an objective scoring system is used to monitor them for clinical changes and initiate therapy. For patients with complete resolution of symptoms and at least a 50% reduction in primary tumor volume (partial response), chemotherapy is discontinued, and observation continues for 3 years after completion of therapy. If the disease progresses, the patient leaves this study. Current Clinical Trials Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients.

Consequently, serial sampling of progressive tumors may lead to the identification of potentially actionable mutations.[ If neuroblastoma recurs in a child originally diagnosed with high-risk disease, the prognosis is usually poor despite additional intensive therapy.[ Prognostic Factors for Recurrent Neuroblastoma A comprehensive analysis of the patterns of relapse was conducted using the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) database on patients diagnosed/enrolled between 1989 and 2017.[ The INRG database was used to examine clinical and biological features that are prognostic of survival after relapse or progression of INRG Staging System (INRGSS) stage MS pattern neuroblastoma. Of the 1,511 patients diagnosed between 1984 and 2021 who met the eligibility criteria, 209 patients were identified as having an event. Eligibility criteria included patients younger than 365 days at initial diagnosis with INRGSS stage MS disease or with INSS stage 4S, or patients aged 365 to 546 days with INSS stage 4 disease and metastasis limited to the liver, skin, and/or bone marrow.[ The International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Project performed a survival-tree analysis of clinical and biological characteristics (defined at diagnosis) associated with survival after relapse in 2,266 patients with neuroblastoma entered in large clinical trials in well-established clinical trials groups around the world.[ Significant prognostic factors determined at diagnosis for postrelapse survival include the following:[ The Children's Oncology Group (COG) experience with recurrence in patients with low-risk and intermediate-risk neuroblastoma showed that most patients can be salvaged. The COG reported a 3-year event free survival (EFS) rate of 88% and an OS rate of 96% in intermediate-risk patients and a 5-year EFS rate of 89% and OS rate of 97% in low-risk patients.[ The OS after recurrence in children presenting with high-risk neuroblastoma is generally extremely poor. However, such patients at first relapse after complete remission or minimal residual disease (MRD) in whom relapse was a single site of soft tissue mass (a few children also had bone marrow or bone disease at relapse) had a 5-year OS rate of 35% in one single-institution study. All patients underwent surgical resection of the soft tissue disease. MYCN amplification and multifocal soft tissue disease were associated with a worse postprogression survival.[ Table 9 summarizes the treatment options for |Locoregional recurrence in patients initially classified as low risk||Surgery followed by observation or chemotherapy.| |Chemotherapy that may be followed by surgery.| |Metastatic recurrence in patients initially classified as low risk||Observation(if metastatic disease is in a 4S pattern in an infant).| |Chemotherapy.| |Surgery followed by chemotherapy.| |Locoregional recurrence in classified as intermediate |Surgery (incomplete resection) followed by chemotherapy.| |Radiation therapy(only with disease progression after chemotherapy and second-look surgery).| |Metastatic recurrence in patients initially classified as intermediate risk||High-risk therapy.| |Recurrence in patients initially classified as high risk||Chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy.| |131I-MIBG alone, in combination with other therapy, or followed by stem cell rescue.| |Novel therapies, including ALK inhibitors for those patients with ALK mutations.| |Chemotherapy.| |Immunotherapy.| |Recurrence in the central nervous system||Surgery and radiation therapy.| |Chemotherapy in combination with surgery and radiation therapy.| |Novel therapeutic approaches.| Recurrent Neuroblastoma in Patients Initially Classified as Low Risk Locoregional recurrence Treatment options for locoregional recurrent neuroblastoma initially classified as low risk include the following: Local or regional recurrent cancer is resected if possible. Patients with favorable biology and regional recurrence more than 3 months after completion of planned treatment are observed if resection of the recurrence is total or near total (90% resection). Those with favorable biology and a less-than-near-total resection are treated with chemotherapy.[ Infants younger than 1 year at the time of locoregional recurrence whose tumors have any unfavorable biological properties are observed if resection is total or near total. If the resection is less than near total, these infants are treated with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy may consist of moderate doses of carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide, or cyclophosphamide and topotecan. The cumulative dose of each agent is kept low to minimize long-term effects, as used in previous COG trials (COG-P9641 and COG-A3961).[ Evidence (surgery followed by observation or chemotherapy): Metastatic recurrence or disease refractory to standard treatment Treatment options for metastatic recurrent neuroblastoma initially classified as low risk include the following: Metastatic recurrent or progressive neuroblastoma in an infant initially categorized as low risk and younger than 1 year at recurrence may be treated according to tumor biology, as defined in the previous COG trials (COG-P9641 and COG-A3961): Chemotherapy may consist of moderate doses of carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide. The cumulative dose of each agent is kept low to minimize long-term effects, as used in previous COG trials (COG-P9641 and COG-A3961). Any child initially categorized as low risk who is older than 1 year at the time of metastatic recurrent or progressive disease and whose recurrence is not in the stage 4S pattern usually has a poor prognosis and is treated as follows: Patients with metastatic recurrent neuroblastoma are treated like patients with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma. For more information, see the Treatment Options for High-Risk Neuroblastoma section. Recurrent Neuroblastoma in Patients Initially Classified as Intermediate Risk The COG ANBL0531 (NCT00499616) study treated patients with newly diagnosed intermediate-risk neuroblastoma with chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin. Retrieval therapy was included in the protocol for patients who developed progressive nonmetastatic disease within 3 years of study enrollment. Up to six cycles of cyclophosphamide and topotecan could be given to patients. Of 29 patients who received cyclophosphamide and topotecan, 18 remained event free, 9 experienced relapse, and 2 died. Twenty patients who experienced an inadequate initial response to eight cycles of chemotherapy were treated with cyclophosphamide and topotecan. Of those 20 patients, 9 patients achieved a very good partial response or better; however, 6 patients developed progressive disease or experienced relapse, and 1 patient died. This suggests that more aggressive therapy is needed for patients who do not achieve the defined treatment end point after eight cycles of chemotherapy.[ The previous COG study for intermediate-risk neuroblastoma (COG-A3961) enrolled 479 patients, 42 of whom developed disease progression. The recurrence rate was 10% for those with favorable biology and 17% for those with unfavorable biology. Thirty patients had locoregional recurrences, 11 had metastatic recurrences, and 1 had both types of recurrent disease. Six of the 42 patients died of disease, while 36 patients responded to therapy. Thus, most patients with intermediate-risk neuroblastoma and disease progression may be salvaged.[ Locoregional recurrence Treatment options for locoregional recurrent neuroblastoma initially classified as intermediate risk include the following: Locoregional recurrence of neuroblastoma with favorable biology that occurs more than 3 months after completion of chemotherapy may be treated surgically. If resection is less than near total, then additional chemotherapy may be given. Chemotherapy should be selected on the basis of previous chemotherapy received.[ Metastatic recurrence Treatment options for metastatic recurrent neuroblastoma initially classified as intermediate risk include the following: Patients with metastatic recurrent neuroblastoma are treated like patients with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma. For more information, see the Treatment Options for High-Risk Neuroblastoma section. Recurrent Neuroblastoma in Patients Initially Classified as High Risk Any recurrence in patients initially classified as high risk signifies a very poor prognosis.[ An analysis of several trials included 383 patients with neuroblastoma whose tumor recurred or progressed in COG modern-era, early-phase trials. The 1-year survival (PFS) and the 4-year PFS rate was 6%. The OS rates were 57% at 1 year and 20% at 4 years. Less than 10% of patients experienced no subsequent recurrence or progression. MYCN amplification predicted worse PFS and OS rates.[ Treatment options for recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma in patients initially classified as high risk include the following: Chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy produces the best response rate and response duration of treatments for high-risk patients with disease progression. Evidence (chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy): Evidence (131I-MIBG alone or in combination with other therapies): Evidence (chemotherapy): Allogeneic transplant has a historically low success rate in recurrent or progressive neuroblastoma. In a retrospective registry study, allogeneic SCT after a previous autologous SCT appeared to offer no benefit. Disease recurrence remains the most common cause of treatment failure.[ Clinical trials of novel therapeutic approaches, such as a vaccine designed to induce host antiganglioside antibodies that can replicate the antineoplastic activities of intravenously administered monoclonal antibodies, are currently under investigation. Patients also receive a beta-glucan treatment, which has a broad range of immunostimulatory effects and synergizes with anti-GD2/GD3 monoclonal antibodies. In a phase I study of 15 children with high-risk neuroblastoma, the therapy was tolerated without any dose-limiting toxicity.[ Recurrent Neuroblastoma in the Central Nervous System Central nervous system (CNS) involvement, although rare at initial presentation, may occur in 3% to 10% of patients with recurrent neuroblastoma. CNS relapses represented 6% of all metastatic relapses in a series of 1,161 first relapses in 1,977 stage 4 patients treated in a trial of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.[ Significant risk factors for CNS relapse identified in the International Society of Paediatric Oncology Europe Neuroblastoma (SIOPEN) trial were patient and disease features at diagnosis. These features included female sex (hazard ratio [HR], 2.0; P = .016), MYCN amplification (HR, 2.4; P = .0008), hepatic disease (HR, 2.5; P = .01), or more than one metastatic system/compartment involvement (HR, 7.1; P = .047). Neither high-dose chemotherapy nor immunotherapy was associated with higher risk of recurrence. Investigators noted stable incidence of CNS relapse reported over time.[ CNS relapses are almost always fatal, with a median time to death of 6 months. The 1-year and 3-year postrelapse OS rates were 25% and 7%, respectively, in the SIOPEN trial.[ Treatment options for recurrent neuroblastoma in the CNS include the following: Current treatment approaches generally include eradicating bulky and microscopic residual disease in the CNS and minimal residual systemic disease that may herald further relapses. Neurosurgical interventions serve to decrease edema, control hemorrhage, and remove bulky tumor before starting therapy. A single institution had some success while testing intraventricular compartmental radioimmunotherapy using intrathecal radioiodinated Gy or 21 Gy of craniospinal irradiation with boosts to gross CNS disease, in patients with recurrent metastatic CNS neuroblastoma.[ For patients who experience prolonged survival after an initial CNS relapse, some may develop a second relapse after cranial spinal irradiation (CSI). Published data for patients who experience a second CNS relapse are limited. A second CNS relapse portends a poor prognosis.[ In a single-institution study that included 128 patients treated with CSI for first CNS relapse, 40 developed a second CNS relapse at a median of 6.3 months from the initial CSI treatment. Patient outcomes after second CNS relapse are poor, although treatment with radiation therapy at the time of second CNS relapse may be associated with longer OS.[ Treatment Options Under Clinical Evaluation for Recurrent or Refractory Neuroblastoma Information about National Cancer Institute (NCI)-supported clinical trials can be found on the NCI website.

Genomic and Biological Features of Neuroblastoma Added text to state that given the widespread metastatic nature of high-risk and relapsed neuroblastoma, use of circulating tumor DNA technologies may reveal additional genomic alterations not found in conventional tumor biopsies. Moreover, these approaches have demonstrated the ability to detect resistant mutations in patients with neuroblastoma who were treated with ALK inhibitors (cited Bosse et al. as reference 35 and level of evidence C1). Treatment of High-Risk Neuroblastoma Added text to state that at the end of induction therapy, patients with high-risk disease typically undergo a full disease evaluation. Management of patients with residual disease at the end of conventional induction therapy is not standardized. Also added text about the results of a retrospective study that analyzed 201 patients with high-risk disease who had a partial response or less at the end of induction therapy (cited Desai et al. as reference 21). Added text to state that the retrospective data suggest a role for bridging therapy in patients with incomplete response to conventional induction therapy. Treatment of Recurrent Neuroblastoma Added text to state that the response rates were 32% for patients who received topotecan and cyclophosphamide and 19% for patients who received topotecan alone. Also revised text to state that high-dose carboplatin, irinotecan, and/or temozolomide has been used to treat patients with refractory disease or new relapses occurring off therapy. However, this regimen is not used to treat patients whose disease progresses while on therapy.
