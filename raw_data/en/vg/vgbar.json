Meditation is a powerful tool for wellbeing, and is essentially a process to take one beyond the limitations of body and mind. Practitioners of these \"inner technologies\" have also experienced the many physical and mental benefits of meditation and yoga. In recent years, a growing number of scientific studies and research on meditation have corroborated these experiences. The Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya is offered in various formats and is available for those who have previously completed Inner Engineering Online. This experiential step allows one to deepen the process imparted in the online course, providing daily support for one's continued growth. One can also learn this kriya during the Inner Engineering Total programs. The word \"kriya\" refers to a yogic internal energy technique incorporating the breath. Millions of dedicated practitioners of all ages and walks of life experience greater emotional balance, concentration, focus, stability and better health with regular practice of this daily 21-minute meditation. In fact, there have been several scientific studies that measure the various benefits of practicing the kriya regularly - both with regard to brain activity during the kriya, as well as statistical research of how it affects people's health and well-being. How does the Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya Work? The reason why most people are unhappy or unhealthy is that the physical, the mental and the \"pranic\", or energy body are not in alignment. The Shambhavi Mahasmudra Kriya is a method of bringing your entire system into alignment so that your mind, body, emotions and energy function in complete harmony, establishing a chemistry of blissfulness within you. Sadhguru explains, \"There is a certain way to engineer our system, to make this body, to make this mind... the very chemistry within us the way we want it.\" Traditionally, yoga sees the human being as five layers of body: the physical body, the mental body, the pranic energy body, the etheric body and the bliss body. The reason why most people are unhappy or unhealthy is that the physical, the mental and the 'pranic' body are not in alignment. If they are properly aligned, a natural expression, an overwhelming expression of joyfulness will naturally happen within a human being. Now, we are looking at the technology of keeping these three bodies constantly aligned so that joyfulness is not an accidental happening; joyfulness becomes a normal condition, a natural way of living for you.\" Health Benefits Practitioners of Shambhavi Mahamudra experience a drop in stress and anxiety, a boost in mental alertness and focus, and an increase in self-awareness. It is also clear that regular practice benefits cardiac health and either leads to a stop in the use of medication or at least reduces it considerably for a range of ailments including hypertension, depression and menstrual issues. Research studies on Shambhavi Mahamudra have been varied: some have examined its impact on disease status and medicine usage, some have looked specifically at menstrual disorders, while others have studied the benefits of this meditation on sleep, heart rate variability, brain activity, etc. Other studies have researched general well-being and improved attention spans among regular meditators. See the amazing results for these studies here. In addition to relief from physical ailments, practitioners also experience mental and emotional benefits which greatly enhance their overall quality of life. In a questionnaire asking about improvements in life experienced from practicing the Shambhavi Mahamudra, 536 respondents indicated how the kriya had helped reduce medication and eliminate problems such as depression as well as a variety of ailments. 91% reported greater inner peace, 87% reported improved emotional balance, 80% experienced greater mental clarity, 79% experienced increased energy levels, 74% reported improved self confidence and 70% reported better concentration and higher productivity.
