DAAR* I. INTRODUCTION Advances in reproductive medicine are notorious for yielding previously unthinkable methods of enhancing hu man procreation, alongside equally unanticipated ethical and social dilemmas. The introduction of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD ) produced such dual consequences and continues to challenge tradition al notions of health and medical decision-making. PGD is a medical technique originally developed in England in the late 1980s as a method of detecting single-gene disorders in unimplanted three-day old embryos.1 The basic PGD procedure involves the creation of embryos via in vitro fertilization (IVF), followed by the extraction via biopsy of a single cell, known as a blastomere, from the three- day old, eight-celled embryo.2 Because each blastomere is totipotent in the early embryo\u2014meaning it has \"all po tential\" and can develop into a separate, wholly intact new embryo\u2014s tudying this single cell reveals the genetic make-up of the embryo from which it was taken.3 PGD can detect * Associate Dean for Academic Affa irs, Professor of Law, and Harry S.

PGD's initial usage was limited to pr ospective parents anxious to birth a child unaffected by a genetic disorder that had plagued the family's lineage for generations.5 Inevitably, interest in surv eying the genetic make-up of early embryos grew to encompass clinic al scenarios likely not contemplated by the technique's originators.6 In addition to screening to discover the genetic health of the conceptus, today ART physicians can use PGD to screen embryos so that, if later born alive, the resulting children's blood, organs, or tissues can be used to su pport the health of another person, often a whole blood sibling.7 A n e v e n m o r e r e c e n t u s e o f P G D i s t h e selection of embryos based on paren tal preferences for offspring whose sensory or mobility capabilities reflect that of their genetic parent or the embryo are removed, fixed on a slide and analyzed by molecular biology testing.

PGD is used to detect two types of genetic anomalies: (1) inherited chromosomal abnormalities in which a gene or portion of a gene contains a mutation, causing such disorders as Tay-Sachs disease, Duchene muscul ar (non-inherited) aneuploidy, in which the genome contains either too few or too many chromosome in one or more of the 23 pairs. See HUANG , supra note 2 (discussing aneuploidy and inherited genetic disorders). Some of the more well-known disorders associated with aneuploidy include Do wn syndrome (also known as \"Trisomy 21,\" or three chromosomes in 21st pair), Edwards syndro me (Trisomy 18), Pata u syndrome (Trisomy 13) and Klinefelter syndrome (XXY, having an extra \"X\" sex chromosome).

Chicago resident Chad Kingsbury suffered the loss of hi s mother, maternal grandfather, and two maternal uncles from an inherited form of colon cancer.9 As a carrier of the genetic mutation associated with fa milial susceptibility to the adult-onset disease, Chad was terrified that his chil dren would inherit his predisposition to colon cancer.10 For the Kingsburys, PGD \"offered them a way to reload the genetic dice.\"11 The couple joined a growing pool of prospective parents with heritable cancer-susceptibility genes who turned to ART to assure the birth of a child free of the family genetic mutation.12 In addition to colon cancer susceptibility, PGD ca n now be used to screen for other genetically-based adult-onset diseases including Huntington's disease, Alzheimer disease, and breast cancer.13 While the Kingsburys took months to make the decision to use PGD, the result was a child free of the colon cancer gene. 14 While talking to reporters about his child's conception, Chad Kinsbury gazed at daughter Chloe and remarked, \"I couldn't imagine them telling me my daughter has cancer . . . when I could have stopped it.\" 15 Vignette 2: Using PGD for the Health of Another Person. By 1999, Lisa and Jack Nash's five-year old daugh ter Molly was nearing death from Fanconi's anemia, an inherited genetic disorder that leads to bone marrow failure and early forms of cancer.16 Her only hope for recovery was a compatible stem cell donor, but exhaustive searches within her family and her community failed to produce a suitable donor. 17 The Nashes consulted Yuri Verlinsky, director of the Reprod uctive Genetics Institute in Chicago, 8.

Long-time partners Sharon Duchesneau and Candace McCullough wanted a child that resembled them in one important way.22 The couple was deaf, and their idea of the perfect child was one who could move in and appreciate the deaf culture that was defining for the prospective parents. 23 The women inquired of the local sperm bank, only to learn that deafness is a disqualifying trait for sperm donors; th us no suitable sperm was available in the marketplace.24 Determined to maximize the chances their child would be deaf, they turned to a deaf friend who agreed to serve as a sperm donor.25 Six years later, the couple were parents to a daughter and a son, both deaf.26 Though Sharon and Candace's journey to parenthood did not involve the use of PGD (which can de tect genetic deafness), their story prompted researchers to ask whether ph ysicians would be willing to provide the technique to cull embryos for certain genetic anomalies.27 A survey published in 2006 indicates that at leas t a few IVF centers have assisted in selecting for a \"disability\" such as deafness or dwarfism.28 18. at 9N; Acevedo, supra note 17; Scott Gottlieb, Scientists Screen Embryo for Genetic Predisposition to Cancer , 322 B RIT.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2008] EMBRYONIC GENETICS 85 The availability and use of PGD layers a social choice atop a medical decision. Parents who choose to impl ant only those embryos that offer compatible tissue for an ailing child si multaneously make the decision to discard or defer development of otherwise healthy embryos because they lack utility for an immediate purpose. Parents whose family trees are dotted with relatives devastated by certain genetically-based diseases must decide in the earliest moments of conception whether to eliminate embryos that bear the mutation, or entrust the health of their offspring to the uncertainty of future medical advances. Parents with sensory or other deficits who desire a similarly-abled child may discard genetically healthy embryos in pursuit of their vision of the perfect ch ild. Each of these scenarios calls into question traditional notions of health, disability and reproductive choice. Part II of this article chronicles the use of PGD and other reproductive technologies from their inception to current practices, observing that each advance has produced some unintended consequence. The ability to mesh human gametes in the laboratory, form embryos, freeze embryos for later use, and cull embryonic cells for their ri ch genetic story has been essential to family formation. Yet these advance s have simultaneously introduced conflicts and harms that were unimagin able in a pre-ART world. Part II briefly surveys a few of the inadvertent consequences wrought by a staple in the ART arsenal\u2014IVF. Examples includ e genetic parenthood after divorce, after death, and even after learning that one's embryos were mistakenly transferred to another patient with an overlapping clinic appointment. The law can and has responded to these sc enarios with familiar tools borrowed f r o m f a m i l y l a w , t o r t l a w , c o n t r a c t l a w , a n d o t h e r s o u r c e s . P G D , a s t h e newest reproductive technology, can draw upon some of the same disciplines when mishaps occur, but the unintended consequences of embryonic genetics are more subt le and arguably more globally problematic. Part III of this article surveys the use of PGD as described in Vignette 1\u2014 to assess embryonic health as a mean s of birthing a child free of known genetic anomalies. 29 At least three conundrums emerge when parents 29. Vignettes 2 and 3, using PGD for the health of another, and for the preferences of the parents, are not treated in depth herein, th ough each scenario has generated robust discussion in the legal literature.

First, there is what I'll call \"the spectrum problem.\" PGD can detect whether the offspring will be likely or even certain to express symptoms of the identified condition, but it often cannot determin e the severity of such manifestation. 30 Moreover, as we increasingly recognize the genetic basis of human health, we are able to detect propensity for di seases that will not manifest until the fourth or fifth decade of life. Dist inguishing between childhood and adult- onset diseases, as well as between seve re, mild, and benign conditions, is both morally and medically difficult in the context of adjusting access to genetic technologies. This essay offers an assessment tool, in the form of a multi-factorial questionnaire with assi gned point values for each response, as one response to the spectrum proble m. Fixing values, even crudely, to factors such as severity of symptoms an d timing of disease onset, may aid in understanding the proper uses of PGD to maximize embryo health. A second conundrum evoked by PGD is its shifting of responsibility for h e a l t h f r o m p e r s o n t o p a r e n t . P a r t I I I d e s c r i b e s \" t h e s h i f t i n g p r o b l e m , \" noting that PGD may also shift the way we view health in the future. A parent's ability to spare a child from a disease for which the parent has a genetic susceptibility means that parent and child may act very differently in their health-related decisions. While the parent may make lifestyle choices to reduce the risk of disease onset, in cluding the use of therapeutics or even prophylactic surgeries, the child will be medically unburdened, possibly unprepared to accept anything less than perfect health that could come in the form of sporadic disease or trauma tic injury. Additionally, as control over health shifts from person to parent, those prospective parents who access reproductive technologies (and even those who do not) may come under increasing pressure to use PGD to avoid even mild anomalies. This pressure to utilize genetic technologies to avoid all genetic anomalies\u2014 herein labeled \"the expectation problem\"\u2014represents the third conundrum in the trilogy. Part III discusses th e expectation interests that genetic technologies raise, focusing on the ex pectations of prospective parents and the society into which their children are born.

The goal of this article is to examine the motivations, expectations, and cons equences that can accompany a decision to use PGD for the health of the embryo. It is my hope that these foundational observations will inform future discussions about other PGD uses. 30.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2008] EMBRYONIC GENETICS 87 Advances in reproductive medicine can evoke the myth of Sisyphus pushing his stone up a mountain only to see it roll back as he nears the summit.31 In a crude sense, today's version of the myth pits reproductive scientists, who toil to advance the technology surrounding assisted conception, against observers who sometimes push back against advances that alter the traditional course of reproduction. The introduction and subsequent refinement of PGD display these push-pull qualities, producing stunning achievements in reproductive medicine, while instilling enormous unease over our newfound ability to manipulate the human genome. What follows are arguments for pushing the nascent science of reprogenic medicine up the mountain, and counterarguments for letting it roll right back down. In my view, at the end of the day, unlike Sisyphus, PGD will make sustainable and essential pr ogress in advancing human health. II. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN ART Breakthroughs in the nascent field of reproductive medicine have yielded a host of unintended consequences. Since the introduction of IVF in 1978,32 the technique is credited with the birth of over three million children worldwide.33 Combined with other ARTs such as artificial insemination by donor, oocyte donation, and surrogate parenting arrangement, IVF gives prospective parents increasing choice and control over their reproductive futures. The successful integration of ART into modern society is evident by the numbers alone: today, three out of every one hundred children in the U.S. are born as a result of some form of assisted conception.34 Moreover, 31.

Louise was conceived using IVF, a medical technique in which the egg and sperm are introduced under the glare of a laboratory petri dish, inst ead of in the dark quie t recesses of a woman's fallopian tube.

According to an annual report publis hed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2005 (the most recent year for which figures are available) there were 52,041 children born in the U.S. who were conceived using some form of assisted reproductive technology (ART), as defined by the CDC to include only those techniques in which both the egg and the sperm are handled.

In addition to IVF births, it is estimated that 60,000 children are born annually via artificial insemination by donor (AID), a technique in which only the sperm is handled (a nd thus births by AID are not included in the annual CDC report). See Inst. for Sci., Law & Tech. Working Group, ART into Science: Regulation of Fertility Techniques , 281 S CIENCE 651 (1998).

See Michele Goodwin, Assisted Reproductive Technolo gy and the Double Bind: The Illusory Choice of Motherhood , 9 J. GENDER RACE & JUST. 1, 5, 46-49 (2005). Professor Goodwin argues that access to ART creates a \"double bind\" for women in the workplace, especially professional women whose superiors place subtle pressure on younger women to defer childbearing to increase th eir chances of \"fair\" opportunitie s at law firms, businesses, or university posts. ART is seen as a technologi cal bail out for women who put off childbearing, thus encouraging continued participation in the workplace. Pregnancy and motherhood discrimination, Professor Goodwin argues, are soft but real discrimination that create \"double binds\" for women who believe they must choose between career and early motherhood.

The well-publicized use of IVF and gestational surrogacy by celebrities, as well as incorporation of ART into movie and television plots has contributed to its role in popular culture.

ART's unintended consequences are best viewed from the perspective of its two major purposes\u2014to treat infertility and to promote the health of offspring. Infertility treatment is based on a model in which gametes are extracted from the body and melded into embryos, many of which are frozen for later use.38 The presence of gametes and embryos outside the body, subject to human manipulation, invites scenarios that are only possible in an ART world. In one New York fertility clinic, a white patient became pregnant with twin boys, one white and one blac k, because a laboratory technician mixed-up two couples' embryos on the day of transfer.39 The white couple's \"successful\" use of ART inadvertently wrought tremendous pain and suffering to the black couple whose embryo was negligently misdirected. After a two- year legal battle, the black child was ordered returned to his genetic parents, but the debacle caused irreparable harm to both sets of parents.40 This case and others like it disaggreg ate the roles of race, genetics, and gestation in determining parenthood, three factors that had heretofore vested in a single individual. The freezing of sperm, eggs, and embryos can also produced unintended results. When a happily married couple undergoes IVF and freezes excess embryos for future use, they likely do not intend to later divorce and squabble bitterly over the di sposition of those embryos, but such cases abound.41 When a couple agrees to freeze embryos, neither party anticipates that the embryos will be released to the other without mutual consent, but at least several children have been born after their mothers forged their (non-consenting) fathers' name on the authorizing documentation. 42 Equally unexpected are decisions about the fate of 2008.

When researchers at the University of Wisconsin announced in the fall of 1998 they had succeeded in isolating and cultivating stem cells from human embryos, ART suddenly developed a second identity as a potential for medical cures.45 The Wisconsin stem cell lines were developed from embryos donated by couples who had previously undergone IVF for reproductive purposes. 46 Seeing ART through the fresh lens of stem cell research focused attention on question s that were part of the backdrop of assisted conception, but had largely esc aped the scrutiny that this type of research unleashed. Questions about the moral wisdom and legal authority surrounding the intentional destruction of embryos for research purposes, as well as the consent necessary to utilize gametes and embryos in medical experiments, moved front and center in the minds of stakeholders and observers alike. 47 Stem cell research brought public attention to the possible medical benefits of ART apart from treating infertility, thus broadening the impact of advances in reproductive medicine from personal and procreative to global 43.

THE USE OF PGD TO ASSURE OFFSPRING HEALTH The array of genetic disorders and characteristics that PGD can detect grows with each passing year. Currently, PGD is performed for approximately one hundred genetic conditions, each carrying a unique profile in terms of severity of impact on overall health and onset of somatic symptoms. 53 Some of the detected conditions are fatal in the first years of life, such as Tay-Sachs disease; others pose serious health risks and often cause death in early adulthood, such as cystic fibrosis and Huntington's disease; still others are associated with an increased predisposition to adult- onset diseases such as colon and breast cancer.54 The ability to access this vast array of genetic information, only so me of which is reliably predictive of disease, enables prospective parents to decide what is, and is not, an acceptable level of health for their future children. This power to orchestrate offspring heal th, however, is rife with problems of imprecision. Just as geneticists are unable to predict the severity of certain conditions, parents are likewis e unable to predict the impact these health choices will have on their offspring, on themselves, and on society at large. What follows is an effort to isolate, describe, and analyze the 48.

For ease of reference, I categorize the variables into three areas which I'll label \"the spectrum problem,\" \"the shifting prob lem,\" and \"the expectation problem.\" A. The Spectrum Problem If medicine is an art, then medical genetics may be best described as abstract expressionism for its break from the traditions of the past in a manner that can be jarring and incomprehensible. But as any fan of Willem de Kooning will croon, the vibrancy an d energy of his colorful abstract canvases helped pave the way for a new generation of artists. 55 Likewise medical genetics breaks from the diagnostic practices of the past, offering predictions and prophylaxis long before any symptoms present. Our current understanding of genetics provides clarity with respect to certain disease processes, while remaining frustratingl y out of focus for a host of other genetic anomalies. Questions of when, whether, and how severely a disease will manifest embody the spectrum problem. PGD can detect whether a resulting child's genome will contain a genetic anomaly associated with a par ticular disease, but often it cannot predict how the disease will be expressed during the child's life. 56 For example, both Down syndrome and cystic fibrosis can be detected through PGD, but to date there is no clinical measure for the severity of symptoms associated with the diseases. According to the National Institutes of Health, \"Down syndrome symptoms vary from person to person and can range from mild to severe.\"57 The National Down Syndrome Congress concurs, adding that \"[t]here is wide variation in me ntal abilities, behavior and physical development in individuals with Down syndrome. Each individual has his/her own unique personalit y, capabilities and talents.\"58 The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation likewise advises that the course of cystic fibrosis varies 55.

While diseases such as Tay-Sachs62 and Fanconi's anemia63 manifest at or near birth, other disorders such as Alzheimer disease64 and Huntington's disease65 may not become clinic ally noticeable until adulthood. Still other PGD-detectible genetic anomalies are associated with disease susceptibility, as o pposed to disease certainty. 66 For example, families in which many individuals ha ve been diagnosed with breast or colon cancer may share a genetic mutation that increases an affected individual's chances of developing the disease in adulthood. 67 Women who 59.

Such an attitude is shameful and utterly reprehensible, since it presumes to measure the value of a human life only within the parameters of \"normality\" and physical well-being, thus opening the way to legitimizing infanticide and euthanasia as well.' 78 Absolutist views in favor of PGD fo r medical screening of embryos have also appeared.79 At least two subsets of absol utism co-exist in the ethics literature on the subject of pr enatal genetic technologies.80 O n e s u b s e t advocates that prospective parents have a positive moral duty to use genetic technologies to enhance the well-being of their offspring, enabling them to live longer, run faster, think clearer, and so on.81 A second subset frames the positive duty in terms of preventi ng foreseeable medical harm to children by selecting against embryos that bear a known genetic anomaly.82 The former subset is perhaps best represented by John Harris, a Professor of Bioethics at the University of Manchester , who argues in his recent book that 75.

As long as the child could experience some deficit as a result of a genetic anomal y, the moral balance weighs in favor of PGD use and embryo selection. Abso lutist views that PGD must never be used are likewise refractory to the sp ectrum problem.

If one is always in favor of or always against PGD, then the clinical realities of particular genetic disorders will hold no sway over the absolutist's position. But if one is open to weighing the meri ts of PGD on a case-by-case basis, or along some multi-factorial algorithm, th en it would be useful to marshal the various points along the spectra identifi ed with genetic disease. Such an algorithm could be used to identify the instances when the use of PGD is most acceptable, such as to avoid tran smission of fatal childhood disorder, or when its use is more questionable, such as when the genetic anomaly has low penetrance and produces mild, trea table symptoms in the later decades of life. Table 1 provides a tool for the numeric assessment of the merits of PGD for embryo health screening. The Table sets out four factors that determine the clinical significance of a given genetic anomaly\u2014severity of disease, onset of disease, penetrance of dise ase, and availability of treatment or prophylaxis\u2014together with three points along the spectrum for each factor. Using a point allocation system, basic parameters for the non-absolutist position on PGD can be set out. The strongest cases mark the end points. For example, lethal Tay-Sachs disease would fall in the \"should be permitted\" category, while a (as of now theoretical) mutation that poses a 5 percent likelihood of causing color blindness in late adulthood would represent the \"should be discouraged\" category. The majority of cases would fall somewhere in between the end points, in the neutral \"can be permitted\" arena. Even in these ca ses, it may be possible to more definitively resolve the question of whether PGD offers greater benefit than not be compelled to do so. Coined \"liberal eugenics,\" this discipline respects the voluntary choices of parents to use genetic techniques that will benefit th e child in some way). Authors Guido de Wert and Joep P.M. Geraedts assert that two philosopher scholars\u2014Carson Strong and Bonnie Steinbock\u2014have espoused support for open access to PGD for prospective parents striving to assure maximal health for their offspring. Carson Strong urges adoption of a medical model in which physicians are \"non-directive\" toward parental requests for PGD, meaning they offer unconditional support fo r this reasonable request for service. See de Wert & Geraedts, supra note 70, at 87-88 (citing C ARSON STRONG , ETHICS IN REPRODUCTIVE AND PERINATAL MEDICINE : A NEW FRAMEWORK 180 (1997)). Steinbock adopts a reproductive freedom framework, urging that a woman's right to control her reproductive life includes the right to access information that she deems releva nt to any procreative decision. While doctors can discuss concerns about the use of PGD in ce rtain situations, ultimate ly the decision rests with the patient.

Casting the spectrum problem as a mathematical equation will do little to solve the ethical conundrums that PGD poses for non-absolutists, but organizing the data in a uniform manner can create a template for debate. While the factors included may not be exhaustive, and the spectrum points can invite wild speculation about unknowable clinical phenomena, a numeric approach does provide a means of assessing the relative merits of individual cases. In an era in whic h PGD tends to be accessed only by those with the means to pay its approximately $15,000 price tag, 90 questions about whether it should be made available are suppressed by prevailing market forces in which supply capably meets demands. Should PGD become more widely available through expanded health insurance coverage, or even government mandates to provide, a rubric for comparing essential and nonessential uses of PGD will be invaluable. 89. Admittedly, the terms \"benefit\" and \"harm\" are ill-defined in this context. Benefit could be measured by parental happiness wrought by the ability to control reproductive choice, or by offspring genetic health. Harm may refer to the risk of damage to or loss of embryos attributable to the PGD process, or to th e morbidity associated with IVF in general. Moreover, balancing benefits and harms pays homage to a utilitarian calculus, in which actions are judged ethically acceptable when they produce greater benefits than harms overall. 90.

Shifting control and responsibility for health status from person to parent could fundamentally change the way futu re generations view health risks, altering their behavior toward themse lves and others. What follows is a discussion of the current landscape of health perspectives and its possible shift in light of emerging genetic technologies. 1. The Person-Public Dichotomy Our current world view of health tends to vest responsibility for its maintenance in two actors: person and public. 91 From the person 91. See BUCHANAN ET AL ., supra note 79, at 11-12 (discussing the two perspectives for viewing genetic intervention, th e \"public health model\" and the \"personal choice model,\" SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 100 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 2:81 perspective, an adult individual enjoys the benefits of maintaining, or suffers the consequences of neglecting, bodily and mental functions that generally comprise human health.92 A child's health is likewise subject to a person- affecting model, with parents or gu ardians imbued with decision-making authority over offspring and minor charges.93 While environmental, familial, social, and a host of other factors im pact on a person's health, the person- affecting model dominates contemporary American constructs of health care decision-making. So essential is the ri ght of the person to control his or her health and health care that the princi ple of patient autonomy sits at the nadir of contemporary bioethics.94 Autonomous decision-making about individual health is of such moment in our culture that it currently occupies the highest echelon of constitutional protection\u2014a right protected against government interference under the liberty interest of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.95 Individual rights and responsibilities largely drive health decision-making in the U.S.96 While the person may be supreme, the public health model also occupies a significant role in directing health in our society. Aided by early recognition of the need for public health measures in modern society,97 Buchanan writes that the public health mode l \"stresses the producti on of benefits and the avoidance of harms for groups[,]\" while the personal choice model is based upon on \"individual autonomy.\"). 92.

In a sense, public health principles act as a filter th rough which individual decisions about health pass, permitting a broader view of the impact that person-affecting conduct has on society at large.98 Focusing on population rather than person, the public health perspective aims to maximize health for the many, even if it means sacrificing the rights of a few. 99 In an era of reproductive genetics in general, and PGD in particular, applying the person-public dichotomy yiel ds two distinct views of the value of preimplantation embryo selection. As discussed supra , Philosophers Allen Buchanan, Dan Brock, Norman Daniels, and Daniel Wikler describe the dual perspectives from which embryonic genetic intervention can be viewed as the \"public health model\" and the \"personal choice model.\" 100 T h e public health model relies on \"simple and unqualified consequentialist reasoning\" and \"looks only to the aggregate balance of good over bad.\"101 If PGD, or any genetic intervention, produces an overall benefit for society (for example, by the birthi ng of fewer babies with ge netic diseases), then the technique would be assessed as ethically sound. The utilitarian calculus embedded in the public health model is laudable for its ease of use, but is often subject to criticism for its failure to recognize the rights, needs, and harms to indivi duals. Viewing genetic technologies from a utilitarian perspective is particularly nettlesome given the devastation wrought by the early 20th century American eugenics movement.102 \"Eugenicists believed that most social problems were caused by hereditary faults of those afflicted by the prob lem, and they sought to eventually eliminate these problems from society through selective breeding.\" 103 Using a combination of law and social pre ssure, American eugenicists convinced many that society's greater good wo uld be served by sacrificing the stated, \"it is equally true that in every well-orde red society charged with the duty of conserving the safety of its members the ri ghts of the individual in respec t of his liberty may at times, under the pressure of great dangers, be subj ected to such restraint , to be enforced by reasonable regulations, as the safety of the general public may demand.\" Id. at 29. 98.

From Person to Parent The longstanding person-public perspectives on health are well-suited to a construct in which medical decisions a ffect the well-being of an existing individual, but they display signs of obsolescence when health choices are made on behalf of future generations. The use of PGD allows parents to wrest control over the health status of their offspring from nature itself.

A person's understanding of their own health vulnerabilities are gleaned through various channels providing both specific and general health information. A person can learn directly about his or her own health from bouts of ill health, visits with health care providers, or results of medical testing. In addition, public education plays a role in individual health by the disse mination of information about risks and benefits to health via certain activi ties, foods, and therapeutics. An individual armed with specific and general health information can adjust behaviors to promote good health. For example, a woman with a family history of breast cancer can undergo a genetic test to see if she possesses of any of the genetic mutations associated with inhe rited forms of breast cancer.110 If so, she can take several steps to reduce and possi bly avoid onset of the disease. She can modify her lifestyle to include a he althier diet and more exercise, both shown to reduce the risk of disease onset in women with the genetic marker for breast cancer. 111 She can consider taking a drug regimen which studies show can reduce the chances of developing the disease in some cases.112 And she can opt for prophylactic surgery in which susceptible breast tissue is removed, thus substantially reducing her chances of developing breast cancer. 113 A woman who knows she is highly susceptible to breast cancer may be super vigilant about her health in general, taking far fewer health risks than someone with no such predisposition. It is understandable that a woman wh ose life is affected by her genetic predisposition to breast cancer wo uld want to spare her children such trauma. Today such a woman could use PGD to select both male and female embryos that do not be ar the known genetic mutation. 114 H o w 110. N AT'L CANCER INST., NAT'L INST.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 104 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 2:81 might such a decision impact on the child's life? At least two possible behavioral scenarios emerge. If the child is told about the orchestrated origins of their conception, he or she might be grateful to the parent for eliminating that particular cancer risk from their bloodline. But a sense of invincibility could follow. The child, or later the adult, may feel little incentive to adhere to a healthy lifestyle, believing that the parent has absorbed all responsibility for the child's health. Just as a person with a genetic predisposition can overemphasize health in their lifestyle, a person purposefully conceived to be free of the predisposition may be lackadaisical towa rd their health in general, perhaps increasing the risk of sporadic illness or traumatic injury. Moreover, a person who ignores or downplays heal th maintenance could be woefully unprepared to cope with injury or illn ess, compared to a person who does not take good health for granted. Alternatively, a person born into a family whose adult members have suffered the devastating effects of inhe rited breast cancer may feel both relief and appreciation for their genetic good fortune. They may have an enhanced sense of the importance of good health, taking measures to protect themselves against known health diminishers. At least in the first generation of PGD use, children born without the genetic mutation will belong to families in which one or several members are affected by the cancer susceptibility gene. Watching a loved one suffer can be a powerful incentive to guard one's own good health. I find the latter scenario far more lik ely and far more consistent with our past experiences with breakthroughs in disease prevention. PGD may have certain unique qualities, but it is not the first medical advance to offer parents an opportunity to protect their children against disease.

Knowing that one cannot be infected with smallpox or polio does not translate into recklessness or fearlessness about other health matters. Likewise, PGD, viewed either as a form of genetic enhancement or disease prevention, would not affect the way the resulting offspring view their general health. Knowing that one is protected against a particular disease (inherited forms of breast or colon cancer, for example) does not change one's perceived vulnerability, or lack thereof, toward the myriad other diseases that plague the human race. While a PGD-selected adult may be less vigilant about certain diseases, protection against one or several genetic disorders is a proverbial drop in the bucket when it comes to the array of health maladies that lurk in any lifetime. PGD does shift some medical decision-making from person to parent, but the shift is subtle in the context of the resulting child's (and later adult's) overall health status. Whether diseas e prevention occurs prenatally or postnatally is of little moment in the lifetime of the indivi dual spared from diseases that sickened prior generation s. Allowing parents to make choices that avoid harm to their children seems consistent with the traditional role that parents have played in protecti ng and defending the health of their children. Since disease prevention meas ures are best practiced sooner than later in the human life cycle, better we honor the shift of medical decision-making from person to parent when deleterious genetic anomalies can be avoided. Parental stewardship may requ ire nothing less, a debatable point I refer to as \"the expectation problem,\" to which I now turn. C. The Expectation Problem Since its introduction nearly two decades ago, PGD has received its share of criticism from the academi c ethics community whose concerns range from the intentional destruction of human embryos to the creation of a genetic overclass bred to dominate those less-genetically well endowed. 122 121.

Professor Janet Dolgin provides a succinct summary of the main objections to PGD in her article titled Method, Mediations, and the Moral Dimensions of Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis . She cites the five main moral objectio ns to PGD as: (1) th e technique involves embryo destruction, an impermissible act to th ose who adhere to the belief that personhood begins at conception; (2) it commodifies children by reducing their valu e to the sum of their distinct traits, rather than their personhood as a whole; (3) it is a form of eugenics because it allows the selection of embryos (and later pers ons) with favored traits and the destruction of embryos with disfavored traits; (4) its high cost impacts pr inciples of distributive justice, because it is available only to wealthier parents, leaving less wealthy indi viduals more likely to SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2008] EMBRYONIC GENETICS 107 In the context of selection (and thereb y deselection) of embryos to maximize the health of the resulting child, one critique dominates\u2014the concern that a parent's choice to use PGD to assure offspring health will convert into parental duty to do so. 123 As the technique is perfected and becomes more widely available, social pressure will mount to form an expectation that a child's well-being is served only by pr enatal manipulation of the offspring's health status. This \"expectation prob lem\" is described by the President's Council on Bioethics in their 2004 report, Reproduction and Responsibility , which warns that \"[a]s the aggregate effect of parental choices reshapes society's understanding of 'normal' or 'acceptable' phenotypes, parents might feel social pressure to underg o PGD, as many pregnant women are now pressured to undergo amniocentesis.\" 124 The expectation problem is comprised of two dependent components\u2014 the expectation to use PGD and the expectation to then discard embryos with genetic anomalies. I label these components as dependent because the clinical reality is that parents who seek out PGD to detect the health of their embryos do so in order to impl ant only those that do not bear an unhealthy genome. 125 What concerns many about the expectation problem is the lack of boundaries surrounding acceptable uses of the screening technology. As discussed in Part II I(A), the spectrum of genetic disease penetrance and severity is wide, admitting the possibility that an embryo with a low likelihood of developing a high ly manageable disease could fall prey birth children with genetic anomalies; and (5) it is an affront to the disabilities community for its expression of rejection of physical or mental difference in society.

Understandably, the disability rights community views the expectation problem as gravely troubling, posing a \"fear of elimination\" as parents select against more and milder anomalies.142 But others defend the expected use of PGD as a valid, ev en required, exercise of parental responsibility. Philosopher Janet Malek stakes out what she calls \"the Strong Claim\" on the use of PGD.143 \"There are some situations,\" she posits, \"in which potential parents are morally re quired to use reproductive genetic technologies to reduce the likelihood that their future child will have a disabling condition.\"144 Dr. Malek argues that acting in accordance with the Strong Claim maximizes the future child's opportunities and well-being, 137.

Id. SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2008] EMBRYONIC GENETICS 111 a special responsibility that parents are ethically obligated to undertake.145 Because parents of existing children are obligated to reduce the likelihood that they will become disabled, for ex ample by obtaining care for treatable diseases, the obligation to future children is no weaker.146 S h e acknowledges the disability rights cr itique, but finds that the sources, incidence, and views of disability are t oo diverse to be significantly impacted by the use of PGD.147 On balance, she concludes that the ethical demand for parental partiality toward their children tip the scales in favor of the Strong Claim in cases of disabling conditions.148 Both the disability rights critique and the Strong Claim offer commentary on the expectation problem engendered by the use of PGD to assure embryo health. The disability communi ty finds the expectation problematic because it is based on and is calibrated to increase discrimination against persons with disabilities. From this pe rspective, PGD is used to eliminate a would-be person, resulting in negative attitudes and ill-treatment of existing persons with disabilities. Defenders of the Strong Claim view the expectation to use PGD as a moral requisite to good parenting because it avoids harm to a particular person\u2014the offspring to whom parents owe a d u t y o f c a r e . S e e n f r o m t h i s p e r s p e ctive, PGD eliminates disease, thus fulfilling the duty of existing persons\u2014the prospective parents. Is it possible to reconcile these tw o seemingly opposite views of the expected use of PGD to assure embryo health? A place to begin may be with the language, and corresponding pe rceptions, adopted by each side. Instead of viewing PGD as a tool for e limination (person/disease), it should be seen as a means of preventing harm. If both foes and advocates can agree that harm prevention is a good worth pursuing, then a dialogue can begin about which harms are worth preventing, and in whom the harms should be prevented. As to the latter issue of who should be protected from harm, both sides seem to agree that existing persons, or those likely to come into existence, are the ones who should be protected from harm. The existing person category includes pe rsons with disabilities, prospective parents, and the \"healthy\" embryos selected for implantation. 149 145. Id. 146. Id. 147. Id. 148. Malek, supra note 143; see also, Harris, supra note 79, at 21 (discussing what Dr. Malek terms \"the Strong Claim\"). 149. This categorization assumes that adherents to the disability rights critique and the Strong Claim do not subscribe to the view th at all preimplantation embryos are existing persons, and thus must be implanted in order to avoid harm to the embryos themselves. This view, advocated by the Catholic Church, represents an absolutist view of PGD that shuns all use of the technique. See supra notes 72-78 and accompanying text. I do not read the disability rights critique to say that PGD should never be us ed because it may lead to embryo SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 112 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 2:81 There appears nothing mutually exclusive about preventing harm to all three groups within the category of ex isting persons. Even if one favors greater protection for one group, the other groups need not be made vulnerable to harm as in a zero-sum game. The key to achieving equipoise in group harm prevention is in agreeing which harms are worth preventing. This determination is where the two pers pectives are most likely to diverge. Whereas the Strong Claim may advocate for PGD to select against embryos that are certain or likely to experience mobility or sensory disabilities such as paraplegia, blindness, or deafness, the disability rights critique may argue these conditions do not pose harm to the individual and therefore selecting against them is a form of discrimination against existing persons with the deficits. Even if the disability community agreed that it is better for a child to be born fully ambulatory with all sens es intact, it would continue to worry about the slippery slope upon which PGD is sure to fall. Selecting against severe mobility and sensory deficits could easily morph into deselecting embryos with extremely mild forms of the disability, such as those destined to be pigeon toed, color blind, or tone deaf, should these conditions ever be traced to a genetic cause. Will the ability to prevent harm to offspring that is both grave and trivial translate into the use of PGD to discard all but the Renaissance embryos of the twenty-first century? I think the answer is no. First, from an efficiency standpoint, it seems unlikely that IVF plus PGD will ever overtake the old- fashioned way of reproducing. Th e cost, time, and surgical invasion 150 required make it an unlikely rival fo r natural conception. Still, the worry remains that the small subset of parents who do invoke PGD will ratchet up the indications for its use, widening the circle from individuals with a family history of a devastating disease to those bent on eliminating even slight imperfections in their family tree. If this wider clientele does emerge, will a more routine use of PGD impact the way we view illness and health in our society, as some critics have worried? Will our ability to select against mild and manageable disease translate into intolerance of those with such genetic disorders? Again, I am pe rsuaded to answer in the negative. The trajectory of modern medicine suggests that we will continue to search out causes and cures for a broad range of maladies, but that such discard. Nothing in its concern for the lives of individuals with disabi lities suggests that it insists on birthing infants whose life span woul d be a handful of year s and who would suffer great pain throughout. Instead, the critique reads as a plea for society to recognize the beneficial and productive lives that persons with disabilities lead. 150. The surgical invasion refers to the surgery required to extract mature eggs from a woman's ovaries in order to form embryos using IVF. PGD can only be performed on extracorporeal embryos, thus IVF is an essentia l first step to genetic te sting of preimplantation embryos. See C OOK ET AL., supra note 3, at \u00a79.7. SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2008] EMBRYONIC GENETICS 113 discoveries will have little impact on how we view those afflicted with the ailments. The use of vaccines to prevent harm from disease provides a nice counterpart to the use of PGD to prevent harm from genetic anomaly. While vaccines are administered postna tally, and PGD is used prenatally, both aim to prevent the onset of heal th diminishing conditions. Though PGD is still in its infancy, it appears to be traveling a path similar to that paved by vaccine development, initially targeting severe, life-threatening diseases then gradually addressing less severe conditions as more is learned about the technology. As noted previously, PGD was developed in the late 1980s to detect mostly lethal single-gene disorders that displayed high penetrance in affected families, such as Tay-Sachs disease and Huntington's disease. 151 Today, embryologists can use PGD to detect over one hundred genetic conditions, some of which are nonfatal , such as familial high cholesterol, and others which pose a mere susceptib ility to adult-onset disease, such as breast or colon cancer.152 This pattern repeats the development of vaccines, which at first were used to prevent fatal communicable diseases, but today are routinely administered to avoid generally mild symptoms of common childhood infections. The first successful vaccination was created by Edward Jenner in 1796 to combat smallpox, a contagious dise ase that had plagued humankind for centuries.153 A vaccination for yellow feve r followed in 1937, and the well- known polio vaccine was introduced in a large scale trial in 1954.154 The President of the March of Dimes, Basil O'Connor, said of the polio vaccine at its introduction: I have just figured out that during the coming summer, thirty or forty thousand children will get polio. About fifteen thousand of them will be paralyzed and more than a thousand will die. If we have the capacity to prevent this, we have a social responsibility . . . we are supported by the 151.

If we have the capacity to prevent disease through vaccination, do we have a social responsibility (duty) to do so? American pediatricians seem to answer in the affirmative, in the form of th eir recommendations to parents regarding childhood vaccinations. Today the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children be vaccinated against fifteen diseases, some of which overwhelmingly produce only mild symptoms in their host. 156 For example, the vaccination for chicken pox was introduced in the U.S. in 1995, and is now widely used despite the medical fact that the disease is generally mild and short-lived in the vast majority of those affected. 157 But its severity in a small number of infe cted individuals supports its use as a public health matter.158 In terms of the expectation problem, we should query whether the widespread, although not universal, use of childhood vaccines has changed the way we view children and adults who manifest the targeted disease. Epidemiologic data suggests that over ni nety percent of children old enough to receive vaccinations do receive the inoculations, leaving around ten percent of the population volunt arily or inadvertently unvaccinated. 159 As a result of either vaccine ineffectiven ess, or the exposure of unvaccinated 155.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2008] EMBRYONIC GENETICS 115 individuals to the particular viruses, outbreaks do periodically occur.160 Loosely applying the disability rights crit ique to these incidents of (largely) preventable diseases, we would expect to see widespread discrimination against individuals (or their parents ) whose voluntary refusal to be vaccinated caused their disease syndrome. That is, if an individual has the opportunity to prevent disease, then declines such opportunity, that individual should be derided once the disease manifests for failing to protect herself and possibly her community from harm. Instead of shunning \"vaccines de viants,\" society appears to have accepted them and accommodated their difference. For example, several pediatric practices advertise their wil lingness to work with vaccine-adverse parents, permitting them to sign an \"informed refusal\" form declining vaccinations on behalf of their children. 161 Also, a number of states have enacted broad exemptions to their vaccine mandates, allowing parents to opt out of required inoculations so lo ng as they agree to keep their children out of school during known outbreaks.162 While the presence of preventable\u2014and communicable\u2014disease is concerning for the commonweal, it has not wrought isolation, denial of treatment, or discrimination against those who choose to live outside the bounds of accepted medical practice. Being different, even \"imperfect\" from a disease-resistance perspective, has not produced widespread social harm to affected populations. The take away message from the vaccine experience may be that the ability to prevent disease does not nece ssarily translate into discrimination against those who manifest the disease. Shifting back to PGD, there is reason to believe that this observatio n will hold true for disease prevention in the form of embryo selection. Allowing parents to choose to birth a child free of known genetic disorders\u2014ev en those associated with mild symptomology or asymptomatic carrier status\u2014should have little or no impact on the treatment of living or to-be-born individuals who express those genetic anomalies.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 116 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 2:81 of parental duty by the Strong Claim, should likewise have no impact on society's perception of that indivi dual's worth. Disease prevention technologies should be celebrated as a collective benefit when they succeed, but their failures should never re st on the shoulders of any affected individual. In sum, it is likely that PGD will cont inue to gain audience as its ability to reveal the embryonic genome improves. At the same time, it seems equally unlikely that PGD will be a routine part of reproduction, as its cost and risk barriers make it unattractive to most of the world's prospective parents. Still, for the subset that wishes to screen and choose among their early embryos, the expectation problem will present. The expectation that parents should routinely use PGD will likely impact only those parents who are already predisposed to accessing prenatal genetic technologies. For these reprotech-inclined parents, PGD is the latest entry on the ART continuum that has been in development for over three decades. This group may regard PGD as a \"must have\" because it expedites the delivery of genetic information and eliminates the abortion dilemma that accompanies other forms of prenatal genetic testing. But the idea of a universal expectation to use PGD seems clinically unrealistic. Mother Nature is a far more compelling, efficient, and successful alternative to technically-assisted procreation. As for the second part of the expectation problem\u2014that once PGD is used it will result in deselection of embryos for milder and more benign conditions\u2014this is likely to be the case. PGD, like other forms of disease prevention, will begin by tackling life- threatening conditions and gradually expand to address less serious, albeit lif e-affecting, syndromes. Will this incremental expansion change the way we view disease or those with disease in our society? I think not. We will continue to seek out cures and treatments for diseases grave and trivial because those who aspire for greater health in our society demand and deserve nothing less. Instead of fostering discrimination against those with lesser health, advances in the treatment and prevention of serious diseases may instead yield, as a byproduct, therapies useful for treating less devastating illness. A modern day example of such fortui ty can be found in the research surrounding smallpox. We recently lear ned that after centuries of work to combat, and virtually rid the world of smallpox, a drug used for this deadly disease may also be useful in treating a far less serious, though annoying, health scourge\u2014the common cold. In May 2008, scientists announced the successful application of a smallpox drug to protect against adenovirus, SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2008] EMBRYONIC GENETICS 117 a.k.a. the common cold, in animal studies.163 Such is a common trajectory in medical research\u2014 with a destination in mind, researchers stay alert to useful detours along the way. IV. CONCLUSION Genetic technologies have and will continue to change the way we think about our own health and that of our children. The ability to select or discard early embryos on the basis of genetic health empowers parents to make earlier and more profound medical decisions on behalf of their offspring, possibly disrupting long held views about an individual's capacity to control his or her own health. PGD, with its increased sensitivity to detect milder and later-onset diseases, actively shifts decision-making about health from the affected person to the controlling parent, while tempting users to eliminate even slight imperfections in their offspring. While worries abound that PGD will promote recklessness towa rd health in children spared of familial diseases, and disdain for those who do manifest genetic anomalies, nothing in our past treatment of sickne ss and health suggests such a future. The path of our plodding journey to improve human health was recently described by Harvard Professor of Psycho logy Steven Pinker in response to concerns that advances in technology will rob us of our basic human dignity. \"The reality is that biomed ical research[,]\" Professor Pinker observed, \"is a Sisyphean struggle to eke small increments in health from a staggeringly complex, entropy-beset huma n body. It is not, and probably never will be, a runaway train.\" 164 While some may yearn for PGD to forge full-steam ahead to reveal more and more about the early human genome, thus enabling greater micromanagement of our genetic offspring, what we really should expect are baby steps in this neophyte technology whose own life cycle will surely long outlast each of our own. 163.
