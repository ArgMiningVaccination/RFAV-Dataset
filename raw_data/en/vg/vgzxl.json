Lesson Overview Featured article: \" [2 Companies Say Their Vaccines Are 95% Effective. What Does That Mean?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/health/covid-vaccine-95-effective.html)\" by Carl Zimmer Last week, after a trial showed that Pfizer's [coronavirus vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/03/science/vaccine-efficacy-coronavirus.html) had an [efficacy](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/03/science/vaccine-efficacy-coronavirus.html) rate of 95 percent, the Food and Drug Administration [approved](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/health/pfizer-vaccine-authorized.html) the vaccine. What is \"efficacy,\" and how is it calculated? In this lesson, you will analyze the data from Pfizer's successful vaccine study to get a practical sense of how the vaccine performed. (Spoiler: It did well.) Then, you will analyze what factors could make or break the vaccine's success as it becomes widely available. Note to Teachers: This lesson plan is available as [a PDF for students](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/teaching-the-math-of-vaccine-effectiveness/190b272f891868c7/full.pdf). Warm Up Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/t1X2d-FUIvQ?t=56), from 0:56 to 3:00, of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, speaking about the efficacy of new vaccines at a briefing of the White House's coronavirus task force on Nov. 19. Respond to the following questions in writing or in class discussion: Dr. Fauci says that vaccines have \"crushed\" previous outbreaks of diseases like smallpox, polio and measles. You probably received one or more of those vaccines when you were young. Did you know what those vaccines were when you received them? Did you know those diseases had deadly outbreaks before vaccines were introduced? Dr. Fauci calls the 95 percent efficacy rate of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine \"extraordinary.\" Does that rate sound impressive to you? Why or why not? Toward the end of the video, Dr. Fauci implies that the ultimate effectiveness of the vaccine will depend on how it is rolled out and received by the general public. What factors might influence how effective a vaccine is when it's widely released? Activity: Infection Risks and Efficacy Read [the featured article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/health/covid-vaccine-95-effective.html). Then, proceed through the following sections to break down the Pfizer study and its data. Study Design: Answer the following questions: What is a placebo? Why do you think Pfizer and other drug companies use placebos in their studies? The Pfizer study enrolled 43,661 people. Why so many people? Would the company's results be as convincing if it enrolled, for example, just 100 people? Half of the subjects (the study volunteers) were given a placebo. The other half were given the vaccine. This created two groups: the placebo group and the vaccine group. The study used a random process to choose which subjects were assigned to each group. Why would subjects be randomly assigned to the groups? What You Need to Know About the Johnson & Johnson Vaccine Pause in the U.S. - On April 23, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel of advisers [voted to recommend lifting a pause](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/23/health/johnson-covid-vaccine-blood-clots.html)on the [Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine.html)and adding a label about an exceedingly uncommon but potentially dangerous blood clotting disorder. - Federal health officials are expected to formally recommend that states [lift the pause](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/22/us/politics/johnson-and-johnson-vaccine.html). - Administration of the vaccine ground to a halt recently after reports emerged of a rare blood clotting disorder in six women who had received the vaccine. - The overall risk of developing the disorder is [extremely low](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/health/blood-clots-johnson-vaccine.html). Women between 30 and 39 appear to be at greatest risk, with 11.8 cases per million doses given. There have been seven cases per million doses among women between 18 and 49. - Nearly eight million doses of the vaccine have now been administered. Among men and women who are 50 or over, there has been less than one case per million doses. - Johnson & Johnson had also [decided to delay the rollout of its vaccine in Europe](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/world/johnson-covid-vaccine-europe.html)amid similar concerns, but it later decided to [resume its campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/20/world/europe/johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-EU.html)after the European Union's drug regulator said a warning label should be added. South Africa, devastated by a more contagious virus variant that emerged there, also [suspended use of the vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/world/south-africa-covid-vaccine.html)but later [moved forward with it](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/22/world/south-africa-johnson-covid-vaccine.html). - On April 23, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel of advisers Infection Risk: The 43,661 subjects were split evenly between the placebo and vaccine groups (about 21,830 subjects per group). In the placebo group \u2014 the group that got a \"fake\" vaccine \u2014 162 became infected with the coronavirus and showed symptoms. In the vaccine group \u2014 the group that got the real vaccine \u2014 that number was only eight. On a separate sheet of paper, draw the following table to store these numbers and our calculations: Answer the following questions (and fill in the corresponding table cells): What percentage of the placebo subjects became infected? Hint: Divide the number infected by the total group size, then multiply by 100. What percentage of the vaccine subjects became infected? These numbers are each group's \"infection risk.\" Put these numbers in the appropriate places of the \"infection risk\" column. Check your work: Answer the following questions: Both infection risks are lower than 1 percent. Would you describe the placebo and the vaccine infection risks as low or high? Explain. Is the vaccine group's infection risk that different from the placebo group's? Explain. Scale Up: It can be hard to see a vaccine's impact in terms of percentages. Let's answer the same questions as above after calculating what the infection risks indicated by Pfizer's study would look like if applied to the entire population of the United States. Answer the following questions (and fill in the corresponding table cells): About 328 million (328,000,000) people live in the United States. Assume all of these people had the same infection risk as those in the placebo group during the months of this study. How many people in the country would you expect to contract the coronavirus? Hint: Multiply the U.S. population by the infection risk (before multiplying, write the infection risk as a decimal: 0.74% = 0.0074). Assume the U.S. population had the same infection risk as the vaccine group. How many people would you expect to become infected? Put these numbers in the appropriate places of the table's final column. Check your work: Answer the same questions about the infection risk that you answered before. This time, use the numbers you just calculated to help inform your response: Both infection risks are lower than 1 percent. Would you describe these infection risks as low or high? Explain. Is the vaccine group's infection risk that different from the placebo group's? Explain. Efficacy: Now that we've analyzed infection risks, let's calculate the efficacy. First, find the difference between the risks in both groups. Check your work: 0.74% - 0.04% = 0.7% So, the vaccine reduced the infection risk by 0.7 percentage points (less than 1 percentage point). This seems small. However, as we know from our earlier analysis, small differences in infection risks can mean big differences in the number of people that become infected. How can we capture that difference in impact? Let's scale the percentage point difference in risks by the original infection risk. To do this, divide the difference (0.7%) by the infection risk of the placebo group (0.74%). Check your work: You just did the same calculations that were performed by the scientists at Pfizer. The number you got, 95 percent, is [known as the efficacy rate](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section6.html). This tells you that, under the same conditions as the study, the vaccine reduces the risk of infection by 95 percent. Going Further Part I: Threats to Effectiveness Read the following excerpt from the article: Vaccines don't protect only the people who get them. Because they slow the spread of the virus, they can, over time, also drive down new infection rates and protect society as a whole. Scientists call this broad form of effectiveness a vaccine's impact. The smallpox vaccine had the greatest impact of all, driving the virus into oblivion in the 1970s. But even a vaccine with extremely high efficacy in clinical trials will have a small impact if only a few people end up getting it. Answer the following questions: Because vaccines prevent new infections, they also prevent further spread. Why would this effect be diminished if few people agreed to get the vaccine? Even impressive vaccines, like Pfizer's, show a nonzero infection rate among the vaccinated group. Why does this fact make the widespread adoption of vaccines so important? If effective vaccines are taken by enough people, a population can develop \"herd immunity\" to a disease. What do you think that term means? Do you think the United States will eventually develop herd immunity to the coronavirus? Why or why not? Part II: Your Own Decision-Making A vaccine against Covid-19 is now being distributed in the United States and elsewhere. Do you plan on being vaccinated? Do you want your loved ones and friends to be vaccinated, too?
