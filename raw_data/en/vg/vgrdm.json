Storing vaccines Vaccines are delicate biological substances and must be stored between +2 degrees Celsius and +8 degrees Celsius. Vaccines exposed to temperatures outside this range may have to be considered ineffective and discarded. It is vital that vaccines are stored appropriately in order to: - ensure patients receive an effective vaccine - ensure efficient management of resources (vaccines are an expensive resource that can be in limited supply) avoid patients needing revaccination after having been given an ineffective vaccine. [Order a minimum/maximum temperature chart ](mailto:QHIP-ADMIN@health.qld.gov.au?subject=Order%20Temperature%20Chart&body=VSP%20number:%0D%0AOrder%20quantity:) For detailed information about the correct storage of vaccines, please refer to the [National Vaccine Storage Guidelines 'Strive for 5'](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/national-vaccine-storage-guidelines-strive-for-5).
