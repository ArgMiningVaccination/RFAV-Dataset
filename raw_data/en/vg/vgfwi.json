PREVALENCE OF SUPPLEMENT USE IN THE UNITED STATES The published literature supports the high prevalence of supplement use in children and adolescents in the United States. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 34% of US children and adolescents used supplements in the past month, andalmost half of those took a supplement daily. Supplement use was high in underweight patients.

(2) THE DIETARY REFERENCE INTAKES According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) include 4 nutrient-based refer- ence values that are used to assess and plan the diet of healthy people: \u0081Estimated Average Requirement: the average dailynutrient intake level that is suf cient to meet the requirements of half of the healthy population of aparticular age and sex \u0081Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): the averagedaily nutrient intake level that is suf cient to meet the requirements of nearly all (97% -98%) of the healthy individual of a particular age and sex \u0081Adequate intake: the recommended average daily intake level based on estimated intake of apparently healthy people; adequate intake is used when RDA cannot be determined \u0081Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): the highest averagedaily nutrient intake level that is unlikely to pose a risk of adverse effects to almost the whole general pop-ulation (3) VITAMIN A (RETINOL) Introduction Until the 1980s, the focus on vitamin A de ciency was limited to its ocular manifestations as the leading cause ofblindness in developing cou ntries. However, in the past 3 decades, international stud ies indicate that subclinical vitamin A de ciency has broader consequences regard- ing childhood morbidity and mortality in the developing world. Vitamin A de ciency accounts for 1.7% of all deaths in children younger t h a n5y e a r si nd e v e l o p i n g countries. (4) Case J.H. is a 14-year-old with autism who presented to the emergency department for evaluation because he fell off the school bus. J.H.' s mother reports that recently he has been keeping his eye closedand he has been walking with his arms outstretched. J.H. was born full-term and has no other health conditions except for autism. J.H. 's diet consisted of crackers and chips only, and he was not taking any vitamins or supplements. On physicalexamination, J.H. looked underweight (body mass index, 13[<5th percentile for age and sex]) and was agitated. Results of a head computed tomographic (CT) scan and a lumbarpuncture were negative, so J.H. was discharged. On follow-up with his primary care doctor, b ilateral corneal lesions were noted, so J.H. was referred for an urgent ophthalmology eval-uation. J.H. was diagnosed as having xerophthalmia and corneal ulcers secondary to vitamin A de ciency. J.H. was treated with high-dose vitamin A. Two years later, on ophthalmologyfollow-up he was noted to be able to see objects and ambulatewithout assistance, but he had complete opaci cation of his left cornea and a corneal scar in his right eye . Sources and DRIs Vitamin A is the collective name for a family of fat-solublecompounds referred to as retinoic acids. There are 2 formsof dietary vitamin A. Preformed vitamin A is found in sup- plements and food from animal sources, such as forti ed dairy products and liver. Provitamin A carotenoids aredietary precursors of retinol. The most important provita- min A carotenoid is b-carotene, which is found in carrots, b r o c c o l i ,s q u a s h ,p e a s ,s p i n a c h ,a n dc a n t a l o u p e .( 3 ) The RDAs for vitamin A are given as micrograms of retinol activity equivalents (RAEs) to recognize the differentbioactivities of retinol and b-carotene. However, food and supplement labels state vitamin A levels in InternationalUnits.

In the vitamin A -dependent vision cycle, 11-cis-retinal, a derivative of vitamin A, com-bines with a membrane protein in the retina called opsin to form rhodopsin. Rhodopsin absorbs light and enables the transmission of its stimuli to the brain. Vitamin A is essential to the integrity of the cornea and conjunctiva as well as many other organs because of its importance for cell differentiation. (5) Factors and Consequences of Vitamin A De ciency Xerophthalmia is the term used to describe the ocular manifestations of vitamin A de ciency. Night blindness is the earliest symptom and it is normally a sensitive andspeci c indicator for vitamin A de ciency. Patients with night blindness cannot see well at night or in dim light,and this can be dif cult to recognize, especially among toddlers. Mild cases of night blindness can become appar- ent only after exposure to a bright light that depletes the limited stores of 11-cis-retinal in the affected patient. Night blindness responds to vitamin A therapy within 24 to 48 hours. If untreated, it leads to keratinization of the surface of the conjunctivae and, thus, is histopathologic pic- ture acteristic for vitamin A de ciency. Bitot spots are generally whitish, foamy-appearing ovoid areas on the conjunctiva that result from a buildup of keratin. (6) Corneal xerosis and ulceration can develop in advanced eye disease and can subsequently lead to blindness. (7) Before xerophthalmia is apparent, other serious conse- quences, including increased mortality, result from sub-clinical vitamin A de ciency. The protective effect of vitamin A against infant morbidity and mortality is due to its vitalrole in enhancing the host immune functions at different levels. Its protective effect against diarrheal diseases is due to its vital role in sustaining the integrity of the intes- tinal mucosa. The positive effect of vitamin A in human immunode ciency virus -infected children is due to in- creased T-cell lymphopoiesis. The therapeutic effects of vitamin A against measles are well validated and are at- tributed to enhanced antibody production. (8) Without supplementation, measles can induce a de- compensation of vitamin A status and is known to pre- cipitate 25% to 50% of blinding xerophthalmia in Asia. In many parts of Africa, measle si sc o n s i d e r e dt h el e a d i n g cause of childhood blindness. (7) TABLE 1.

Vol. 39 No. 4 APRIL 2018 163 by guest on March 5, 2019 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recom- mends vitamin A supplementation for children 6 months to 2 years old who are hospitalized for measles. The recom- mended oral supplement dose is 100,000 IU (30,000 mg) for children 6 to 12 months old and 200,000 IU (60,000 mg) for children older than 1 year. (9) Measles is one example of how seemingly unrelated disease states can alter an individual 's vitamin A balance a n dl e a dt od e ciency. The role of vitamin A for maintenance of normal epithelial cell integrity in the lungs has been examined in relation to chronic lung disease of preterm infants. A recent systematic review concluded that vitamin A supplementation had a modest bene t on risk of death, oxygen requirement, and development of chronic lung disease. No bene t was foundon neurodevelopment in the second year of life. De nitive recommendations were not supported by the data. (10) In patients with protein energy malnutrition, vitamin A deciency can develop not only secondary to low dietary intake but also due to the effect of malnutrition on the transport and storage of vitamin A. (7) Young children in developing countries are especially vulnerable to and at risk for vitamin A de ciency due to their dependence on human milk, which can be de cient if the mother is de cient. Intestinal infections that impair vitamin A absorption and respiratory infections, such as tuberculosis, that increase metabolic demands make affected children the most vulnerable victims of xerophthalmia. The same factors can affect older individuals, such as refugees who experience unsanitary conditions and nut ritional deprivation. (7) TABLE 2.

The toxic effects are transient and are due to increased intracranial pressure (pseudotumor cerebri).Symptoms include headache, bl urred vision, vertigo, and a bulging fontanelle in infants. (5) This has led the IOM to apply alarge safety margin in recommending the ULs for vitamin A. This is speci cally important for women of childbearing age w h o s ei n t a k eo fr e t i n o ls h o u ld not exceed 2,800 to 3,000 mg/d due to the risk of teratogenicity. (3) Isotretinoin (13 -cis- r e t i n o i ca c i d ) ,am e d i c a t i o nu s e dt o treat severe acne, is a teratogen that is associated withcommon birth defects. Since 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established the iPLEDGE program by which the prescribing and dispensing of isotretinoin is more tightly controlled in an effort to reduce inappropriate drug use and exposure to women of childbearing age. VITAMIN B 12(CYANOCOBALAMIN) Case C.S. is a 7-month-old infant who presented with failureto thrive, progressive loss of milestones, and shaking move- ments (Fig 1). On physical examination on the day ofadmission she looked pale but was alert and had normal vital signs. Her length and weight were below the 5th percentile, andshe appeared malnourished. She showed generalized hypotonia with constant tremors of her tongue and extremities. The remainder of her physical examination was normal, with no anomalies or organomegalies . C.S. was exclusively breastfed. The mother was on a well-balanced diet with oral multivitamins, and she has previously breastfed C.S. 's 2 siblings, who were reportedly healthy. The mother' s medical history was signi cant for Graves disease. Results of a CT scan of her head were normal. Laboratory evaluation was notable for macrocytic anemia. The ndings of macrocytosis triggered fur ther evaluation of vitamin B 12 and folate levels, and her level of vitamin B 12was found to be signi cantly low. The mother 'sl e v e lo fv i t a m i nB 12was undetectable. The mother was f ound to have intrinsic factor (IF) antibodies secondary to an autoimmune process trig- gered by Graves disease . C.S. was treated with vitamin B 12and was reported to have a nearly normal developmental outcome at 2 years of age . Sources and Homeostasis of Vitamin B 12 Animal source foods such as milk, eggs, and meat are the only natural sources of vitamin B 12.( 1 1 )A b s o r p t i o no ft h e vitamin is distinctively comp lex, especially compared with other water-soluble vitamins. In the stomach, hydrochloric acid and pepsin release vitamin B 12from dietary protein, a n dc y a n o c o b a l a m i ni st h e nb o u n dt oI Fs e c r e t e db yt h egastric parietal cells. The complex B 12-IF remains intact until its uptake is facilitated by a speci c receptor in the distal ileum. (12) Vitamin B 12deciency can result from low dietary intake of animal source food due to cost, low availability, or religious and cultural beliefs. Dysfunc- tion in any part of the sophisticated gastrointestinal pathway of cyanocobalamin absorption \u2014from stomach to ileum\u2014 can lead to non -dietary-induced vitamin B 12 deciency. The DRIs The RDA for vitamin B 12is 0.9 mg/d for infants and toddlers, 1.2 to 1.8 mg/d for 4- to 13-year-olds, and 2.4 mg/d thereafter. No adverse effects have been reported with excess vitamin B 12intake, and the risk of toxicity is very low; there- fore, a UL is not established (3) Maternal and Infant Vitamin B 12Deciency Most adults can tolerate a low vitamin B 12intake status for years without any clinical symptoms. Mothers of infants Figure 1. C.S. at 7 months of age presenting with marked hypotonia and loss of milestones.

(13) Newborn infants have limited endogenous stores and are at risk for vitamin B 12de- ciency if they are predominantly breastfed, with a poormaternal vitamin B 12status and intake. (14) Typical man- ifestations usually start between 4 and 10 months of ageand include growth faltering, developmental regression, tremors, hypotonia, lethargy, i rritability, and feeding dif- culties. (14) Megaloblastic anemia is not always present. (13) Vitamin B 12replacement (1 mg intramuscular for 2 to 7 days [15]) leads to rapid recovery, with documented rever-sal of apathy, hypotonia, anorexia, and tremors within days of initiating treatment. Brain atrophy and growth failure reversed within several month s. Unfortunately, despite the dramatic rapid improvement, many infants with vita-min B 12deciency experience long-term cognitive and developmental delay. (14) Similar symptoms are seen in infants with inborn errors of vitamin B 12absorption and utilization. A full discussion of these conditions is beyond the scope ofthis article. Vitamin B 12Deciency in Children and Adolescents A study of serum B 12levels in 3,766 US children (4 -19 years old) identi ed 3 children with levels less than 100 pg/mL (<74 pmol/L) (1 of 1,255) and 18 with levels less than 200 pg/mL ( <148 pmol/L) (1 of 200). The highest incidence of children with levels less than 200 pg/mL ( <148 pmol/L) was reported in the 12- to 19-year-old category, with a rate of 1 in 112. (15) Because the cutoff value suggested to de-ne vitamin B 12deciency is a level less than 203 pg/mL (<150 pmol/L), (11) these data indicate that B 12deciency in children and adolescents is more common than previously suggested. Of note, a vitamin B 12level greater than 300 pg/mL (>221 pmol/L) is tentatively considered as the cutoff value for B 12repletion. (16) The estimated vitamin B 12intake in the United States is higher than the RDA, but dietary B 12deciency is increas- ing due to atypical diets, such as extreme vegetarianism.(17) Patients who undergo gastric bypass or other bariatric surgeries are at risk for vitamin B 12deciency due to the loss of gastric production of IF. (13) Pathologic disordersthat disrupt the ileal length or surface, such as short gut syndrome, Crohn disease, and celiac disease, can affect B 12 absorption. (15) It is especially important to note thatprevious and current use of gastric acid inhibitors for 2or more years was signi cantly associated with the occur- rence of vitamin B 12deciency in adults. (18) Neurologic changes secondary to B 12deciency can oc- cur without hematologic abnormality, including loss of deep tendon re flexes, developmental regression, hypoto- nia, and neuropsychiatric changes (eg, depression). (15) Laboratory Evaluation Several feasible indicators to assess vitamin B 12status are available, and the least expensive is a serum vitamin B 12 level. (11) However, serum B 12level is not always re flective of tissue levels that can be depleted with a low normal orborderline serum cobalamin level. (15) Methylmalonic acid(MMA) and homocysteine are 2 precursors in the meta- bolic pathway and are affected by B 12deciency. Homo- cysteine is elevated in both B 12and folate de ciencies, but an elevated MMA level is reasonably speci c for B 12 deciency; MMA levels can be measured in both serum and urine. (13) Studies are needed to determine the optimum strat- egy for the diagnosis of vitamin B 12deciency in children. Several experts recommend B 12,M M A ,a n dh o m o c y s t e i n e levels when B 12deciency is suspected. (13)(15) Once B 12 deciency is con rmed, subspecialty consultation, eg, a physician nutrition specialist, gastroenterologist, or hema-tologist, is recommended to guide further evaluation and treatment. VITAMIN C (ASCORBIC ACID) Introduction In 1747, Dr James Lind, a surgeon in the British Navy, demonstrated that scurvy can be cured by consumingoranges and lemons. Since then, scurvy, or vitamin C deciency, which used to debilitate sailors, has become a rare disease that warrants a case report. A recent one waspublished in the New York Times in July 2015. Although a clue to a disrupted eating pattern was clear on the initialpresentation (the child has developmental delay and will eat only macaroni and cheese), a nutritional de ciency was not suspected. The patient had an extensive evalua-tion that included bone marrow biopsy and many sub- specialist consults. This case is a testimony to the importance of physician knowledge about certain cluesthat should prompt a more detailed nutritional history. Functions Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that acts as an antiox-idant and free radical scavenger. Vitamin C is a cofactor for many enzymes and hormones and plays a major role in the 166 Pediatrics in Review by guest on March 5, 2019 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from biosynthesis of many components of connective tissue, such as collagen. It also modulates the absorption, transport, andstorage of iron. (3) The DRIs The DRIs for vitamin C are based on estimates of tissuelevels that are deemed adequate to provide antioxidant protection with minimal urinary loss. Tobacco smoking or environmental exposure to nicotine increases the vi- tamin C requirement by 35% to 40% due to increased ox- idative stress. Vitamin C abso rption in the small intestine is dose dependent, and the kidney also regulates its bodycontent. As a result, excessive intake of vitamin C isunlikely to cause adverse effects other than gastrointes- tinal upset and osmotic diarrhea occasionally reported with large doses.

(3) Sources Fruits and vegetables provide 90% of the vitamin C found in the typical diet. The major contributors are potatoes and citrus fruits and juices. (3) A diet that is persis- tently limited to meat, bread and/or dairy presents a high risk for inadequate vitamin C intake and development of deciency. Deciency Scurvy is rare in the current era but should not be forgot-ten. According to NHANES, children aged 6 to 11 years old had the highest mean serum concentration of ascorbic acid but showed a linear decrease thereafter. (19) In the pedi-atric population there are many case reports of scurvy in patients with autism due to their severely restrictive diet. Adults at risk for vitamin C de ciency include smokers, alcoholics, and those on a very restricted diet due to socialisolation. (20)(21) Clinical symptoms can develop only after 30- to 40 days of consuming a diet that is void of vitamin C. (22) The earliest symptoms of vitamin C de ciency are fatigue and refusal to walk. (20) Dermatologic ndings include pete- chiae hair. Hematomas, ecchymosis, poor wound healing, and edema may also be noted. Oral manifestations occur only in patients with teeth and include bleeding and hypertrophic gums. Musculoskeletal ndings include joint pain, hemarthrosis, and muscle pain. Anemia is a com-mon nding in vitamin C de ciency, and it can be attrib- uted to the hemorrhagic symptoms and the role of ascorbicacid in iron absorption. (23) Infantile scurvy is rarely seenbecause human milk (if the maternal diet is suf cient) and formula provide an adequate supply of vitamin C. Infantile scurvy presents with bone abnormalities, bleeding, and anemia. (3) High-Dose Vitamin C for the Treatment of Upper Respiratory Tract Infections Supplementation trials have shown that vitamin C reduces the duration of colds, but this effect was not replicated in therapeutic trials. Further randomized controlled trials are warranted to investigate the role of vitamin C in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections. However,given its low cost and excellent safety pro le, it may be worthwhile for patients with common cold to try a thera-peutic dose of vitamin C. (24) VITAMIN D (CHOLECALCIFEROL) Introduction Rickets has plagued children, especially in the northeast- ern United States, since the 1800s. However, the bene cial effect of sunlight was not elucidated until 1921 when Hess and Unger reported a dramatic improvement in rachitic children who were exposed to the sun. (25) Contempora- neously, investigators observed that ultraviolet irradiation of milk and various foods imparted antirachitic activity. With this discovery it was thought that rickets was con- quered. (25) However, in the 19th century it became clear that vitamin D de ciency is a common problem in children and adults worldwide. In fact, the discovery that variouscells and tissues express the vitamin D receptor has high- lighted its many other nonskeletal functions. Now expertsbelieve that rickets is simply only the \"tip of the iceberg \"of the consequences of vitamin D de ciency. (26) Case J.L. is a 15-month-old white boy who fell off his bed and refused to walk afterward. He had been walking for about a month before this episode. His dietary history showed that he was breastfed until 6 months of age and then was placed on a mostly liquid diet consisting of water, juice, and some milk. Solids in his diet consisted of some baby food without dairy products. No supplemental vitamins were given . Physical examination was signi cant for underweight sta- tus (weight-for-length <5th percentile), length age of 9 months (his length was 70.6 cm), a prominent forehead, and swellingat the wrists. Radiographs of his leg revealed a distal left femur fracture, and wrist radiographs showed osteopenia with meta- physeal flaring . Vol. 39 No. 4 APRIL 2018 167 by guest on March 5, 2019 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from Laboratory studies showed a low-normal serum calcium level of 8.2 mg/dL (2.05 mmol/L), a low serum phosphorus level of (1.1 mmol/L), but elevated phosphatase and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) level was low at 11 ng/mL (27 nmol/L) . J.L. was given stoss therapy with a high dose of vitamin D (100,000 -600,000 IU given over 1 -5 days). The appearance of his wrist at 1 and 5 months of age showed gradual healing of hisrickets (Fig 2) . Denition of Vitamin D De ciency There continues to be much debate regarding what consti- tutes vitamin D de ciency, insuf ciency, and suf ciency. Vitamin D status is de ned by the level of serum circu- lating 25(OH)D. (27)(28) The Endocrine Society \u0081Vitamin D suf 100 ng/mL (75-250 nmol/L) The Endocrine Society determined these cutoff points using many criteria that affect bone metabolism, suchas PTH, bone mineralization, and intestinal calcium absorption. However, to establish vitamin D requirements through the life cycle at a population level, the IOM prioritizes specic end points associated with health outcomes. Accord- ingly, the IOM has questioned the premise that a serumlevel of 25(OH)D greater than 30 ng/mL ( >75 nmol/L) provides additional health bene ts. (29) At present, the IOM, the AAP, and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition also suggest 20 ng/mL(50 nmol/L) as the cutoff value for de ciency, (30) but the controversy continues regarding the level ofserum 25(OH)D that de nes suf ciency. Prevalence of Vitamin D De ciency Vitamin D de ciency is widespread around the world. (27) The NHANES studies examined thousands of American children and adolescents, which provides a reliable report of their vitamin D status. According to NHANES 2001 - 2004, 9% of US children and adolescents had vitamin D deciency (25[OH]D levels <15 ng/mL 15-29 ng/mL [37 -72 nmol/L]). (31) Causes and Risk Factors for Vitamin D De ciency Limited Sunlight Exposure. When absorbed by the skin, UV-B converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D 3,w h i c h is isomerized to vitamin D 3. There are many factors, such as skin pigment and use of sun screen, that infl uence the cutaneous production of vitamin D 3. Increased skin pigmentation causes the mel- anin to absorb most of the UV-B, resulting in much lower vitamin D 3production in African American individuals compared with white individuals for the same UV-B expo-sure. Sunscreen with a sun-protecting factor of 30 can reduce the skin 's ability to produce vitamin D by 95% to 99%.

Passage through glass or plastic and airpollution also dramatically reduces UV-B. (32) Limited Nutritional Intake in Infancy and Beyond. Breastfed infants and toddlers are at risk for vitamin D deciency. The content of vitamin D in human milk is greatly in fluenced by all the factors that affect maternal vitamin D status, such as sun exposure, skin pigmentation, season, latitude, and maternal vitamin D intake. The op- timal vitamin D supplement dose for nursing mothers is not yet established. However, studies have shown that ma-ternal supplementation of vi tamin D at 4,000 IU/d was not enough to consistently yield at least 400 IU of vitamin Dper liter of human milk. It is hypothesized that a supple- mental dose of 6,000 IU/d may be needed to achieve this effect. This should not undermine the value of human milk as a vital source of nutrition for infants but highlights the basis for the recommendation to supplement all infants who are breastfeeding or taking less than 1 L of formula per day with 400 IU of vitamin D daily. (33)(34) Beyond the rst year of life, an intake of 32 oz of vitamin D-fortied milk provides 400 IU of vitamin D. Fatty sh and other vitamin D -rich foods tend to be absent in most infant and adolescent diets, and the content of vitamin D infortied foods may be overestimated. For example, forti- ed cereal provides only 40 IU per serving. Thus, for children and adolescents who do not receive regular sun- light exposure, they may be at increased risk for nutritional vitamin D de ciency and insuf ciency. (35) The Effect of Obesity. The association between obesity and lower 25(OH)D serum concentration is well estab-lished. Possible mechanisms include lower dietary intake, sedentary behavior that tends to limit sunlight exposure, and sequestration of 25(OH)D in the adipose tissue. (36) Medications. Antiepileptic drugs and systemic gluco- corticoids have been shown to reduce 25(OH)D concen- trations when dietary sources of vitamin D and sunlight exposure are limited. Of note, there is no evidence that inhaled corticosteroids at a conventional dose given for 2 to 3 years have a negative effect on bone mineral density andbone turnover biomarkers, including 25(OH)D. (37) Orlistat and cholestyramine cause fat malabsorption and, thus, impair vitamin D absorption. (38) Diseases that Interfere with Vitamin D Absorption and Metabolism. Vitamin D absorption is chylomicron depen- dent; thus, children with fat de ciency. Cystic brosis, Crohn disease, and celiac disease are known risk factors for nutritional rickets.(38) Food allergies and small-bowel resection can also leadto fat malabsorption and vitamin D de ciency. (35) Genetic Factors. In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Powe et al report that more than 90% of African American individuals have a genotype that is associated with a lower level of vitamin D -binding protein compared with white individuals. (39) The authors spec-ulate that variation in vitamin D -binding protein levels may be responsible for observed racial differences in25(OH)D levels and the clinical manifestations of vitamin Dd eciency. (39) More research is needed to elucidate if genetic polymorphism plays a role in determining vitaminD requirements in different ethnic groups. Skeletal Consequences of Vitamin D De ciency A vitamin D -decient state is associated with reduction in intestinal calcium absorption from approximately 30% to40% to 10% to 15%. The body responds to the reduction in serum calcium with hyperparathyroidism. (35) Parathyroid hormone enhances calcium absorption in the renal tubules. It also caus es phosphaturia, leading to a low serum phosphorus level that causes a maturation de- fect in the chondrocytes with cellular ballooning and dis-ruption of the growth plate, leading to the widening at the end of the long bones that is characteristic of rickets. (35) Rickets can be divided into 3 stages (Fig 3). The rst stage is characterized by osteopenia and subclinical hy- pocalcemia. Bone pain and rachitic changes start in the second stage and become progressively worse in the third stage. (35) Clinically, rickets in children ranges from an asymp- tomatic disease to varying degrees of poor growth, bone pain, irritability, and gross motor delay. The signs of rickets include, but are not limited to, genu varum (bowing of the legs) or genu valgum (knock-knees),due to the lack of structural support as the child learns to walk. The widening at the end of the long bones is most commonly manifested in the wrist. The rachitic rosary is a term used to describe the beading along the anterior chestwall and is a result of the hypertrophy of the costochondral joints. (25)(35) In rare cases of severe maternal vitamin D de ciency, rickets can develop in utero. (33)(34) Nonskeletal Consequences of Vitamin D De ciency Every cell and tissue in the body has a vitamin D receptor. Therefore, vitamin D de ciency has been associated with a plethora of negative health consequences. (25)(40) Maternalvitamin D de ciency is associated with low birthweight (33) and is linked to increased risk of preeclampsia. (25)(40) Vol. 39 No. 4 APRIL 2018 169 by guest on March 5, 2019 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from Vitamin D de ciency has also been linked to increased risk of infectious disease, types 1 and 2 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and cancer,(40)(41) but controlled trials to determine causality are not available. Laboratory Evaluation of Vitamin D Status Circulating 25(OH)D level measured by a reliable assay isthe best indicator of vitamin D status and stores. Measure- ment of serum 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D) is not recommended because 1,25(OH)2D does not re flect vitamin D reserves and can be normal or elevated in pa-tients with vitamin D de ciency due to secondary hyper- parathyroidism. Measurement of the 1,25(OH)2D level is useful in conjunction with the PTH level in disorders of 25(OH)D and phosphate metabolism, such as chronic kidney disorders and vitamin D -resistant rickets. (27) In nutritional rickets, the classic biochemical pro le includes the triad of hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and vated alkaline phosphatase levels.Some the measure- ment of vitamin D -binding protein for better assessment of vitamin D status in Africa n American individuals and in diverse populations, (39) but more research is needed. Screening Universal screening of all patients for vitamin D de ciency is not recommended (27) and should be reserved and con-sidered only for high-risk patients, including but not limited to: \u0081Patients with nonspeci c symptoms, such as poor growth, irritability, and gross motor delay (35) \u0081Dark-skinned patients, especially those who live inhigher latitudes (27)(35) \u0081Children taking long-term glucocorticoids or seizure medications (27)(35) \u0081Children with chronic diseases that are associatedwith fat malabsorption, such as cystic brosis, in- flammatory bowel disease, (35) and post -bariatric surgery (27) Figure 3.

Sources and Forms of Vitamin D There are 2 sources of vitamin D. Cholecalciferol (D 3)i s synthesized in the skin and found in oily sh. Ergocalciferol (D2) is synthesized by plants and produced from the irradiation of yeast. Both forms are used to fortify milkand are found in dietary supplements, but vitamin D 2is the only prescription form available in the United States. (33)(42) Table 3 summarizes the pharmaceutical and sup- plemental sources of vitamin D. Calcidiol (25[OH]D), the form that de nes vitamin D status, is formed in the liver from vitamins D 2and D 3by the action of 25-hydroxylase. Calcitriol (1,25[OH]2D), theactive form of vitamin D, is created when a second hydroxy- lation occurs in the kidney and many other tissues in the body. (33)(42) Treatment of Vitamin D De ciency There are many strategies to treat vitamin D de ciency. Based on studies that examine the effect of D 2and D 3 administered in different doses on 25(OH)D serum level, experts estimate that 100 IU of vitamin D 2or D 3daily will raise the blood level of 25(OH)D by 1 ng/mL (2.5 nmol/L).(25)(26) Short-term administration of 2,000 IU of vita- min D 2or D 3daily yields an equivalent outcome to weekly 50,000 IU of vitamin D 2. (27)(43) Thus, pediatricians can individualize their treatment of vitamin D to meetthe patients 'and families' preferences and probability of compliance. When compliance is a major concern, stosstherapy ( stoss in German means to push), with doses of 100,000 to 600,000 IU given over 1 to 5 days, can beadministered to infants older than 1 month of age. (35) However, the recommendations of the stoss therapy, especially in outpatient settings, have b een met with controversy due to the risk of hypercalcemia. (43) In July 2011, the Endocrine Society published the fol- lowing guidelines for the evaluation, treatment, and pre-vention of vitamin D de ciency (27): \u0081I n f a n t s0t o1y a ro l d :2 , 0 0 0IU orally once daily or50,000 IU orally once weekly for 6 weeks until the 25(OH)D blood level is greater than 30 ng/mL ( >75 nmol/L), followed by maintenance therapy (400 - 1,000 IU/d) \u0081Children 1 to 18 years old: 2,000 IU orally once daily or 50,000 IU orally once weekly for 6 weeks until the blood level is greater than 30 ng/mL ( >75 nmol/L), followed by maintenance therapy (600 -1,000 IU/d) \u0081Use of a high dose (double or triple the 2 previously mentioned doses) is recommended for obese patients or patients taking medications or having conditions that affect vitamin D metabolism and/or absorption Prevention of Vitamin D De ciency: The DRIs and Other Recommendations The AAP recommendations on vitamin D supplementa-tion are in agreement with the IOM recommendations re- leased in 2011. The IOM propose d that healthy infants younger than 1 year of age consume 400 IU/d of vitamin D, andolder children (1 -1 8y e a r so l d )c o n s u m e6 0 0I U / d .( 3 5 ) ( 4 4 ) Dietary Sources of Vitamin D. Many children and ado- lescents in the United States do not consume most of the natural food sources of vitamin D in suf cient quantities. Furthermore, meeting the RDA of vitamin D would require an impractically large intake of forti ed food. For example, TABLE 3.

Human skin has a wonder- ful capacity to produce vitamin D 3, which is stored in the fat tissue and released during the winter months. Sensible sun exposure, de ned by the exposure of the arms and legs without sunscreen for 5 to 30 minutes between 10 AMand 3PMtwice a week, is often adequate. (26)(45) Toxicity Excessive intake of vitamin D can cause hypervitaminosisD and results in hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. (28) However, vitamin D intoxication is rare, and the cases re-ported were the result of inadvertent ingestion of extremely high doses of vitamin D for prolonged periods. (32) Sun- light exposure never causes vitamin D intoxication. (32) The UL of vitamin D intake should not exceed 1,000 IU for infants 0 to 12 months old and 2,000 IU for older children (28) unless de ciency has been documented and therapy is being monitored. VITAMIN E (TOCOPHEROL) Vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant that protects the cells from the damaging effects of free radicals. Cell damage due to free radicals has been linked to the development of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Structure, Sources, and the DRIs Vitamin E is abundant in many food sources, such as fruits,vegetables, meats, grains, and vegetable oils. Vitamin E is also available as a dietary supplement. Naturally occurring vitamin E exists in 8 forms ( a-,b-,g-, and d-tocopherols and tocoretinols). a-Tocopherol is the only form recognized to meet human requirements and is the form referred to in theDRIs as set by the IOM. (3) Adequate intake of vitamin E in the rst year of life is 4 to 5 mg/d of a-tocopherol. The RDA of vitamin E for children aged 1 to 8 years is 6 to 7 mg/d of a-tocopherol, with a UL of 200 to 300 mg. The RDA of vitamin E for children aged 9 to 13 years is 11 mg/d of a-tocopherol, with a UL of 600 mg. The RDA for age 14 years through adulthood is 15 mg/d of a-tocopherol, with a UL of 800 to 1,000 mg. (3) Vitamin E De ciency Because of its abundance in natural sources, vitamin Edeciency is rare and generally occurs as a result of fat malabsorption syndromes or in the setting of proteinenergy malnutrition. The main clinical symptom of vita- m i nEd e ciency is peripheral risk for vitamin E de ciency. Failure to supple- ment high-risk patients leads to a progressive neurologic disorder, including ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, proxi- mal muscle weakness, and ophthalmoplegia. These effects may be irreversible if the de ciency is longstanding. (47) Risk of Toxicity Supplements of vitamin E provide a-tocopherol with amounts that are more than or equal to 100 IU. These amounts are signi cantly higher than the RDAs. The possible effects of a high supplemental level of a-tocopherol remain uncertain. However, some adult studies suggest thatthe use of high doses of vitamin E may increase all-cause mortality. (48) Vitamin E supplement use is high in the US population. The most frequently reported motivation for use was to improve overall health. (49) The 1986 National Health In- terview Survey reports that supplements containing vita- min E are used by 37% of young children in the United States. (3) Excess vitamin E intake in individuals who aredecient in vitamin K or receiving anticoagulant therapy can lead to hemorrhagic toxicity. (3) There is no evidence of adverse effects from exposure to high levels of the vitamin E naturally occurring in foods. (3) Therapeutic and Preventive Use of Vitamin E Using pharmacologic doses of vitamin E as an antioxidant has been proposed for the treatment or prevention of many diseases. Vitamin E supplementation in preterm infants reduced the risk of intracrani al hemorrhage (ICH), and in the very low-birthweight infant it also reduced the risk of severe retinopathy. (50) However, the current evidence does not support the routine use of vitamin E supplemen- tation intravenously in high doses due to the increased risk of sepsis. (51) Several studies investigated the role of vitamin E and the reduction of oxidative str ess in the treatment of non- alcoholic steatohep atitis (NASH) and have led to variable results. (52)(53)(54) One of the largest studies in adults (247 patients) concluded that vitamin E at a dose of 800 IU/d was supe-rior to placebo in the treatment of NASH in nondiabetic a d u l t s .( 5 5 )T h es a m ed o s ei sp r o v e dt oo f f e rh i s t o l o g i c bene ts to children with biopsy-proven NASH, but more studies are needed before its use can be recommended inpediatrics clinical practice. (56) Vitamin E may have functions that are not related to its role as a free radical scavenger. Vitamin E has a positive Vol. 39 No. 4 APRIL 2018 173 by guest on March 5, 2019 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from e f f e c to nt h ei m m u n es y s t e ma n dap o s s i b l ep r o t e c t i v e effect against upper respiratory tract infection. Vitamin Ealso has anti-DNA mutagenic damage properties that may explain its protective effects against cardiovascular dis- eases, Alzheimer disease, and cancer. (5) FOLATE (PTEROYLPOLYGLUTAMATE) Introduction In 1931, Dr Lucy Willis demonstrated that a factor in yeast, subsequently shown to be folate, cured megaloblastic anemia of pregnancy. (57) In the 87 years since that original discovery, the roles of folate in the pathogenesis of neural tube defects (NTDs), vascular disease, and certain types of cancer have been established. Sources and the DRIs The term dietary folate is used to denote folate that occurs n a t u r a l l yi nf o o ds o u r c e sa n dt h em o r ea c t i v es y n t h e t i cform of folic acid used in forti ed food. Total folate is an umbrella term used to encompass all dietary and supple-mental exposure to folate and folic acid. (58) Rich food sources of folate include dark green vegeta- b l e s ,b e a n s ,a n dl e g u m e s .( 3 )H o w e v e r ,t h ef o o dr e t e n t i o n of folate is highly dependent on the type of food and the method of cooking. Folate from animal sources is more stable than folate in green vegetables, and steaming is superior to boiling for folate retention. (59) This has led to public health efforts to increase folic acid intake on apopulation level, especially since the nding that folic acid supplementation in the preconception period unequivo-cally decreases the incidence of NTDs. (60) The FDA authorized the addition of folic acid to enriched grain products in March 1996, with compliance mandatory by January 1998. (61) This resulted in a dramatic decrease in folate de ciency and NTDs. (61)(62) The RDA of folate is 150 mg/d for the rst 3 years after birth, then 200 to 300 mg/d for 4 to 13 years old and 400 mg/d thereafter. The RDA for pregnant women is 600 mg/d. The UL applies to folic acid from forti ed food and supplements and ranges from 300 to 1,000 mg/d. (3) Causes and Metabolic Indicators of Folate De ciency Isolated folate de ciency is rare; it is often associated with conditions that affect other nutrients. Small-bowel disor- ders associated with malabsorption, such as in flammatory bowel disease and celiac disease, can cause folate de - c i e n c y .P r e g n a n c y ,l a c t a t i o n ,a n dc h r o n i ch e m o l y t i ca n e - mia increase folate requirements. Other populations at risk for folate de ciency include premature infants andalcoholics. (46) Infants consuming unforti ed goat milk have classically been found to develop folate de ciency, manifesting as macrocytic anemia. Several medications, such as methotrexate and trimeth- oprim, act as folate antagonists and produce a de ciency by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase. Other medications that can lead to folate de ciency include anticonvulsants, anti- tuberculosis drugs, and oral contraceptives, but the mech-anism is unclear. (46) Serum or erythrocyte concentrations of folate are rea- sonable indicators of this vitamin status. Serum levels reflect relatively recent intake and can respond quickly; erythrocyte levels may be preferred as an indicator of chronic intake. Both MMA and homocysteine assays ob- tained in the setting entiate between B 12and folate de ciency. Both are elevated in B 12deciency, but only homocysteine is increased in folate de ciency. (11) Correction of macrocytic anemia with folate can mask an underlying B 12deciency and will allow progression of neurologic damage due to the l a t t e r .I ti s ,t h u s ,c r i t i c a l to distinguish folate vs B 12deciency before initiating treatment. Heath Consequences of Folate De ciency A decline in serum folate level occurs in approximately 2 weeks of consumption of a folate-de cient diet, and meg- aloblastic anemia occurs within weeks if the de ciency continues. (11) The effect of maternal folate status on pregnancy out- come is indisputable. There is a strong association between low maternal folate status and increased risk of NTDs. However, the association between folate status and the riskof other birth defects, such as cleft palate, is not as strongly established. (11) T h e r ei sa l s os t r o n ge v i d e n c eo fa ni n v e r s ea s s o c i a t i o n between blood folate concentration and the risk of low birthweight. (11) In adults, there is moderate evidence that low folate concentration is associated with a higher prevalence of depression, cognitive impairment, and dementia. The association between folate status and cognitive functionis weaker in children. (11) Folate and Chronic Disease Prevention Folate plays an important role in DNA synthesis and repair,but the research about its effect on carcinogenesis and cancer prevention has been contradictory, and this has led to its being called a double-e dged sword. Earlier studies suggested that the use of folate in adults can reduce the risk 174 Pediatrics in Review by guest on March 5, 2019 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from of colon cancer in women and men. (63)(64) However, randomized controlled trials did not con rm this effect and raised the possibility of a cancer-promoting effect. (65) More research is needed from a public health perspective o nt h ee f f e c to ff o l a t eo nc ancer risk and prognosis. Folate was also postulated to play a protective role against cardiovascular disease because of its role in lowering the homocysteine level, (66) but randomized controlled trials did not provide any evidence to support this role. (67) Risk of Toxicity No adverse effects have been attributed to excessive con-sumption of folate from food. Excessive intake from sup- plemental folate may obscure and potentially delay the diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B 12deciency, which can lead to neurologic damage. (3) VITAMIN K (PHYTONADIONE) In 1943, Dam and Doisy received the Nobel Prize inMedicine for elucidating the chemical structure of vitamin K. They named this fat-soluble compound K due to its role in\"Koagulation. \" Structure and Sources Vitamin K belongs to a family of molecules that share a2-methyl-1, 4-napthoquinone ring but differ in the iden- tity of the side chain at the 3-position. Vitamin K is present in plants as phylloquinone and is produced by bacteria in human and animal large intestine as menaquinone. The signicance of the gut microbial production of vitamin K is not clear because most of the absorption occurs in thesmall intestine. The small intestinal absorption of thisliposoluble vitamin is enhanced by dietary fat but also depends on the flow of bile and pancreatic enzymes. Vitamin K is stored in the liver. (3)(5) Dietary sources of vitamin K include green leafy vege- tables such as spinach and collard greens, soy and canolaoils, and margarine. The DRIs The data were insuf cient to recommend an Estimated Average Requirement and an RDA for vitamin K. Adequate intake of vitamin K intake is 2 to 2.5 mg/d for infants and 30 to 75mg/d for 1- to 18-year-olds. Others have recommended 1mg/kg per day. (68) No adverse effects were reported from high vitamin K intake from food or supplements in healthyindividuals who are not receiving anticoagulant drug ther- a p y .T h ed a t aw e r ei n s u f cient to establish a UL. (3)Functions and Consequences of Vitamin K De ciency Vitamin K is a cofactor for g-glutamyl carboxylase, the enzyme responsible for the modi cation of the side chain of some proteins from glutamate to g-carboxyglutamate. Most g-carboxylated proteins are clotting factors such as factors II (prothrombin) VII, IX, and X. This under-lies the essential role of vitamin K in the coagulation cascade. Other carboxylated proteins play an important role in calcium homeostasis and, thus, are important for bone and cardiovascular health. There is also emerging evidence about the protective effects of vitamin K against oxidativestress, age-related decline in motor and cognitive functions, cancer, and hepatitis C. (5) Clinically relevant vitamin K de ciency is rare and is usually limited to patients with lipid malabsorption syn- dromes or those who take certain medications (such as antibiotics, vitamin A, and vitamin E) that interfere with vitamin K metabolism. (3) In this review, we focus on the importance of recognizing the recrudescence of vitamin K deciency bleeding (VKDB), formerly known as hemor- rhagic disease of the newborn. Cases A 6-week-old infant presented to a tertiary care center emergency department with a 1-day history of poor breast- feeding, increased crying, pallor, and a \"full and hard \" anterior fontanelle. The medical history was relevant forexclusive breastfeeding and no vitamin K prophylaxis at birth. A full sepsis evaluation was initiated, and due to the bloody cerebrospinal fluid and the altered mental status, a head CT was obtained, which demonstrated a large ICH.The infant was treated with neurosurgical evacuation of thehematoma and administration of anticonvulsant agents. He remained seizure free with therapy but had a right hemiparesis and signi cant developmental de cit 3 months after ICH . This infant was 1 of 5 cases of late VKDB presenting to a tertiary care center in Tennessee between February andSeptember 2013, raising concerns about an increased oc- currence of late VKDB due to parental refusal of vitamin K prophylaxis at birth. All 5 infan ts were exclusively breastfed and did not receive vitamin K prophylaxis at birth. Their age range was 6 weeks to 5 months, and 2 of the infants were born at home. One of the infants presented with a gastro- intestinal bleed, and the other 4 had ICH. Of those who presented with ICH, 3 had varying degrees of developmental delay on follow-up.

Vitamin K de ciency bleeding can be classi ed as early ( <24 hours after birth), classic (2 -14 days), and late (2 -1 2w e e k sb u tc a nb es e e ni ni n f a n t su pt o 6 months old). Symptoms of VKDB range from mild \"warning bleeds \"(umbilical cord, gastrointestinal, or cir- cumcision bleeding) to severe (ICH). (5)(69) It is impor-tant to note that warning ble eds proceed ICH by days to weeks. (70) Newborn infants are at increased risk for VKDB for several reasons. First, the placental transfer of vitamin K is poor, and its half-life in the liver stores is short. Second, the newborn gut flora is immature and unable to produce vitamin K, rendering the newborn infant dependent ondietary intake as the main source of vitamin K. The exclusively breastfed infant is especially at risk for late VKDB because the human milk content of vitamin K is low; standard forti cation of infant formulas provides adequate intake. (5)(69) Incidence Early VKDB is rare and is almost exclusively related to maternal medications, especi ally antiseizure drugs, that increase the degradation of vitamin K (ICH occurs in20% -25% of such infants) (71). Classic VKDB often presents with mild symptoms such as gastrointestinal and umbilicus blood loss and rarelyICH; however, VKDB incidence without vitamin K pro- phylaxis is estimated to be 0.25% to 1.7%. (72) Late VKDB incidence in exclu sively breastfed infants with no vitamin K prophylaxis is 4.4 of 100,000 to 7.2 of 100,000. Infants with fat malabsorption syndromes (cystic b r o s i s ,c h o l e s t a t i cj a u n d i c e ,e t c )a r ee s p e c i a l l ya tr i s k ,a n d sometimes VKDB is the presenting symptom. (72) LateVKDB often presents with ICH. (73) Diagnosis In vitamin K -decient individuals, uncarboxylated vita- min K -dependent proteins, normally called \"proteins induced by vitamin K absence \"(PIVKA), are present in the blood and can be measured. PIVKA II, or uncarboxy-lated prothrombin, is a marker of subclinical vitamin K deciency and is usually present before the development of abnormal coagulation test results. (68)(73) Ac o n rmed case of VKDB should ful ll the diagnostic criteria of prothrombin time that is 4 times the control value, and at least 1 of the following: \u0081Normal or elevated platelet count, normal brinogen level, and absent brin degradation products\u0081Normalization of prothrombin time after vitamin Kadministration \u0081PIVKA (usually PIVKA II) level greater than that of healthy controls The prompt diagnosis of late VKDB can have important legal consequences in cases of suspected nonaccidental brain injury. Retinal hemorrhage, a signature of nonacci- dental brain injury, was recently documented in 2 con- rmed cases of VKDB. PIVKA II has a long half-life and can be of major value in retrospective diagnosis of VKDBeven weeks after the event. (73) Vitamin K Prophylaxis The AAP recommends that vitamin K be given to all new- b o r n sa sas i n g l ei n t r a m u s c u l a r( I M )d o s eo f0 . 5t o1m g . The AAP concludes that additional research is needed regarding the oral administration of vitamin K to prevent late VKDB. (72) Oral administration of vitamin K for the prevention of VKDB was promoted due to concerns regarding a pos- sible causal association between parenteral vitamin K and childhood cancer, a claim that was subsequently anddenitively debunked. Orally administered vitamin K prophylaxis, even with multiple-dose regimens, is asso-c i a t e dw i t har e s u r g e n c eo fl a t eV K D Bi ns e v e r a lc o u n - tries. (68)(72) Some oral regimens have proven ef cacy in the pre- v e n t i o no fl a t eV K D Ba n da r eu s e di nE u r o p e ,s u c ha st h e weekly administration of 1 mg of vitamin K for 12 weeks or 2 mg at weeks 1 and 4. However, oral vitamin K is not effective in the prevention of late VKDB in patients with liver disease or malabsorption. (68) Currently, the Cana- dian Paediatric Society suggests that oral vitamin K shouldbe given to newborns whose parents decline IM vitamin K as a 2-mg dose at birth and at weeks 1 and 6. (74) Talking Points for the Clinician when Parents Decline Vitamin K Prophylaxis After the recent increase of infants presenting with late VKDB, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted an investigation and determined that 28% of the parents for children born at local privatebirthing centers in Tennessee declined vitamin K pro- phylaxis. Some reasons for pa rental refusal include con- cern about an increased risk of leukemia, concern aboutthe use of a synthetic medication, and the impression that giving medications at birth is neither natural nor neces- sary for healthy term infants. There was a remarkable lack of awareness among the Tennessee families about the potentially life-threaten ing nature of late VKDB. (69) 176 Pediatrics in Review by guest on March 5, 2019 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from When faced with vitamin K refusal, the clinician should respectfully elicit the parents 'concerns and attempt to educate and correct any misinformation. The clinician can discuss the recent cases of late VKDB in Nashville, Ten- nessee, and point out that in all cases the parents had refused the vitamin K prophylaxis at birth. There is no expert consensus on whether circumcision should be refused or deferred in infants whose parents refuse vitamin K prophylaxis. When confronted with this request there are many considerations. First, there is no available data on the optimal timing of the procedure. Second, the medical provider and the nursing staff com- fort with this decision must be taken into analysis becausethey have to practically manage the bleeding should it occur. In contemplating the idea of suggesting oral vitamin K to parents who refused the IM injection, it is important to note that oral vitamin K preparations used in Europe with proven ef cacy are not available in the United States. The phytonadione 5-mg tablet is the only oral formulation ofvitamin K currently approved by the FDA. However, because giving a tablet to a newborn can be challengingand requires crushing or compounding, the injectable phytonadine (1 mg/0.5 mL) is sometimes given orally. Unlike the European vitamin K preparations, US formu- lations have not been studied for ef cacy. (74) One can argue that delivery o f some vitamin K is better than none, but when parents are offered oral vitamin K they seem to perceive it as equally effective as the IM injection. Some parents may consider the IM route if the oral form is not an option. There is also the ethical aspect of prescribing an unproven formulation for the preven- tion of a potentially life-threatening disease when a treat-ment of proven ef cacy exists.

Summary \u0081Thirty-four percent of US children and adolescents used vitamin supplements in the past month, and almost half of those children took a supplement daily. (1) Supplement users were morelikely to be Asian, white, or non-Hispanic; to belong to familieswith higher income and education; to be in good or excellent health; and to have access to health care. (2) (Evidence Quality B) \u0081Vitamin A de ciency is prevalent, especially in the developing world. In fact, vitamin A de ciency accounts for 1.7% of child mortality. (4) (Evidence Quality B) \u0081The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a vitamin Asupplement for children 6 months to 2 years old who are hospitalized for measles. (9) (Evidence Quality D) \u0081The recognition and treatment of vitamin B 12deciency is critical, especially in infants, because with early diagnosis it is a reversible cause of developmental regression and cognitive delay. (13)(14) (Evidence Quality D) \u0081In the exclusively breastfed infant, the most common cause ofB 12deciency is undiagnosed maternal pernicious anemia. Other etiologies include maternal gastric bypass surgery and vegetarian diet. (13) (Evidence Quality D) \u0081Neurologic symptoms secondary to B 12deciency can occur without hematologic abnormalities. (13) (Evidence Quality D) \u0081It is reasonable to suspect B 12deciency in any infant with failure to thrive and developmental regression. (14) (Evidence Quality D) \u0081Symptoms of vitamin C de ciency can develop after 30 to 40 days of consuming a diet that is void of vitamin C. (22) Scurvy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an at-risk child (especially in the setting of a developmental disorder and a restrictive diet) who presents with refusal to walk. (21)(22)(Evidence Quality D) \u0081Infants and children aged 0 to 1 year need at least 400 IU/d of vitamin D. Children 1 year and older need at least 600 IU/d of vitamin D. (27) (Evidence Quality A) \u0081Infants and children aged 0 to 18 years who are vitamin Ddecient can be treated with 2,000 IU/d of vitamin D 2or D 3, or with 50,000 IU of vitamin D 2or D 3once a week for 6 weeks to achieve a blood level of 25(OH)D greater than 30 ng/mL(>75 nmol/L). (27) (Evidence Quality B) \u0081Universal screening of all patients for vitamin D de ciency is not recommended and should be reserved and considered only for high-risk patients. (27) (Evidence Quality D) \u0081Vitamin E at a dose of 800 IU/d is bene cial for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in adults. More studies are needed before its use can be recommended in children. (55)(56) (Evidence Quality D) \u0081Since the Food and Drug Administration authorized the addition of folic acid to enriched grain products in 1996 there has been adramatic decrease in folate de ciency and neural tube defects. (61) (Evidence Quality C) \u0081Recognition of vitamin K de ciency bleeding (VKDB) is critical for prompt diagnosis and urgent therapy. Warning bleeds (umbilicalcord, gastrointestinal, or circumcision bleeding) precede ICH by days to weeks. (70) (Evidence Quality C) \u0081The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that vitamin K be given to all newborns as a single intramuscular doseof 0.5 to 1.0 mg. The AAP concludes that additional research is needed regarding the oral administration of vitamin K to prevent late VKDB.
