Burmen PhD, is a scientist, science educator, a science advocate, and the author of Anti-vaxxers: How to Challenge a Misinformed Movement. He recently sat down with Paulie Doyle to discuss the modern global anti-vax movement, and what healthcare professionals around the world can do to reassure patients who are sceptical of vaccines Covid-19 infections have risen in Ireland recently, prompting a number of anti-vax groups to claim on social media that vaccines are ineffective, or even dangerous. Some say vaccines are responsible for a high number of unreported sudden deaths across the country. Others that we now live an apartheid society, with the unvaccinated reduced to the status of second-class citizens. Then there are those who claim vaccines cause infertility, or that the government is running a dress rehearsal for future tyranny by implementing an unnecessary, overreaching mass vaccination campaign. Many of these arguments are read by people who are unfamiliar with the science behind vaccines, and have genuine concerns for their safety. The consequences are devastating: unvaccinated people make up two-thirds of ICU admissions, despite being just 8 per cent of the population. To understand why some of us believe the arguments made by vaccine-sceptics, it is important to know the history of the anti-vax movement, which has been recycling many of the same claims for over 150 years. That's one of the many reasons that Jonathan M. Burmen's book, Anti-vaxxers: How to Challenge a Misinformed Movement, is important. It traces anti-vaxxers back to their roots in the 19th century, when the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League was formed in response to Britain's Vaccination Act of 1853, which made smallpox vaccinations mandatory for all infants over four months old. Anti-vax sentiment can easily spread when left unchecked. Though Ireland has one of the highest vaccination rates when it comes to Covid-19, uptake for other vaccines has been lower at various points in history. Healthcare professionals, Burmen says, have a responsibility to understand the arguments that people are hearing - and learn to respond to them in an empathetic way. Q: In 'Anti-vaxxers: How to Challenge a Misinformed Movement', you mention a 19th century work by John Gibbs called 'Our Medical Liberties'. The arguments he makes - vaccines are an intrusion on personal rights; laws mandating vaccines were written on behalf of the medical trade; not all physicians think vaccines work, etc. - are strikingly similar to ones used by modern anti-vaxxers. My first question is this: are there any new arguments, specific to the modern anti-vax movement? A: It depends on how granular you get in your definition. Take for example, anti-vax arguments that developed in the 1970s in the US, where people would say 'this was developed from foetal cell tissues from aborted foetuses, and I don't want aborted cells in my body.' Because cell culture didn't exist in 1850, no one was using that exact argument. But if you categorise it as an argument about the safety of the vaccine then it's the same. If you categorise things broadly, then I don't think there's a lot that's very new: the classes of arguments people generate tend to mirror what's happened before over and over and over again. You previously said that the modern anti-vax movement has veered to the right in recent years - why do you think this shift has taken place? And are you familiar with the so-called 'cosmic right' movement, which merges new age wellness with far-right conspiracy theories? The phrase I've heard of is 'conspirituality'. Conservative spirituality. It addresses the same thing. I did a podcast interview a few months ago trying to address the movement. There's a fair amount of overlap now between wellness communities, new age spirituality communities, and conservatism. We had a coup attempt a few months ago. One of the most prominent images was that guy in the headdress who claimed to be a shaman. And that surprised people. But really there's this growing market of people who are politically conversative but do yoga, or aromatherapy or whatever. There's been a growing overlap there. This has coincided with far-right populist movements which point to elites as the source of problems in society. In some cases, they're pointing to a political class who seem to be born to rule. In others, they're pointing to scientists and saying 'oh, these scientists or elites look down on you'. They're not looking out for your best interests, they're just in it for the money.' Things like that. In the US, far-right populism has been centred around Donald Trump. When you have a powerful following around a personality and vaccine-usage become partisan, an issue of politics, it's the worst thing that can happen, because people's political views are so entrenched. What role does social media have in radicalizing people? And is it possible to adequately moderate all the anti-vax content? Surely not all moderators are going to have the expertise. That's hard. For a while I helped moderate a Facebook group I helped start. It went from me and one other person, to close to a million people, in a matter of two weeks. And that was difficult to do because the Facebook moderation tools are not good, and I have a job. Have you ever heard of a town with a million people that doesn't have a police force to keep people in check? You're always going to have bad actors. And Facebook has that problem on a bigger scale because they have billions of users. Facebook has an advisory board that's meant to be independent. However, if you look at the advisory board's makeup, it's mostly lawyers, some celebrities - no scientists. If you can have an advisory board helping you make decisions about political speech and what's allowable, then you can also have a board of scientists. Keep them independent, let them select their own membership - people who have a good reputation in immunology, infectious disease, epidemiology - and let them make the determination: what information is real. The algorithm they have now isn't very good. I posted one of my own articles and it was flagged as potential disinformation. The moderation has come out, but I think everyone knew it had two sets of rules. One set for celebrities, powerful people and so on, who could post things that would get other people banned. Another for everyone else. I've reported death threats where Facebook has said 'we've reviewed this, it's fine'. I think the problem is a matter of will, not a matter of capacity, for a company that wealthy. How can scientists and doctors reach out to certain groups of people who have good reasons to be sceptical of powerful institutions? There are people all over the world like this. If you're from Pakistan, you've seen the CIA run a fake Hep B campaign in your country. If you're African American, you know medical racism has historically been directed at your community. I don't trust the government either. But I can read the scientific papers and make a reasoned determination. And most people don't have a biology degree, right? Sometimes that mistrust is legitimate; on the other hand, the science is legitimate too. In my mind it's a matter of cutting out the government middleman and getting science to people. Helping people understand the science. If the government wants to send those messages, they need to do a better job of understanding that simply presenting facts to people is not sufficient. Peer groups have a role to play too. Take for example, when someone buys a car. I don't think many people make a spreadsheet and look at all the different engines, tyres etc. No, most people go and ask their friends what they think. The people around them. In their peer group. It's important to have representatives or ambassadors for every group that feels disenfranchised or mistreated by governments come in and say I understand your rage and distrust, but in this case, it's being done with honesty, and the science is good. It looks like we're going to be living with Covid for a very long time. Will anti-vaxxers play a bigger role in societies around the world, do you think? Their influence has waxed and waned over time historically. At one point they were influential enough that they had huge demonstrations with hundreds of thousands of people. Then smallpox got under control and for a while they weren't as loud. What really concerns me is how vaccine use is tied into our political language and life in some countries. Places like Texas now have state legislators pushing to remove all vaccine requirements. If it happens, then the legacy of this pandemic will be further outbreaks of disease that will happen in five or ten years. At some point, enough people will be vaccinated that the disease is no longer endemic. It will probably be similar in severity in most people to other upper respiratory infections that circulate every year. But that risk of a big outbreak will always be there unless we keep up immunity. I think we'd both agree that it's a civic duty for people to ensure that they don't spread disease. Do you think that pharmaceutical companies in turn have a duty to remove patents, ensuring that as many people as possible can access vaccines? There's a famous quote from Jonas Pal about developing the polio vaccine. He said: 'Could you patent the Sun?' I think if the research was done in good will and with government funds, then results of that research should be made as widely available as possible. One of the features of the ways vaccines work is that the more people take them, the better they work. We should be making sure that as many people get them as possible. If only the people in my country or yours get vaccinated, then they still have risk. That's why there's been vaccine diplomacy. Some countries are donating vaccines - nowhere near enough. The companies tend to be motivated by currency. Individual scientists of course have to get paid, but I don't know anyone who went into science to become rich. There's much better ways to do that than trying to survive on a grad-school stipend. They're doing it because they like science and they want to help people. But in order to do so, to get the resources they need, they have to work with these companies that are motivated by money. It's kind of a Faustian bargain. The companies aren't going to decide to act out of good will. They might for PR purposes. But otherwise, I don't expect them to do the right thing. Is there any advice would you give to healthcare professionals who are dealing with anti-vax or vaccine-reluctant patients in their practice? I'm not a physician, I'm a PhD scientist and a researcher. My training is physiology and biophysics. With that out of the way - I do teach at a medical school. A lot of what we're taught is to explain the reasons for things, to give rational reasons for why certain standards of care should be how people should be treated. When talking to people, their decision-making is not going to be rational. They're responding to fears that they have. They're not responding to scientific papers that say the vaccines aren't safe, though some people might cherry-pick papers. The conversation should be about identifying and addressing their actual fears. Why specifically are they hesitant, what have they heard, and how can you address the issues? If your patients are concerned about foetal tissue, or heard about myocarditis in teenage males in a trial, you can say 'can I help address any of those fears?' I know people are busy, but right now I think it's important to learn the arguments that people are hearing and learn to respond to them. Rudolf Virchow, the father of modern pathology, said that physicians are the natural attorneys of the poor. I think what he meant by that is that as a physician your role is not just to treat the body, but to understand the social conditions that create diseases and spread disease, and help patients address those. You're not a mechanic just fixing a car that rolls into the shop. You're asking the driver what happened. I think it's important for physicians to be civically engaged and be advocates for their patients. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. "}
