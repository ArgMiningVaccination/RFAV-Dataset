Harn) ABSTRACT Influenza is a global public health issue that results in considerable economic burden. Seasonal epidemics of this acute viral infection spread rapidly with unpredictable morbidity. The very young, the elderly and immune compromised are typically considered \"high-risk\" for developing severe symptoms and potentially life-threatening complications from influenza infection. Regular vaccination remains the most effective prevention, and as such, there is tremendous need for new technologies focused on improving immunogenicity and efficacy of seasonal flu vaccines that are safe for use in high-risk populations. Vaccine Self-assembling Immune Matrix (VacSIM) is a patent-pending delivery platform able to enhance immunogenicity and efficacy in a variety of different vaccine systems. VacSIM technology utilizes a synthetic hydrogel composed of a self-assembling peptide (SAP) in an aqueous solution. It is inert, biodegradable and self-assembles in situ. Traditional hydrogels rely on cross-linkers for self-assembly and require ex vivo polymerization prior to vaccine administration. VacSIM is a liquid ex vivo, providing flexibility to incorporate different vaccine components through simple mixing. Post-injection, VacSIM undergoes self-assembly in situ encapsulating vaccine components through the formation of a temporary vaccine depot. VacSIM delivery was observed to enhance vaccine-specific immune responses in a murine influenza model system. Specifically, mice immunized with inactivated A/Puerto Rico/08/34 (PR8) and CpG via VacSIM delivery had increased vaccine-specific antibody and T cell responses, greater protection from lethal, homologous challenge and improved ability to clear virus from their lungs. Studies involving other candidate vaccine antigens suggest VacSIM is capable of enhancing the immunogenicity and efficacy of a wide variety of vaccines. In addition, this vaccine delivery platform provides the flexibility to rapidly incorporate various types of antigens, adjuvants or organisms for vaccine delivery and therefore VacSIM has potential as a true \"Plug and Play\" vaccine platform technology.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW 1.1 Vaccines: Historical Beginnings Immunization is the process of priming the host's immune system to foreign antigens as a means of inducing protective immune responses. Thus, following pathogen exposure via immunization, there is either no infection or mild infection with limited symptoms. By 430 B.C.E. it was well known that smallpox survivors were immune to reinfection and due to their immunity, these individuals were frequently assigned to be caretakers of the sick (1). Rudimentary immunization or rather inoculation techniques were being practiced across Asia as early as the 12th century. The term 'variolation' refers to the intentional inoculation, often via an intradermal (i.d.) graft on an uninfected individual (generally the arm or leg) with biological material containing live smallpox virus, which resulted in the inoculated individual developing a localized infection (survivable version) of the disease. European records indicate that this technique left 20-60% of its survivors horribly scarred and had a case-fatality rate between 1-3% in adults (2) and 70-98% in infants (3). The high fatality associated with variolation techniques and the devastation of smallpox epidemics (400,000 smallpox-related deaths annually and 1:3 survivors left blind) continued to spread across 18th century Europe (4) and paving the way for Edward Jenner to pioneer smallpox vaccination (Figure 1.1) (5). In 1798, Jenner published the seminal smallpox vaccine paper outlining the hypothesis that exposure to vaccinia 2 (cowpox) a virus infecting cows but commonly known not to naturally infect humans was sufficient to provide protection from the smallpox virus (6). As evidence, Jenner outlined his findings collected over a one-year period, following his inoculation of a child with liquid residue transferred to a milkmaid's hands, which had been in contact with pustules shedding cowpox virus. Jenner's publication on vaccine inoculation against smallpox continued to be expanded and refined by innovative experimentalists like Emil Von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato, Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin leading to the emergence of several new scientific fields. Figure 1.1: Major milestones in the historical path of the development of vaccinology and vaccine design. EMBO Molecular Medicine Volume 6, Issue 6, pages 708-720, 6 MAY 2014 DOI: 10.1002/emmm.201403876. 3 Figure 1.1 depicts the major milestones accomplished through numerous technological advances in the fields of molecular biology, virology, immunology, and vaccinology (7). Both the 19th and 20th century are referred to as being a golden age of vaccines (7). The first golden age was brought about by innovators such as Pasteur, Koch, Ramon, Merieux, Salmon and Smith. This century led to establishment of the germ theory and vaccines incorporating live-attenuated or inactivated (killed) pathogens as well as inactivated toxins (toxoids) (7-10). In the 20th century, a second golden age of vaccine development, was initiated by innovations in cell culture technology and scientists such Salk, Enders, Sabin, and Plotkin. The ability to propagate virus in cell cultures provided a means of attenuating viral vaccines (7, 8, 11-15). Following establishment of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 1946), the World Health Organization (WHO, 1948) and mass-immunization campaigns such as the Global Smallpox Eradication Program (WHO launched in 1967), naturally occurring smallpox was eradicated. Controlling the spread of infection, towards the eventual elimination of vaccine-preventable diseases requires that the majority of the population be immune to the particular infectious disease. This immune protection can be acquired through previous exposure to an antigen associated with that particular infectious disease. Exposure is typically in the form of a prior infection or effective vaccination with a disease-associated antigen, triggering the body's immune defense systems and leading to the production of specific antibodies and antigen-specific memory cells (Figure 1.2). Immune protection requires antigen-specific effector cells, which target and clear the pathogen, as well as an effective immune memory response, derived 4 from long-lived antigen-specific cells capable of rapidly responding to subsequent pathogen exposures (Figure 1.3). When the vast majority of the population is immune to an infectious disease such as smallpox or polio for example, the likelihood of disease outbreak is significantly decreased. This concept is an essential step in the eradication of any vaccine-preventable disease and is often referred to as \"herd immunity\" because the population's unvaccinated minority has a decreased risk of infection, which is correlated to the fact that the majority of the population is vaccinated. In the Spring of 1980, WHO announced Figure 1.2: Primary immune response and development of antigen-specific memory. In the case of natural infection, exposure to an unknown pathogen, a healthy immune system begins to mount a response made up of specific antibodies and effector T cells that target and clear the unknown pathogen. This also occurs following initial exposure to vaccinating antigen (\"x\" or \"y\") with the peak response generated after 5-10 days. Due to antigenic memory response, repeat exposure to vaccinating antigen results in an immune response that also develops more rapidly, with the response peaking after only1-3 days.

Now in the 21st century, the threat of infection with polio virus has been eliminated in most countries and various global aid and mass-immunization organizations such as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Rotary International, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are working with the CDC and WHO towards the successful eradication of polio virus and other vaccine-preventable diseases. Besides access to clean drinking water, vaccines are the most important public health tools utilized in the prevention of infectious diseases (11, 16). 1.2 Modern Vaccines and Avenues for Improvement Through the years, researchers became increasingly aware of the complexities surrounding the various infection strategies posed by different bacterial and viral disease agents, as well as the counter-strategies being utilized by the host's immune system (Figure 1.3). Simultaneously, many different avenues for vaccine design were being explored and although some were more successful than others, these studies led to the development the various types of vaccines in use today. Table 1.1 outlines the different types of modern vaccines: 1) live-attenuated vaccines, which contain a weakened form of the infectious virus or bacteria, 2) inactivated vaccines, which contain a non-infectious protein/subunit or fragmented pieces of the whole virus or bacteria, 3) toxoid vaccines, which contain a chemical or toxin produced by the virus or bacteria and 4) biosynthetic or virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines, which contain synthetic mimics of the infectious virus or bacteria and are, therefore, noninfectious (17, 18). 6 Table 1.1: Types of vaccines and their immune correlates (18). Vaccine Type Diseases w/ this Type of Vaccine Vaccine-induced Immune Response Live-attenuated Measles of immune responses by vaccination. Reprinted with kind permission from Springer Science and Business Media: Advances in Polymer Science 247, 2012, 31-64, Biodegradable Nanoparticles as Vaccine Adjuvants and Delivery Systems: Regulation of Immune Responses by Nanoparticle-Based Takami Akagi, Masanori Baba, Mitsuru Akashi,( Fig.1). Copyright \u00a9 2012. 7 Effective vaccines should include adequate antigen and/or adjuvant containing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) for the host immune system to view as \"danger signals\" and trigger an innate immune response (19). The type of vaccine used typically affects the overall vaccine response due to the specific influencers being utilized to activate an innate immune response (20). In general, these \"danger signals\" trigger inflammatory signal cascades and recruit immune responders, also known as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Vaccines containing inactivated (non-infectious) material can induce high levels of vaccine-specific antibodies, which may prevent or minimize infection levels as well as contribute towards clearance of extracellular pathogens through various mechanisms (Table 1.2). Table 1.2: Vaccine-triggered mechanisms of effector function and protection. Adapted from \"Vaccines\" 6th ed., by Stanley Plotkin, Walter Orenstein and Paul Offit, (Chapter 2, Table 2-1). The majority of modern vaccines provide vaccine-induced protection though the induction of antigen-specific serum IgG (21). However, vaccine-induced specific antibody responses tend to diminish over time, thus these vaccines containing inactivated antigen typically require \"boosters\" and/or addition of an immune-potentiating adjuvant Effectors Vaccine-induced Action Mechanisms Aiding in Protection Specific antibodies Prevent and/or reduce infection - Bind enzymatic active sites, prevent diffusion - Inhibit binding, neutralize viral replication - Opsonophagocytosis of extracellular bacteria - Activate complement cascade CD8+ T cells Reduce infection, control & clear intracellular pathogens -Kill infected cells directly by releasing granzyme/perforin - Kill infected cells via antimicrobial cytokines CD4+ T cells Contribute to reduction, control & clearance of extracellular & intracellular pathogens - Produce IFN-, TNF-/, IL-2 and IL-3, support activation & differentiation of Th1-type cells (B cells, CD8+ T cells & macs) - Produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-6 & IL-10, support activation & differentiation of Th2 cells 8 or delivery system in order to maintain protection (22). Vaccines containing live-attenuated infectious material can induce CD8+ T cells, which assist in pathogen control and clearance in addition to inducing a robust, specific antibody response. Live-attenuated vaccines (LAV) are able to generate a more sustained specific-immune response, compared to inactivated vaccines. Although LAVs are typically the most effective at generating a protective immune response, because they contain infectious material there are many limitations, such as the type of pathogen, the route of delivery as well as the age and health status of the individual being vaccinated. Improving vaccine formulation and delivery as well as vaccine efficacy (VE) and durability remain vital areas of research. Despite the discovery of numerous candidate antigens specific for each disease, effective vaccines have yet to be developed for many infectious diseases including HIV, TB and malaria. Additionally, in an epidemic or pandemic scenario, it is vital to have a vaccine option capable of inducing protective immune responses or enhancing weak responses after only a single vaccination. 1.3 Vaccine Adjuvants The term \"adjuvant\" is broadly defined and can refer to a myriad of different compounds whether chemical or biological, naturally occurring or synthetic, so long as the addition results in an increased immune response (23). Initially, adjuvants were thought to fall into one of two categories based on their observed or hypothesized mode of action; those that functioned as immune-modulators (directly stimulating the innate immune system) or as a delivery system (inducing controlled antigen release and/or triggering the inflammasome). 9 Table 1.3: Compounds with known adjuvant activity (22-24). Decades of research and clinical trials have resulted in a diverse collection of compounds with confirmed adjuvant activity (Table 1.3) (22-24). Although the precise mechanisms of many adjuvants remain at least partially unclear, decades of research has lead to a collection of hypothesized mechanisms for various immune stimulating adjuvants (23). An adjuvant or delivery system may bolster the immune response (directly/indirectly) through any one or a combination of the following methods. An adjuvant may cause formation of a depot at the injection site, which has been associated with sustained or slow-release of antigen. It may induce the transient secretion of cytokines and chemokines, inducing recruitment of immune cells back to the injection site. APCs express various pattern recognizing receptors (PRRs) intracellularly (i.e.: NLRs) and on their surfaces (i.e.: TLRs), which recognize and ligate adjuvants, leading to increased antigen uptake and presentation. An adjuvant may bolster APC activation & maturation, resulting in increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC-II) as well as co-stimulatory molecules. Adjuvants may also improve the ability of APCs Compounds w/ Adjuvant Activity Example Adjuvants synthetic 10 to process and present antigen or increase migration of mature APCs to the draining lymph nodes (dLNs), where they are able to interact with antigen-specific B and T cells. Adjuvants may also stimulate activation of the inflammasome (Table 1.4). In the 1920s alum became the first adjuvant licensed for use in humans. Alum refers to precipitates of either aluminum phosphate and/or aluminum hydroxide upon which the vaccinating antigens or organisms are adsorbed. This process is highly time and labor intensive (25, 26). Today, nearly a century later, alum remains the most common adjuvant in human vaccines. A track record that spans this many decades has only reinforced alum's safety; however, aspects of its immune-stimulating mechanism(s) are still being debated. It was 80 years following alum licensure before a non-aluminum salt adjuvant was approved for human vaccines (27). Adjuvant reactogenicity is a concern that continues to be relevant in the process of development and licensure of new adjuvants. Freund's adjuvant, for example, was shown to be extremely reactogenic and therefore not acceptable for licensure (28). The mechanistic \"black box\" of adjuvant activity and potential reactogenicity are key factors related to vaccine adjuvant licensure, which remains a slow, tedious and frequently disappointing process. Un-methylated DNA (CpG-ODN) is an effective and frequently used adjuvant for research purposes and makes a good case-study example for the arduous process of getting vaccine adjuvants approved for use in humans. In 2013, Dynavax's Hepislav vaccine candidate for hepatitis B completed phase-III clinical trials using CpG-ODN (1018) as an adjuvant (24, 29). Despite undergoing repetitive clinical trials, CpG/immune stimulating sequences (ISS) has not yet been approved by the United State's Food and Drug Association (FDA) following phase-III human clinical trials, due 11 to reactogenicity concerns (29). Dynavax's Hepislav vaccine candidate adjuvanted with ISS began a new phase-III human clinical trial shortly afterwards, and results of their most recent clinical trial should be available by the end of 2015 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02166671). CpG-ODN functions as a TLR-9 agonist through the activation of MyD88, IRAK and TRAF-6 (24). As a vaccine adjuvant, CpG has been shown to induce DC maturation, increase antibody production as well as CD8+ T lymphocytes (T cells) (30, 31). By 3-hours post vaccination with pro-inflammatory IL-2, IL-12, IL-18 are up-regulated (30, 31). Recent efforts to improve vaccines have led to the generation of new delivery methods in addition to traditional formulations incorporating an adjuvant (32-37). These alternative vaccine delivery methods utilize approaches such as virosomes (38-40), liposomes (41-43), layer by layer formulations and microneedle nanoparticle technology (44, 45) as well as vector-based strategies (46-48). Although still being investigated, current reports indicate drawbacks are associated with each of these delivery approaches; either associated with reactogenicity and regulatory issues, product stability or required formulation steps. Recently, there has been increasing emphasis on vaccine formulations containing a combination of adjuvants with complementary activity as well as combining traditional adjuvants with new delivery methods (23). These strategies have been employed experimentally as a means of increasing vaccine-specific immune responses, either by improving antigen stability, APC presentation, balancing adjuvant-specific immune bias or reducing reactogenicity. This combination strategy also has the potential to generate a \"smart adjuvant\", capable of specific targeting/activation (22, 49). 12 Table 1.4: Common vaccine adjuvants, their current regulatory status, their immune-stimulating activity and the known or hypothesized mechanism of action (22-24, 50).

Hydrogels are composed predominately of water but possess both hydrophobic and hydrophilic characteristics, which allows them to alternate phases depending on environmental stimulators (51, 52). It is because of this biphasic nature that hydrogels are capable of forming highly organized, water-insoluble, 3-dimensional structures (53). This is accomplished through intricate networks of hydrated, cross-linking chains forming a lattice-based structure commonly utilized as scaffold or semi-porous barrier (54, 55). Often hydrogels existing in an aqueous phase are triggered to begin self-assembly by external stimuli, such as environmental fluctuations in light, temperature or pH (54). Although predominately composed of water, many hydrogels are excluded from being developed for clinical use because they require toxic cross-linkers for self-assembly, such as the petroleum-based polyethylene glycol (PEG)-linkers or because they contain harmful degradation products such as methacrylates or alginates resulting from hydroxyethyl methacrilates (HEMA) and such as alginate, chondroitin sulfate, chitosan, and hyaluronic acid. Various natural and synthetic hydrogel constructs have been evaluated for clinical applications such as tissue engineering (56, 57), drug delivery (58) and vaccine delivery (59-61). Incorporation of short, self-assembling amino acid sequences at the C-terminal domain of certain peptide epitopes have been shown to boost immunogenicity (62). Recent studies reported that mice vaccinated with a peptide epitope conjugated to the self-assembling peptide domain Q11 led formation of antigenic nanofibers, able to induce a vaccine-specific protective serum antibody response (63, 64). 14 Intradermal vaccine delivery via microneedles is an alternative to traditional intramuscular and intranasal vaccine routes that takes advantage of the unique immune environment (APC prevalence) of the skin. This approach addresses issues such as poor vaccination compliance due to trypanophobia or discomfort related to traditional immunizations, as well as reducing the amount of antigen required per dose. Vaccines delivered via microneedles can be coated onto an array of tiny metal needles, encapsulated within polymers (65) or loaded in hollow needles (66, 67). Over the years, numerous experimental modifications to improve the influenza vaccine have been tested. These include adjuvants (32-37) as well as viral (47, 48, 68) and non-viral vectors (38-43). Unfortunately, these attempts were minimally successful and/or have limited translational appeal. Development of a flexible vaccine delivery method could be utilized with a multitude of vaccines, with particular relevance in marginally efficacious vaccines and populations of immune compromised or low-responding individuals. 1.5 Influenza Virus and Host Infection Influenza, historically referred to as the \"grippe\", is caused by successful infection of the host's upper respiratory tract (URT) by influenza viruses. Influenza \"flu\" viruses contain single-stranded, negative-sense RNA and belong to the orthomyxoviridae family. There are three known influenza virus types (A, B, C). Infection with type C leads to minor symptoms and is not believed to contribute to seasonal epidemics like type A and B viruses. Influenza A viruses are the most prevalent of circulating influenza viruses, several of which are able to infect multiple species (human, avian, swine, fruit bats, etc.). Influenza A viruses have an 8-segmented genome which encode for various 15 viral proteins, 11 of which are described in Table 1.5 (69). Type A viruses are further classified into subtypes based on the expression of the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which are antigenically variable. This variability is a result of antigenic shift, stemming from genetic changes occurring during viral replication, which leads to production of new viruses with alternative surface glycosylation patterns. Currently, 18 different HA and 11 different NA subtypes have been reported (70) to bind receptors on the surface of human epithelial cells. 16 Figure 1.4: Diagram of the lung and respiratory tract. Images on the right are magnified, cartoon views of tissue structures of the conducting airways (i.e. trachea, bronchi and bronchioles) and alveoli in the parenchyma region. The mucosal tissue of the conducting airways consists of ciliated epithelium and mucus producing goblet cells which remove inhaled antigens through upwards mucociliary clearance, with the help of secretary IgA produced by local plasma cells. Blind-ended alveolar sacs are lined by a specialized, thin-walled epithelium to aid gas exchange with the underlying capillaries. Immunosuppressive alveolar macrophages and serum-derived antibodies provide a final line of protection against invading pathogens. A cellular and humoral immune response can be generated after interaction with innate immune receptors present on epithelial cells and tissue-resident dendritic cells.

Upon entering the URT, virions bind to sialic acid via glycoprotein HA (Figure 1.5). Virions enter the host cell via an endosome vesicle that undergoes acidification, allowing bound HA monomers to be cleaved at the stem base by a trypsin-like enzyme into HA1 and HA2. Cleavage results in a conformational change, activating the membrane fusion function of HA2, which in combination with the close proximity leads to membrane fusion of the virus envelope to the endosome. The low pH triggers the integral membrane protein, M2, to open its proton channel. As the virion becomes more acidic, due to the influx of protons, there is a dissociation/uncoating of Figure 1.5: Influenza virus infection and propagation within host cells.

The combination of events leads to release of the nucleocapsid into the host cytoplasm. Viral material traffics to the nucleus due to nuclear targeting sequences present in the nucleoprotein (NP). Upon reaching the nucleus the virus hijacks the cell's production machinery to propagate more virus particles. Newly produced proteins remain in the cytoplasm, except for NP, which return to the nucleus. An infected host cell will continue virus replication and new virions are released through budding at the plasma membrane. Table 1.5: Influenza A virus genes and proteins.

Seasonal influenza is an acute infection that hospitalizes 200-250,000 and kills approximately 36,000 persons annually in the United States alone (74). Symptoms of infection present rapidly and include high fever, headache, muscle pain, cough, sore throat and rhinitis. Infections in high-risk populations, such as those under 5 or over 65 years old and immune compromised, often lead to more severe and potentially life-threatening complications such as influenza-associated encephalitis or encephalopathy (75), and pneumonia. Pneumonia is seen as primary influenza pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia, including severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia due to MRSA (76). Influenza vaccine effectiveness is assessed by established correlates of protection, which include seroconversion (able to generate 4-fold higher specific antibodies than pre-vaccination) and seroprotection (capable of inducing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers 1:40 post-vaccination) (77). According to the package insert (www.FDA.gov) the immune mechanisms of action responsible for conferring protection following vaccination with FluMist\u00ae Quadravalent are still unclear; however, it is speculated that serum antibodies, mucosal antibodies, and influenza-specific T cells are involved. Vaccine-induced specific antibodies block virus binding to sialic acid receptors on epithelial cells, bind surface Fc receptors and may also be involved in intracellular virus neutralization, preventing virion egress from infected cells (78, 79). Intracellular 20 neutralization by flu-specific IgG is thought to require shuttling by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). Multiple virus strains are incorporated into vaccines against seasonal influenza epidemics to provide broader exposure. There are two types of influenza (A and B) known to contribute to seasonal epidemics in humans (Figure 1.6). The most effective method to prevent influenza infection is through annual vaccination. Influenza vaccines are typically effective by two weeks post immunization, but protection is variable depending on age and health status. There are numerous types of influenza vaccines available, including LAIVs (i.n.), and inactivated subunit vaccines (i.m./i.d.). The only seasonal vaccine recommended for high-risk populations is whole-inactivated split influenza virus. Individuals 65 years and over are recommended to receive the Fluzone high dose vaccine, which contains 4x more HA and represents a vaccine subgroup within whole-inactivated split influenza virus vaccines. A recent study Figure 1.6: World Health Organization Influenza Nomenclature. Note: Influenza type B does not occur as subtypes. Image constructed using Microsoft\u00ae PowerPoint\u00ae for Mac 2011 v. 14.4.8 (150116). 21 conducted in adults over the age of 65 showed the high dose vaccine to be 22% more effective than the standard seasonal vaccine (80). The CDC estimated the overall vaccine efficacy for influenza in 2013-2014 to be 61% (95% confidence interval = 52%-68%) (81), with lower efficacy in high-risk populations (81-83). Vaccine efficacy fluctuates depending on factors such as the year, virus type and population group. According to the current director of the CDC's NCIRD, Anne Schuchat, the 2013-2014 influenza vaccine was 67% effective in children aged six months-17 years, 60% effective in adults aged 18-64 years and 52% effective in seniors over the age of 65. Although 52% effectiveness may seem unacceptably low, 52% is an improvement from the 2012-2013 vaccine which was only 32% effective in seniors (84). In addition to high-risk populations being at greater risk of developing complications from influenza infection (85-87), they typically have decreased protection from vaccination. Thus, there is a tremendous need for new vaccine delivery methods and/or adjuvants capable of significantly improving immunogenicity and efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccines for use in high-risk populations (88-91). In contrast to healthy adults under the age of 65, infections in high-risk populations, such as the elderly, the very young and the immune compromised, often lead to more severe and potentially life-threatening complications (76, 82, 83, 92, 93). Due to their heightened risk, the only seasonal vaccine recommended to these individuals is intramuscular injection of whole-inactivated virus, which is only marginally effective in high-risk populations. Regular vaccination against annual epidemics remains the most effective prevention and as such, there is tremendous need for new vaccine delivery methods and/or adjuvants, capable of significantly improving immunogenicity and 22 efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccines that remains safe for use in high-risk populations (73, 88-91, 94). 1.6 References 1.

Synthetic (RADA)4 was designed to imitate the amphiphilic segment of naturally occurring EAKA 16-II (EAEAKAKAEAEAKAKA), found in the yeast Zuotin protein. Known as both RADA16-I and (RADA)4, this engineered biomaterial was named for its composition (RADARADARADARADA) of a repeating, alternatively charged, 16 amino acid (arginine=R, alanine=A, aspartic acid=D) sequence (Figure 2.1) (5). When exposed to water, these peptides form stabile beta-sheets with distinct polar and non-polar surfaces due to the alternating ionic, hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acid repeats (Figure 2.2) (2, 6). Under physiologic conditions of Figure 2.1: Molecular models of the RADA16-I, RADA16-II, EAK16-I and EAK16-II self-assembling peptides. Each molecule is ~5nm in length with 8 alanines on one side and 4 negative and 4 positive charge amino acids in an alternating arrangement on the other side. Reprinted (5) with permission of Taylor and Francis Group LLC, Copyright (2005). 31 salinity, beta-sheets continue self-assembly into hydrated nanofibers, on a scale similar to extracellular matrix, generating a highly organized and three-dimensional, porous scaffold (Figure 2.3) (7, 8). Depending on the concentration, the resulting nanofibers have a diameter range between 10-20 nm and three-dimensional scaffold pore sizes can range in diameter from 5-200 nm (5). In 2002 the RADA-based patents (US 5,670,483, US 5,955,343, US 2002/0160471, WO 02/062969) were acquired by 3-D Matrix Inc., and the synthetic (RADA)4 self-assembling peptide (SAP) was further developed and commercialized. The product known as PuraMatrix Peptide Hydrogel was initially marketed to researchers as a synthetic matrix for use in cell culture experiments requiring defined three-dimensional microenvironments both in vivo and ex product no. 354250). PuraMatrix Peptide Hydrogel is produced and quality tested by 3-D Matrix Inc. according to proprietary protocols, which incorporate F-MOC solid-phase peptide synthesis, aseptic fill-finish, liquid formulation and sterile filtration. The final product is available as a transparent, 1% solution of aqueous peptide, which is both biocompatible Figure 2.2: Schematic of design strategies (left) and assembled structures (right) for selected engineered peptide and protein materials.

Solutions of the (RADA)4 oligopeptide have undergone third party testing, demonstrating no reactogenicity or toxicity (10), leading to clinical trials for multiple applications including, wound healing, tissue repair (11) and as scaffolding for dental implants (12, 13). 3D Matrix Inc. has expanded their product line and now includes PuraStat\u00ae Synthetic Surgical Hemostatic Agent (2.5% semi-viscous Figure scaffold.

Reprinted from the Journal of Controlled Release (2) with permission from Elsevier. 33 2.2 Vaccine Delivery Conception The base-concept that initiated and eventually led to development of the vaccine delivery platform technology, VacSIM, was proposed as a strategy to increase antigen presenting cell activation and maturation via presentation of vaccine components as particulates, or a porous 3D scaffold. Particulate vaccine components and/or 3D porous scaffold presentation of vaccine components should increase vaccine antigen persistence, and antigen persistence is thought to contribute to the duration of immune memory. Initially, a semi-viscous commercial extracellular matrix (ECM) material known as Matrigel (BD Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix (currently available as Corning\u00ae Matrigel\u00ae matrix) was obtained and tested, in an attempt to enhance vaccine immunogenicity. Matrigel is a preparation of solubilized basement membrane originating from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) mouse sarcoma. According to the manufacturer, the Matrigel preparation contains laminin, collagen IV, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, nitrogen, TGF- and various growth factors including epidermal, insulin-like and fibroblast. The first vaccine study employing this strategy, utilized a purified, recombinant Schistosoma mansoni circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) as vaccine antigen delivered to mice in the BD cell culture product, Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix to produce monoclonal antibodies to CCA (14). The Grenfell study demonstrated the superiority of Matrigel to deliver schistosome CCA as compared to other vaccine delivery methods/adjuvants. A separate experiment was designed to test Matrigel\u00ae delivery of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen (rHepBsAg). As hypothesized, Matrigel was an effective adjuvant delivery system, inducing potent antigen specific 34 antibody responses, not seen in mice vaccinated with rHepBsAg in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)(15). Concerned that the basement membrane matrix molecules, contained in Matrigel would prevent further development of this 3D porous matrix approach of vaccine delivery for use in human vaccines, a synthetic alternative was preferable. Additionally, it was unclear whether the components within Matrigel could be responsible for the adjuvanted response, rather than the physical properties of the membrane-matrix leading to persistence of antigen. The BD available product, PuraMatrix Peptide Hydrogel was proposed as a possible alternative to Matrigel. PuraMatrix is simply a 1% solution of the (RADA)4 synthetic oligopeptide in sterile solution and thus represented a far less complicated delivery system. The results indicated that in Th2-biased BALB/c mice, inclusion of PuraMatrix increased specific antibody levels in the sera and were maintained out to five weeks post prime, compared to mice receiving rHBsAg alone, in combination with Matrigel or adjuvanted with Alum, CFA or CpG-ODN (Figure 2.4) (15) (full text in Appendix A). 35 2.3 Developing a Vaccine Platform Technology The use of PuraMatrix\u00ae to deliver vaccines was not an anticipated application by 3D-Matrix Inc., and is therefore an innovative application of this technology. The trademarked name \"VacSIM\" stands for Vaccine Self-assembling Immune Matrix and Figure 2.4: rHepBsAg-specific humoral responses are enhanced and sustained by VacSIM. (A) Kinetic evaluation of rHBsAg-specific IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies in sera of immunized BALB/c mice (n=10, pooled from 2 independent experiments) were determined by ELISA. Immunization times are indicated by arrowheads. (B) rHBsAg-specific IgM (upper panel) and IgG (lower panel) levels from sera collected 21 days post-immunization. (C) The IgG1:IgG2a ratio was determined at 35 days post-immunization. Statistical differences (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, post-test. Copyright \u00a9 American Society for Microbiology (15) full text in Appendix A. 36 refers to the vaccine delivery method (patents-pending) being evaluated. VacSIM is comprised of a 1.0% solution of PuraMatrix\u00ae, which is easily combined with other vaccine components through simple mixing. The results presented in this dissertation outline the initial experiments utilized for evaluation and development of VacSIM as a vaccine delivery platform, with specific emphasis on assessing its ability to improve immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy (VE) of a whole-inactivated influenza vaccine, in a murine model. Additional experiments were necessary to evaluate whether a similar immune effect could be generated with an alternative antigen and ultimately, whether this new method could be further developed and broadly utilized as a vaccine delivery platform. Immunized mice were vaccinated with either rHBsAg or influenza recombinant nucleoprotein (rNP), via subcutaneous (s.c.) injection, following the previous schedule (boost 3 weeks after prime) and utilizing both Th1- and Th2-biased mouse models (C57BL/6 IgA endpoint titers from sera collected 3 weeks post prime were used to compare na\u00efve and vaccinated (Ag+Alum, Ag+CpG, Ag+CpG+VacSIM). The results from these experiments confirmed that immunizing mice with rHBsAg+CpG in VacSIM generates increased production of rHBsAg-specific antibodies (Figure 2.5) (15) (full text in Appendix A). 37 Elevated rNP-specific endpoint titers in mice vaccinated with rNP+CpG in VacSIM indicates the immunogenicity effect is not confined to rHBsAg (Figure 2.6). Additionally, because elevated titers are visible (Ag+CpG+VacSIM) in both Th1- and Th2-biased mouse models, the effect does not appear to be limited to either a Th1- or Th2-predominant immune response (15). Taken together, these findings confirm that VacSIM, composed of the synthetic (RADA)4 oligopeptide PuraMatrix, has the Figure 2.5: Immunization with rHBsAg-specific antibody titers in both Th1- and Th2-biased mouse models. Comparison of rHBsAg-specific antibodies induced in mice immunized three weeks apart. There are 5 or 4 mice per group for immunized or na\u00efve, respectively. There are only 3 IgM values for rHBsAg + CpG immunized C57BL/6 mice, as sera were limited. Sera was collected 3 weeks post boost and rHBsAg-specific IgM, IgG, IgG1 and IgG2b endpoint titers were determined by indirect ELISA. Dashed lines indicate detection limits of the assay.

Figures 2.4-2.6 demonstrate successful delivery of recombinant protein antigen vaccines using VacSIM. A vaccine delivery platform technology would require the flexibility to easily incorporate multiple different types of antigens (Table 1.1) and/or adjuvants (Table 1.4). In addition to recombinant protein antigens (rHBsAg, rNP, Ch.2) it was necessary to evaluate VacSIM antigens and inactivated titers in Th1-/Th2-biased mouse models. Comparison of rNP-specific antibodies induced in mice immunized three weeks apart (n=5 vaccine, n=4 naive). Sera were collected 3 weeks after boost and rNP-specific IgG endpoint titers were determined via indirect ELISA. Dashed lines indicate dilution thresholds of the assay. Representative of 2 independent experiments. Statistical differences (*p<0.05, **p<0.01) were determined by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test. 39 The precise mechanism by which VacSIM delivered vaccine components induce an immune response is still being investigated and will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 5. Numerous studies have found PuraMatrix\u00ae, when compared to other biodegradable hydrogels, to be less immunogenic and inflammatory and more biocompatible overall (3, 16-20). Additionally, in-house experiments (Chapter 3) indicate that VacSIM does not have inherent immunostimulatory activity. It is hypothesized that a key component of the mechanism to be the in situ construction of the vaccine gel matrix depot via hydrated nanofibers of the (RADA)4 oligopeptides. (Figure 2.7). Post-injection, under physiological conditions, VacSIM self-assembles, forming a porous and biodegradable gel-matrix depot of concentrated vaccine components. In addition to sustained antigen egress, the VacSIM depot may provide a stabilizing effect, delaying systemic degradation of vaccine components. Figure 2.7: Proposed mechanism by which, VacSIM improves vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. 40 As previously mentioned (Section 2.1), pore sizes of the assembled gel-matrix depot can be adjusted, simply by varying the (RADA)4 oligopeptide concentration in the vaccine. Therefore, depending on the overall size of vaccine antigens, the range of pore sizes in the VacSIM gel-matrix can be increased or made smaller by reducing or increasing the concentration of (RADA)4 respectively. Further, though not discussed here in detail, two alternative versions of the (RADA)4 oligopeptide exist to function more effectively with increased/decreased hydrophobic molecules (5). A recent study demonstrated in situ, that insulin delivered in PuraMatrix\u00ae led to the slow release of insulin over time (21). In regards to varying the pore sizes of the VacSIM gel-matrix, Figure 2.8 shows the varying diffusion results over time, comparing two different concentrations of VacSIM, combined with a protein antigen (OVA) or WIV (PR8). In this study, a 1% and 0.5% concentration of VacSIM was compared to evaluate any effects of pore size on the two alternative antigens. In contrast to OVA, which diffused differentially at both VacSIM concentrations, WIV was unable to diffuse at either concentration (Figure 2.8). These results are consistent with in vivo results discussed in Chapter 3, showing ineffective protection after immunization of unadjuvanted PR8 (WIV) via VacSIM delivery. One explanation for why PR8 did not egress from the gel-matrix may involve PR8 being a formalin-inactivated whole virus preparation, thus viral antigens/particles/virions may be too large to diffuse through the gel-matrix pores. If the lack of diffusion of PR8 and other WIV preparations is a general phenomena, then whole inactivated preparations will require use of an adjuvant, such as CpG, which will diffuse through the gel-matrix pores, to recruit APCs to the localized vaccine depot. 41 The majority of influenza vaccines contain inactivated virus. Additionally this is the only type of vaccine recommended to populations with increased risk of developing Figure 2.8: Antigen diffusion kinetics. Diffusion of ovalbumin (OVA) protein and influenza A/PR/8/34 virus (WIV) from a 0.5% gel matrix, assembled in vitro (A-B). Supernatant samples were collected from PBS overlay out to 48 hours, and antigen diffusion was detected through -OVA or -PR8 indirect ELISA. Photographs show that following preparation, all samples remain liquid and appear more or less identical. After 1hr incubation, the VacSIM containing samples have transitioned to a gel phase, while the antigen-only samples remain liquid (C). Representative of 2 independent experiments. 42 potentially life-threatening complications with influenza infection. Therefore, inactivated virus represents a crucial type of antigen to be further evaluated for increased immunogenicity and improved vaccine efficacy through VacSIM delivery. The following experiments were designed to evaluate the effect of incorporating various adjuvants with a whole-inactivated PR8 vaccine delivered in VacSIM by a single (s.c.) immunization. Antibody endpoint titers (IgM, IgA, IgE, IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3) determined in sera harvested 4 weeks post vaccination (wpv), utilizing the C57/BL/6 mouse model (Figure 2.9), via indirect EILSA. Comparisons were made between groups receiving a PR8 (WIV) vaccine delivered in saline or in VacSIM, unadjuvanted or in combination with CpG, or GLA variant prepared as aqueous solution (AQ501) or emulsion (EM582). The mentioned vaccine groups were also compared to relevant controls, including na\u00efve and a group immunized with a vaccine containing PR8 and the emulsion vehicle used in EM582 delivered in VacSIM (EM081). All mice receiving adjuvanted vaccines had minimal levels of antigen specific IgM (na\u00efve antibody) and IgE (allergic antibody). Unadjuvanted PR8 whether delivered in VacSIM or saline resulted in similar levels of specific antibody, except in the case of IgA (increased in VacSIM) and total IgG (increased in saline). Among the adjuvants compared in combination with PR8 and VacSIM delivery, CpG was the most effective. The mean endpoint titers for mice receiving PR8+CpG in VacSIM showed increased, PR8-specific IgG, IgA and IgG3, compared to all other groups (Figure 2.9). A separate experiment was designed to confirm that CpG was an ideal adjuvant for VacSIM delivery of whole-inactivated PR8 (Figure 2.9, A.4). Three new groups were added in addition to the vaccine groups described in Figure 2.9, in order to compare 43 mice immunized with PR8+Alum delivered in VacSIM or in saline and PR8+CpG+Alum delivered in saline (Figure 2.10). The combination of adjuvants CpG+Alum has been shown to be quite effective in a research setting (22, 23). Serum samples were collected from C57BL/6 mice at 4 wpv and anti-PR8 IgG endpoint titers were determined by indirect ELISA. Mice receiving an immunization of whole-inactivated PR8 and CpG delivered in VacSIM had significantly elevated antigen-specific antibody titers compared to all other vaccine groups (Figure 2.10A). 44 Measuring antigen-specific antibodies provides vital information regarding antigen-specific vaccine immunogenicity and reactogenicity. Ideally, the increase in specific antibodies seen mice immunized with PR8+CpG delivered in VacSIM groups. Sera werecollected 4 weeks following a single s.c. vaccination and A/PR/8/34 (PR8)-specific IgM, endpoint titers determined by indirect ELISA. Dashed lines indicate detection thresholds of the experiment. Representative of 2 independent experiments. Statistical significance (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001) between vaccination groups was determined by 1-way ANOVA and Dunn's multiple comparisons test 45 2.10A) would correlate to a decrease in symptom severity (morbidity) as well as virus levels present in the lungs, following influenza challenge, compared to other vaccine groups. To determine whether antibody levels did in fact correlate to improved protection, all mice received an intranasal (i.n.) challenge with a lethal dose (1,000 LD50) of homologous influenza virus (A/PR/8/34) at 4 wpv. Following challenge, mice were monitored daily to evaluate variations in symptom severity between vaccine groups. In addition to monitoring changes in weight, a daily morbidity score was determined for each individual, which represented their cumulative symptoms for each day post-challenge (Figure 2.10B). The results indicated a clustering of four different vaccine groups, which maintained minimal weight loss and morbidity out to 4 days post challenge (dpc). These groups receiving PR8+CpG delivered in VacSIM and PR8, PR8+Alum, or PR8+Alum+CpG all delivered in saline. Finally, to determine whether decreased weight loss and morbidity would correlate to viral clearance and as a measure of vaccine efficacy, individual viral lung titers were evaluated by plaque assay at 4 dpc (Figure 2.10C). The clearance results indicated that mice immunized with whole-inactivated PR8+CpG delivered in VacSIM were more effective at clearing virus than na\u00efve mice and those receiving unadjuvanted PR8, regardless of whether it was delivered in saline or VacSIM. All of the mice in the PR8+Alum and PR8+Alum+CpG in saline had undetectable levels of virus and are clearly performing as effective adjuvants to the whole-inactivated PR8 vaccine. However, when comparing all of the adjuvanted vaccines that were delivered using VacSIM, CpG remains the preferred adjuvant with all but one of the mice showing undetectable levels of virus in the lungs at 4 dpc (Figure 2.10C). 46 Figure 2.10: Immunization with various adjuvants and their effect on specific IgG sera titers, morbidity and viral clearance from the lungs. Sera collected prior to vaccination (baseline) and 4wpv was used to determine A/PR/8/34-specific IgG endpoint titers via indirect ELISA (A). Mice were challenged at 4wpv with 1,000LD50 PR8 and monitored daily for weight changes and morbidity post-challenge (B). Lungs were harvested 4dpc and viral clearance determined (C).

Results representative of 2 separate experiments (n=5-6). 47 Depending on the vaccine, the route of delivery will vary (Figure 2.11). Some common routes include intramuscular (i.m.), as with the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines, intranasal (i.n.), as with the live-attenuated seasonal influenza vaccines and Figure 2.11: Routes of administration vary to maximize effectiveness of vaccine.

Adapted from World Health Organization (http://vaccine-safety-training.org/route-of-administration.html). 48 oral, as with specific Polio vaccines. Additionally, the measles vaccine is delivered via a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection, and the tuberculosis vaccine (BCG) is administered via intradermal (i.d.) injection. In order to be truly effective as a vaccine delivery platform technology, VacSIM must be versatile enough to enable incorporation with multiple immunization routes. Given the route variability amongst current vaccines, the following experiment was designed to evaluate whether the improved antigen-specific immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy were specific to the s.c. vaccination route, or if similarly improved vaccine responses could be generated with alternative routes. In this vaccine study unvaccinated mice were compared to mice that received either whole-inactivated PR8 in saline or PR8+CpG in VacSIM. For both vaccines, five alternative routes were explored, including s.c., i.d., i.m., intraperitoneal (i.p.) as well as intragastric (i.g.). antigen-specific immunogenicity was evaluated by comparing -PR8 IgG levels in the sera, at 4 wpv by indirect ELISA, and vaccine efficacy was evaluated by comparing viral lung loads at 2 dpc via plaque assay (Figure 2.12). Overall, when comparing the PR8+CpG in VacSIM vaccines across different routes, the results indicate successful immunization in four out of the five tested routes. Immunization by the i.g. route was ineffective in the case of either vaccine. It is possible, given the hostile environment, that VacSIM assembly was delayed or all together disrupted, allowing the vaccinating antigen to be rapidly degraded. The combination of route and vaccine, which generated the most variable response, was in i.m. immunization of PR8+CpG in VacSIM. Of the five routes evaluated, i.p., followed closely by s.c. were the most effective immunization routes for delivery of PR8+CpG in VacSIM (Figure 2.12). 49 Figure 2.12: Route-dependent -PR8 IgG sera levels and viral clearance from the lungs post challenge. All mice were bled prior to vaccination (baseline) with either PR8 in saline or PR8+CpG in VacSIM and again 4 wpv, when -PR8 IgG levels in the sera were detected by indirect ELISA (A).

Results representative of 2 separate experiments. 50 2.4 Conclusions Vaccine Self-assembling Immune Matrix (VacSIM) is a patent-pending vaccine delivery system incorporating a sterile solution of the synthetic (RADA)4 self-assembling oligopeptides. A liquid ex vivo, VacSIM can easily be utilized for vaccine delivery through simple mixing with vaccine components prior to vaccination. Unlike traditional hydrogels, which tend to rely upon toxic cross-linkers for self-assembly, this rapid and straightforward preparation suggests VacSIM would be amenable to rapid formulation changes, the likes of which would be essential in a pandemic situation. Additionally, because VacSIM self-assembles in vivo, triggered by physiological levels of pH and salinity, VacSIM is readily set apart from alternative vaccine delivery methods, which typically involve ex vivo polymerization (24-29). Immediately following delivery, there is a rapid formation of a porous gel-matrix, which is inert, biocompatible and resorbable (16, 17). When these (RADA)4 oligopeptides are utilized for vaccine delivery, as proposed by VacSIM, the resulting gel matrix assembles in and around the aqueous vaccine components, generating a localized depot of concentrated vaccine. The results presented in Figures 2.4-2.6, 2.8-2.10 and 2.12 indicate that VacSIM delivery is capable of enhancing immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy by multiple delivery routes, as well as delivery of different types of antigens and antigen-adjuvant combinations. Taken together these results suggest that VacSIM delivery is flexible and has potential to be developed as a vaccine delivery platform that is able to enhance immunogenicity and efficacy in a variety of different vaccine systems. Combined, this work has lead to the inventors and The University of Georgia jointly filing applications for the following provisional patents: (61/476,431) \"Vaccine Delivery 51 Method\" filed on April 18th, 2011 (30) and (61/968,531) \"Reduction of Reactogenicity of Adjuvants\" filed on March 21st, 2014. 2.5 Materials and Methods 2.5.1 Experimental Design To evaluate VacSIM delivery of an influenza vaccine in a mammalian model system controlled laboratory experiments were conducted in C57BL/6 mice (Harlan). Also utilized was the Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cell line (ATCC). Analyses of vaccine-specific immune responses were conducted according to standard protocols with slight modifications (33). Endpoint titers were calculated for antibodies specific to inactivated virus (PR8) or recombinant proteins (rNP, rHBsAg) in the sera by indirect ELISA. Protection from lethal challenge was assessed in vivo in accordance with IACUC guidelines and clearance of the virus was assessed by viral lung titers determined from plaque assay. Group size for significant statistical power was determined by consultation with collaborating scientists, who have substantial experience with influenza infection in mice. In general, a sample size of at least four mice per treatment group was utilized. Animals within a group were not pooled during analysis and unless otherwise stated, data from individual mice were graphed. Following influenza challenge, mice were monitored daily and symptoms were recorded, including changes in weight, behavior, activity, posture, grooming and respiratory rate. Each animal was given a daily morbidity score, calculated from the assigned values of each symptom: hunched back or ruffed fur (1), lethargy (2), head tilt (3), weight loss >20% (3), weight loss >25% (4), weight loss >30% (5), cyanosis (5), paralysis (5), seizure (5) and severe dyspnea (5). Animals were immediately sacrificed (CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation) if they received a total score 52 of 5 and said to have reached their humane endpoint. Mice could be excluded from the final analysis if there was evidence of its difference prior to employing the experimental manipulation (i.e.: physical or behavioral abnormality recorded prior to vaccination or challenged). No outliers have been excluded. 2.5.2 Animals - rHBsAg and rNP Experiments Five to seven week old female BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories, housed in specific pathogen-free conditions and allowed to acclimate for one week prior to manipulation. All animal work was performed in accordance with all applicable policies and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. 2.5.3 Animals - PR8 (WIV) Experiments Female C57BL/6 mice (Harlan) aged 5-7 weeks were obtained from Harlan laboratories and housed in pathogen-free conditions. Mice were acclimated for one week prior to manipulations. All animal handling was conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and with the approval of the institutional animal care and use committee. 2.5.4 Cell Culture Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells were cultured in 1:1 ratio of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) and Eagle's essential medium 2.5.5 rHBsAg and rNP Experiments Mice were vaccinated subcutaneously with recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen (rHBsAg) adw subtype (5 \u00b5g, Fitzgerald Industries, Inc. Massachusetts, USA) or human recombinant influenza-A nuclear protein (10 \u00b5g, USA), via alhydrogel (250 \u00b5g, Inject Alum, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) \u00b1 CpG, by VacSIM (PuraMatrix, BD) \u00b1 CpG, or in Freund's (13 \u00b5L, Sigma-Aldrich Co. Missouri, USA), at a maximum volume of 200 \u00b5L per injection site. For most experiments, mice were primed then boosted four weeks later in an identical manner. For the endpoint titer experiments, mice were primed and boosted three weeks apart and the endpoint titers were determined three weeks post boost. 2.5.6 Vaccination - PR8 (WIV) Experiments For the route optimizing experiments (Figure 2.12, Appendix Figure A.2), 6-8 week old mice (n=4-8) were vaccinated with 200 uL, a single time, by a subcutaneous (s.c.), intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intragastric (i.g.) route. Mice vaccinated by an intradermal (i.d.) or intramuscular (i.m.) route received two injections, of 50uL each (for i.d. one injection in the right and left side flank and for i.m. one injection in the thigh muscle of each leg). A 285/8 G needle with 1mL syringe was used for s.c. and i.p. routes. A 30 G insulin syringe was used for both i.d. and i.m. routes and a 20x1\u00bd G feeding needle with 1mL syringe was used for the i.g. route. Regardless of route and whether receiving a total vaccine volume of 100 uL or 200 uL, all mice were immunized, in accordance to their groups, with identical amounts of antigen, adjuvant and/or VacSIM. In all other experiments, 6-8 week old mice received a single, subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination of 200 \u00b5L to their right flank. Vaccinations contained sterile saline, PR8 whole-inactivated virus (WIV) (10 EM081 (1:5 dilution, oil-in-water formulation, Infectious Disease Research Institute), or equal volumes VacSIM (PuraMatrix, BD), as indicated by group. 2.5.7 Viral Challenge Influenza challenge virus (A/Puerto Rico/08/34, H1N1) was mouse-adapted through serial passage prior to propagation in embryonated chicken eggs (Appendix Figure A.) and lethality was determined by MLD50 (Appendix Figure A.), as described previously (31). Four weeks post-vaccination, age-matched mice were challenged intranasally (i.n.) with a lethal dose (1,000 LD50, as indicated) of mouse-adapted homologous PR8 virus, while under temporary sedation with tribromoethanol. Mice were monitored daily for weight change and symptom severity (subsection 2.5.1). In a minimum of two mice, lungs were harvested 6-12 hours post challenge (hpc) to confirm infection via plaque assay. 2.5.8 Antibody Endpoint Titers Serum samples were collected from mice prior to vaccination (pre-bleed) and four weeks following vaccination. Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with whole A/Puerto Rico/08/34 (H1N1) inactivated/purified virus (4 \u00b5g/ml) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Plates were washed five times with wash buffer (160 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.05% Tween 20), then blocked in 1X PBS containing 5% non-fat milk powder and 1% BSA for at least two hours. Plates were decanted, incubated for 2-24 hours with samples serially diluted in blocking buffer, then washed five times. Detection antibodies (HRP-conjugated -mouse IgG1, IgA and IgM from Santa Cruz, IgG3, IgG2a and IgG2b from Invitrogen, IgE from Southern Biotech or total IgG from BioLegend) were diluted in blocking buffer and 55 incubated for one hour. After five washes, plates were developed in the dark using SureBlue 1 component TMB substrate (KPL Laboratories) and the reaction was stopped with 2 N sulfuric acid. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm with 570 nm background correction. Figure 2.4 only: Blood samples were collected from all vaccinated and control mice weekly, beginning week -1 prior to primary immunization. rHBsAg-specific antibodies in sera were analyzed by ELISA. Briefly, plates were coated with 4 \u00b5g/ml rHBsAg and sera antibodies specific for rHBsAg were detected by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (-IgA, -IgM, diluted were with (Appendix Figure A.4). After incubation for 2-3 days, cells were fixed with methanol/acetone and stained with crystal violet (Acros Organics) for enumeration of plaque forming units (pfu). Lung samples with undetectable virus were graphed as four pfu per lung, which is a value equal to \u00bd of the detection threshold of the assay. 2.5.10 ELISpots - Data in Appendix B Splenocytes were obtained three weeks post-prime or three weeks post-boost, then stimulated for 20 hours to evaluate HBsAg-/NP-specific cell-mediated vaccine responses using IFN ELISpot, according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences, San Francisco, CA, USA). Briefly, single cell suspensions (3 and 1.5 \u00d7 105 cells per well) were cultured at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 20 hours in complete medium [RPMI-1640 (Hyclone, Thermo Scientific, Utah, USA) supplemented U/ml penicillin, 100 non-essential acids and 56 -mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)] and stimulated with either \u00b5g/ml Concanavalin A (ConA), 20 \u00b5M specific peptide (Appendix greater than 95% purity (Biosynthesis Inc., Lewisville, TX, USA) and dissolved in DMSO prior to dilution in culture media, 10 ug/ml recombinant protein] or left unstimulated. ELISpot plates were developed with AEC substrate and spot forming units (SFU) were counted using an Immunospot Analyzer (C.T.L.). The SFU value was expressed as mean of the triplicate cultures per mouse (Appendix Figures A.11-A.12). 2.5.11 Cytometric bead array - Data in Appendix B Splenocytes were harvested, plated at 1.5 million cells per well in 48-well plates, and stimulated with 20 \u00b5M peptide, 25 \u00b5g/ml SEA, or 1 \u00b5g/ml ConA or left unstimulated for 72 hours. Cytokine levels in supernatant were measured using a Th1/Th2/Th17 cytometric bead array (CBA) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD). 2.5.12 Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.0. Statistical methods and significant differences between vaccination groups include one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA followed by either Dunn's, Tukey's, Dunnett's or Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons.

Farah Samli, Lisa M. Shollenberger, Donald A. Harn, Resubmitted to Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 61 3.1 Abstract Human and Veterinary vaccines remain the best public health measures to prevent infectious diseases, second only to clean drinking water. As effective as vaccines have been in preventing disease, for many diseases the current vaccines afford only marginal protection. For example, overall efficacy for the seasonal influenza vaccine varies, with efficacy from 50-67%. This relatively low level of efficacy is further decreased in the very young, the elderly and immune compromised. Therefore, improving vaccine efficacy remains a high priority for influenza and many other diseases. One approach to enhance vaccine efficacy is to find delivery methods that provide antigen persistence, leading to increased activation and maturation of antigen presenting cells. Here we describe a new platform vaccine delivery system that provides antigen persistence. VacSIM (Vaccine Self-assembling Immune Matrix) is an inert, synthetic (RADA)4 oligopeptide liquid that self-assembles to form hydrated nanofibers in vivo. When delivered in combination with a vaccine, the hydrated nanofibers immediately self-assemble, forming a porous gel-depot, encompassing aqueous vaccine components and allowing gradual egress from the gel. VacSIM provides the flexibility to rapidly incorporate various vaccine components without requiring ex vivo polymerization. Here, we describe how gradual exposure to antigen, as a result of VacSIM delivery, enhances influenza-specific immune responses, which may be driven by increased activation of antigen presenting cells. Mice immunized with inactivated A/Puerto Rico/08/34 (PR8) and CpG in VacSIM had increased PR8-specific antibody responses as well as greater protection and improved viral clearance following lethal, homologous challenge, compared to mice immunized with PR8 and CpG in the absence 62 of VacSIM. Surprisingly, although we vaccinated with inactivated virus, VacSIM delivery of inactivated PR8 and CpG generated PR8-specific T cell responses. VacSIM as a new vaccine platform technology has the potential to enhance efficacy of numerous current and future vaccines, with advantages over earlier hydrogel based methods. 3.2 Significance VacSIM, is a new vaccine delivery method that produces a three dimensional gel depot in situ, providing vaccine antigen persistence as a means to enhance vaccine efficacy. Because VacSIM can be used to deliver subunit or whole organism vaccines as well as vector based vaccines, and increases both cellular and humoral responses, VacSIM technology should have wide applicability to enhance vaccine efficacy. 3.3 Introduction Vaccines remain one of the greatest public health tools to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases. As powerful as vaccination has been to prevent infection and reduce morbidity, there are numerous human and veterinary diseases for which no vaccines exist, or that are only marginally effective. For some vaccines, notably pneumonia and influenza, vaccine efficacy is further reduced in low responder populations such as the very young, the elderly and immune compromised. Therefore tremendous effort has been devoted to discovery and development of new adjuvants and/or vaccine delivery methods that can safely improve vaccine efficacy (VE). Our long-term approach to increase vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy has been to deliver vaccines as particulates, to enhance antigen persistence and activation of antigen presenting cells (APC). Toward this goal, we wanted a method that allowed for simple mixing of vaccine components without the need to precipitate or polymerize ex vivo, such 63 that a \"Plug and Play\" vaccine platform is realized. This led us to develop a new vaccine delivery method named VacSIM (Vaccine Self-Assembling Immune Matrix) (1), which is based on the properties of the synthetic (RADA)4 oligopeptide and other biopolymers (2-6). Created by Zhang (6), the (RADA)4 synthetic oligopeptide was commercialized by 3-D Matrix Inc., as a cell scaffold for 3D cell cultures in vivo and ex vivo (7). Solutions of the (RADA)4 oligopeptide have undergone third party testing, demonstrating no reactogenicity or toxicity (8), which had led to clinical trials for wound healing (PuraStat\u00ae), tissue repair (9) and as scaffolding for dental implants (PuraMatrix) (10, 11). VacSIM, composed of the (RADA)4 oligopeptide solution remains liquid ex vivo, allowing for easy incorporation of vaccine subunit or whole antigens, organisms and adjuvants. Under physiological conditions, hydrated nanofibers self-assemble to form an inert and biodegradable, gel-matrix. The VacSIM gel- matrix depot concentrates vaccine components in the aqueous phase of the gel-matrix enabling gradual egress of these components through the gel-matrix pores (1). This gel-matrix depot, in addition to providing slow egress of vaccine components, may also provide protection from systemic degradation. Therefore, VacSIM is a flexible, vaccine delivery method with wide applicability in terms of the types of vaccines that can be delivered. Recently, we demonstrated that VacSIM delivery of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen (rHBsAg) induced superior vaccine-specific responses compared to delivery of the same antigen in aluminum hydroxide (alum) or complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (1). Having demonstrated that VacSIM delivery enhances vaccine immunogenicity, our next goal was to determine its ability to enhance VE. To test this we 64 evaluated immunogenicity and VE in a murine influenza model prior to and after challenge infection. Influenza is a highly infectious virus, responsible for seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. Infection is a global health concern, imposing often-unpredictable levels of morbidity, mortality and considerable economic burden in the form of health care costs and lost productivity (12, 13). Seasonal influenza is an acute infection that hospitalizes 200-250,000 and kills approximately 36,000 persons annually in the United States alone (14, 15). Infections in low-responding or high-risk populations, such as the elderly, the very young and the immune compromised, often lead to more severe and potentially life-threatening complications such as pneumonia (16-18). Annual vaccination is the most effective method to prevent infection from seasonal influenza epidemics. Several of the influenza vaccines contain more than one strain of inactivated viruses, and are trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines that function by generating flu-specific antibodies. However, the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) option (FluMist\u00ae) is most effective because it induces a T cell response in addition to generating flu-specific antibodies. The only seasonal influenza vaccine recommended for high-risk populations is intramuscular injection of either tri or quadrivalent vaccines. For the most recent 2013-2014 influenza season, the CDC estimated the overall VE to be 61% (95% confidence interval = 52-68%) (19), with lower efficacy in high-risk populations (16, 17, 19). In addition to exhibiting lower VE, high-risk populations have greater morbidity/mortality (18, 20, 21). Thus, development of safe vaccine delivery methods and/or adjuvants to significantly improve immunogenicity and efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccines is a high priority, especially for high-risk populations (22-25). 65 In this study we evaluated whether VacSIM delivery of an influenza vaccine would enhance immunogenicity and efficacy from challenge infection in C57BL/6 mice. We utilized the whole inactivated virus (WIV), influenza A/Puerto Rico/08/34 (PR8), for its high immunogenicity and reputation as a standard in the field. Because PR8 is known to be highly effective when the vaccine is administered by the intramuscular (i.m.) route, we chose a sub-optimal vaccination route, subcutaneous (s.c.), to better assess effects of VacSIM and differences between functional vaccine groups. To be consistent with how the seasonal influenza vaccine is administered, mice received a single immunization. 3.4 Results 3.4.1 Delivery of WIV PR8 and titers of sera collected 4 weeks post vaccination (wpv) from each vaccination group were determined for multiple antibody classes and isotypes (Figure 3.1, S3.6). Total IgG endpoint titers were significantly higher in sera from mice vaccinated with PR8 + CpG via VacSIM delivery compared to all other vaccine groups: 1) na\u00efve mice and mice vaccinated with 2) un-adjuvanted PR8, 3) + in + CpG in VacSIM compared to CpG in saline groups. Sera quantity was limited from the group receiving unadjuvanted PR8 in VacSIM and only three of five mice were assayed for IgG1 and IgG2a endpoint titers. This group (PR8 in VacSIM) was excluded from statistical analysis due to low sample size (Figure 3.1). Mice vaccinated with PR8 + CpG in VacSIM consistently had the highest vaccine-specific IgG isotype endpoint 66 with significantly increased levels vaccine-specific IgG1 and IgG2b, and decreased levels of IgG2a and IgG3 suggesting a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response. The IgG2a endpoint titers were the lowest for all vaccine groups (Figure 3.1, S3.6.). To evaluate mucosal antibody responses, we determined IgA and IgG endpoint titers from lungs one-day post challenge (dpc). We compared the PR8 + CpG in VacSIM group to PR8 in saline group, with na\u00efve mice as controls. Both of the Figure 3.1: Inactivated influenza vaccine delivered with CpG via VacSIM induces higher antibody titers in sera IgG IgA endpoint titers determined from the lungs of immunized mice, 4 wpv and 1 dpc with 1000 LD50 of live virus (A/PR/8/34) (C-D). Dashed lines indicate detection thresholds of the experiment. Results were replicated, for each vaccine group (A-B), in a minimum of 3 separate experiments (n=5-16). Statistical significance (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001) between vaccination groups was determined from titers using 1-way representative (C-D) of 2 independent experiments (n=4-5) with no significant differences (p < 0.05) between groups by 1-way ANOVA and Bonferroni's multiple comparisons post-test. 67 vaccinated groups had high IgG endpoint titers in lung tissue. However, the PR8 + CpG in VacSIM group had increased levels of IgA, compared to the PR8 vaccinated group (Figure 3.1). 3.4.2 Hemagglutination Inhibition HI titers are one parameter employed to evaluate VE and immunogenicity (26, 27). HI titers ranging between 15 and 65 have been associated with 50% reduced risk of infection with influenza A-H1N1, A-H2N2, A-H3N2, and B strains in humans (28). The CDC defines the standard protective titer to be 40 (29). We performed HI assays for vaccine-specific antibodies present in sera 4 wpv (Figure 3.2). The average HI titers of both na\u00efve mice and those vaccinated with PR8 in VacSIM were below our detection threshold. Average HI titers of the remaining four vaccine groups (PR8, PR8 + Alum, PR8 + CpG, and PR8 + CpG in VacSIM) all met the CDC standard of 40 HI titer. Surprisingly, although sera from mice immunized with PR8 + CpG via VacSIM had consistently high vaccine-specific antibodies (Figure 3.1), their ability to inhibit hemagglutination varied greatly (Figure 3.2). 68 Figure 3.2: Inhibition of hemagglutination is a standard correlate (HI) relative sera collected at 4 wpv from immunized mice (A) and the percent of samples, relative to each vaccine group, with an HI titer 40 (B) were determined. Graph represents pooled data from three identical experiments (n= 5-16). Dashed lines indicate detection thresholds of the 2. Statistical significance (*p<0.05, **p<0.01) between vaccination groups was determined via the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple-comparisons post-test. 69 3.4.3 PR8 and CpG Delivered by VacSIM Protects Vaccinated Mice from Lethal Challenge Mice vaccinated with PR8 + CpG in VacSIM had increased humoral responses, but not greater HI titers (Figure 3.1, 3.2). To assess VE as protection from infection, we initially challenged vaccinated mice at 4 wpv with a lethal dose (30 LD50) of homologous live virus via intranasal challenge (S3.7). As expected, based on flu-specific antibody levels, the na\u00efve group and mice vaccinated with PR8 via VacSIM suffered weight loss and increased morbidity scores, indicative of symptom severity. Each of the other vaccine groups showed no morbidity or mortality at this challenge dose. Due to poor protection, the PR8 via VacSIM group was excluded from subsequent challenge studies, where we increased the challenge dose to 1000 LD50, to distinguish differences among protected groups. As shown in Figure 3.3, the higher dose (1000 LD50) challenge resulted in all unvaccinated mice having high composite morbidity scores indicating their humane endpoint by day seven post challenge. In contrast, mice vaccinated with PR8 alone or PR8 + CpG had similar weight loss and overall morbidity scores, resulting in identical levels of protection (87.5% survival at 14 dpc). Mice vaccinated with PR8 in alum had lower protection (75% survival at 14 dpc). Consistent with antibody endpoint titer data, the group vaccinated with PR8 + CpG in VacSIM had minimal weight loss, low morbidity scores and was the only group fully protected from the 1000 LD50 challenge (100% survival at 14 dpc) (Figure 3.3). These results suggest the increased VE seen in the PR8 + CpG in VacSIM group may correlate with high, vaccine-specific endpoint titers in both the sera and lungs (Figure 3.1, S3.1). Only the HI titer data were inconsistent with VE against a 1000 LD50 challenge (Figure 3.2). 70 To further examine vaccine-induced protection to lethal challenge, we evaluated clearance of challenge virus from the lungs of control and vaccinated mice. Lung viral loads were measured at 1, 2, 3, and 5 dpc via plaque assay. We compared the group with the highest antibody response and protection (PR8 + CpG in VacSIM) to the group vaccinated with PR8 alone. Na\u00efve mice were included as controls for viral replication in vivo. The na\u00efve mouse group maintained high lung viral loads at all time points post challenge infection, whereas mice vaccinated with PR8 had approximately two logs lower viral titers at 1 dpc and began clearing the infection at 5 dpc, evidenced by undetectable virus levels in two mice at this time (30). Correlating with the 100% survival to challenge infection, we observed several mice in the PR8 + CpG in VacSIM group that had undetectable levels of virus, at each time point. The PR8 + CpG in VacSIM group had approximately two logs lower lung viral loads than PR8 vaccinated mice on days 1-3 post-challenge, demonstrating a significant improvement in viral clearance (Figure 3.3). To determine whether mice receiving PR8 + CpG in saline rather than in VacSIM would have similarly enhanced viral clearance, we repeated the vaccination and challenge study with an expanded set of groups and a single time point. Mice receiving PR8 + CpG in Saline or in VacSIM were compared to groups vaccinated with PR8 alone, VacSIM alone (containing no antigen) as well as na\u00efve mice, three days following a 1000 LD50 influenza challenge (Figure 3.3). Not surprisingly, the delivery of VacSIM in the absence of antigen provided no protection and resulted in a group mean similar to na\u00efve mice post challenge. However, the addition of CpG in saline (PR8 + CpG) was unable to reproduce the viral clearance efficacy seen in mice vaccinated with PR8 + CpG in VacSIM. Further, the observation that several 71 mice in this group had undetectable virus at 1 dpc, suggests that PR8 + CpG in VacSIM. Figure 3.3: Inactivated influenza vaccine delivered with CpG via VacSIM decreases mortality, results in the highest level of protection post challenge and increased viral clearance after lethal influenza challenge. Immunization with PR8+VacSIM+CpG leads to sterilizing immunity and improved viral clearance from the lungs. Presented are post-challenge weight (A), morbidity scores (B) and survival (C) of mice following lethal (1,000 LD50) challenge administered at 4 wpv, as well as virus levels in lungs of immunized mice harvested between 1-5 days (D) and 3 days (E) post lethal (1,000 LD50) challenge. Dashed lines indicate detection threshold. Representative of 3 independent experiments (n=5-9). Statistical significance (*p<0.05) of survival (C) was determined relative to unvaccinated mice using the Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test with multiple comparisons. Statistical significance of the log-transformed values (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001) was determined by two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni's multiple comparisons post test (D) or compared to PR8+CpG+VacSIM by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's post-test (E). 72 Virus-Specific T Cell Responses are Enhanced in Mice Vaccinated with PR8 and CpG via VacSIM Previously we noted that sera HI titers from mice vaccinated with PR8 + CpG via VacSIM were not a predictive correlate of VE, as measured by 100% survival and increased lung viral clearance upon lethal challenge. To examine another potential anti-viral mechanism as a correlate of protection, we examined T cell responses. We compared the PR8 + CpG in VacSIM group, which had the highest antibody responses and levels of protection, to the PR8 only group and na\u00efve mice, which were included as controls for basal T cell levels in vivo (Figure 3.4). Fewer than half of the mice in the PR8 only vaccine group had higher percentages of tetramer-specific T cells in draining lymph nodes than in the non-draining lymph nodes at 2 dpc. In comparison, all animals in the PR8 + CpG in VacSIM group had increased levels of NP-specific CD8+ T cells in the draining lymph nodes, which were also elevated compared to non-draining lymph nodes. This finding suggests that VacSIM delivery is able to drive T cell responses to an internal protein present in formalin-inactivated virus delivered to a distant site. 73 3.4.4 Proposed Mechanism for VacSIM Improving Vaccine Responses We hypothesize that combining VacSIM with vaccine \u00b1 adjuvant prior to immunizing, leads to localized formation of a porous gel-matrix depot, which allows gradual egress of vaccine components (Figure 3.5). To investigate whether VacSIM Figure 3.4: Vaccination with PR8 and CpG by VacSIM delivery enhances NP-specific T cells in draining lymph nodes post challenge. Levels of NP-specific CD8+ T cells in draining and non-draining lymph nodes of mice 2 days post lethal (1000 LD50) challenge are shown (A-D). Statistical significance (*p<0.05) was determined by one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni's multiple comparisons test. 74 enhanced immunogenicity (1) (Figures 3.1, 3.4, S3.7) and vaccine efficacy (Figures 3.3, S3.7) was a result of inherent immune-stimulating factors associated with VacSIM, we compared its ability to induce activation of bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Results indicate that unlike alternative vaccine components such as PR8 or CpG, the level of DC activation following incubation with VacSIM was comparable to media and human serum albumin (HSA). Therefore, in the absence of antigen or adjuvant, VacSIM fails to initiate an immune response through DC activation. We next wanted to investigate gradual egress of antigen from the gel-matrix depot and the effects of altering concentrations of the oligopeptide within VacSIM, which has been shown to affect the pour size range (31). The diffusion of two alternative antigens from the in vitro assembled vaccine depot was measured over time and incorporation of either 0.5% or 1% VacSIM. In contrast to whole-inactivated PR8, which did not diffuse at either concentration, the protein antigen ovalbumin (OVA) differentially diffused over time in a VacSIM concentration-dependent manner. 75 3.5 Discussion Until a universal influenza vaccine is developed, annual vaccination for seasonal influenza epidemics will be necessary to reduce infection related morbidity and mortality. Production of annual influenza vaccines is dependent on global surveillance and a \"best Figure 3.5: Vaccine self-assembling immune matrix proposed mechanism. Schematic of antigen and adjuvant vaccine components being delivered in VacSIM, which under physiological conditions begins to self-assemble generating a porous vaccine-matrix depot localized to vaccination site (A). In the absence of antigen, VacSIM did not induce dendritic cell (DC) activation in bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). BMDC cultures were albumin (HSA), PR8 (WIV), CPG, combinations of antigen + adjuvant + VacSIM and either media, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) prior to staining. Activated DCs (CD86+/CD11c+) were determined by flow (B). Diffusion over time of ovalbumin (OVA) protein (C) and influenza A/PR/8/34 (PR8) whole-inactivated virus (D) from in vitro assembled vaccine-gel depots incorporating a 0.5% or 1% VacSIM solution. Samples were collected from PBS overlay out to 48 hours, and antigen diffusion was detected via -OVA or -PR8 indirect ELISA. Photographs depict VacSIM \u00b1 antigen in the initial liquid phase maintained during preparation and the gel phase induced by incubation under physiological conditions (E). 76 guess\" for which circulating influenza A and B strains should be incorporated into the vaccine. This results in fluctuating VE from year to year and represents an added variable to producing effective seasonal influenza vaccines. Due to population-biased VE disparity, a major goal for seasonal influenza vaccines is to increase efficacy in high-risk populations, such as the very young, the elderly and immune compromised, who are limited to the less-potent inactivated vaccines. In the current study, we demonstrated that delivery of whole-inactivated influenza in VacSIM led to enhancement of multiple aspects of vaccine immunogenicity and overall efficacy to challenge when the adjuvant CpG was also incorporated into the vaccine. Specifically, we showed that VacSIM delivery of the inactivated influenza vaccine plus CpG to mice, significantly increased production of flu-specific antibodies, protection from lethal challenge and significantly increased viral clearance from the lungs compared to other PR8 delivery methods. Delivery in VacSIM is flexible enough to incorporate a variety of different vaccine components and as such, represents a new vaccine delivery platform, capable of enhancing VE, and is amenable to rapid formulation changes and immediate deployment. Composed of the (RADA)4 synthetic oligopeptide, VacSIM is not analogous to first or second generation hydrogels, which were based on polyethylene glycol (PEG), hydroxyethyl methacrilates polysaccharides (such or polyaminoacids (32-35) that require ex vivo polymerization. Similarly, vaccine alternatives involving nanoengineering, such as layer-by-layer assembly of hydrogel vesicles and dermal microneedle patch technologies, are unlike VacSIM and require polymerization prior to administration (36, 37). In addition to the (RADA)4 oligopeptide, various other natural and synthetic hydrogel constructs 77 have been evaluated for clinical applications such as tissue engineering (38, 39), drug delivery (40) and vaccine delivery (41-43). In regards to vaccine delivery, incorporation of short, self-assembling amino acid sequences at the C-terminal domain of certain peptide epitopes have been shown to boost immunogenicity (44). Further, direct coupling of vaccine antigen peptide epitope(s) to the self-assembling peptide (SAP) domain Q11, induced vaccine-specific antibody responses in mice (45, 46). Although the precise mechanism is still being evaluated, we hypothesize a key component to be in situ construction of the vaccine gel matrix depot via hydrated nanofibers of the (RADA)4 oligopeptides. This formation immediately following injection, allows gradual egress of aqueous vaccine components from the porous gel matrix depot, providing antigen persistence and increasing activation of APCs. In this regard, one formulation of the (RADA)4 oligopeptide, PuraMatrix, has been shown to gradually release insulin over time in vivo (47). Initial mechanistic studies are consistent with in vivo challenge results (Figure 3.3) indicating that VacSIM itself does not poses immune stimulating characteristics (Figure 3.5). In addition to sustained antigen egress, which was demonstrated in vitro using the protein antigen OVA (Figure 3.5), the VacSIM gel matrix depot may also help stabilize vaccine components by delaying systemic degradation. These findings are consistent with reports on other SAPs and Q11 nanofibers to be non-immunogenic (45). The results presented here show that a single vaccination of PR8 + CpG via VacSIM in mice, was sufficient to drive increased systemic and mucosal humoral responses, including increased vaccine-specific antibody titers in sera and vaccine-specific mucosal titers from the lungs (Figure 3.1). Importantly, mice vaccinated with 78 PR8 + CpG in VacSIM had increased protection from lethal influenza challenge and improved viral clearance from the lungs (Figure 3.3). The HI titers however, were lower (Figure 3.2). Thus, HI titers alone may not always be an appropriate correlate of protection or indicator of VE in this mouse model (48). Interestingly, VacSIM-induced protection correlates with increases in influenza-specific T cells in the draining lymph nodes (Figure 3.4), an observation that warrants further exploration. Antigen persistence is thought to contribute to the duration of immune memory responses (49) and the concept that antigen persistence increases vaccine-specific immune responses, notably antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, has been gaining traction for some time (50). Taken together, our results suggest there is a synergistic effect between CpG and VacSIM delivery of WIV PR8 vaccine. Why simple mixing of WIV PR8 in VacSIM did not drive enhanced responses remains to be determined. However, simple mixing of recombinant protein subunit vaccines, including Hepatitis B Surface Antigen show dramatic enhancement of vaccine-specific responses without addition of other adjuvants (1). Additionally, the protein antigen OVA diffused gradually from in situ assembled vaccine depots, whereas whole-inactivated PR8 was unable to diffuse (Figure 3.5). One explanation is that WIV PR8 is a formalin-inactivated whole virus preparation, whose particle sizes may hinder subunits from diffusing through the VacSIM gel matrix depot as easily as single recombinant protein subunit vaccines. The lack of diffusion through the gel matrix, therefore, increases reliance on use of an adjuvant such as CpG to recruit APCs directly to the VacSIM gel depot. This could explain the lower overall VE seen in mice vaccinated with PR8 via VacSIM versus elevated levels when PR8 was 79 delivered in saline and how addition of CpG to PR8 in VacSIM was sufficient to increase overall levels of anti-influenza antibodies and VE beyond the levels observed in PR8 or PR8 + CpG vaccinated mice (Figure 3.1, 3.3). Regardless, adjuvants might be necessary to improve VE in high-risk populations, who have increased potential to develop severe complications. In this regard, we predict that another advantage of the VacSIM gel matrix depot will be the ability to reduce adjuvant reactogenicity through gradual egress of adjuvant from the vaccine depot. This attribute of reducing adjuvant reactogenicity while retaining the ability to increase APC activation would represent a major advance in adjuvant development and broaden the use of adjuvants in vaccines. In summary, VacSIM enables flexibility to incorporate various types of antigens/organisms plus or minus adjuvants in a straightforward and time-effective manner, prior to injection. We believe VacSIM delivery can be applied to the majority of vaccines that have been or are currently being developed and represents a true \"Plug and Play\" vaccine delivery method that can be utilized for the rapid development and administration of vaccines for biodefense and against emerging and pandemic diseases. 3.6 Materials and Methods 3.6.1 Animals Female C57BL/6 mice (Harlan) aged 5-7 weeks were obtained from Harlan laboratories and housed in pathogen-free conditions. Mice were acclimated for one week prior to manipulations. All animal handling was conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and with the approval of the institutional animal care and use committee. 80 3.6.2 Cell Culture Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells (ATCC) were cultured in 1:1 ratio of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) and Eagle's essential medium Bone marrow dendritic cells Femurs and tibias were collected from C57BL/6 mice and sterilized by bones in 70% EtOH (1x), 1x marrow was isolated in RPMI-1640 serum-free media. Suspended lymphocyte precursor cells were separated and adherent cells were retained for continued culture in complete media [RPMI-1640, 10% FBS, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, non-essential factor (GM-CSF) at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. After six days, DC cultures were confirmed by incubating 2E6 cells in 2ml complete media \u00b1 100ng/mL LPS for 16-20 hours (differentiate activated/resting DCs). Cells were treated with Fc with CD86-FITC (BD) and CD11c-PE (BD). 3.6.4 Vaccination Six to eight week old mice (n=4-8) were vaccinated via a single, subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination. Vaccinations contained sterile saline, PR8 whole-inactivated virus alum volumes VacSIM (PuraMatrix, BD), as indicated, with a total injection volume of 200 uL. 81 3.6.5 Viral Challenge Influenza challenge virus (A/Puerto Rico/08/34, H1N1) was mouse-adapted through serial passage prior to propagation in embryonated chicken eggs and lethality was determined by MLD50, as described previously (51). Four weeks post-vaccination, age-matched mice sedated with tribromoethanol, were challenged intranasally (i.n.) with a lethal dose (30 or 1000 LD50, as indicated) of mouse-adapted homologous PR8 virus. Immediately post-challenge, lungs were harvested from minimally 2 control mice, to confirm infection by plaque assay. Mice were monitored daily for weight change and symptom severity in accordance with IACUC guidelines. Following challenge each animal was given a daily morbidity score, calculated from the sum of the assigned values of each symptom: hunched back or ruffled fur (1), lethargy (2), head tilt (3), weight loss >20% (3), weight loss >25% (4), weight loss >30% (5), cyanosis (5), paralysis (5), seizure (5) and severe dyspnea (5). Animals were immediately sacrificed (CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation) if they received a total score of 5 indicating they reached their humane endpoint. 3.6.6 Antibody Endpoint Titers Humoral responses were measured by indirect ELISA. Sera were collected from mice prior to vaccination (pre-bleed) and four weeks following vaccination. In addition, lungs were collected to evaluate vaccine-specific mucosal IgA and IgG levels. Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with whole A/Puerto Rico/08/34 (H1N1) inactivated/purified virus (4 \u00b5g/ml) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Plates were washed five times with wash buffer (160 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.05% Tween 20), then blocked in 1X PBS containing 5% non-fat milk powder and 1% BSA for at least two hours. Plates were decanted, incubated for 2-24 hours with samples serially diluted in blocking buffer, then washed five times. 82 Detection antibodies (HRP-conjugated -mouse IgG1, IgA and IgM from Santa Cruz, IgG3, IgG2a and IgG2b from Invitrogen, IgE from Southern Biotech or total IgG from BioLegend) were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated for one hour. After five washes, plates were developed in the dark using SureBlue 1 component TMB substrate (KPL Laboratories) and the reaction was stopped with 2N sulfuric acid. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm background 3.6.7 Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Assay Sera samples were heat-inactivated for 30 minutes at 56 C, and then pre-absorbed with 1% turkey RBCs for 30 minutes at 4 C. Sera diluted two-fold and incubated with 4HAU/25 \u00b5L mouse-adapted PR8 virus, at equal volumes and room temperature for 30 minutes. Plates were developed with 0.05% turkey RBCs for 30-60 minutes at 4 C and immediately imaged. Samples with an undetectable HI titer were assigned an arbitrary value of 5, which is equal to one half the assay detection limit. 3.6.8 Plaque Assays for Viral Quantitation Briefly, serially diluted lung were with MDCK under a 2.4% Avicel (FMC BioPolymer) overlay. After incubation for two days, cells were fixed with methanol/acetone and stained with crystal violet (Acros Organics) for enumeration of plaque forming units (pfu). Lung samples with undetectable virus were graphed as four pfu per lung, which is a value equal to \u00bd of the detection threshold of the assay. 3.6.9 Flow Cytometry for T Cell Enumeration Draining and non-draining (contra-lateral) axillary and inguinal lymph nodes were harvested 2 dpc. Tissues were macerated and single cell suspensions were stained for flow cytometry with -CD16/CD32, -CD3-V500, and -CD8a-Pacific (NIH Core Facility), and Live/Dead fixable green viability dye (Invitrogen), using standard methods. Samples were acquired on a BD LSRII running FACSDiva software vX (10.0.6) software. 3.6.10 Statistical Analyses In general, a sample size of at least 4 mice per treatment group was utilized. Animals within a group were not pooled during analysis and unless otherwise stated, data from individual mice were graphed. No outliers were excluded. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.0. Statistical methods and significant differences between vaccination groups include one-way statistical method(s) used and alpha level (0.05 or 0.01) has been specified in each figure legend. 3.7 Acknowledgments The authors thank Lindsay Nyhoff, Cac Bui and Mai Himedan for technical assistance.

Mice vaccinated with PR8 in VacSIM containing CpG had slightly increased 84 IgM endpoint titers. For IgE, all vaccine groups maintained low PR8-specific IgE titers, with the group vaccinated with PR8 + CpG in VacSIM having IgE titers that while low, were significantly increased compared to mice vaccinated with PR8 alone. Analysis of IgA showed that mice vaccinated with PR8 + CpG in VacSIM had the highest PR8-specific sera IgA endpoint titers, significantly increased over other vaccine groups. Sera quantity was limited from the group vaccinated with PR8 via VacSIM, so only three of five mice were assayed. The vaccine-specific endpoint titers from this group (PR8 via VacSIM) were excluded from statistical analysis due to low sample size, however, their levels of IgG and IgA were lower compared with mice vaccinated with PR8 + Alum or CpG. 85 Supplementary Figure 3.6: Inactivated influenza vaccine delivered with CpG via VacSIM induces higher antibody titers in sera.

To be submitted to Vaccine. 92 4.1 Introduction Vaccine effectiveness is typically defined as a percent reduction in the incidence or severity of disease. Effectors, such as CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and antigen-specific antibodies directed to activate the immune response as a result of immunization, are typically what cause efficiency variations among different vaccines (1, 2). The vast majority of vaccines in use today rely on inducing immune responses that mimic those elicited as a result of a natural infection. Specifically, generating strong antigen-specific B cell responses that produce high titers of vaccine-specific IgG antibodies along with the eventual development of memory B cells, allowing for an efficient immune recall response to infection (3, 4). Research efforts focused on developing vaccines to elicit CD8+ effector CTLs increased dramatically as a result of HIV/AIDs. However, thus far there remains a singular example vaccine that utilizes a predominately CD8+ immune response and has been licensed for human use. The Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rine (BCG) vaccine utilizes T cell induced cytokine production, contributing to macrophage activation as the means to control M. tuberculosis (5, 6). The most effective vaccines are those that employ live/attenuated or killed, bacterial or virus (3). Whole organism vaccines generally induce strong CD4+ T cell responses that promote B cell maturation and vaccine-specific antibody production. For some whole organism vaccines, CD8+ T cell responses, including vaccine-specific CTL are also induced (3). 93 Table 4.1: Examples of vaccines with revaccination recommendations for general and high-risk* populations. *In this table \"high-risk\" includes those at continued risk due to environment or occupational hazards, in addition to immune compromised and >65years. Vaccine Semi-regular revaccination (booster shot) General High-risk Seasonal influenza 1 dose / 1 year 3 doses / 1year Tetnus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap) (Td) 1 dose /10 years (Td) 1 dose / 10 years Rabies - 1 dose / 6-24 months if serum Ab level drops One unfortunate drawback of vaccines that rely predominately on generation of strong antibody responses is the need for vaccine booster shots, as a means of maintaining sufficiently high titers of vaccine-specific antibodies (7). Thus, many current vaccines result in waning protection over time necessitating a one-time series or in some cases recurrent booster vaccines to maintain immunity. Not surprisingly, waning of vaccine-specific responses is more pronounced in high-risk populations (Table 4.1). The seasonal influenza vaccine is a good example of this, with infants and the elderly having difficulty mounting sufficient immune responses to the vaccine (8-15). Additionally, individuals with compromised immune responses, such as those with asthma or other respiratory-related and unrelated illnesses, as well as those undergoing certain anti-cancer therapies, generate less effective vaccine responses. This chapter focuses on several complicating factors of seasonal influenza vaccines, such as waning protection, cross-protection between alternative virus subtypes and age-specific variability in vaccine efficacy. Insufficient vaccine-induced immunity is affected by the vaccine-induced immune response durability (i.e.: how rapidly the immune response wanes over time). Another significant factor affecting seasonal 94 influenza vaccine efficacy is the frequent changes in viral strain that require vaccine manufacturers to rely on annual predictions for the following season's infectious strains. The experiments outlined in this chapter were designed to evaluate whether VacSIM delivery of CpG adjuvanted whole-inactivate virus (PR8), would enhance immunogenicity and protection in an elderly population, affect the response durability (protection over time) and/or the breadth (cross-reactivity/cross-protection) of vaccine-induced immunity, compared to alternative vaccine groups. 4.2 Results 4.2.1 Durability of the Vaccine-Induced Immune Response To evaluate the durability of immune protection in mice after a single vaccination (s.c.) of whole-inactivated PR8+CpG delivered in VacSIM, two vaccine studies were designed (Figure 4.1) that would challenge mice at four different time points, out to one year post immunization. In this study (see vaccination schedule in Panel A of Figure 4.1), unvaccinated and mice immunized with PR8 in saline were included, as standard control groups for comparison to PR8+CpG delivered in VacSIM. Additionally, PR8+CpG delivered in saline as well as PR8+CpG+Alum vaccine groups were included for comparison. Sera were collected from individual mice in each group (n=5-8) prior to vaccination, to establish a baseline and again at 4, 10, 18, and 26 weeks post vaccination (wpv). PR8-specific IgG endpoint titers were determined from individual mice sera at each time point, prior to challenge, via indirect ELISA (Figure 4.2). 95 Figure 4.1: Immunization, viral challenge and biological sample collection schedules. Sera were collected from all mice, as a baseline, prior to receiving a single, subcutaneous vaccination. As presented here, subsequent serum samples were collected between 4-50 wpv and prior to lethal challenge. Mice received a single, intranasal challenge at 4, 26, 34, or 52 wpv, after which they were monitored daily until either the experiment completion and sample harvest or until the individual reached a level of post challenge weight loss and morbidity equal to or greater than its predefined humane endpoint.

After 6 months or 26 wpv mice that had been immunized with PR8+CpG in VacSIM maintained significantly increased levels of PR8-specific IgG in the sera, compared to mice that received PR8 in saline. In addition to comparing the individual endpoint titers at each time point, the mean endpoint titers for each vaccine group, across all time points post vaccination was were bled prior to vaccination, as a baseline and again at 4 wks (A), 10 wks (B), 18 wks (C), 26 wks (D), when -PR8 IgG levels in the sera were detected by indirect ELISA. Dashed lines indicate detection thresholds of the experiment. Results are representative of 2 separate experiments (n=5-8). Statistical significance (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001) compared to the vaccine group was determined using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's test for multiple comparisons (A-D). 97 graphed in Figure 4.3 to more effectively visualize the kinetic response variations between vaccine groups. Unvaccinated mice maintain background levels of PR8-specific IgG in the sera samples collected across all time points. Likely due to the oscillating trend and range of individual responses at each time point (mean \u00b1 SD), no significant change over time could be determined for the vaccine groups including PR8, PR8+CpG or PR8+Alum+CpG delivered in saline. Mice that were with PR8+CpG in VacSIM had the highest endpoint titers at each time point and their kinetic response shows a trend of gradually decreasing PR8-specific IgG levels in the sera (Figure 4.3). As part of this same study, a cohort of mice from each vaccine group (n=5-8) was challenged at 4 wpv and a second, equal cohort was challenged at 26 wpv. Following lethal PR8 challenge, individual morbidity scores were determined through daily monitoring for changes in weight and influenza-related symptoms. After a total of 2 or 3 days post challenge (dpc), depending on the cohort, lungs were harvested and viral clearance efficiency was elucidated from the lungs via plaque assay (Figure Vaccine-specific titers of -PR8 IgG at 4, 10, 18 and 26 weeks post vaccination (wpv). Error bars above or below indicate standard deviation. Statistically significant (*p<0.05, **p<0.01) change in IgG endpoint titer over time was evaluated within each vaccine group by two-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test. 98 Following lethal challenge at 4wpv, both na\u00efve and immunized mice showed insignificant morbidity at 1 and 2 dpc. The lack of morbidity this soon after challenge is consistent with previous challenge studies using C57BL/6 mice and this particular PR8 challenge virus (16, 17). Typically, na\u00efve challenged mice show signs of morbidity around the third day post challenge and frequently have a score equal to their humane Figure 4.4: Immunity tapers for all vaccine groups by 6 months influenza challenge. Immunized mice received a single vaccination (s.c.) at 4 (A) or 26 (B) weeks prior to lethal challenge (n=5-8). Immunized and na\u00efve mice, were challenged with 1000 LD50 PR8 (influenza A/PR/8/34), following which, mice were monitored daily for 2 -3 days, recording weight change and overall symptom severity (morbidity scores) post-challenge. Dashed lines at 1 and 5 indicate the minimal symptom/morbidity score (asymptomatic = 0) and the humane endpoint (individual with morbidity score of 5), respectively. Vaccine efficiency was evaluated by viral clearance from the lungs at 2 (A), 3 (B) days post challenge. Statistical significance (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001) between groups was determined by and Tukey's multiple comparisons test (A-B). 99 endpoint no later than the sixth day. Viral clearance from the lungs at 2 dpc, of the cohort challenged 4 wpv indicates that vaccines containing an adjuvant provided better sterilizing immunity compared to na\u00efve mice or mice immunized with unadjuvanted PR8 in saline. Even when incorporating outliers (one out of five mice unable to clear the virus effectively at 2 dpc time point) in the PR8+CpG in VacSIM group, this delivery regimen was among the most efficient tested, along with PR8+CpG+Alum, at inducing immunity to homologous challenge. Results from the cohort challenged six months post-vaccination (26 wpv) shows a decrease in vaccine efficacy across all vaccine groups, except for mice vaccinated with PR8+CpG in saline, which shows a greater proportion of challenged mice with undetectable virus levels in the lung at 3 dpc (Table 4.2). An additional vaccine durability experiment was performed utilizing the vaccine groups and immunization/challenge schedule outlined in panel B of Figure 4.1, in which the durability of each vaccine-induced immune response was compared out to 12 months post vaccination. As previously described, serum samples were collected from all mice prior to vaccination and at various times post vaccination to determine vaccine-specific IgG endpoint titers (Appendix B, Figure 1). The durability of vaccine-induced protection was evaluated through lethal challenge of a cohort of mice from each vaccine group (n=8 immunized, n=5 naive) at 34 wpv (~ 8 months) and lethal challenge of a second, equal cohort at 52 wpv (12 months). Following PR8 challenge at 34 wpv, individual morbidity scores were determined daily, out to 14 dpc, for comparing morbidity trends and percent survival among vaccine groups. Following the PR8 challenge at 52 wpv, individual morbidity scores were determined out to 4 dpc, at which point lungs were harvested and viral clearance efficiency was elucidated (Figure 4.5) and summarized in Table 4.2. 100 Somewhat surprisingly, the two vaccine groups with less than 100% survival 14 days post 1,000 LD50 PR8 challenge (34 wpv), were and PR8+CpG in VacSIM (75% survival). By comparing the percent survival of these two Figure 4.5: Vaccine groups possess marginal immunity by 1-year influenza challenge. Immunized mice received a single vaccination (s.c.), 34 (A) or 52 (B) weeks prior to lethal challenge (n=5-8). All mice, were challenged (i.n.) with 1,000LD50 PR8 (influenza A/PR/8/34) and monitored daily for either14 (A) or 4 (B) days post challenge (dpc), recording individual weight change and overall symptom severity (morbidity scores) post-challenge. Error bars indicate standard deviation. Dashed lines at 1 and 5 indicate the minimal symptom/morbidity score (asymptomatic = 0) and the humane endpoint (individual with morbidity score of 5), respectively. Vaccine efficiency was evaluated by percent mean survival out to 14 dpc (A) and viral clearance from the lungs at 4 dpc (B). Dashed line at 1.6pfu represents detection threshold (a value of 1.6 was given samples with 0 plaques at lowest detection). Statistical significance (**p=0.0029, ***p=0.0002, ****p<0.0001) of survival (A) was determined relative to unvaccinated mice using the Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test with multiple comparisons. 101 groups with their associated morbidity scores over time post challenge (mean \u00b1 SD) provides further context for interpreting survival results. The morbidity and survival results for PR8+CpG in VacSIM, indicates that only two of the eight mice developed symptoms and/or lost weight post challenge. Further, two of these mice developed symptoms on the 4th day, one day after onset in the unvaccinated (na\u00efve) group, and rapidly hit their humane endpoint morbidity score on day 4-5. This is in contrast to morbidity and survival results for the PR8 in saline group, in which several mice experienced weight loss and/or symptoms for a prolonged time period post challenge (days 5-10), yet only a single mouse reached its humane morbidity threshold. Table 4.2: Summary table of percent undetectable virus in lungs by group. Proportion of immunized mice with undetectable virus level in the lungs (2, 3 or 4 dpc) following lethal challenge (4, 26 or 52 wpv). Data represents two independent experiments (n=5-8) described in subsection 4.1.1. Challenged at 4, 26 or 52 weeks post vaccination (wpv) Viral load detected at 2, 3 or 4 days post challenge (dpc) Vaccine 4 wpv, 2 dpc 26 wpv, 3 dpc 52 wpv, 4.2.2 of Response Sera collected from na\u00efve and immunized mice were evaluated to determine if vaccination with PR8+CpG delivered in VacSIM led to increased levels of cross-reactive antibodies, compared to mice immunized with PR8 in saline. The presence of cross-reactive IgG antibodies in sera (4 wpv) was detected via indirect ELISA. Plates were coated with a standard concentration (200 ng/50 \u00b5L/well) of recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from various influenza-A subtypes as well as influenza-B strains (Table 4.3). Cross-reactive antibodies were detected, specific for rHA from 2 subtypes, H1N1 (A/CA/07/09) had increased IgG sera endpoint 4.7A). Figure 4.6: Proportion of immunized mice with undetectable virus in lungs. Data was pooled from 2 independent experiments (n=5-8), described in subsection 4.1.1 and Table 4.2. 103 In an expanded strain analysis, rHA surface proteins from two different influenza-B strains and one additional H1N1 strain were tested for cross-reactivity with serum samples from immunized and na\u00efve mice. Additionally we included the conserved internal protein, recombinant nucleoprotein (rNP) and whole-inactivated PR8 as a baseline and a positive control (PR8-WIV). However, despite the promising results seen in panel A, the results of this expanded study (Figure 4.7B) do not show a detectable level of cross-reactive IgG antibodies in the serum samples tested. Additionally, a hemagglutinin sequence alignment was done to, compare the alternative influenza viruses (Table 4.3) to hemagglutinin from the vaccinating PR8 strain (Figure 4.8). This sequence alignment showed that the H1 from A/CA/07/09 and A/BR/59/07 had the highest percent H1 from Figure 4.7: Cross-reactive IgG endpoint in sera of immunized mice. Serum samples were collected prior to vaccination (baseline) and 4 wpv of PR8 in saline or PR8+CpG in VacSIM. received equivalent volume of saline. Antigen-specific IgG in mice sera was detected by indirect ELISA. Dashed line indicate detection threshold. 104 A/PR/8/34 (81.27% and 82.38%, respectively), followed by H5 from 18.34%, respectively). Appendix Table C.1 and Figure C.3 show a second alignment of these hemagglutinin sequences (all amino acids shown), which indicates the published locations of certain B cell epitopes (18, 19). Table 4.3: The average cross-reactive IgG endpoint titers in 105 A heterologous vaccine and challenge study was designed to compare the heterosubtypic immune responses between vaccine groups. In this study, mice were immunized with whole-inactivated X:31 virus (20) delivered either in saline or in VacSIM. Additionally the following adjuvanted vaccine groups were examined: X:31+CpG in saline VacSIM, X:31+Alum+CpG and X:31+VacSIM+Alum. were collected as previously described and IgG endpoint titers were determined via indirect ELISA, Figure 4.8: Alignment of hemagglutinin sequences from 6 influenza A/B viruses. The sequence information for 6 different (Figure 4.7, Table 4.3) influenza viruses (ABO21709, ADI99532, AFM72832, AAC34263, ACN29383, AGM53847) were Database (IEDB) version 3.0 (www.iedb.org). Hemagglutinin sequence alignment (A) was generated using Geneious\u00ae version 8.1.4 and shows the similarity to influenza H1N1 (A/PR/08/34). The percent identity between cross-reacting influenza strains is provided in the far-left heat map column (B). 106 specific for the vaccinating antigen (whole-inactivated X:31) as well as an alternative (whole-inactivated PR8) antigen (Figure 4.9). Vaccine-specific antibody responses from mice immunized with X:31 were lower across all groups, compared to the vaccine-specific IgG endpoint titers obtained (rHBsAg, rNP) antibodies were significantly increased in two X:31 vaccine groups over na\u00efve levels. These were X:31 Alum with Alum (Figure 4.9B). In fact, X:31 in the absence of Alum or Alum combinations including Alum+CpG and Alum delivered in VacSIM, appear to have a negative effect on X:31 antibody titers. Four weeks post whole-inactivated X:31 vaccination, mice were challenged with 100 LD50 PR8 to compare morbidity and viral clearance following heterologous challenge between vaccine groups. Challenge dose was determined following a pilot study involving an unvaccinated and X:31 vaccinated cohort (n=3) at 4 different challenge doses (1 LD50, 10 LD50, 100 LD50, 500 LD50). Morbidity and viral clearance were examined in an attempt to determine a challenge dose that would overwhelm all na\u00efve mice and induce symptoms in a portion of the vaccinated mice but not overwhelm them (Appendix Figure B.2). Unfortunately, no variations could be elucidated post-challenge, using these parameters (Figure 4.10). 107 Figure 4.9: Heterologous and homologous antigen-specific -X:31 indirect of C57BL/6 mice (4wpv). Statistical significance (p*<0.05, p**<0.01) between vaccine groups was determined by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test on log-transformed data. 108 4.2.3 Population-Biased Vaccine-Induced Immunity Population-bias within this thesis, specifically refers to age-related variation in vaccine-induced immunity. Therefore, population bias was examined using two alternatively aged populations (young vs. elderly). In accordance with previously Figure 4.10: Whole-inactivated X:31 immunized mice struggle to clear virus from the lungs following 100 LD50 PR8 challenge (4 wpv). Mean change in weight of vaccine groups over time post challenge (A). Viral clearance from the lungs at 3 days post challenge (dpc) from na\u00efve and immunized mice. Vaccine group mean morbidity scores (B) graphed as box and whiskers showing all points. Dashed line on y-axis designates viral challenge dose (C) and dotted line indicates minimal morbidity score (asymptomatic=0) (B) or assay detection threshold (C). 109 published age-specific mouse studies (10, 21), a \"young\" population, consisting of 8-week old female BALB/c mice were compared to an \"elderly\" population, consisting of 12-month old female BALB/c mice. Unvaccinated mice were compared to the following vaccine groups: whole-inactivated PR8 delivered in saline or in delivered in saline or in VacSIM. Sera were collected, as previously described, evaluating -PR8 IgG endpoint titers in sera of na\u00efve and vaccinated mice at 4 wpv (Figure 4.11A). In the young mice, vaccine-specific IgG levels were significantly increased over na\u00efve and all other vaccine groups. In comparison, elderly mice immunized with PR8+CpG in VacSIM had a similar group mean to young mice, and was statistically increased over na\u00efve and all vaccine groups except PR8+CpG delivered in VacSIM. As previously described, both young and elderly cohorts were challenged intranasally (i.n.) after 4 wpv with a lethal (1000 LD50) dose of homologous virus (PR8). Following challenge, mice were monitored daily for 2 days, and lungs were harvested for virus enumeration via plaque assay (Figure 4.11B). The cohort of young mice was able to clear virus as anticipated from results in prior vaccine studies (PR8-WIV antigen, 1000 LD50 homologous challenge at 4 wpv, C57BL/6 mice). The cohort of elderly mice had more difficulty clearing the virus at 2 days post challenge across all vaccine groups. Mice vaccinated with PR8+CpG in VacSIM were the only vaccine group with undetectable virus levels (two out of five mice). Statistics were not attempted for viral clearance data in the elderly cohort since two out of the five mice in three different groups (na\u00efve, PR8 in saline and PR8+CpG in saline) reached their humane morbidity score prior to harvesting lungs on 2 dpc and therefore could not be included. 110 Figure 4.11: Elderly mice given PR8+CpG+VacSIM maintain antibody levels and ability to clear virus following lethal influenza challenge.

In the case of influenza, there are additional needs for vaccine improvement arising from the inherent complications of immunizing against zoonotic viruses with ever evolving subtypes (antigenic shift/drift). Additionally, seasonal influenza vaccines have been shown to be less effective in specific populations, such as children under 5 years and adults over 65 years (11, 23-27). Vaccine delivery by VacSIM as proposed in this dissertation, is a method inducing antigen-persistence that is subsequently hypothesized to result in enhanced immunity and increased vaccine efficacy. The improved vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity, consistently demonstrated in earlier time points post vaccination, were not seen in the long-term vaccine/challenge studies. Specifically, using a prime-only vaccination schedule, the results from both long-term studies (Figure 4.1) indicate that immunizing (s.c.) with whole-inactivated PR8 + CpG delivered in VacSIM, leads to a gradual reduction in protection (indicated by viral clearance) following a 1000 LD50 homologous challenge (Figures 4.4, 4.5). However, this gradual decrease seen in mice immunized with PR8 + CpG in VacSIM was in contrast to the sporadic trends seen in mice receiving PR8 + CpG in saline. Mice given unadjuvanted PR8 delivered in saline showed minimal levels of protection (33%) compared to some of the other groups (80-100%) at the earlier time points (4 wpv-26 wpv, Figure 4.4). The reduced viral clearance in mice vaccinated with PR8 in saline may be due to the suboptimal route being used (optimal protection via i.m.). More expansive 112 evaluation will be necessary before direct correlations can be made regarding the effects of VacSIM on the durability of vaccine-induced protection, particularly with regard to the human experience. Seasonal influenza vaccines typically contain 3-4 different strains as a means of increasing the breadth of vaccine protection. This is necessary because protection is generally not transferable between influenza subtypes. Therefore, until a universal influenza vaccine (28-30) is successfully designed, annual immunizations will be necessary to ensure some level of protection (31). Formulation of seasonal influenza vaccines involves an international consensus of which infectious strains are predicted to be in circulation (32-34). When the predicted strains align with those in circulation, vaccine efficacy improves. Vaccine effectiveness in the case of seasonal influenza vaccines indicates the probability that vaccinated individuals will avoid clinical symptoms of acute respiratory illness (ARI), which require treatment by a healthcare professional, resulting in laboratory confirmation of infection. The predicted and circulating strains were poorly aligned for the 2014-2015 influenza season and the CDC estimated overall vaccine efficacy to be 19% (95% CI: 7%-29%) (24). This, in combination with the ever-present threat of a new pandemic provides impetus for researchers to improve heterosubtypic immunity and cross-protection from newly emerging viruses. Unfortunately, VacSIM delivery of whole-inactivated PR8 + CpG seems cross-reactive serum IgG levels. Further heterologous vaccine/challenge investigation may elucidate whether the increase in cross-reactive antibodies (Figure 4.7A) are also cross protective. 113 The need to improve seasonal influenza vaccine efficacy is particularly relevant in high-risk populations (22, 26, 35-39). Individuals who are over the age of 65, for example, are at an increased risk for influenza related complications, which can become life threatening (12, 14, 15). A preliminary vaccine study was designed to compare vaccine efficacies between alternatively aged cohorts of mice and determine whether VacSIM delivery is able to improve immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy of adjuvanted (CpG) whole-inactivated PR8 vaccine. The results showed that mice vaccinated with PR8+CpG via VacSIM had higher levels of specific IgG in sera, regardless of age. Age was a more significant factor for viral clearance. In the elderly cohort, all vaccine groups struggled to clear virus, but mice immunized with PR8+CpG in VacSIM appeared to be more successful, given that two out of five mice challenged had undetectable levels of virus in the lungs at 2 dpc. In conclusion, VacSIM delivery of adjuvanted-PR8 (WIV) effectively increases immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy to lethal homologous challenge at 4-6 wpv (Th1 and Th2 biased mouse models), with immune responses steadily decreasing by 6 months. The potential of VacSIM delivery inducing a cross-reactive and cross-protective immune response remains unclear from the results of X:31/PR8 heterologous challenge study and require further evaluation. Results from the initial age-bias vaccine study suggest that PR8+CpG delivered in VacSIM improves vaccine-specific immune responses in elderly mice. 4.4 Materials and Methods 4.4.1 Experimental Design To evaluate VacSIM delivery of an influenza vaccine in a mammalian model system controlled laboratory experiments were conducted in C57BL/6 mice (Harlan). 114 Also utilized was the Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cell line (ATCC). Analyses of vaccine-specific immune responses were conducted according to standard protocols with slight modifications (33). Endpoint titers were calculated for antibodies specific to inactivated virus (PR8, X:31) or recombinant proteins (rNP, rHA) in the sera by indirect ELISA. Protection from lethal challenge was assessed in vivo in accordance with IACUC guidelines and clearance of the virus was assessed by viral lung titers determined from plaque assay. Group size for significant statistical power was determined by consultation with collaborating scientists, who have substantial experience with influenza infection in mice. In general, a sample size of at least four mice per treatment group was utilized. Animals within a group were not pooled during analysis and unless otherwise stated, data from individual mice were graphed. Following influenza challenge, mice were monitored daily and symptoms were recorded, including changes in weight, behavior, activity, posture, grooming and respiratory rate. Each animal was given a daily morbidity score, calculated from the assigned values of each symptom: hunched back or ruffed fur (1), lethargy (2), head tilt (3), weight loss >20% (3), weight loss >25% (4), weight loss >30% (5), cyanosis (5), paralysis (5), seizure (5) and severe dyspnea (5). Animals were immediately sacrificed (CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation) if they received a total score of 5 and said to have reached their humane endpoint. Mice could be excluded from the final analysis if there was evidence of its difference prior to employing the experimental manipulation (i.e.: physical or behavioral abnormality recorded prior to vaccination or challenged). No outliers have been excluded. 115 4.4.2 Animals Six to eight week old, female, C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories and housed in specific pathogen-free conditions and allowed to acclimate for one week prior to manipulation. All animal work was performed in accordance with all applicable policies and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. 4.4.3 Cell Culture Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells were cultured in 1:1 ratio of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) and Eagle's essential medium 5% CO2. 4.4.4 Vaccination Six to eight week old mice were received a single, subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination of 200 \u00b5L to their right contained PR8 (A/PR/8/34 whole-inactivated X:31 (A/Aichi/68 (H3N2) influenza, 15 \u00b5g, equal volumes VacSIM (PuraMatrix, BD Biosciences, Cat. No. 354250), as indicated. 4.4.5 Challenge Influenza challenge virus (A/Puerto Rico/08/34, H1N1) was mouse-adapted through serial passage prior to propagation in embryonated chicken eggs and lethality was determined by MLD50 (Appendix Figure A.), as described previously (40). Four 116 weeks post-vaccination, age-matched mice were challenged intranasally (i.n.) with a lethal dose (100-1000 LD50, as indicated) of mouse-adapted homologous PR8 virus under temporary sedation with tribromoethanol. Mice were monitored daily for weight change and symptom severity (subsection 4.4.1). Lungs were harvested 6-12 hours following challenge from minimally two control mice, to confirm infection by plaque assay. 4.4.6 Antibody Endpoint Titers Sera samples were collected from mice prior to vaccination (pre-bleed) and 4 weeks following vaccination. Briefly, ELISA plates were coated (4 \u00b5g/mL) with desired antigen at 4 \u00b0C overnight. ELISA coating antigens included whole A/Puerto Rico/08/34 (H1N1) inactivated/purified virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/34/Mount the following influenza strains: A/Puerto Rico/08/34 (H1N1, Protein Sciences Corp., Cat. No. (Protein Sciences Corp., Cat. No. 3006), A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1, BEI Resources, Cat. No. NR-15477, gifted by Professor R. Jeff Hogan) or B/Florida/04/2006 (BEI Resources, Cat. No. NR-15482, gifted by Professor R. Jeff Hogan). Plates were washed five times with wash buffer (160 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Tween 20), then blocked in 1X PBS containing 5% non-fat milk powder and 1% BSA for at least two hours. Plates were decanted, incubated for 2-24 hours with samples serially diluted in blocking buffer, then washed five times. Detection antibodies (HRP-conjugated -mouse IgG1, IgA and IgM from Santa Cruz, IgG3, IgG2a and IgG2b from Invitrogen, IgE from Southern Biotech or total IgG from BioLegend) were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated for one hour. After five washes, plates were developed in the dark using SureBlue 1 component TMB substrate (KPL Laboratories) and the reaction was stopped 117 with 2 N sulfuric acid. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm with 570 nm background correction. 4.4.7 Plaque Assays for Viral Quantitation Briefly, serially diluted lung were with MDCK under 2.4% Avicel (FMC BioPolymer) overlay. After incubation for 2-3 days, cells were fixed with methanol/acetone and stained with crystal violet (Acros Organics) for enumeration of plaque forming units (pfu). Lung samples with undetectable virus were graphed as 4 pfu per lung, which is a value equal to \u00bd of the detection threshold of the assay. 4.4.8 Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.0. Statistical methods and significant differences between vaccination groups include one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey or Bonferroni's test for multiple comparisons. Mean survival was calculated using Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. The statistical method(s) used and alpha level (0.05 or 0.01) have been specified in each figure legend. 4.5 References 1.

The proposed mechanism by which VacSIM delivery leads to increased immunogenicity was initially discussed in Chapter 2. To reiterate, VacSIM enhances vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy based on its ability to produce a three-dimensional vaccine depot, which provides for antigen persistence (4). To recap, VacSIM is simply a solution of the synthetic (RADA)4 oligopeptides in solution. Under physiological conditions, the (RADA)4 synthetic oligopeptide self-assembles into a hydrated nanofiber gel-depot with vaccine components present in the aqueous phase. Over time, vaccine components in the aqueous phase egress via pores, out of the gel-matrix. The three-dimensional vaccine-matrix depot, is resorbable, non-toxic and non-reactogenic (5, 6). This chapter describes early mechanistic experiments designed to further investigate characteristics innate to VacSIM. Coinciding with published results (4, 6, 7) and the hypothesized slow release or delayed antigen egress, the in vitro antigen release experiments discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, indicated that protein subunit vaccines, differentially diffuse from the three-dimentional vaccine-matrix depot based on pore size, which itself is governed by the 122 concentration of (RADA)4 oligopeptides in solution. Cell recruitment experiments were designed to evaluate whether the gradual egress of antigen due to VacSIM delivery, caused enhanced maturation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), resulting in maturation/activation of vaccine-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Antigen release experiments (Chapters 2 and 3) also demonstrated that vaccines comprised of formalin-inactivated whole virus, were unable to diffuse from the in vitro assembled vaccine-matrix depots. Thus, for whole inactivated vaccines, the addition of adjuvants, such as CpG, appears necessary for enhanced vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. It is likely that this molecular adjuvant plays a role in recruitment of APCs to the vaccine depot, such that immune responding cells may encounter and uptake vaccine antigen. In addition, experiments were designed to evaluate the total cell numbers in draining versus non-draining lymph nodes at 1-2 days post vaccination, as well as the total and vaccine-specific cell populations (DCs, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). For comparison between vaccine groups, total cell numbers and relative percentages (of live) were determined from a pool of draining and non-draining lymph nodes (1 pool/mouse) harvested 48 hours post challenge. In addition, pre-challenge lymph nodes were collected from a cohort of mice, previously (4 wpv) vaccinated with PR8+CpG in VacSIM, so that cell population variations pre- and post-challenge could be evaluated. 5.2 Results 5.2.1 VacSIM-Induced Activation of APCs Various cells can function as antigen presenting cells (APCs), including B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), however DCs are considered as professional APCs (8-10). Therefore in vitro experiments were performed utilizing bone-marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to evaluate immune activating properties of VacSIM. 123 These studies compared VacSIM in the presence or absence of antigen/adjuvant (Figure 5.1). BMDCs were isolated from the femurs of C57BL/6 mice and cultured for 6-7 days. Flow cytometry was used to validate 6 and 7-day cultures of BMDCs. Specifically, looking for the presence of a defined DC population that when incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 24 hours prior to staining, underwent a clear shift in phenotype from CD11c(+),CD86(-) to CD86(+) markers (CD86, CD11c) and live/dead indicator were used to distinguish live cells that were activated DCs. The ability of mitogens and vaccine antigens alone, or in combination with VacSIM, were evaluated for their ability to stimulate day 6-7 BMDCs in vitro (Figure 5.1). Specifically, vaccine components (human serum albumin, HSA) or whole-inactivated virus (influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34, PR8), or the adjuvants LPS and CpG (ODN-1826) plus or minus VacSIM, were incubated with 2x105 cells per 200uL in complete media. Vaccine components were used at 1/10th the standard vaccination concentrations, whether incubated with BMDCs individually or in combination. Positive and negative controls were culture of BMDCs in complete media alone (negative), or with LPS (positive) for DC activation. Figure 5.1 shows that in the absence of antigen or adjuvant, VacSIM by itself does not induce DC activation, supporting the hypothesis that VacSIM functions as a delivery method that lacks inherent adjuvant activity. Further, in regards to VacSIM being non-immunostimulatory, a preliminary (n =2) in vivo study was conducted to determine if injection of VacSIM alone would give rise to increased cell recruitment in the draining lymph nodes (Appendix Figure C.3). In this study, mice received a single, subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination of saline or VacSIM \u00b1 124 CpG. The draining and non-draining lymph nodes were collected at 24 and 48 hours post-vaccination (hpv), and total cell counts were determined and compared between groups. Results from this pilot study showed that injection of VacSIM in the absence of antigen/adjuvant does not alter cell numbers in the draining and non-draining lymph nodes and was comparable to mice injected with sterile saline. 125 Figure 5.1: VacSIM does not induce dendritic cell (DC) activation in the absence of antigen/adjuvant. Six day BMDCs were incubated with the various vaccine components singly and in combination as shown in Panel B. DCs were considered activated CD11+,CD86+. 126 5.2.2 In vitro Assembled Antigen-Incorporating Depots and Antigen Uptake by DCs A preliminary confocal study was conducted in an attempt to visualize antigen uptake by dendritic cells (DCs). The antigen selected was human to DyLight-488, not shown due to inadequate fluorescence at the time of imaging). Fluorescently conjugated HSA was premixed with VacSIM at a 1:5 ratio. This mixture was added without mixing, into a single well (12-well plate) containing BMDCs (7-day culture) in sterile 1x PBS. Imaging began immediately following addition of labeled HSA and VacSIM mixture. Images recorded by fluorescent and light microscopy and collected in the minutes following incubation with BMDCs provide visual confirmation of in vitro induce 3-dimenstional gel-matrix depots incorporating and containing fluorescent antigen (blue arrows). After some time, there is the appearance of individual fluorescent cells, possibly indicating uptake of fluorescent antigen (white arrows) by the DCs in culture (Figure 5.2). 127 5.2.3 VacSIM Delivery of Antigen/Adjuvant Leads to the Localized Increase of Immune Cells A more expansive in vivo study was conducted to further explore whether the persistence of antigen, as a result of VacSIM delivery, would affect cell recruitment to draining and/or non-draining lymph nodes. Mice were vaccinated (s.c.) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) delivered in saline or in VacSIM, with or without the adjuvants CpG and alum (alone or in combination). The axillary and inguinal lymph nodes (draining /non-draining) were harvested at 24 and 48 hpv. Total cell counts were determined for each lymph node at both time points following immunization. Figure 5.3 shows that mice vaccinated with BSA+CpG in VacSIM consistently had an increased number of cells in their draining lymph nodes compared to non-draining lymph nodes. Figure 5.2: Confocal images showing VacSIM depots of fluorescent cells (BMDCs). Fluorescently conjugated antigen (DL680 in top panels or DL488 in bottom panels) and VacSIM induced to self-assemble upon incubation with bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Conjugated antigen was pre-mixed with VacSIM immediately prior to being added to 6-7 day BMDC culture. Confocal images were taken immediately following addition to antigen+VacSIM to BMDC culture. White arrows in top panels indicate fluorescent cells. Blue arrows in bottom panels indicate fluorescent HSA within VacSIM in vitro self-assembled gel depot. 128 This trend is maintained in this particular vaccine group, regardless of time point (24 or 48 hpv) or specific lymph node (axillary or inguinal). In general, when comparing the six different vaccine groups, the mice who received BSA adjuvanted with CpG showed an increased accumulation of cells by the 48 hpv time point, which appeared most striking in the inguinal lymph nodes. In addition to total cell counts, the type of immune cells present in the lymph nodes at 24 and 48 hpv was assessed by flow cytometry. Mice were vaccinated with fluorescently conjugated BSA (BSA:DyLight-680) \u00b1 adjuvant and delivered in saline or VacSIM. Lymph nodes were harvested at 24 and 48 hpv, processed and resulting cells stained with specific cell markers to detect DCs and T cells (CD11b, CD11c, CD86, Figure 5.3: Vaccinating with antigen+CpG delivered in VacSIM leads to increased total cell counts in the draining versus non-draining lymph nodes at 1-2 days post vaccination. Mice receive a single vaccination (s.c.) 24 or 48 hours prior to harvesting lymph nodes (n=4-5/time point). Cell counts determined using a 1:1 dilution with trypan blue viability dye on a TC-10 automatic cell counter available from Bio-rad. 129 CD3) following live/dead discrimination. The following phenotypes were used to distinguish cell populations present in the lymph nodes at 24 and 48 hpv: T cells were defined CD3+and DCs were defined as CD11c+ and either CD86- (resting) or CD86+ (activated). Consistent with the total cell counts (Figure 5.3), cell type analysis by flow cytometry showed that mice vaccinated with BSA+CpG in VacSIM had increased numbers of total DCs (Figure 5.4), activated DCs (Figure 5.5) and T cells (Figure 5.6) in the draining lymph nodes compared to non-draining lymph nodes. In contrast, lymph nodes that were harvested from mice vaccinated with BSA adjuvanted with Alum and/or CpG delivered in saline, were far more variable. Although there were occasions when these vaccine groups had increased cell numbers in the draining lymph nodes compared to non-draining lymph nodes, particularly by the 48 hpv time point, this was often accompanied by a systemic increase in specific cell numbers. The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) specific for these three cell populations at both 24/48 hpv was also determined, although the results were far more variable and no clear trend emerged (Appendix Figures C.3-C.4). 130 Figure 5.4: Fluorescently labeled BSA delivered with CpG + VacSIM results in an increased number of DCs that localize to the draining lymph nodes. Shown here are the cell counts of total DCs per draining or non-draining lymph node (axillary and inguinal) at 24 or 48 hours following a single vaccination (s.c.) with fluorescently conjugated bovine serum albumin saline or VacSIM (n=4-5 per time point). Total DC counts were determined by flow cytometry, discriminating for live CD11c+, CD86+/ - lymph node cells. 131 Figure 5.5: BSA+ CpG delivered in VacSIM leads to an increased number of activated DCs, that generally localize in the draining lymph nodes. Shown here are the cell counts of activated DCs (live, CD11c+, CD86+) per draining or non-draining lymph node (axillary and inguinal) at 24 or 48 hours following a single vaccination (s.c.) with fluorescently conjugated bovine serum albumin saline or VacSIM (n=4-5 per time point). Activated DC counts per lymph node were determined by flow cytometry, discriminating for live CD11c+, CD86+ lymph node cells. 132 5.2.4 Cells Present in Pooled Lymph Nodes of Vaccinated Mice 48 Hours Following Intranasal Challenge The following study was conducted to provide a more complete picture of the mechanism behind VacSIM delivery and its ability to improve vaccine efficacy. Specifically this study focused on obtaining a more detailed understanding of underlying factors enabling VacSIM delivery of CpG-adjuvanted, whole-inactivated PR8 to induce more effective viral clearance as well as the production of vaccine-specific mucosal antibodies in the lungs, following homologous challenge (discussed in Chapters 2-4). Mice received a single vaccination (s.c.) containing whole-inactivated PR8 \u00b1 CpG, delivered in either saline or VacSIM. Four weeks later these same mice received an Figure 5.6: Increased number of T cells in the draining lymph nodes of mice vaccinated with BSA+ CpG delivered in VacSIM compared to the non-draining lymph nodes. Shown here are the T cell counts per draining or non-draining lymph node (axillary and inguinal) at 24 or 48 hours following a single vaccination (s.c.) with fluorescently conjugated bovine serum albumin saline or VacSIM (n=4-5 per time point). T cells were discriminated as live CD3+lymph node cells by flow cytometry. 133 intranasal (i.n.) challenge with a lethal dose (1,000 LD50) of homologous virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/34). Following challenge, mice were monitored daily for weight loss and symptoms of illness as described previously (Chapters 2-4). At 48 hours post challenge (hpc) lymph nodes were harvested, processed and stained for cell-specific analysis via flow cytometry. A pool of six lymph nodes was collected from each mouse, including the mediastinal, brachial and axillary draining lymph nodes and non-draining lymph nodes. Therefore, the cell counts per mouse, indicate the pool of six lymph nodes, harvested from an individual mouse. Table 5.1 lists the fluorescent markers used in this study and the spectral overlap has been included in the appendix (Figure C.8). In this and all other flow experiments described in this dissertation, live cells were initially selected using live/dead discrimination, after which population gates were determined according to fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls. Compensation controls included single-stained cell samples, an unstained cell sample as well as a sample containing all fluorophores being used. Cell counts per mouse were determined for eight distinct immune cell populations, including activated/naive CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, influenza-specific NP-tetramer+ CD8+ T cells (activated/na\u00efve), natural killer cells (NKs) or a population defined as \"other\", which indicated cells that were neither CD8+/CD4+ T cells or NKs (Figure 5.7A). The phenotypes used to discriminate distinct cell populations from total live cells are listed in Table 5.2. In addition to cell counts, the relative populations were determined, with respect to total live cells (Figure 5.7B). The group vaccinated with PR8+CpG delivered in VacSIM had a slight increase in the relative proportion of NK 134 cells compared to all other vaccine groups, however neither the population counts nor the relative percentages showed statistically significant differences. Table 5.1: Phenotypic markers. Marker : Fluorophore CD8a for analysis by flow cytometry. Live cells were initially selected using live/dead discrimination and population gates were determined according to fluoresce minus one (FMOs) controls. Immune cell type Population phenotype Naive CD8 T Minimal variation between PR8(WIV) vaccine groups, in relative immune cell populations at 48 hour post influenza challenge. Immune cell population counts per mouse and population frequencies were determined from pooled lymph node samples, at 48 hour post influenza challenge. Data was shown to be not significant by 2-way ANOVA and Bonferroni's multiple comparisons test. 136 5.3 Conclusions VacSIM delivery provides improved immunogenicity (4) and vaccine efficacy. However in the absence of antigens and/or adjuvants, VacSIM lacks immunostimulatory characteristics (Figure 5.1, Figure 5.3). The (RADA)4 oligopeptides within VacSIM have previously been shown, in vitro and in vivo, to provide an effective porous barrier and facilitate slow release of molecules such as insulin (7, 11). All of which is consistent with the hypothesized mechanism and preliminary results discussed in this chapter. This dissertation proposes that delivery of vaccine antigens and/or adjuvants in VacSIM allows for an extended (Figure 5.3) and gradual exposure to antigens/adjuvants to the immune system (Figure 5.1, Figure 5.2). The confocal experiments showing DCs infiltrating the VacSIM gel-matrix and taking up fluoresceinated HSA are limited in nature and need to be extended to determine if DCs enter the porous vaccine-gel structure to retrieve antigen/adjuvant components, and how this is influenced by the addition of adjuvants, and/or altering the concentration of the (RADA)4 synthetic oligopeptide in VacSIM to reduce/increase the gel-matrix pore size. Similar evaluations with model antigens of small, medium and high molecular weights to gain further understanding on how vaccine antigen size may influence egress from the gel-matrix, as well as DC migration into the gel-matrix. Future imaging experiments should utilize time-lapse microscopy to monitor DC entry and exit from the gel-matrix in vitro. Ultimately, the use of whole animal imaging coincident with cytometry, to monitor migration of APCs and labeled antigen trafficking to and from the VacSIM gel-matrix depot and lymph nodes over time. 137 The cell recruitment experiments (Figures 5.3-5.6) presented in this chapter show that VacSIM delivery of antigen/adjuvant leads to a non-systemic increase of immune cells in the draining lymph nodes compared to the non-draining lymph nodes. This trend is visible in total cell counts as well as DC and T cell populations, and is most impressive by 48 hours post vaccination. This trend of cell recruitment being localized to the draining lymph nodes at 48 hours post vaccination remains consistent for mice receiving antigen + CpG delivered in VacSIM, with the exception of one non-draining lymph node with more activated DCs than the corresponding draining lymph node. Mice that received antigen in the presence or absence of antigen showed increased cell recruitment to the draining and/or the non-draining lymph nodes by 48 hours post vaccination, particularly with CpG. Taken together, these results suggest that in addition to increasing immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy, VacSIM may also be able to minimize vaccine adverse events that can arise due to incorporation of highly reactogenic/immunostimulating vaccine components, through \"controlled\" release or gradual exposure. This potential added benefit to immunizing in VacSIM could enable the incorporation of vaccine components, historically considered too potent and therefore otherwise excluded from clinical development due to reactogenicity concerns. Additional reactogenicity studies are currently ongoing, funded through a Georgia Research Alliance (GRA) Ventures seed grant. The forthcoming results should provide additional evidence necessary to move forward or reevaluate this hypothesis. Immune cell phenotype analysis was conducted by flow cytometry to investigate specific cell populations present in pooled lymph node samples of draining and non- 138 draining lymph nodes harvested 1 day prior or 2 days following homologous influenza challenge (Figure 5.7- Figure 5 .10). As previously discussed, there were no significant variations in cell populations (counts/mouse or frequency with respect to live) between vaccine groups post challenge. Similarly, there was no significant variation in immune populations when comparing 1 day prior to challenge with 2 days following challenge. Due to the extended time post vaccination (4-weeks), it was determined that pooling the lymph nodes would ensure a sufficient number of cells were collected. It is possible that had draining and non-draining lymph nodes been treated individually rather than being pooled, a similar trend of increasing immune cells localized to the draining versus the non-draining lymph nodes would be visible. Should a similar experiment be conducted in the future, it may be interesting to include lung washes (bronchoalveolar lavage), comparing between the various vaccine groups. 5.4 Materials and Methods 5.4.1 Animals Female C57BL/6 mice (Harlan) aged 5-7 weeks were obtained from Harlan laboratories and housed in pathogen-free conditions. Mice were acclimated for one week prior to manipulations. All animal handling was conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and with the approval of the institutional animal care and use committee. Animals within a group were not pooled during analysis and unless otherwise stated, data from individual mice were graphed. Mice could be excluded from the final analysis if there was evidence of its difference prior to employing the experimental manipulation (i.e.: physical or behavioral abnormality recorded prior to vaccination or challenged). 5.4.2 Bone marrow derived dendritic cells 139 Femurs and tibias were collected from C57BL/6 mice and sterilized by bones in 70% EtOH (1x), 1x marrow was isolated in RPMI-1640 serum-free media. Suspended lymphocyte precursor cells were separated and adherent cells were retained for continued culture in complete media [RPMI-1640, 10% FBS, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, non-essential at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. After 6 days, DC cultures were confirmed by incubating 2 x 106 cells in 2ml complete media \u00b1 100 ng/mL LPS for 16-20 hours (differentiate activated/resting DCs). Cells were treated with Fc with CD86-FITC (BD) and CD11c-PE (BD). 5.4.3 Vaccination Six to eight week old mice (n=4-8) received a single vaccination of 200 \u00b5L for subcutaneous (s.c.) to their right flank. PR8 whole-inactivated PR8 (A/PR/8/34 whole-inactivated X:31 (A/Aichi/68 (H3N2) influenza, 15 \u00b5g, Charles River Laboratories, Cat. No. 10100784), BSA (add), equal volumes VacSIM (PuraMatrix, BD Biosciences, Cat. No. 354250), as indicated. Influenza challenge virus (A/Puerto Rico/08/34, H1N1) was mouse-adapted through serial passage prior to propagation in embryonated chicken eggs and lethality was determined by MLD50, as described previously (12). Four weeks post-vaccination, age-matched mice were challenged intranasally (i.n.) with 1000 LD50 of mouse-adapted 140 homologous PR8 virus under temporary sedation with tribromoethanol. Lungs were harvested immediately following challenge from minimally two control mice, to confirm infection by plaque assay. Mice were monitored daily for weight change and symptom severity including changes in weight, behavior, activity, posture, grooming and respiratory rate. Each animal was given a daily morbidity score, calculated from the assigned values of each symptom: hunched back or ruffed fur (1), lethargy (2), head tilt (3), weight loss >20% (3), weight loss >25% (4), weight loss >30% (5), cyanosis (5), paralysis (5), seizure (5) and severe dyspnea (5). Animals were immediately sacrificed (CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation) if they received a total score of 5 and said to have reached their humane endpoint. 5.4.5 Flow or brachial lymph nodes were harvested at 12, 24, 36 or 48 hours post vaccination, 4 weeks post vaccination and prior to challenge or 4 weeks post vaccination and 2 days following challenge. Tissues were macerated and single cell suspensions were stained for flow cytometry with -CD344-FITC, -NK1.1-PE, green/NIR viability dye (Invitrogen). Following live/dead discrimination, population gates were determined according to fluoresce minus one (FMOs) controls. Compensation controls included single-stained cell samples (or bead samples), an unstained cell sample as well as a sample containing all fluorophores being used in the particular staining experiment. When an experiment contained multiple time points, resulting in multiple staining sessions, all FMO and compensation controls were remade, during subsequent sample 141 staining. Samples were acquired on a version X (10.0.6) or FACSDiva software (BD). 5.4.6 Statistical Significance In general, a sample size of at least four mice per treatment group was utilized. Animals within a group were not pooled during analysis and unless otherwise stated, data from individual mice were graphed. No outliers were excluded. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.0. Statistical methods and significant differences between vaccination groups were determined using two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni's multiple comparisons test. 5.5 References 1. Berzofsky JA, et al.

It is through this same concept that many successful vaccines utilize pathogen mimicry or provide a low-level infection as a means of inducing host immunity. However, there still remains a critical need to develop effective vaccines targeting pathogens that are unable to induce sterilizing immunity following natural infection, such as malaria or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to list just two such diseases. Similarly, pathogens inducing latent or persistent infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) represent further complicated vaccine targets (1, 2). In addition, several current vaccines, as well as numerous candidate vaccine antigens induce sub-optimal immune responses and thus fail to induce good levels of protection. Therefore, availability of safe and effective adjuvants and/or delivery systems that will allow increased vaccine-induced protection remains a crucial goal (3, 4). Chapter 2 introduces the patent pending delivery system, VacSIM (vaccine self-assembling immune matrix), the development of which has been the focus of this dissertation. The results outlined in this chapter (summarized in Table 6.1), provide the foundation on which is built a framework for investigating the potential of VacSIM as a three-dimensional vaccine delivery platform. VacSIM is solely comprised of a 1.0% 144 solution of the synthetic (RADA)4 self-assembling oligopeptide buffer. Immediately post-injection, the (RADA)4 oligopeptides self-assemble into hydrated fibers that form a gel-matrix with vaccine components found in the aqueous phase. We hypothesize that the egress of vaccine components through the pores in the gel-matrix provides antigen persistence and improved vaccine responses. The RADA-based self-assembling nanofibers scaffolds (SANS) were originally conceived and designed by Zhang and colleagues (5-7). The (RADA)4 synthetic oligopeptide was commercialized by 3-D Matrix Inc. as the product PuraMatrix for use in 3-D cell culture experiments. The (RADA)4 oligopeptides contained in VacSIM are triggered to self-assemble, shifting from a semi-viscous liquid to a gel phase, upon exposure to physiological conditions of salinity and pH (6, 8-10). Vaccine delivery in VacSIM is possible through simple mixing with the desired vaccine antigen and/or adjuvant prior to immunizing. Immediately after being injected, the oligopeptide, which make up the VacSIM portion of this vaccine, begin self-assembling into a porous a gel-matrix depot of concentrated vaccine components, which is hypothesized to provide antigen persistence and improve vaccine efficacy. Thus, VacSIM enables rapid and straightforward preparation, making it an ideal candidate for pandemic scenarios as well as vaccines that may require rapid formulation changes. 145 Table 6.1: Summary of Chapter 2 results.

Specifically, these results demonstrate that immunizing Th1- and/or Th2-biased mice with various protein subunit antigens (rHBsAg, rNP), provides increased antigen-specific immunogenicity that can be further improved by addition of an adjuvant, such as CpG (Figures 2.4-2.6). Results discussed in both Chapters 2 and 3 showed that VacSIM is not limited to improving protein subunit vaccines, but also improved immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy with adjuvanted whole-inactivated viruses (PR8). Specifically, demonstrating that VacSIM delivery of CpG adjuvanted PR8 (WIV) provides improved protection from lethal challenge (1,000 LD50, homologous, 4 wpv), determined by increased viral clearance from the lungs as well as reduced morbidity and mortality (Figures 2.10, 2.11, Figures 3.3, S3.7). Results shown in Figure 2.10 demonstrate VacSIM is also flexible enough to incorporate alternative types of 146 adjuvants, including unmethylated CpG-ODN that signals inorganic aluminum salts (Alum, Al(OH)3) that induce activation of multiple complement cascades (11) as well as candidate adjuvant formulations of a glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (GLA)-variant, which function as TLR-4 agonists (12). Mice that received a single vaccination of whole-inactivated PR8+CpG in VacSIM had increased tetramer-specific CD8+ T cells in the lungs at two days post challenge (dpc), compared to na\u00efve mice or those vaccinated with PR8 in saline. Whole-inactivated PR8 utilized in this comparison due to its high immunogenicity and reputation as a research standard in the field (Figure 3.4). In addition to enhanced influenza-specific CD8+ T cells, this vaccine group (PR8+CpG in VacSIM) also had increased vaccine-specific mucosal antibodies in the lungs compared to na\u00efve mice or those vaccinated with PR8 in saline after 1 dpc (Figure 3.1D). This finding is particularly intriguing since inactivated vaccines are not typically capable of inducing a mucosal antibody response. 147 Table 6.2: Summary of Chapter 3 results.

Mucosal vaccines activate mucosal B and T lymphocytes and induce secretory IgA responses (14) that assists in cell-mediated toxicity and preventing colonization of mucosal barrier cells by infectious pathogens (15). There are several 148 advantages to vaccine delivery via mucosal surfaces, but relatively few approved vaccines do so. Those that have been approved include orally delivered vaccines against polio, rotavirus, cholera, typhoid and the intranasal delivered seasonal influenza vaccine (13). One of the main complicating factors associated with mucosal vaccines is poor immunogenicity, as a result of ineffective antigen uptake and/or presentation, which may be exacerbated by enzymatic degradation (13, 16). A major component in the proposed VacSIM mechanism involves generation of a vaccine depot. Thus, it is possible that another advantage of VacSIM is that the gel-matrix provides a stabilizing effect to vaccine components and in the case of mucosal environments may delay and/or reduce enzymatic or systemic degradation. Therefore, mucosal delivery of vaccines using VacSIM presents an approach, which may overcome some, if not all of the above-mentioned complications typically associated with delivery to mucosal sites. In the case of seasonal influenza vaccines, efficacy varies from year to year, depending on the alignment of predicted and circulating viral strains. Experts at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommend that all persons older than six months receive an annual influenza vaccination, particularly those with increased risk of developing more severe complications as a result of infection. As discussed in Chapter 4, vaccine effectiveness in the case of seasonal influenza, refers to probability that vaccinated individuals will avoid clinical symptoms of acute respiratory illness (ARI) that require treatment by a healthcare professional that results in laboratory confirmation of virus infection. A recent publication, spanning five influenza seasons (November-April) between 2006 and 2012 (data from 2009-2010 was excluded) indicated seasonal trivalent inactivated vaccines to be 58.4% effective (95% CI, 7.9%-81.1%) in those aged 149 65 years and over (17). Seasonal influenza vaccines are typically less effective in those under the age of 5 and over the age of 65 (18, 19). In the most recent influenza season (2014-2015) the predicted virus strains were not aligned with the circulating strains, as a result of drifted influenza A H3N2 circulating virus strains. For the 2014-2015 season the CDC has estimated overall vaccine efficacy to be 19% (95% CI: 7%- 29%) (20). As there are still several weeks before this close of this season, the age-specific vaccine efficacy estimations are not yet available. However, a recent modeling study conducted by the CDC suggests that during a moderately severe influenza season (i.e.: 2012-2013) a vaccine efficacy for adults over the age of 65 that is only 10%, would translate to preventing ~13,000 hospital visits due to influenza related illness (IRI) by adults 65 in the United States (21). These hypothetical modeling studies suggest that even minor improvement in seasonal influenza vaccine efficacy would provide significant health and socioeconomic benefits. The preliminary results described in chapter 4 and summarized in Table 6.3 indicate that VacSIM delivery of an adjuvanted, inactivated influenza vaccine leads to improved vaccine-specific immune responses and viral clearance, compared to delivery in saline (Figure 4.10). Unfortunately, under the experimental conditions outlined in Chapter 4, VacSIM did not appear to extend the duration of vaccine efficacy (Figures 4.4-4.5) or induce cross-reactive immunity to alternative influenza A subtypes (Figures 4.6, 4.8-4.9). However, the inability to extend the duration of vaccine-induced protection (under these conditions) is not by any means a fatal flaw in the case of seasonal influenza vaccines. The influenza season is typically 6 months and annual vaccination against seasonal viruses will continue to be the recommendation at least until there is a viable \"universal\" 150 influenza vaccine option. Additionally, the results presented in this thesis were derived from studies using na\u00efve mice and thus these results cannot be expected to translate directly to outcomes within a non-na\u00efve human population. Further, based on the results presented here, it is likely that VacSIM delivery would provide enhanced immunogenicity for a broad spectrum of influenza subtypes, if combined with one or more universal vaccine antigen candidates, which are notoriously poor immune stimulators. Table 6.3: Summary of Chapter 4 results. Figure(s) Chapter 4: Results Overview Timeline 4.2, 4.3, (Appendix B.1) A single (s.c.) immunization of whole-inactivated PR8 and CpG delivered in VacSIM leads to enhanced -PR8 IgG levels in the sera, which are maintained out to 6 and 12 months 4, 10, 18, 26 wpv 4.4, 4.5, (Table 4.2) Whole-inactivated PR8 and CpG delivered in VacSIM via a single s.c. vaccination provides gradually decreasing level of protection from lethal challenge out to 6 and 12 months. 4, 26, 34, 52 wpv 2, 3, 14, 4 dpc 4.6, 4.7 (Table 4.3) The cross-reactive -IgG levels in sera of mice immunized with PR8 (WIV) are variable depending on the recombinant hemagglutinin (rHA) being evaluated 4 wpv 4.8, 4.9 The -PR8 and -X:31 specific IgG levels in sera of mice immunized with X:31(WIV) are quite similar. Unfortunately (likely due to challenge dose) there was no variation in protection between groups. 4 wpv, 3 dpc 4.10 Initial study indicates that VacSIM is also able to improve vaccine-specific immune responses and induced protection of an adjuvanted whole-inactivated vaccine (PR8+CpG) in elderly mice. 4 wpv 3 dpc The precise mechanism by which VacSIM provides improved vaccine responses is still under investigation. The results from several early studies were presented in Chapter 5 and summarized in Table 6.4. Overall, VacSIM is hypothesized to allow antigen persistence through generation of a porous gel-matrix, resulting in a 151 depot of vaccine components localized at the site of delivery. All in vitro and in vivo studies, which included VacSIM in the absence of an antigen or adjuvant, indicate that VacSIM does not itself possess immunostimulatory activity (Figures, 5.1, 5.3, Figure 3.3E). Specifically, VacSIM alone was insufficient to induce DC activation. However, in combination with CpG and either a protein subunit antigen (HSA) or inactivated virus (PR8), DC activation was not only achieved, but increased over levels of either antigen or adjuvant component individually (Figure 5.1). Immunization with VacSIM, in the absence of an antigen or adjuvant resulted in no protection from influenza challenge (Figure 3.3E) and did not induce cell recruitment to the draining or non-draining lymph nodes at 12, 24 or 36 hours post vaccination (hpv) (Appendix Figure C.3). Given that the (RADA)4 oligopeptides contained in VacSIM are resorbable, non-toxic and non-reactogenic (22, 23), the results included in this dissertation, showing that VacSIM is not immunostimulating are not surprising. Again, further studies on the mechanism of VacSIM delivery need to be performed, including repetitive immunizations using VacSIM over time to insure that VacSIM is not reactogenic when used repeatedly. Lastly, such \"repeat\" vaccine experiments would also be able to show if local or systemic immune alterations occur simply as a result of environmental disturbances due to physical changes on a nanoscale level, instigated by VacSIM self-assembly and depot formation. As shown in these studies, model antigens diffuse out of the VacSIM gel-depot over time, thus generating antigen persistence (Figure 2.8/Figure 3.5). This slow egress from the depot provides an extended window of opportunity for early responding antigen presenting cells (APCs) to become activated by the available vaccinating 152 antigen/adjuvant (24). Chapter 5 describes the results from several studies investigating the affects on cell recruitment to the lymph nodes after immunization with or without VacSIM. Mice that received a vaccine containing antigen + CpG in VacSIM, showed an increased number of total cells localized to the draining lymph nodes compared to the non-draining lymph nodes at 24 hpv and increased further at 48 hpv (Figure 5.3). In addition to total cell counts, flow cytometry was used to discriminate between immune cell population phenotypes and determine population counts as well as relative frequencies. The DC, activated DC and T-cell populations present in the individual draining and non-draining lymph nodes were evaluated across six alternative vaccine groups (n= 4-5) and at two time points (24, 48hpv). Intriguingly, the trend of increased cell recruitment being localized to the draining lymph nodes in the antigen + CpG + VacSIM cohort, was maintained consistently (Figures 5.4-5.6). However, results from fluor-conjugated antigens used to calculate the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) were not clearly defined and require further optimization of fluorescent conjugates including, the dose per mouse of labeled protein as well as investigating multiple times post vaccination (Appendix Figures C.4 and C.5). 153 Table 6.4: Summary of Chapter 5 results.

These findings remain to be validated with additional subunit antigens and adjuvants. Because VacSIM provides gradual egress of vaccine components; these results suggest that in addition to increasing immunogenicity and vaccine-induced protection, VacSIM may also represent an avenue for reducing reactogenicity from vaccine-incorporated antigens/adjuvants. Therefore, through 154 \"controlled\" release of the highly immune-stimulating vaccine component(s), VacSIM could provide for more physiologically acceptable exposure to the highly immune-stimulating vaccine component(s). This potential new benefit to immunizing in VacSIM could lead to re-evaluation of promising vaccine antigens/adjuvants, which historically have been considered too potent and excluded due to reactogenicity concerns from clinical development. One such adjuvant class is the CpG-ODNs. Additional reactogenicity studies funded through a Georgia Research Alliance (GRA) Ventures seed grant are currently ongoing and these forthcoming results will hopefully provide the additional evidence necessary to move forward or reevaluate this new hypothesis. 6.2 References 1.

Reprinted here with permission from publisher. 158 A.1 Abstract Vaccination remains the most effective public health tool to prevent infectious diseases. Many vaccines are marginally effective and need enhancement for immunocompromised, elderly, and very young populations. To enhance immunogenicity, we exploited the biphasic property of the (RADA)4 synthetic oligopeptide to create VacSIM (vaccine self-assembling immune matrix), a new delivery method. VacSIM solution can easily be mixed with antigens, organisms, and adjuvants for injection. Postinjection, the peptides self-assemble into hydrated nanofiber gel matrices, forming a depot with antigens and adjuvants in the aqueous phase. We believe the depot provides slow release of immunogens, leading to increased activation of antigen-presenting cells that then drive enhanced immunogenicity. Using recombinant hepatitis B virus surface antigen (rHBsAg) as a model immunogen, we compared VacSIM delivery to delivery in alum or complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Delivery of the rHBsAg antigen to mice via VacSIM without adjuvant elicited higher specific IgG responses than when rHBsAg was delivered in alum or CFA. Evaluating IgG subtypes showed a mixed Th1/Th2 type response following immunization with VacSIM, which was driven further toward Th1 with addition of CpG as the adjuvant. Increased specific IgG endpoint titers were observed in both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, representative of Th1 and Th2 environments, respectively. Restimulation of splenocytes suggests that VacSIM does not cause an immediate proinflammatory response in the host. Overall, these results suggest that VacSIM, as a new delivery method, has the potential to enhance immunogenicity and efficacy of numerous vaccines. 159 A.2 Introduction Vaccines remain the single greatest public health tool to combat infectious diseases. Vaccine formulation and delivery are key to the ability of vaccines to induce the desired immune responses. One goal of vaccine delivery is to present vaccine antigens in a manner that enhances antigen-presenting-cell (APC) activation, leading to antigen/organism uptake and processing of vaccine antigen(s). Delivery methods or adjuvants that safely enhance vaccine immunogenicity/efficacy are desirable for vaccines that are marginally effective and for vaccines administered to low responders or immunocompromised populations. Additional goals are to reduce the number of doses required to induce effective, vaccine responses and to reduce the amount of vaccine/dose, especially when a single dose of vaccine is administered, as with annual influenza vaccines. Lastly, in pandemics, a vaccine that produces high titers after a single administration would be beneficial. Recent advances in the understanding of how innate mechanisms influence adaptive immunity have led to more rational design in the development of new vaccine adjuvants and delivery systems. Aluminum salts were the first adjuvants licensed for human vaccines in the 1920s. The licensure of non-aluminum salt adjuvants took an additional 80 years (1). One reason for this long gap is that the principles of adjuvant activity were largely unknown; thus, the development of adjuvants was empirical, Moreover, many adjuvants, including Freund's adjuvant, were reactogenic and not acceptable for licensure (2). Recent methods to improve vaccine delivery have taken several approaches, including the use of virosomes (3-5), vector-based methods (6-8), liposome-based methods (9-11), and the use of more traditional formulation with adjuvants (12-17). Each of these methods has 160 some drawbacks, in terms of reactogenicity, regulatory issues, product stability, or time required for formulation; however, each of these methods focuses on presenting the vaccine as a particulate. To enhance vaccine immunogenicity over that seen when conventional alum-based delivery methods are used, we focused on identifying ways to deliver vaccines such that vaccine antigens are released over time. This led to our development of a new vaccine delivery method we call VacSIM (vaccine self-assembling immune matrix). VacSIM is based on the unique properties of the (RADA)4 synthetic oligopeptide and other biopolymers (18-22). The (RADA)4 synthetic oligopeptide was created by Zhang (22) and commercialized by 3-D Matrix Inc. for cell scaffolding and is currently in clinical trials for wound healing (PuraStat), tissue repair (23), and dental implant scaffolding (PuraMatrix) (24). As such, it has already undergone third-party reactogenicity and toxicity testing (25). VacSIM is composed solely of the (RADA)4 synthetic oligopeptide. Thus, it is biocompatible and biodegradable. Ex vivo, a 1.0% VacSIM solution is in liquid phase, resulting in the flexibility to mix virtually any antigen, organism, and adjuvant. Upon injection into tissue, VacSIM self-assembles into hydrated nanofibers (26), forming a gel matrix depot, which entraps and concentrates vaccine components in the aqueous phase at the injection site (27). We hypothesize that the vaccine depot allows slow egress of antigen out of the gel pores, leading to persistent release of antigen, which is considered to be important in the development of robust adaptive immunity and memory responses (28, 29). We theorize that slow release of antigen and possible cellular infiltration of the VacSIM gel depot increases activation 161 and maturation of antigen-presenting cells, which then drive more robust adaptive responses. Further, it is possible that the gel depot protects vaccine components from degradation. VacSIM is different from other hydrogels, such as alginates and methacrylates, as well as microneedle and layer-by-layer technology, as all of these require polymerization ex vivo (30-35). Further, it is different from other self-assembling peptide (SAP) technologies, such as the Q11 peptide, where the antigenic motif must be directly conjugated to the SAP (36-38). In contrast, VacSIM is prepared by simply mixing SAP and antigens prior to administration. The biphasic property of VacSIM, coupled with the inert nature of the resultant vaccine gel depot, provides novel technology that can be translated for use in a multitude of vaccines. In this study, we tested the ability of VacSIM to enhance specific immune responses to the recombinant hepatitis B virus surface antigen. A.3 Materials and Methods Immunizations. Five- to seven-week-old female BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories, housed under specific-pathogen-free conditions, and allowed to acclimate for 1 week prior to manipulation. All animal work was performed in accordance with all applicable policies and approved by the University of Georgia institutional animal care and use committee. Mice were immunized subcutaneously with recombinant hepatitis B virus surface antigen (rHBsAg), subtype adw (5 \u00b5g; Fitzgerald Industries, Inc., North Acton, MA, USA), with or without CpG (50 \u00b5g; ODN 1826; InvivoGen, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), via alhydrogel (250 \u00b5g; Inject Alum; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) with or without CpG, by VacSIM with or 162 without CpG, or in Freund's (13 \u00b5l; Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) or sham immunized with VacSIM or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), at a maximum volume of 200 \u00b5l per injection site. Three or four weeks later, as indicated in the figures, mice were administered a second, identical immunization. Antibody responses. For the kinetic experiments, blood samples were collected from all immunized and control mice weekly, beginning at week 1 prior to primary immunization. rHBsAg-specific antibodies in sera were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, plates were coated with 4 \u00b5g/mL rHBsAg before singly diluted serum (1:800 for IgA and IgG2a and 1:1,200 for IgM, IgG, and IgG1) was added. Antibodies specific for rHBsAg were TMB (3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine) 1-component substrate (KPL), and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 N sulfuric acid. To evaluate the IgG1/IgG2a ratio, we multiplied the absorbance values by the dilution factors of the sera to normalize prior to dividing. For nonkinetic studies, all methods remained the same except that mice were bled prior to immunization and after each subsequent immunization. Each sample of serum was diluted serially for endpoint titer antibody analysis, and samples with undetectable antibody were assigned a value below the detection limit. ELISpots. Splenocytes were obtained 3 weeks postprime or 2 weeks postboost and then stimulated for 20 h to evaluate HBsAg-specific cell-mediated 163 responses using gamma interferon (IFN-) (ELISpot), according to the manufacturer's instructions Biosciences, San Francisco, CA, USA). Briefly, single-cell suspensions (3x105 and 1.5x105 cells per well) were cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 20 h in complete Thermo Scientific, antimycotic, acids, and -mercaptoethanol [Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA]). Cells were stimulated sulfoxide dilution in culture medium) or left unstimulated. ELISpot plates were developed with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) substrate, and spot-forming units (SFU) were counted using an immunospot analyzer (Cellular Technology Limited). The SFU value was expressed as the mean for triplicate cultures per mouse. Flow cytometry. Splenocytes collected at 3 weeks postprime and 2 weeks postboost were stimulated for 3 days with 5 \u00b5M HBs S28-39 peptide and 40 U/mL recombinant interleukin 2 (Peprotech) for assessment of molecular specificity. Briefly, HBs bound with H2-Ld DimerX reagent Pacific near-infrared 164 fixable dye; Invitrogen). cells were acquired a BD flow cytometer and analyzed with FACSDiva software (BD). Cytokine responses. Splenocytes were isolated 2 weeks postboost and tested for rHBsAg-specific cytokine production. Single-cell suspensions (1.5 x 106/mL) were cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in complete medium and stimulated with 1 \u00b5g/mL ConA or 5 \u00b5g/mL rHBsAg or left unstimulated. Levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and IFN- were quantified after 24 and 48 h culture, IL-5 after 48 h, IL-4 at 48 and 72 h, and IL-10 after 72 h, each in triplicate, by ELISA, according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD). Statistical analyses. Except for the kinetic studies whose results are shown in Fig. 1A, all data are represented by box-and-whisker plots, ranging from the minimum value to the maximum, with the mean displayed as a plus sign. Statistical analyses (one- or two-way analyses of variance [ANOVAs] with Bonferroni posttests) were performed using Prism 5 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA). Differences were considered statistically significant when P values were 0.05, as indicated by asterisks in the figures. A.4 Results Using recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (rHBsAg) as a model immunogen, we compared the VacSIM delivery to that of rHBsAg in alum or Freund's, with or without CpG as a model adjuvant for use with VacSIM and alum. A.4.1 VacSIM enhances and sustains specific humoral immunity. To assess humoral immunity, total rHBsAg-specific IgA, IgM, and IgG titers were quantified at various times postimmunization and are presented in Fig. 1A. Mice immunized with VacSIM-delivered rHBsAg had higher specific IgM levels than CFA- 165 delivered antigen (Fig. 1B, top) (P < 0.05) 21 days after a single injection. When mice were given rHBsAg administered with CpG adjuvant and delivered by VacSIM, IgM levels were higher than those in all other groups except those receiving antigen by VacSIM without CpG adjuvant. Mice immunized with rHBsAg in VacSIM developed anti-rHBsAg IgG antibody within 2 weeks postprime. At 21 days postprime (Fig. 1B, bottom), mice receiving rHBsAg in VacSIM had significantly higher levels of rHBsAg-specific IgG antibodies than mice immunized with rHBsAg alone (P < 0.0001) or rHBsAg with the standard adjuvant/delivery methods, CpG (P <0.0001), alum (P < 0.0001), or Freund's (P < 0.05). 166 When rHBsAg was delivered by CpG-adjuvanted VacSIM, the IgG levels postprime were higher than those obtained with CpG-adjuvanted alum delivery of rHBsAg (P < 0.0001) and all other groups (P < 0.0001). One week postboost (Fig. 1A), levels of antibodies were similar between groups, with the exception that the group immunized with rHBsAg in VacSIM plus CpG had higher specific IgA levels than mice immunized Figure A.1: rHBsAg-specific humoral responses are enhanced and sustained by VacSIM delivery. (A) Kinetic evaluation of rHBsAg-specific IgA, IgM, and IgG antibodies in sera of immunized BALB/c mice (n10, pooled from 2 independent experiments) were determined by ELISA. Immunization times are indicated by arrowheads. (B) rHBsAg-specific IgM (top) and IgG (bottom) levels from sera collected 21 days postimmunization. (C) The IgG1:IgG2a ratio was determined at 35 days postimmunization.

Immunization via VacSIM, compared to immunization with CpG, alum, or Freund's adjuvant, generated higher levels of specific antibody responses after only a single injection, which remained elevated postboost. To determine if immunization using VacSIM would alter rHBsAg-specific IgG isotype responses, we measured rHBsAg-specific IgG1 and IgG2a levels in mice after the prime and boost. As shown in Fig. 1C, the IgG1/IgG2a ratio elicited in vivo shows that VacSIM delivery drove a mixed Th1/Th2 response, which could be skewed further toward the Th1 type by the inclusion of CpG. As expected, mice immunized with Freund's trended toward a Th1 response, and those immunized with alum trended toward a Th2 response, which could be driven toward Th1 by addition of CpG. Overall, these data show that single immunization with VacSIM enhances specific antibody responses over that seen with single immunization in the absence of adjuvants or with conventional adjuvants such as alum or Freund's. To determine if host Th1/Th2 bias would alter the effect of VacSIM, both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice (Th1 and Th2 biased, respectively) were immunized in a prime-boost manner, 3 weeks apart, and serum was collected 3 weeks postboost. Ten-fold serial dilutions of the serum were analyzed by ELISA, as described in Materials and Methods. The reciprocal value of the last dilution showing a positive value after baseline correction was recorded as the endpoint titer. As shown in Fig. 2, rHBsAg delivered by VacSIM and CpG had high titers of all antibody types tested. Evaluating specific antibodies in serum showed high IgM, IgG, IgG1, and IgG2b endpoint titers in both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. 168 Together, these results indicate that immunization of mice with rHBsAg using VacSIM substantially improves and sustains humoral immunity while requiring fewer doses and that it can be used in a variety of host environments. A.4.2 VacSIM induces rHBsAg-specific cellular responses. rHBsAg-specific cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses were evaluated after the prime and boost by IFN- ELISpot and flow cytometry upon restimulation of Figure A.2: with VacSIM increases rHBsAg-specific antibody titers in both Th1- and Th2-biased mouse models. Comparison of rHBsAg-specific antibodies induced in mice immunized 3 weeks apart. The immunized and na\u00efve groups had 5 and 4 mice per group, respectively. There are only 3 IgM values for rHBsAg _ CpG-immunized C57BL/6 mice, as sera were limited. IgM, IgG, IgG1 and IgG2b endpoint titers were determined by indirect ELISA. Dashed lines indicate detection limits of the assay. Statistical differences (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P <0.001; ****, P < 0.0001) were determined by one-way ANOVA with the splenocytes with the dominant CD8-restricted peptide epitope (Fig. 3). All delivery methods tested resulted in specific IFN- ELISpot responses. Responses in groups administered rHBsAg via VacSIM with and without CpG were not significantly higher than those in other groups. When molecular specificity of the CTL was examined by flow cytometry, all groups showed an increase in percentage of CD8+ T cells with T cell Figure A.3: VacSIM delivery produces a mixed Th1/Th2 type cellular response. Mice were immunized 4 weeks apart, and splenocytes were prepared from mice 2 weeks postboost. For rHBsAg-immunized mice, there are 10 mice per group and data were pooled from 2 independent experiments, whereas control groups (PBS- and VacSIM-immunized) had only 5 mice per group. Splenocytes were restimulated with 5 \u00b5g/mL rHBsAg, and levels anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) (B) cytokines were measured at 24, 48 or 72 h by ELISA. Statistical differences (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001) were determined by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni posttest. 170 receptors specific for the epitope. Responses in the group immunized with rHBsAg adjuvanted with alum were significantly higher than the others, but only after the boost. We analyzed cytokine responses to rHBsAg at 2 weeks postboost. Splenocytes were stimulated with rHBsAg ex vivo for 24 to 72 h, and levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines were determined as an estimate of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance of the host. Figure 4A shows the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IFN- and TNF-, collected at 24 and 48 h after ex vivo rHBsAg restimulation of splenocytes. As expected, splenocytes VacSIM, without coadministration, had minimal IFN- secretion, whereas immunization with rHBsAg alone resulted in a dramatic increase in IFN- at 24 h. Similarly, splenocytes from mice immunized via VacSIM without CpG made amounts of IFN- and TNF- similar to those in splenocytes from mice immunized with only rHBsAg. Interestingly, splenocytes from mice immunized using Freund's adjuvant delivery of rHBsAg had the lowest levels of IFN- expression at 24 h, close to the amounts produced from splenocytes from PBS (sham)- or VacSIM only-immunized mice., Surprisingly, splenocytes from VacSIM with CpG-immunized mice had reduced IFN-_ expression at 24 h, compared to splenocytes from VacSIMrHBsAg, CpG-rHBsAg, and rHBsAg-alone groups. This result suggests that VacSIM does not cause an immediate proinflammatory 171 response in the host. All remaining comparisons were not significantly different from that obtained with antigen alone. Figure A.4: Cell-mediated immunity is induced following immunization via VacSIM. Mice were immunized 4 weeks apart and rHBsAg-specific CD8_ T cells were enumerated by IFN-_ ELISpot (A) and flow cytometry (B) of splenocytes harvested from mice (n5, except n1 for rHBsAg_Freund's, due to lost samples) at 3 weeks postprime (left) and 2 weeks postboost (right). 172 We assayed for IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 at 48 and 72 h after rHBsAg restimulation by ELISA (Fig. 4B). Cells from mice immunized with rHBsAg in VacSIM or Freund's adjuvant showed increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines at both time points, with significantly higher levels of IL-10 at 72 h than cells from rHBsAg-only mice. Immunization via alum also induced a not statistically significant increase in production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Addition of CpG to the immunogens inhibited production of Th2 and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Overall, these results suggest that VacSIM by itself is not proinflammatory and that it has significant potential to enhance immunogenicity and efficacy of various immunogens. A.5 Discussion Design and development of novel, nonreactogenic adjuvants, including synthetic LPS derivatives such as glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA), are aimed at improving vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy (14). Candidate vaccines have been defined for a number of diseases that are currently unable to drive reasonable levels of efficacy. For example, vaccines that need to drive robust CTL responses to kill intracellular pathogens induce weak Th1-biased responses (39-41). Here, we compared a new delivery method (VacSIM) to alhydrogel and CFA delivery of the rHBsAg immunogen, to determine if VacSIM delivery would drive enhanced hepatitis B-specific humoral and cellular responses. For VacSIM, alum and rHBsAg alone, we also compared immunization plus or minus CpG as an adjuvant. The results demonstrate that delivery of rHBsAg with VacSIM with or without CpGs functioned to increase specific humoral (Fig. 1 and 2) and cellular (Fig. 3 and 4) responses. Alum has been considered a reasonable, nonreactogenic 173 adjuvant for years, promoting antigen presentation in a particulate form and enhancing internalization by APCs (42). The results presented here show that for the rHBsAg, VacSIM is superior to alum, significantly enhancing the humoral response postprime, by increasing antibody titers at earlier time points and maintaining them in a sustained manner (Fig. 1). The ability of VacSIM to increase early rHBsAg-specific adaptive immune responses may be due to the slow release of antigen from the gel depot, possibly enhancing antigen uptake by APCs compared to that seen when aluminum hydroxide particles or oil-in-water emulsions are used. A major focus for enhancing immunogenicity is activation of the innate immune system by incorporating agents that ligate one or more innate immune pattern recognition receptors on antigenpresenting cells. Maturation of APCs is essential for priming antigen- specific naive T cells, influencing both the magnitude and the type of the T and B cell responses as well as the induction of memory cells (2). Furthermore, the interaction of T cells and APCs in the presence of immunomodulatory molecules (IL-4, IL-2, IFN-, IL-12, TGF-, and/or other cytokines) defines the lineage of CD4+ T cells to Th1 and Th2 subtypes. We examined the T helper biasing of the humoral response by evaluating IgG subtypes produced by the various immunization schemes. Immunization using VacSIM resulted in a mixed Th1/Th2 type antibody response, with more IgG1 than IgG2a. Adding CpG to VacSIM skewed the response toward Th1. We also tested biasing of cellular responses by analyzing antigen-specific restimulation of splenocytes after the boost. In that context, VacSIM induced a mixed Th1/Th2 type response, with high levels of all 174 cytokines. Interestingly, when CpG was added to rHBsAg and VacSIM, the levels of all cytokines were reduced. A.6 Conclusions The VacSIM delivery system tested in this study was superior to conventional delivery/adjuvants in driving early immune responses. Given the flexibility afforded by VacSIM, differential administration of adjuvants and delivery methods can be employed to produce a Th2 or mixed-type response, depending on the outcome desired for each vaccine target. In addition to our studies on VacSIM delivery of recombinant subunit vaccines, we are also evaluating VacSIM as a vaccine delivery method for parasitic and viral vaccines. In this regard, we are evaluating VacSIM for delivery of influenza vaccines, including both whole inactivated virus and subunit vaccines. A major goal of ongoing studies is to determine the mechanism(s) whereby VacSIM delivery of vaccines results in enhanced vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. Lastly, we are working to define optimal parameters for VacSIM delivery, particularly the concentration of the (RADA)4 peptide, as gel pore size will get smaller/larger with higher/lower (RADA)4 concentration, respectively, altering the rate of antigen release from the gel depot. Because VacSIM delivery leads to release of antigen from the gel depot over time, we also need to optimize the interval between prime and boost and determine whether VacSIM will function to deliver mucosal vaccines. In summary, VacSIM delivery is a flexible \"plug-and-play\" platform technology, representing a new approach for delivery of vaccines.

Statistical significance over re-stimulation with media was determined by two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni's multiple comparisons test (n=5, only 2/5 samples run from unvaccinated). 188 Figure B.10: Cytometric bead array (CBA) analysis on C57BL/6 spleens, naive or 28 days post vaccination (dpv). For immunized mice, spleens were harvested 28 days after a single vaccination (s.c.) with recombinant influenza protein (rNP) \u00b1 Alum, CpG or VacSIM. Processed splenocytes were re-stimulated with rNP (protein) for either 25 or 72-hours, at which point supernatants were collected and 2 out of 5 mice samples were analyzed by flow, using the Th1/Th2/Th17 CBA kit from BD to evaluate cytokine levels. Performed but not included in this figure are the negative (media) and positive (ConA) re-stimulation controls. 189 Table B.2: Summary of strain/virus-specific peptides.

C57BL/6 mice were utilized to establish a low-dose vaccine baseline (WIV (influenza A/PR/8/1934)) prior to incorporating additional vaccine delivery and/or adjuvanting agents. In this pilot study vaccine-induced immune responses (C-D) as well as protection following lethal challenge (A-B) was investigated. 196 Figure C.5: Investigating low-dose vaccine-induced protection. All mice (C57BL/6) were challenged with 100 LD50 of live PR8 at 5 wpv (C), 6 wpv (B) or 7 wpv (A). Immunized mice were given varying dose of PR8 (WIV) in saline (A-B) or in combination with CpG and delivered in VacSIM. 197 APPENDIX D CHAPTER 5 SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Figure D.1: Gating strategy for enumerating antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the draining and non-draining lymph nodes following immunization. An \"or\" gate was used to determine relative APC populations in the lymph nodes at 12, 24 or 36 hours post vaccination (hpv). Cell population phenotypes included B220_CD45R- and CD11b+, GR1+ and CD11b+, B220_CD45R- and F4_80+. The representative flow panels were derived from an axillary draining lymph node (d-LN) sample, harvested at 12hpv from a mouse receiving PR8+CpG delivered in saline. 198 Figure D.3: In the absence of antigen VacSIM does not induce localized cell recruitment. Pilot study (n=2) in C57BL/6 mice vaccinated (s.c.) with VacSIM \u00b1 CpG. Total cell counts determined from draining and non-draining lymph nodes at 24 and 48 hours post vaccinations (hpv). Figure D.2: Vaccine delivered in VacSIM may delay accumulation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the draining lymph nodes (d-LNs) versus the non-draining lymph nodes (nd-LNs), when compared to delivery in saline. APC+ populations were defined as live cells with any of following phenotypes; B220_CD45R- and CD11b+, GR1+ and CD11b+, B220_CD45R- and F4_80+ (Figure 5.3). The relative proportion of APC+ cells were determined by flow cytometry, using stained cells harvested from the d-LN or dn-LNs at12, 24 or 36 hpv. 199 Mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells in the non-draining/draining axillary and inguinal lymph nodes at 24 hpv (n=5 per time point). Corresponds with experiment described in Chapter 5 (subsection 5.2.3). 200 Figure D.5: Mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of cells (DCs) and T cells in the non-draining/draining axillary and inguinal lymph nodes at 48 hpv (n=5 per time point). Corresponds with experiment described in Chapter 5 (subsection 5.2.3). 201 Phenotype Comparisons Pre- and Post-Challenge in Draining Lymph Nodes of Mice Vaccinated with CpG Adjuvanted PR8 (WIV) in VacSIM. Thus far, total cells and population frequency have been evaluated in the draining and/or non-draining lymph nodes, either at 1 and 2 days post-vaccination or 2 days post-viral challenge, across vaccine groups (Figures 5.3-5.7 and Appendix Figures C.2-C.7). The following study compares the specific cell totals and population frequencies of a single vaccine group, 4 wpv and either 1-day prior to challenge or 2-days following challenge (Figure 5.7). Two cohorts of mice (n=4-5) were vaccinated (s.c.) 4 weeks earlier with PR8+CPG in VacSIM. Draining and non-draining lymph nodes from individual mice were pooled and processed and cells were stained as described in subsection 5.2.4 with one exception, which was the exclusion of cell marker NK1.1. The 6-different immune cell phenotypes (Table 5.2) were evaluated at day -1 and 2-days post challenge. Results from the population counts (Figure C.6) and relative frequencies (Figure C.7) indicated that following challenge all 6 populations maintained similar mean values, although individuals were spread across a tighter range. Small variations in specific cell frequency, although not statistically significant, were visible following challenge in all populations except in the CD3+,CD8+, CD44+ , NP-tet- and other (not CD3+/ CD4+/CD8+/NK1.1+) cell populations (Figure C.7). 202 Figure D.6: Cell counts from lymph nodes of immunized mice pre/post-challenge. Mice were vaccinated (s.c.) with whole-inactivated PR8 and CpG in VacSIM (prime-only). At 5 wpv, 1 of 2 identically treated cohorts of mice was challenged with 1,000LD50 PR8 virus (i.n.). This data was generated according with the methods detailed in chapter 5 and Figure 5.7. 203 Figure D.7: Immune cell frequencies in lymph nodes of immunized mice pre/post-challenge.
