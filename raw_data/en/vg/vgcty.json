The information in this HAN should be used to supplement other relevant guidance documents and guide the implementation of public health expectations for vaccine providers. Key messages included in the guidance: - There are two mRNA vaccines with 90-95% efficacy in preventing clinical COVID-19 currently available through an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA in the United States. - The only absolute contraindication to COVID-19 vaccination is history of an immediate allergic reaction to either COVID-19 vaccine or any of their components. - Severe adverse reactions are uncommon, but vaccine providers should be prepared for this rare event. - Vaccine providers should report all adverse events following vaccination to Vaccine Adverse Event Recording System (VAERS). - All COVID-19 mitigation measures should continue to be followed after vaccination.
