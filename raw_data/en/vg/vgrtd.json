I've had intestine problems for my whole life and I was looking for something natural that could helped me with my constipation and also to loose some weight. I needed something I could have done at my place since I was staying at my friend's house. I made a research online and I read great review about The Source Herbal detox programme so I contact them by mail. I met Ivor at his Lamai detox center and he explained to me very well how was the programme and what was inside all the herbal formulas. We decided together for the 1 week detox programme. I started with 3 days only orange juice and then followed the instruction for a light diet. With my surprise I didn't feel hungry at all and it was really easy to stick on the programme. I had regular bowel movements from day 2 and I felt so much better, less bloaded and very bright mentally. I lost 3 kgs in that week and felt great. I went back to Samui 1 week ago and I went straight to The Source to buy the Flow formula for my intestine to take for the whole month of my stay. In my life I have tried all laxatives and medicines to cure my constipation problems but nothing works better and natural than the Flow Formula. I highly recommend The Source Detox Samui and a chat with Ivor who will 100% find what is best for your health. Thank you for your detailed review. I am delighted that our colon & intestine formula worked so well for you Hi Guys, I have been to The Source Samui 3 times over the years. The master herbalist Ivor has amazing remedies for detoxing and digestive ailment. I recommend his products over all the other services on the island as they are healing and do not tax the body like colonics. I have done colonics in some nearby spots and found some good results, however the healing and restoration time was lengthy and it took too long to normalize my metabolism. I wanted to do something less taxing on the body and keeps my good bacteria and minerals in tact while removing toxins. His FLOW & formula P worked so great for me in 2017. Now I have just arrived back to Thailand after a long stay in Europe and sat though a 14 night quarantine and I am once again doing the FLOW formula. Its working well after only two days. I think I will add the formula P next week and make the month of march a good detox month to get prepared for a great summer ahead. Thanks Ivor Thank you for your kind review. I am delighted that you had such positive results with our Flow colon & intestine formula I have been looking at the Source website on and off for 2 years. Before the global pandemic I thought about saving up to go to Thailand and give the master cleanse a try. I first started doing cleanses in the early 2000s, having done the master cleanse at the world-famous retreat in Samui. I enjoyed them but found I couldn't continue in the same way once home. The Source offers much more than colon health - this is what I love about the programme, it's a complete organ restart. Physically, I have been able to listen to my body. I applied a 14-day juice cleanse, delivered locally with a mix of raw fruit and veggies. The most powerfully felt formula has been the Lung Cleanse, Flow capsules (so great to not do colonics!) and the awesome and gentle liver flush. I had completed a liver flush in May 2020, and it felt much more of a harsh experience on my body. In fact, all the way during the master cleanse I noticed I was holding my body waiting for the brutality, painful body sensations, and extreme healing crisis to start. I am a regular cleanser (not the greatest nor the most consistent), but this experience was so different to any other cleanse I have done - no extremities and extremely gentle on the body and mind. That doesn't mean it isn't deep. I have felt things I have never felt before. I added massage and the Iyashi sauna dome to help move toxins along and feel the lightest I have felt for more than 15 years. I have lots more energy and if I just remembered to take more of the heavy mental removal tea - this will I think only increase. Emotionally and spiritually it is almost indescribable the deep and unresolved emotions that have come up. The cleanse has helped me 'get to 'without effort depths of unresolved emotions that I feel have been held in my body at a cellular level. Adding meditation and visualisations has really helped me balance emotionally and this has had a direct impact on the clarity of my mind and my ability to put the past behind me, reclaim my body and look fully to the future. I am 4 years post cancer treatment and my relationship with loss (includes my actual breasts and my sense of my own mortality), a feeling of body betrayal and a tangible detachment from my physical body cleared up after my liver cleanse and the tincture supporting my kidneys. All lower back pain and the tightness in my upper back and shoulders also cleaned up after 4 or 5 years of living with overall tightness. I believe that letting go of my grief over my loss of body parts during this cleanse helped enormously. My hair and nails are also growing back. I hate to admit it but that is a big deal for me! I am currently on day 30 of this cleansing package and I have not always fully stuck to the timetable - I had two days of bowel bloating so I foolishly stopped talking the Flow capsules for 5 days - I got back on track once Ivor reminded me of their function and that it wouldn't clear up until I restarted them. He was right! I have a lot of weight I want to lose and this programme has been the kick start I needed - I lost 14 Lbs in the first 14 days - this has plateaued a bit as I have added soups and some solid food into my accompanying diet. Mentally I am committed to the new lifestyle of healthy conscious eating this has given me. I am delighted to have found a natural approach that works, is gentle and to have such immediate and knowledgeable support from Ivor is a true blessing. I couldn't be happier with the results and what the future could hold for me if I incorporate all I have learnt from the programme into 2021. It's the best thing 2020 has had to offer in what has been an extraordinary year for all of us across the globe. If you are thinking of doing the Detox-to-Go package at home while lockdown's, working-from-home and freedom of international movement remains restricted - don't wait. It's totally worth it. Do it today. Thank you for your detailed and insightful review. I am delighted that you had such transformative results with our herbal program I did the 7-day orange juice detox and liver flush last June at The Source Herbal Detox in Thailand. At first I was hesitant in doing the juice detox because I'm also taking Muay Thai classes. My previous experience with juice detox made me feel very tired and exhausted to take classes. However, Ivor's orange juice detox didn't make me feel tired at all. I had energy to take my Muay Thai classes and do a bit of work out. I've already plateaued with my weight loss for weeks but I lost further 8lbs with the 7-day detox. After the liver flush, you'll feel the difference, you'll feel cleaner and lighter. For someone who drinks a lot like me, doing the detox is my way of flushing out the toxins in my body from drinking, get rid of bloating and feel less crappy in general.. This is why I'm doing the 7-day orange juice detox again this month - JR, Philippines Thank you for your kind review and as always I am delighted that you had such good results with the herbal detox program. I hope you have the same great experience doing it again now This was my first time doing an all-natural herbal detox. I choose to do the 14-day detox program. Being a former strength athlete and coming from a variety of sport backgrounds, I've taken many supplements, performance enhancements and pills to improve my sport and wellbeing but never considered a herbal detox. After sitting down with Ivor and discussing my training schedule and eating habits he suggested the 14-day detox to be the most suitable for me. I did not do the orange juice fast with this detox as I was not interested in the weight loss aspect but more interested in the internal health benefits for my kidneys, liver etc after many years of eating huge amounts of meat and large portions of food. I noticed the results within 2-3 days, immediately my energy felt higher throughout the day, my sleep was deeper, my workouts were more productive and my overall wellbeing seemed improved. Ivor was always there when I needed a question answered regarding the program. I look forward to doing this program again in the near future and highly recommend anyone to give it a go! Thank you for your kind review. I am delighted that the detox program was such a positive experience for you. This was my first fast & I settled on The Source because they were highly regarded and intuitively made sense when I read about them. Ivor at the Source is a wonderful man, and patiently guided me through the options, the process and how the herbs I'd be taking worked. He listened attentively to understand my aims with the detox; fixing chronic GERD, regularly broken sleep for years, coffee & sugar addictions, and most worryingly chest pains. A 14-day detox-to-go OJ fast with 2 liver flushes, ended up at 24 days and 3 liver flushes in total. Ivor explained, I'd have lots of energy for work & family life, despite only drinking a glass or two of orange juice every two hours, that was certainly the case! The herbs and tinctures are pleasant enough. A key attraction to Ivor's revolutionary approach is the powerful herbs remove the need for colonics. So much so, I lost 11 kilos on the programme. I slept better, 4 or 5 days into the detox I was sleeping through the night after years of waking up in discomfort at 2am. My acid reflux has completely stopped. My mind is clearer & following Ivor's eating protocol, the good habits are sticking. I met Ivor a number of times during the detox and was amazed at his detailed knowledge of herbs and health. My family are amazed at the changes in my health & so am I! Fasting with herbs is now an essential part of life. Anyone looking for a reset; visit The Source Samui and Ivor, it'll be one of the best decisions you ever make! Thanks Ivor! Thank you for your kind review. I am delighted that you had such wonderful improvement with your health by doing the program. "}
