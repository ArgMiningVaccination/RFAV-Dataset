There are several [ongoing Canadian clinical trials for drug interventions](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/list-authorized-trials.html#shr-pg0) to address COVID-19, including vaccine candidates, candidates for symptom management in hospitalized patients, and prophylactic agents to prevent infection. Some of these drugs, namely hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir, have been common talking-points by scientifically illiterate political figures as \"miracle cures\" since North American COVID-19 cases were first identified in early 2020. The use of other unapproved treatments has also been advocated for by other public figures, many of which do not have the knowledge or background sufficient to substantiate their claims. The charts below present several purported pharmaceutical interventions to treat or prevent COVID-19, including current research on their efficacy and whether their effects could mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 Vaccines Currently, there are no COVID-19 vaccines approved for public use by any regulatory bodies worldwide. Since the identification of COVID-19, several pharmaceutical companies have been focused on developing an effective vaccine. Some of the more notable developments include: - Pfizer and BioNTech: These pharmaceutical companies recently completed a human clinical trial with their vaccine candidate, which tested more than 40, 000 participants. The vaccine candidate had a 95% effectiveness rate in protecting against COVID-19, and no serious side effects were noted. - AstraZeneca: A human clinical trial is currently underway to test their novel COVID-19 vaccine candidate, however no data has been released regarding its effectiveness and/or side effects. - Moderna: The COVID-19 vaccine candidate produced by this company, mRNA 1273, demonstrated a 94.5% efficacy rate in the first interim data analysis of the phase III clinical trial. This human trial involves over 30,000 participants, however the interim analysis concerned only 95 COVID-19-positive participants: 90 exposed to a placebo, and 5 exposed to mRNA 1273. This is a small population size and the efficacy - and lack of serious adverse side effects - may not represent all individuals who could receive the vaccine. Despite the optimistic test results reported by pharmaceutical companies, it is unlikely that any COVID-19 vaccine(s) will be approved for use before the end of 2020. One barrier to approval are the stringent regulations surrounding vaccine formulation, testing, dosage, and distribution. There are also several logistical challenges that will to be overcome on the federal, provincial, and municipal levels for Canadians to receive vaccinations, including obtaining enough vaccine, maintaining proper storage facilities, and managing information on who is vaccinated and who is not to ensure that multiple doses of vaccine are received (if required).
