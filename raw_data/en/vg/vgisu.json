JARED POLIS, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Colorado; JILL HUNSAKER RYAN, in her official capacity as Executive Director of the Colorado of Public Health and Environment, Defendants - Appellees. N o. 20- 1280 (D.C. No. 1 Before LUCERO, MORITZ, and CARSON , Circuit Judges. _________________________________ High Plains Harvest Church and Mark Hotaling (Plaintiffs) seek injunctive relief pending the court's resolution of their interlocutory appeal of the district court's denial of their motion for a preliminary injunction. We deny Plaintiffs' motion because t hey have not made the required strong showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their appeal. Plaintiffs are a church and its minister. Defendants are Colorado's Governor and the Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (\"CDPHE\"), both sued in their official capacities. In their amended complaint, Plaintiffs FILED United States Court of Appeals Tenth Circuit November 12, 2020 C hristopher M. Wolpert Clerk of 11/12/2020 Page: 1 EXHIBIT A2 challenge as unconstitutional certain Executive and Public Health Orders (\"Orders\") issued by Defendants related to the COVID -19 pandemic. They as sert that a 50 -person limitation on indoor worship services violates their free -exercise and free -speech rights under the First Amendment because Defendants have encouraged protests against police violence (the Protests), have exempted the Protests from th e Orders' restrictions on outdoor gatherings, and have favored the Protests' message over Plaintiffs' religious speech. The district court denied Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, and Plaintiffs have filed an interlocutory appeal of that rul ing. In their motion for an injunction pending appeal, Plaintiffs ask this court to enjoin Defendants from enforcing the Orders to the extent they prevent Plaintiffs from conducting indoor worship services with up to 150 persons following social distancin g guidelines. Tenth Circuit Rule 8.1 requires Plaintiffs to address the following factors: (1) \"the likelihood of success on appeal\"; (2) \"the threat of irreparable harm if the . . . injunction is not granted\"; (3) \"the absence of harm to opposing parties if the . . . injunction is granted\"; and (4) \"any risk of harm to the public interest.\" In ruling on a request for an injunction pending appeal this court makes the same inquiry as it would when reviewing a district court's grant or denial of a prelimina ry injunction. Thus, [the court] must consider, based on a preliminary record, whether the district court abused its discretion and whether the movant has demonstrated a clear and unequivocal right to relief. Homans v. City of Albuquerque , 264 F.3d 1240, 1243 (10th Cir. Document: 010110436748 Date Filed: 11/12/2020 Page: 2 3 Because Plaintiffs seek a type of injunction that is disfavored, we apply a heightened standard to their request for an injunction pending appeal. See Schrier v. Univ. of Colo., 427 F.3d 1253, 1259 (10th Cir. 2005). \"[A] party seeking such an injunction must make a strong showing both with regard to the likelihood of success on the merits and with regard to the balance of harms.\" Id. at 1261 (internal quotation marks omitted). In deciding Plaintiffs' appeal, this court will review the district court's denial of their motion for a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion. See id. at 1258. \"The standard for abuse of discretion is hi gh. The [movant] must show that the district court committed an error of law . . . or committed clear error in its factual findings.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs contend that , because they assert claims under the First Amendment, the district court's findings of constitutional facts are subject to de novo review. See United States v. Friday , 525 F.3d 938, 950 (10th Cir. 2008). To decide whether Plaintiffs have made a strong showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their appeal, we apply the traditional constitutional tiered analysis to their First Amendment claims . In doing so, we are mindful that state officials may fight a global pandemic through emergency health orders. See Jacobson v. Massachusetts , 197 U.S. 1 1, 30 -31 (1905); see also S. Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom , 140 S. Ct. 1613 (2020) (Roberts, C.J., concurring). In support of their free -exercise claim, Plaintiffs contend that the Orders are subject to strict scrutiny under the reasoning in Chur ch of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah , 508 U.S. 520, 531- 32 (1993) . They maintain that the Orders are Appellate Case: 20-1280 Document: 010110436748 Date Filed: 11/12/2020 Page: 3 4 neutral and generally applicable because Defendants have created a de facto exemption from the Orders for the Protests that amounts to a \"system\" of \"individualized exemptions .\" Id. at 537. In support of their free -speech claim, Plaintiffs conten d that the Orders are subject to strict scrutiny under the reasoning in Reed v. Town of Gilbert , 576 U.S. 155, 163 (2015). Th ey maintain that the Orders are not content -neutral because Defendants have created a de facto content -based exemption from the Orders for the Protests. We conclude that, even under de novo review of constitutional facts, P laintiffs have not shown error in the district court's factual finding that D efendants did not create a de facto exemption from the Orders for the P rotests . Plaintiffs' contention rests on public comments by Governor Polis and a guidance document issued by CDPHE regarding the Protests . But the Governor's statements did not nullify the otherwise neutral and generally applicable Orders. See Ill. Republican Party v. Pritzker , 973 F.3d 760, 770 (7th Cir. 2020) (holding that a governor's \"press release expressing sympathy for the protests[,] . . . untethered to any legislative or executive rule -making process, cannot change the law\"). Plaintiffs point to no evidence of an affirmative state action creating such an exemption from the Orders applicable to the Protests . Finally, we construe the Supreme Court's denial of an injunction pending appeal in Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley v. Sisolak , 140 S. Ct. 2603 (2020) (Kagan, J.), as implicitly rejecting the argument that the Nevada G overnor's encouragement of protests during the pandemic resulted in a de facto exemption from public health orders. Appellate Case: 20-1280 Document: 010110436748 Date Filed: 11/12/2020 Page: 4 5 Plaintiffs therefore fail to show that the Orders are subject to strict scrutiny , and they do not alternatively argue that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their First Amendment claims if the Orders are subject to any lesser level of scrutiny. Consequently, because Plaintiffs have not made the required strong showing of a likelihood of success on the merits of their appeal , we deny their motion for an injunction pending appeal.1 Entered for the Court CHRISTOPHER M. WOLPERT, Clerk 1 The United States District Court for the District of Colorado recently issued a stay precluding enforcement of the Governor's public health order against the Denver Bible Church. Denver Bible Church v. Azar , No. 20CV02362, 2020 WL 6128994 (D. Colo. Oct. 1 5, 2020) . Another panel of this Court is considering t he district court's orders in that case . We express no opinion on the merits of the district court's orders in that case other than to note that the arguments presented in Denver Bible Church differ substantially from those advanced in this case. Appellate Case: 20-1280 Document: 010110436748 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 41 Filed 06/16/20 USDC Colorado Page 1 of 4 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO Judge Raymond P. Moore Civil Action No. 1 :20-cv-01480-RM-MEH HIGH PLAINS HARVEST ClillRCH, and MARK HOTALING, Plaintiffs, v. JARED POLIS, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Colorado, and JILL HUNSAKER RY AN, in her official capacity as Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Defendants. ORDER This matter is before the Court on Plaintiffs' Renewed Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and for Preliminary Injunction. (ECF No. 35.) At the Court's direction, Defendants have filed a response to the motion. (ECF No. 39.) The Court denies the request for a temporary restraining order and sets a briefing schedule on the request for a preliminary injunction. I. LEGAL STANDARDS To obtain a temporary restraining order or injunctive relief in any other form, the plaintiff must establish \"(1) a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits; (2) irreparable harm unless the injunction is issued; (3) that the threatened injury outweighs the harm that the preliminary injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) that the injunction, if issued, will not adversely affect the public interest.\" Dine Citizens Against Ruining Our Environment v. Jewell, 839 F.3d 1276, 1281 (10th Cir. 2016) (quotation omitted). Because a preliminary EXHIBIT DCase 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 41 Filed 06/16/20 USDC Colorado Page 2 of 4 injunction is an extraordinary remedy, the plaintiff's right to relief must be clear and unequivocal. Schrier v. Univ. of Colo., 427 F.3d 1253, 1258 (10th Cir. 2005). The fundamental purpose of preliminary injunctive relief is to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held. Id. Further, this circuit has identified three types of injunctions that are specifically disfavored: \"(1) preliminary injunctions that alter the status quo; (2) mandatory preliminary injunctions; and (3) preliminary injunctions that afford the movant all the relief that it could recover at the conclusion of a full trial on the merits.\" Id. at 1258-59 (quotation omitted). To get a disfavored injunction, the moving party faces and even heavier burden of showing that the first and third factors above tilt in its favor. Free the Nipple-Fort Collins v. City of Fort Collins, 916 F.3d 792, 797 (10th Cir. 2019). II. BACKGROUND Plaintiffs alleged in their original complaint that government orders aimed at addressing the COVID-19 pandemic in place at that time 1 violated their First Amendment rights. But after the United States Supreme Court denied an application for preliminary injunctive relief in a case substantially similar to theirs, see S. Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, No. 19A1044, 2020 WL 2813056 (2020), Plaintiffs withdrew their original motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. In the days that followed, thousands of people began to gather in Denver and other cities in Colorado to protest police violence. Plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint, alleging that Defendants \"permitted and encouraged these protest gatherings while continuing to impose draconian restrictions on religious gatherings.\" (ECF No. 34 at 'If 8.) Plaintiffs seek to recommence in-person church services in numbers greater than fifty. (ECF No. 34 at 'If 42.) They have now filed a renewed motion for a temporary restraining order and a 1 Then, Plaintiffs were seeking to hold in-person religious services for up to fifty people, which is now permissible under 1he public heal1h orders currently in place. 2 Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 41 Filed 06/16/20 USDC Colorado Page 3 of 4 preliminary injunction, again seeking to enjoin Defendants from enforcing public health orders that limit their in-person church services. III. ANALYSIS Plaintiffs seek a disfavored injunction that would grant them essentially all the relief they request in their amended complaint, and therefore they have a high burden to meet. On the current record and in light of the Supreme Court's recent ruling in South Bay United Pentecostal Church, the Court finds Plaintiffs have not made a strong showing of a reasonable likelihood of success in this matter. Citing Chief Justice Roberts' concurrence in South Bay United Pentecostal Church, Plaintiffs argue that ''the key to the Court's decision, at least according to the Chief Justice, was that California was treating religious gatherings in a way that was comparable to 'comparable secular gatherings,' such as concerts movies, spectator sports, etc.\" (ECF No. 35 at 2.) But Plaintiffs' reliance on that concurrence is misplaced here. First, there is no evidence in the record that would support a finding that the outdoor protests are \"comparable secular gatherings\" to the indoor, in-person church services Plaintiffs seek to provide. Plaintiffs' conclusory assertion that \"from an epidemiological perspective [the protests] were far more intense than any religious service\" (id at 2-3) is insufficient to establish a likelihood of success on the merits. And the notion that the non-enforcement of social distancing during a protest means that the State is engaged in a variety of constitutional misconduct directed at religious institutions is far from apparent. Indeed, as noted in the Chief Justice's concurrence, \"[t]he precise question of when restrictions on particular social activities should be lifted during the pandemic is a dynamic and fact-intensive matter subject to reasonable disagreement,\" and \"[t]he notion that it is 'indisputably clear' that the Government's limitations are unconstitutional seems quite 3 Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 41 Filed 06/16/20 USDC Colorado Page 4 of 4 improbable.\" S. Bay United Perllecostal Church, 2020 WL 2813056, at t-2 (Roberts, C.J., concurring). Nor have Plaintiffs adduced evidence that Defendants permitted or encouraged the protests. Plaintiffs contend that they are ''prepared to submit substantial additional evidence\" on this issue (ECF No. 40 at 1), and the Court will provide an opportunity for them to do so, albeit not in a TRO hearing as Plaintiffs request. On the current record, however, the assertion that Defendants are treating Plaintiffs differently from comparable secular gatherings is \"improbable.\" For present purposes, Plaintiffs have failed to establish a clear and unequivocal right to the extraordinary relief they seek. IV. CONCLUSION Accordingly, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order and sets forth the following briefing schedule on their request for a pre1iminary injunction: (1) Plaintiffs shall file any supplementary materials regarding the nature of the protests and Defendants' alleged encouragement of those protests on or before June 30, 2020; (2) Defendants shall file a response within 21 days of such filing, or by July 21, 2020, whichever occurs sooner; and (3) Plaintiffs shall file a reply within 1 days of Defendants' response. The Court DENIES Plaintiffs' motion for a hearing (ECF No. 40). DATED this 16th day of June, 2020. BY TIIE COURT: United States District Judge 4 1 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO Civil Action No. 20-cv-1480 -RM-MEH HIGH PLAINS HARVEST CHURCH; and MARK HOTALING, Plaintiff s, v. JARED POLIS, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Colorado; and JILL HUNSAKER RYAN, in her official capacity as Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment , Defendants. ____________________________________________________________________________ VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT ____________________________________________________________________________ Plaintiff s submit the following Verified First Amended Complaint: I. AUTHORITY FOR AMENDMENT 1. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(a) provides that a party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course within 21 days after serving it. Service in this matter was accomplished on May 27, 2020 . This First Amended Complaint is filed within 21 days of May 27, 2020. II.SOUTH BAY UNITED PENTECOSTAL CHURCH V. NEWSOM 2. Plaintiffs filed their original Complaint on May 25, 2020. In that Complaint Plaintiffs alleged that the State had violated their rights under the First Amendment because the government orders in place at the time burden ed Plaintiffs' sincerely held religious beliefs while at the same time setting up a pervasive system of individualized exemptions that Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34 Filed 06/10/20 Page 1 of 18 355EXHIBIT E2 permitted other similarly situated businesses or non -religious entities (such as grocery stores; produce stands; operations, hardware stores; laundromats; banks; law offices; and accounting offices ) to continue operations while prohibiting faith -based gatherings, such as Plaintiffs' church and religious gatherings, from operating . 3. Four days later, on May 29, 2020, the United States Supreme Court entered an order in South Bay United Pentecostal Church v Newsom , WL 2813056 (U.S. 2020) , in which the Court denied an application for preliminary injunctive relief in a California case in which the plaintiffs made claims similar to the claims Plaintiffs made in their May 25 Complaint. 4. Accordingly, on May 30, 2020 Plaintiffs w ithdrew their then pending motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. 5. In his concurrence in that order Chief Justice Roberts wrote that denial of preliminary injunctive relief was appropriate because [a]lthough Califo rnia's guidelines place restrictions on places of worship, those restrictions appear consistent with the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Similar or more severe restrictions apply to comparable secular gatherings, including lectures, concerts, movie showings, spectator sports, and theatrical performances, where large groups of people gather in close proximity for extended periods of time. Id. 6. Thus, the key to the Court's decision, at least according to the Chief Justice, was that California was treating religious gatherings in a way that was comparable to \"comparable secular gatherings,\" such as lectures concerts, movies, sp ectator sports, etc. 7. After Plaintiffs withdrew their motion for preliminary relief the factual landscape shi fted dramatically. In the days that followed thousands of protesters gathered in Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34 Filed 06/10/20 Page 2 of 18 3563 Denver and other cities in Colorado . These thousa nds of protesters marched and stood should er-to-shoulder for hours on end , all the while ignoring any semblance of social distancing . Some of these protests occurred literally outside of Governor Polis's office at the Colorado Capitol Building. Far from prohibiting these gatherings - which from an epidemiological perspective were far more intense than any religious service - Governor Polis and Director Ryan permitted and even encouraged the gatherings. 8. Any argument that the State may have ha d that it was treating religious gatherings in a way that was comparable to \"comparable secular gatherings \" evaporated when Defendants permitted and encouraged these protest gatherings while continuing to impose draconian restrictions on religious gatherin gs. 9. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are filing this First Amended Complaint and renewing their request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34 Filed 06/10/20 Page 3 of 18 3574 III. INTRODUCTION 10. This is an image from a recent protest literally outside of Governor Polis's office at the Colorado State Capitol Building: 11. Today in Colorado it is perfectly legal for thousands of protesters to march and stand shoulder -to-shoulder for hours on end , all the while ignoring any se mblance of social distancing , assuming , apparently, the message of the protest is one approved by Governor Polis and Director Ryan . But if more than 50 people meet to worship God in a small rural church, they do so at the risk of being fined and imprisoned. Plaintiffs call upon the Court to come to their aid, vindicate their religious liberties , free speech rights and associational rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and r emedy the surreal state of affairs in which they inexplicabl y find themselves. Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34 Filed 06/10/20 Page 4 of 18 3585 IV. PARTIES 12. High Plains Harvest Church (\"HPHC\" or the \"Church\" ) is a small church located at 108 1st Street, Ault, Colorado 80610. HPHC is a religious nonpro fit organization. HPHC brings this action on its member's behalf. HPHC has associational standing because (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to its purpose; and (c) n either the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit. Each of HPHC's members would have standing to assert claims for breach of their constitutional rights as set forth herein. The interest HPHC seeks to protect, especially the interest in the free exercise of religion, is germane to HPHC's purpose. The claims asserted h erein do not require the participation of individual members. HPHC seeks a declaration, injunction, and other prospective relief, and it can reasonably be supposed that the remedies, if granted, will inure to the benefit of those members of HPHC actually injured. 13. Plaintiff Mark Hotaling (\"Hotaling\") is a resident of Colorado. 14. Defendant Jared Polis (\" Governor Polis\") is the Governor of Colorado. Governor Polis is sued in his official capacity only. All of Governor Polis 's actions described herein were taken under color of law. 15. Defendant Jill Hunsaker Ryan (\" Director Ryan\") is the Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Director Ryan is sued in her official capacity only. All of Director Ryan 's actions described herein were taken under color of law. V. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 16. This action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and is brought pursuant to Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34 Filed 06/10/20 Page 5 of 18 3596 17. Jurisdiction is conferred on this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. 18. The Court may declare the legal rights and obligations of the parties in this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 because the action presents an actual controversy within the Court's jurisdiction. 19. Jurisdiction supporting Plaintiff s' claim fo r attorney's fees and costs is conferred by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. 20. Venue is proper in the District of Colorado pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b). All of the events alleged herein occurred within the State of Colorado (the \"State\") , and all of the parties were residents of the State at the time of the events giving rise to this litigation. VI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND 21. HPHC's vision is to be a Christ -centered, rural, regional church that makes a genuine difference in the hearts of people throughout northern Colorado. The Church seeks to create an environment where each person is : cultivating daily, life -changing intimacy with the Savior ; experiencing biblical community with others in the body of Christ ; using their time, talents, and treasures to further God's kingdom ; engaging in intentional discipleship and ministry ; and bringing the Gospel into their sphere of influence wit h word and action. 22. Hotaling is a former Navy SEAL and a service -disabled veteran. After returning home from the Navy, Hotaling followed the Lord's call to serve Him full -time. Hotaling is a devout Christian and a pastor in the Church. Unti l the recent COVID -19 outbreak, Hotaling frequently attended and/or led services a t the Church. He typically attended and/or led three to Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34 Filed 06/10/20 Page 6 of 18 3607 four services and/or other religious gatherings per week. Hotaling has a sincerely held religious belief that in-person attendance at church is central to his faith. 23. In response to the presence of COVID -19 in Colorado, o n June 1 , 2020, Governor Polis issued his so -called \" Safer at Home and in the Vast, Great Outdoors \" order, Executive Order , D 2020 091 (the \"Executive Order\"). A copy of the Executive Order is attached as Exhibit A. 24. In the Executive Order Governor Polis directed Director Ryan to issue a public health order to: \" Prohibit public gatherings of groups of ten (10) per sons in both public and private commercial spaces unless gatherings of groups greater than ten (10) persons are expressly authorized by this Executive Order or an associated PHO. \" 25. In accordance with the Executive Order, on June 5, 2020 Direct or Ryan issued her Sixth Amended Public Health Order 20 -28 Safer at Home and in the Vast, Great Outdoors (the \"PHO\"). A copy of the PHO is attached as Exhibit B. 26. The PHO prohibits all public and private gatherings greater than ten individuals except for \"Necessary Activities.\" PHO I. C. There is no numerical limit on the number of persons who may be present when \"Necessary Activities\" are conducted . Religious wo rship services are not considered Necessary Activities under the PHO. 27. \"Necessary Activities\" do include activities associated with \"Critical Businesses .\" PHO III. A. 4. \"Critical Businesses\" are listed in Appendix F to the PHO . 28. The PHO permits \" houses of worship \" to open so long as th e number of worshipers in attendance does not 50% of the posted occupancy limit or 50 people, whichever is lower . Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34 Filed 06/10/20 Page 7 of 18 3618 29. The PHO states that it \" will be enforced by all appropriate legal means ,\" and that \"[f]ailure to comply with this order could result in penalties, including jail time, and fines . . .\" PHO, VI. A previous version of the PHO invoked the authority of C.R.S. \u00a7 25-1-114 to impose criminal penalties. 30. Director Ryan has also issued \"Guidance for Places of Worship\" to implement the Executive Order (the \"Guidance\"). A copy of the Guidance is attached as Exhibit C. 31. The Executiv e Order, the PHO and the Guidance shall be referred to herein collectively as the \"Orders.\" 32. Beginning after May 25, 2020 and continuing through the present time, thousands of protesters have gathered in Denver, including prominent protests in front of the Colorado State Capitol Building. 33. The protestors have stood literally shoulder -to-shoulder while they shouted in unison. 34. The protestors have ignored even a pretense of social distancing. 35. One need not be a n epidemiologist to know that these gatherings were epidemiologically far more intense than any religious service . This conclusion is common sense. 36. Governor Polis has not only permitted these protests to occur , he has actively encouraged the m. 37. Director Ryan has not only permitted these protests to occur, she has actively encouraged them. 38. At the same time they are permitting and encouraging these gatherings of thousands, Defendants continue to limit gatherings for worship services to 50 people. Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34 Filed 06/10/20 Page 8 of 18 3629 39. The Bible commands Christians not to forsake the gathering together of believers. Hebrews 10:24 -25. In-person corporate worship is a fundamental ten et of Christian practice and has been for nearly 2,000 y ears. 40. HPHC and its members , including Hotaling, have a sincerely held religious belief that the physical corporate gathering of believers is a central element of religious worship commanded by the Lord. 41. It is a substantial bur den on the religious exercise of HPHC and its members , including Hotaling, if they cannot meet for in -person corporate worship as a body of believers in numbers greater than 50 . 42. HPHC in furtherance of the sincerely held religious beliefs of its members, desires to recommence in-person worship services in numbers greater than 50. The capacity of the church's sanctuary is approximately 150. 43. In all services, HPHC and Hotaling will following CDC guidelines for faith communities . See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Interim Guidance for Communities of Faith , including : Encourag ing staff and congregants to maintain good hand hygiene Encourag ing use of cloth face coverings among staff and congregant s Clean ing and disinfect ing frequently touched surfaces at least daily and shared objects in between uses Promot ing social distancing at services and other gatherings, ensuring that clergy, staff, choir, volunteers and attendees at the services follow social distancing throughout services Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34 Filed 06/10/20 Page 9 of 18 36310 44. Hotaling and HPHC also intend to follow the social distancing standards set forth in Director Ryan's Guidance. 45. To the best of Hotaling's knowledge, no m ember of HPHC has COVID -19. 46. The Church and Hotaling reasonably fear prosecution, including fines, arrest, and jail, if they proceed with this plan to meet for in -person corporate worship in a group of more than ten worshipers . 47. Governor Polis and Director Ryan have actively enforced the Orders and declared their inte ntion to continue to do so. VII. FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 - Violation of First Amendment Freedom of Religion 48. Plaintiff s hereby incorporate all other paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. 49. The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitut ion, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the State from abridging Plaintiffs' rights to free exercise of religion. 50. Plaintiffs have sincerely held religious beliefs that the Bible is the infallible, inerrant word of the Lord Jesus Christ and they are to follow its teachings. 51. Plaintiffs have sincerely held religious beliefs, rooted in Scripture's commands (e.g., Hebrews 10:25), that followers of Jesus Christ are not to forsake the assembling of themselves together, and that they are to do so even more in times of peril and crisis. Indeed, the entire purpose of the Church (in Greek \" ekklesia ,\" meaning \"assembly\") is to assemble together Christians to worship Almighty God. 52. The Orders, a s applied, impermissibly burden Plaintiffs' sincerely held religious beliefs, compel Plaintiffs to either change those beliefs or to act in contradiction to them, and Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34 Filed 06/10/20 Page 10 of 18 36411 force Plaintiffs to choose between the teachings and requirements of their sincerely held religious beliefs in the commands of scripture and the State 's regulations . 53. The Orders, as applied, are neither neutral nor generally applicable, but rather discriminate against the religious beliefs, speech, assembly, and viewpoint of Plain tiffs. 54. The State lacks a compelling, legitimate, or rational interest in the Orders' application of different standards for churches and faith -based gatherings than those applicable to similar or even more intensive secular gatherings such as the protests that have been permitted and encouraged by Defendants. 55. Even if the Orders' restriction on faith -based gatherings were supported by a compelling interest, they are not the least restrictive means to accomplish the government's purported interest. 56. The Orders, as applied, fail to accommodate Plaintiffs' sincerely held religious beliefs. 57. The Orders, as applied, burden Plaintiffs' sincerely held religious beliefs while at the same time setting up a pervasiv e system of individualized exemptions that permit other similarly situated businesses or non -religious entities to continue operations while prohibiting faith-based gatherings, such as Plaintiffs' church and religious gatherings, from operating. 58. The Orders, as applied, burden Plaintiffs' sincerely held religious beliefs while at the State has permitted and encouraged similar or even more intensive secular gatherings of thousands while prohibiting faith -based gatherings, such as Plaintiffs' church and religious gatherings, from operating in numbers greater than 50. 59. The Orders, as applied, have caused, are causing, and will continue to cause Plaintiffs immediate and irreparable harm, and actual and undue hardship.

Plaintiffs respectfully pray for the relief against the State as hereinafter set forth in their prayer for relief. VIII. SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 - Violation of First Amendment Free Speech Rights 62. Plaintiffs hereby incorporate all other paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. 63. The Orders violate Plaintiffs' freedom of speech by prohibiting them from engaging in religious speech through their church services which occur exclusively on private property. 64. The Orders give government officials unbridled discretion with respect to enforcem ent of the Orders and the imposition of any penalty, making the Orders susceptible to both content - and viewpoint -based discrimination. 65. The government has abused its discretion by permitting secular gatherings of thousands to engage in offic ially approved speech while at the same time prohibiting religious gatherings greater than 50 peopl e to engage in n on-officially approved speech. 66. The State's discrimination against Plaintiffs' religious speech does not serve any legitimate, rational, substantial, or compelling governmental interest. 67. The State has alternative, less restrictive means to achieve any interest that it might have. 68. The Orders violate the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied. Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34 Filed 06/10/20 Page 12 of 18 36613 69.

Plaintiffs respectfully pray for the relief against the State as hereinafter set forth in their prayer for relief. IX. THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 - Violation of First Amendment Freedom of Association /Assembly 71. Plaintiffs hereby incorporate all other paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. 72. The First Amendment prohibits the State from violating Plaintiffs' right to peaceably assemble. 73. The Orders, as applied, violates Plaintiffs' right to peaceably assemble because the ban on in -person services greater than 50 (while allowing more intense secular gatherings in the thousands ) does not serve any legitimate, rational, substantial, or compelling governmental interest . 74. In addition, the State has alternative, less restrictive means to achieve any interest that it might have. 75. The Orders violate the right to assemble under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied. 76. In the absence of declaratory and injunctive relief, Plaintiffs will be irreparably harmed. 77. Plaintiffs respectfully pray for the relief against the State as hereinafter set forth in their prayer for relief. Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34 Filed 06/10/20 Page 13 of 18 36714 X. FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 - Violation of Right to Equal Protection Under the Fourteenth Amendment 78. Plaintiffs hereby incorporate all other paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. 79. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees Plaintiffs the right to equal protection under the law. 80. The Orders, as applied, are an unconstitutional abridgment of Plaintiffs' right to equal protection because in the Orders the State treats Plaintiffs differently from other si milarly situated secular gatherings on the basis of the exercise of their funda mental rights . 81. The Orders, as applied, impermissibly discriminate between non -religious gatherings and religious or faith -based gatherings. 82. The State lacks a compelling, legitimate, or rational interest in the Orders' application of different standards for churches and faith -based gatherings than those applicable to non-religious gatherings . 83. The Orders, as applied, are not the least restr ictive means to accomplish any permissible government purpose sought to be served. 84. The Orders, as applied, do not have a rational basis. 85. The Orders, as applied, are irrational and unjustifiable and impose irrational and unjustifiable restrictions on Plaintiffs' religious or faith - based gatherings. 86. The Orders, as applied, have caused, are causing, and will continue to cause Plaintiffs immediate and irreparable harm, and actual and undue hardship. 87. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to correct the continuing deprivation of their most cherished liberties. Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34 Filed 06/10/20 Page 14 of 18 36815 88.

Arrington Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34 Filed 06/10/20 Page 18 of 18 372 D 2020 091 EXECUTIVE ORDER Safer at Home and in the Vast, Great Outdoors Pursuant to the authority vested in the Governor of the State of Colorado and, in particular, pursuant to Article IV, Section 2 of the Colorado Constitution and the relevant portions of the Colorado Disaster Emergency Act, C.R.S. \u00a7 24 -33.5-701, et seq. , I, Jared Polis, Governor of the State of Colorado, hereby issue this Executive Order due to the presence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) in Colorado. I. Background and Purpose On March 5, 2020, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Enviro nment's (CDPHE) public health laboratory confirmed the first presumptive positive COVID -19 test result in Colorado. Since then, the number of confirmed cases has continued to climb, and there is community spread throughout the State. I verbally declared a disaster emergency on March 10, 2020, and on March 11, 2020, I issued the corresponding Executive Order D 2020 003, as amended by Executive Orders D 2020 018, D 2020 032, D 2020 058, and D 2020 076. On March 25, 2020, I requested that the President of the United States declare a Major Disaster for the State of Colorado, pursuant to the Stafford Act. The President approved that request on March 28, 2020. My administration, along with other State, local, and federal authorities, has taken a wide array of acti ons to mitigate the effects of the pandemic, prevent further spread, and protect against overwhelming our health care resources. The virus that causes COVID -19 is spread primarily by close contact between people and through respiratory droplets when an inf ected person coughs or sneezes. It can also be spread through contact with contaminated surfaces. Public health experts recommend we practice Social Distancing, or maintaining a physical distance of six (6) feet or more from other people, as a way to slow the spread of COVID -19. This is especially important for Vulnerable Individuals as ninety percent (90%) of Colorado fatalities are individuals older than sixty (60). Evidence shows that Social Distancing and the Stay at Home Executive Order D 2020 017, as amended, have helped to slow the rate of infection and ensured that Coloradans who needed it had access to healthcare resources. While we have seen indications that our efforts to \"flatten the curve\" are working, increased transmission of the virus, and t he resulting strains on our healthcare resources, continue to threaten Coloradans' way of life and livelihoods. As we take steps to return Coloradans to work, we must continue to practice Social Distancing from others at a high level Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34-1 Filed 06/10/20 Page 1 of 6 373Executive Order D 2020 091 June 1, 2020 Page 2 of 6 and implement other me asures, such as limiting our social interactions, extra precautions for Vulnerable Individuals, and wearing non -medical masks while in public to facilitate reopening the economy while we protect public health. As we move forward, the State continues to mon itor the spread of COVID -19, increase our testing and tracing capabilities, and consider additional precautions as we learn more about the novel coronavirus and its effects on human health. Colorado has millions of acres of accessible federal land, munici pal parks, State parks, State and county open space, and other accessible areas that allow for stronger Social Distancing in our great outdoor areas. Coloradans should Stay at Home or in the great outdoors away from others as much as possible and continue to limit social interactions, remain at least six (6) feet from others not in their household, and wear non -medical facial coverings in public. This Executive Order implements a number of measures that will allow many Coloradans to return to work and recr eation in the great outdoors while we maintain a sustainable level of Social Distancing. Any business or activity not addressed in this Executive Order or any accompanying Public Health Order (PHO) may operate in accordance with general guidance from CDPHE concerning group limitations, Social Distancing Requirements, and sanitation and cleaning protocols. II. Directives A. All Vulnerable Individuals should Stay at Home or in the vast, great outdoors away from others as much as possible, and continue to l imit their social interactions, remain at least six (6) feet from others not in their household, and wear facial coverings in public. Vulnerable Individuals cannot be compelled to perform in -person work for any business or government function, including a Critical Business or Critical Government Function. B. For purposes of this Executive Order, Vulnerable Individuals means: 1. Individuals who are sixty -five (65) years and older; 2. Individuals with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma; 3. Individuals wh o have serious heart conditions; 4. Individuals who are immunocompromised; 5. Pregnant women; and 6. Individuals determined to be high risk by a licensed healthcare provider. C. I direct the Executive Director of the Colorado Depart ment of Higher Education (CDHE) to continue to work with CDPHE to identify those programs and courses at postsecondary institutions that cannot be taught remotely and require limited in - person instruction.

I direct the Colorado Civil Rights Division within the Department of Regulatory Agencies and CDPHE to provide continued guidance to prevent discrimination in the workplace related to COVID -19. Employers must provide reasonable accommodation and are prohibited from discriminating against employees who are showing symptoms of COVID -19 or who have been in contact with a known positive case of COVID -19. E. I direct the Executive Director of CDPHE to issue a new or amended PHO consistent with the directives in this Executive Order. The new or amended PHO must: 1. Advise Coloradans to: i. Limit social interactions to the greatest extent possible; ii. If travelling outside their community, Coloradans are urged to honor all restrictions in place at their destination and avoid travel to counties or municipalities that issue travel restrictions; iii. Get tested for COVID -19 if they are experiencing flu -like symptoms or if they are sick, Stay at Home until at least three (3) days after the fever and last symptom subsides, except as necessary to care for themselves or seek medical care. Coloradans who are si ck and receive negative COVID -19 test results may resume activities as soon as they feel ready; and iv. Take other common -sense precautions against spreading and contracting COVID -19 such as maintaining six (6) feet of Social Distancing from others not in thei r household, wearing non -medical face coverings that cover the nose and mouth while in publ ic, and frequent hand washing. 2. Prohibit public gatherings of groups of ten (10) persons in both public and private commercial spaces unless gatherings of groups g reater than ten (10) persons are expressly authorized by this Executi ve Order or an associated PHO. 3. Strongly encourage all businesses and governmental entities to allow workers to telecommute whenever possible. 4. Require all Critical Businesses, Critical Government Functions, Non -Critical Retail, and Non -Critical Commercial Businesses to make work accommodations for Vulnerable Individuals. Employers are also encouraged to make accommodations for individuals living in the same household as a Vulnerable Individual and for individuals wi th childcare responsibilities. 5. Permit Non -Critical Retail to operate and offer goods through delivery service, window service, walk -up service, drive -through service, drive -up service , curbside delivery, and permit Non -Critical Retail to allow customers onto their Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34-1 Filed 06/10/20 Page 3 of 6 375Executive Order D 2020 091 June 1, 2020 Page 4 of 6 premises in a manner allowing for strict compliance with mandatory Social Distancing Requirements similar to the requirements for Critical Retail and cleaning and disinfectio n protocols. If a Non -Critical Retail entity experiences a COVID -19 case, they should fully cooperate with requirements of local public health officials. 6. Permit Places of Public Accommodation to offer food and beverage using delivery service, window serv ice, walk -up service, drive -through service, drive -up service, curbside delivery, outside dining, limited indoor dining, or any other manner set forth in an existing Executive Order or PHO and in accordance with mandatory Social Distancing Requirements and cleaning and disinfection protocols. If a Place of Public Accommodation experiences a COVID -19 case, they should fully cooperate with requirements of l ocal public health officials. 7. Ensure that Critical Businesses, Critical Government Functions, Non -Critical Commercial Businesses, and Non -Critical Retail with over fifty (50) employees in any one location follow protocols established by PHO, including but not limited to symptom screening and temperature check, closure of common areas, cleaning protocols, and mandatory S ocial Distancing Requirements. 8. CDPHE must specifically identify any businesses, industries, sectors, activities, or events that mus t remain closed at this time. 9. Any business or activity not addressed in this Executive Order or any accom panying PHO may operate in accordance with general guidance from CDPHE concerning group limitations, Social Distancing Requirements, and sanita tion and cleaning protocols.

Mandatory Social Distancing Requirements to be implemented by all employers, identifying any specific protocols for certain employers based on the nature of their work, including proper face and, if appropriate, hand coverings to be used; 2. A definition of Vulnerable Individual consiste nt with this Executive Order; 3. Operations requirements for Non -Critica l Retail and Critical Retail; 4. Appropriate guidelines for classes and programs identified in consultation with the Executive Director of C DHE pursuant to paragraph II.C.; 5.

Define mandatory Social Distancing Requirements and sanitation and cleaning protocols for all business es and government functions . G. I direct the Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) to continue to modify temporary emergency rules to amend the Colorado Health Emergency Leave with Pay Rules found in 7 CCR 1103 -10 to cover individuals returning to work under this Executive Order and to extend paid sick leave coverage to up to two -thirds pay for fourteen (14) days if a worker has tested positive for COVID -19, has COVID -like symptoms, or has been directed to quarantine o r isolation due to COVID -19 concerns. H. I direct the Executive Director of CDLE to continue to modify temporary emergency rules pursuant to C.R.S. \u00a7 8 -73-108(4)(c) and guidance to ensure that workers, and particularly workers who are Vulnerable Individuals , are not in danger of losing unemployment insurance eligibility for refusal to return to COVID -19-related demonstrab le, unsafe working conditions. I. Terms in this Executive Order, including Stay at Home, Necessary Activities, Minimum Basic Operations, Cr itical Government Functions, Necessary Travel, Critical Businesses, Places of Public Accommodation, Critical Retail, Social Distancing Requirements, and Vulnerable Individuals have the meaning as defined in PHO 20 -28, as amended, or any PHO issued pursuant to this Executive Order.

CDPHE shall define any criteria required for approval of a local variance. K. CDPHE shall review and approve a county -specific COVID -19 suppression plan that meets CDPHE's public health standards. CDPHE shall not provide COVID -19 preparedness grant funding to any county that implements measures that are less restrictive than the sta ndards contained in this Executive Order if the county did not first obtain approval from CDPHE to adopt such less restrictive standards. L. Nothing in this Executive Order prevents a county or municipality from adopting more protective standards than those c ontained in this Executive Order as necessary. M. Except as modified by this Executive Order, all Executive Orders issued due to COVID -19 that are currently in effect shall remain in full force and effect as originally promulgated.

Further, as there is substantial evidence of community spread of COVID-19 throughout the State, it is crucial to take measures now that can mitigate further spread of disease in our communities. FINDINGS 1. Governor Polis issued Executive Order D 2020 003 on March 11, 2020, declaring a disaster emergency in Colorado due to the presence of COVID-19. Since that time, the Governor has taken numerous steps to implement measures to mitigate the spread of disease within Colorado, and has further required that several public health orders be issued to implement his orders. 2. I have issued public health orders pertaining to the limitation of visitors and nonessential individuals in skilled nursing facilities, intermediate care facilities, and assisted living residences; closing bars and restaurants to in-person services; defining the terms of the Governor's stay at home requirements and critical business designations; requiring hospitals to report information relevant to the COVID-19 response; and requiring the wearing of face coverings in the workplace and urging their use in public. These measures all act in concert to reduce the exposure of individuals to disease, and are necessary steps to protect the health and welfare of the public. Additionally, in reducing the spread of disease, these requirements help to preserve the medical resources needed for those in our communities who fall ill and require medical treatment, thus protecting both the ill patients and the healthcare workers who courageously continue to treat patients. 3. As of June 1, 2020, there are 26,577 known cases of COVID-19 in Colorado, 4,372 Coloradans have been hospitalized and 1185 Coloradans have died from COVID-19. Multiple sources of data show that COVID-19 transmission and the use of healthcare due to COVID-19 EXHIBIT 3Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 33-3 Filed 06/08/20 USDC Colorado Page 1 of 46 Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34-2 Filed 06/10/20 Page 1 of 46 379Sixth Amended Public Health Order 20-28 Safer at Home June 5, 2020 have leveled off in Colorado. Our work to \"flatten the curve\" appears to be succeeding, and the Governor has ordered some lessening of the current Safer at Home restrictions as a result. 4. Executive Order D 2020 091 Safer at Home and in the Vast, Great Outdoors still strongly encourages that people at risk of severe illness from COVID-19, also known as Vulnerable Individuals, remain at home or in the great outdoors as much as possible, but allows limited reopening of postsecondary institutions and certain businesses. Additionally, individuals are encouraged to stay at home as much as possible and practice Social Distancing to reduce the likelihood of disease transmission, but certain activities, such as gathering in groups of no more than ten for activities, are permitted. As we continue to combat COVID-19 in our communities, continuing restrictions on individual travel and necessary activities remain appropriate. INTENT This Order sets forth the requirements for implementation of Safer at Home and in the Vast, Great Outdoors , as directed by Governor Polis. Individual restrictions remain in place concerning limitations on activities, travel, and public gatherings. Workplace restrictions remain necessary to implement standard Social Distancing Requirements , cleaning standards, and other items necessary to reduce the possibility of disease spread. Additionally, certain businesses and activities require specific guidance based on their business practices, and those are included in the appendices to this Order. ORDER Unless otherwise specifically noted in this Order, the requirements of this Order are effective June 1, 2020 and expire 30 days from June 1, 2020. This Order supersedes and replaces Public Health Orders 20-22 and 20-24, as amended. I. Safer at Home and in the Vast, Great Outdoors A. All individuals currently living within the State of Colorado are encouraged to stay at home or in the vast, great outdoors and avoid unnecessary interactions whenever possible in order to reduce the spread of disease. Individuals living in shared or outdoor spaces must at all times, to the greatest extent possible, comply with Social Distancing Requirements , defined in Section III below, and are encouraged to leave their residences only to perform or utilize Necessary Activities, defined in Section III below. B.

People who are sick must stay in their residence at all times except as necessary to seek medical care, and must not go to work, even for a Critical Business, defined in Section III below. E. Individuals who are sick or are experiencing flu-like symptoms should get tested for COVID-19, and must self-isolate until their symptoms cease or until they have a negative test result. If an individual has tested positive for COVID-19 and/or has developed symptoms of COVID-19, including early or mild symptoms (such as cough and shortness of breath), they should be in isolation (staying away from others) until they have had no fever for at least seventy-two (72) hours (that is three full days of no fever without the use of medicine that reduces fevers), other symptoms have improved (such as cough or shortness of breath), and at least ten (10) days have passed since symptoms first appeared. Coloradans who are sick and receive negative COVID-19 test results should continue to stay home while they are sick and should consult with their healthcare provider about the need for additional testing and the appropriate time to resume normal activities. F. Governmental and other entities are strongly urged to make shelter available to people experiencing homlessness as soon as possible and to the maximum extent practicable, and are authorized to take all reasonable steps necessary to provide non-congregate sheltering along with necessary support services to members of the public in their jurisdiction as necessary to protect all members of the community. People experiencing homelessness are urged to protect their health and safety by complying with Social Distancing Requirements at all times. G. Individuals are encouraged to limit travel to Necessary Travel , defined in Section III below, including but not limited to, travel by automobile or public transit. People must use public transit only for purposes of performing Necessary Activities or to travel to and from work to operate Businesses or maintain Critical Governmental Functions as authorized in Section II of this Order. People riding on public transit must comply with Social Distancing Requirements to the greatest extent feasible. 3 EXHIBIT 3Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 33-3 Filed 06/08/20 USDC Colorado Page 3 of 46 Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34-2 Filed 06/10/20 Page 3 of 46 381Sixth Amended Public Health Order 20-28 Safer at Home June 5, 2020 H.

The key elements of the Order are that most people still stay at home as much as possible and avoid unnecessary social interactions; vulnerable populations continue to stay at home except to support or perform necessary activities or participate in critical government functions or critical businesses; there is limited reopening of postsecondary institutions, and certain business operations are permitted; people are still encouraged to stay within their county of residence or employment as much as possible; public and private gatherings of more than ten (10) persons are prohibited; and Coloradans are advised to wear non-medical cloth face coverings that cover the nose and mouth whenever in public. Any county that desires to apply for a variance from part or all of the executive order may do so after meeting the following criteria and submitting an alternative COVID-19 suppression plan to be approved or denied by the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment (CDPHE). The application must be submitted directly to CDPHE through the online application process, found here. Criteria for variance consideration: 1) The local public health agency endorses the alternative plan; 2) Local hospitals can verify that they have the capacity to serve all people needing their care; 3) The county commissioners or, in the case of the City and County of Denver, the mayor of Denver, or, in the case of the City and County of Broomfield, the city council, vote affirmatively to adopt the alternative plan in place of the state Safer-At-Home order; and 4) Counties with sovereign tribal nations (Ute Mountain Ute and Southern Ute Indian tribes) must obtain a letter of support from tribes and include it with their variance application. The local variance process allows communities that are not experiencing a high rate of transmission to tailor social distancing policies to local conditions, in order to promote community wellness and economic stability. To protect other communities and hospital systems statewide, it is paramount that the local variance process only be used when transmission is at a low enough level to be suppressed through testing and containment efforts to detect positive cases, ensure successful isolation and quarantine close contacts. Examples of local conditions that should be considered in seeking a variance include: a low number of new cases per day, cases declining for the past 14 days, incidence below the state average, declining positive tests as a percent of total tests for the past 14 days, low and stable case growth rate or equivalent, and having an early warning system to detect an increase in community spread or outbreaks, with 36 EXHIBIT 3Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 33-3 Filed 06/08/20 USDC Colorado Page 36 of 46 Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34-2 Filed 06/10/20 Page 36 of 46 414Sixth Amended Public Health Order 20-28 Safer at Home June 5, 2020 triggers for tightening restrictions to prevent a breach of local hospital system capacity. Considerations and triggers should be documented in the plan submitted to CDPHE. Variance requests will be evaluated based on local epidemiological data to assess whether the county requesting the variance has a disease prevalence that is low, medium, or higher than the statewide average. If higher, other metrics may be considered such as two-week case trend, percent positivity of tests and, whether outbreaks exist and are contained. The variance will be commensurate with the local virus transmission and disease burden. CDPHE is available to provide technical assistance to any county considering a variance. The department will consider applications for variances based on the submitted plan's rationale for a step down and the presence of an early warning system with triggers for tightening back up. CDPHE reserves the right to approve or deny applications. All variances granted pursuant to this Order remain in effect until the Order expires without further extension or is terminated, unless automatically rescinded pursuant to the terms of the variance approval by CDPHE, rescinded for other reasons by CDPHE, or rescinded by the county. Approved local variances may be rescinded at the discretion of the local public health agency based on changes to State executive or public health orders. If a variance request is rescinded at the local level, the state orders will remain in effect. Local public health agencies may also choose to maintain approved variance requests in the event that a State order becomes less restrictive than the approved variance. At no point may an approved variance request be altered to be less restrictive in any aspect than state orders without updated approval from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Counties that choose to not comply with this executive order or an approved variance will be subject to the loss of emergency preparedness funds. 37 EXHIBIT 3Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 33-3 Filed 06/08/20 USDC Colorado Page 37 of 46 Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34-2 Filed 06/10/20 Page 37 of 46 415Sixth Amended Public Health Order 20-28 Safer at Home June 5, 2020 APPENDIX H: NON-CRITICAL MANUFACTURING I.

We strongly recommended that those who are at higher-risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (e.g. 65 years and older, chronic lung disease, serious heart conditions, immunocompromised, severe obesity, diabetes, liver disease, chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, etc.) continue using online options. Because spiritual needs cannot always be met through online programming, some spiritual leaders may decide to manage the risk and re-open portions of their in-person services. These guidelines and recommendations will help protect the health of those who choose to attend religious and spiritual gatherings in-person during this time. These guidelines and recommendations apply to houses of worship and settings where life-rites occur, such as funeral homes or venues for wedding ceremonies. Social receptions for those events still must follow mass gathering limitations. We welcome ongoing feedback, and will continually review these in partnership with you. To help us understand the impact on your communities, please complete this survey by June 12, Please find the survey here (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScc-4qr2l37dlX10wflCzLbmeSV4uzXRaotQB4wiKEZH5IWuQ/viewform? usp=sf_link).

Outdoors: Groups from different households spaced at least 6 feet apart, up to local capacity levels. Physical/social distancing Entering and exiting buildings should include at least 6 feet physical distancing by party. A \"party\" includes members of a household who live together. Seating in houses of worship should be arranged in such a way as to maintain at least 6 feet of distance in every direction between individuals or parties. Faith communities are encouraged to add additional services to accommodate the need for physical distancing, as well as consider shortening the duration of services to minimize exposure time. Houses of worship should have a plan for distancing requirements in restrooms (either one person at a time or close off multiple stalls in between the stalls that can be used). Multiple large rooms in a facility can be used as long as each space can follow ALL the guidelines and each room has 4 walls and a door. Service times may have to be staggered to accomplish this. Leaders must attend to distancing requirements, available restrooms, separate entrance/exit doors, and timely cleaning practices. Cleaning practicesFollow the Colorado Department of Health and Environment's Cleaning Guidance (https://covid19.colorado.gov/cleaning-guidance). Restrooms should be cleaned at minimum between each service. Any metal or plastic on chairs or surfaces must be disinfected between services. Additional resources can be found at CDC Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) - Get Your Community- and-Faith-Based Organizations Ready for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/) Strongly recommended guidelines Masks796 Shares EXHIBIT 2Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 33-2 Filed 06/08/20 USDC Colorado Page 3 of 9 Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34-3 Filed 06/10/20 Page 3 of 9 427/Follow the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's Guidance for wearing masks/cloth face coverings (https://covid19.colorado.gov/mask-guidance). We strongly encourage that masks be worn at all times while on the premises by staff, volunteers, and congregants attending worship services. Children 2 and under, those with trouble breathing, or those unable to remove a mask without assistance should not wear a mask. Houses of worship should have extra masks on hand for visitors who do not have their own. Any item provided to be worn must be disposable or fully sanitized before and after each use. Pre-registrationUse a pre-registration system, social media platform, or private messaging to distribute the number of worshippers across the services being offered (in accordance with the physical distancing guidelines). Develop a protocol for symptom screening (https://covid19.colorado.gov/symptom-screening): self-reporting, health surveys, or on-site checks. Anyone with any symptoms may not attend. Consider allowing for 10% capacity at each service for \"walk-ups\" who do not have access to the technology to sign up or do not know how to use it. Consider who will manage additional participants at the door. Employees and volunteers Upon arrival, all employees and volunteers should have their temperature taken and symptoms screened. Anyone with a temperature over 100.4 or showing COVID-19 symptoms (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) should go home. Sample Screening Form (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p6SStp1deNzVVjIgaL937f06jHWT9VDM/view). Masks and gloves must be worn. Training should be provided on sanitation. If anyone has symptoms, follow workplace outbreak guidelines (https://drive.google.com/file/d/107dLRAJaD4ZtNJGy8geSf0UvngesvKYd/view) . Directing movement of people (entry / exit Doors) Employees or volunteers (ushers) should provide physical distance directions for where to walk and which areas are available for seating/standing as the service begins and ends. Display clear signage in languages worshipers understand. Attendees should enter and exit the facility as directed: one person/household party at a time adhering to physical distancing guidelines. Mark the floor of the worship space (aisles), the lobby, and the area outside the entrance and exit with physical distancing markers to cue people where to stand/wait. Avoid any close congregating or crowding before, during, or after the service. Use separate doors for entry and exit. If only one door is available, ensure times of services are spread out enough that the exit of one service can be completed before entry for the next service is allowed. Enable people to stay 6 feet apart while waiting to enter the building. This can include ground markings, or other tactics like encouraging people to remain in their cars. Throughout the service, people need to maintain at least 6 feet of distance from all persons not in their household/party. After services, people should return directly to vehicles, maintaining at least 6 feet of distance from others. Create a \"touchless\" experience Where possible, houses of worship are encouraged to create a plan which allows for worshippers to avoid all contact with surfaces. Doors: Doors entering the building and inside the building should either remain propped open or be opened/closed by employees/volunteers throughout the entire process. Hand sanitizer: Locate touchless hand-sanitizer units at the front door and throughout the facility. Greeters: Greeters and attendees must greet while maintaining at least 6 feet of distance at all times and refrain from shaking hands or any personal contact. Designated standing room: Where possible, some spaces can be designated for those who desire to stand during the service with proper physical distancing (so as not to touch the chairs). Communion: Direct interaction between faith leaders and congregants should be touch-free. Individually packaged communion is the safest option. When communion is not individually wrapped, the container for the host/bread should remain covered and uncontaminated during blessings and prayers. Distribution should be touch-free. Common cups are very high-risk and should not be used. Offering: Offering boxes or baskets should be attached to the wall or set at an entrance or exit of the worship space in a way that attendees do not have to touch it when they give. Do not pass baskets or plates among attendees. Hymnals/religious books: These items should be removed and photocopies should be made available that can be discarded after one individual use, if permissible in that faith tradition. Consider projecting materials on a wall/screen for congregations to read together. Best practice is for worshippers to bring their own religious books and/or use technology to project lyrics, scriptures, liturgies, etc., so no physical copies are necessary, or provide links that can be used to get to the materials on a cell phone.Contact with religious objects: At this phase of re-opening, there should be minimal communal contact with objects of religious or spiritual significance. If possible, consider wearing gloves or other protection while handling. Food and beverage: No food or beverage may be offered by the house of worship. No food or beverage may be brought in by individual attendees to share with others. Presenting speakers/singers/choirs Masks or face coverings should be worn to the greatest extent possible, as loud speaking and singing appear to spread COVID-19 further. 796 Shares EXHIBIT 2Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 33-2 Filed 06/08/20 USDC Colorado Page 4 of 9 Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34-3 Filed 06/10/20 Page 4 of 9 428/Speakers, preachers, presenters, and singers should move considerably further back (25-27 feet) than the prescribed 6 feet of physical distance to maximize distance between them and the front row of attendees. Choirs should not be used at this time given the strong risk of viral spread from singing. Children's and youth programming Children and youth may attend religious services with parent(s)/caregiver(s) who feel confident they can enforce at least 6 feet of distance between children from different households. Particular services should be catered to families and publicized accordingly in order to mitigate the risk of cross-generational transmission. Houses of worship that would like to provide programming for children must demonstrate an ability to adhere to all guidelines for chld care centers (https://covid19.colorado.gov/safer-at-home/safer-at-home-child-care-facilities) published by CDPHE.Youth programming, separate from the religious services, may occur but with a strong recommendation for meeting outdoors, providing at least 6 feet of distance between parties from all sides, and the use of masks byall participants. Other areas of recommendation/consideration Outdoor services These services are allowed if all applicable guidelines listed in this document can be followed. Special consideration must be given to directing people from the parking lots to the outdoor setting while physical distancing, as well as indicating where they can sit/stand. Guests should bring their own lawn chair/blanket to minimize the shared use of chairs and other items (umbrellas, etc.). Masks and at least 6 feet of distance between parties is still required. Weddings that can follow outdoor service guidelines are allowed. Security Unfortunately, hate groups have used the fear of the pandemic to promote discrimination -- particularly against Asian, Jewish and Muslim communities. Any plans for reopening should be made with an awareness of these types of events. Muslim ablutionWhere possible it is recommended ablution occur privately at the attendees' place of residence before arriving at the mosque. If that is not possible, staff or volunteers should clean faucet handles and other items between each use. Religious studies, small groups, and meetingsReligious studies, book studies, and other small groups are strongly encouraged to continue to meet online. Staff might consider limited meetings in the religious facility with appropriate physical distancing and masks. Where possible these groups are encouraged to meet outdoors and to follow proper physical distancing guidelines and the use of masks. Religious facilities should follow the cleaning, movement, and mask guidance above. Food pantries and other services These activities may occur at the religious facility assuming all the relevant guidelines listed in this document can be followed and additional CDPHE guidelines for specific service facilities are followed. When distributing items, the gatherings should remain at 10 or under in one room with physical distancing guidelines, masks, and cleaning. Other sacred ceremoniesAs with all other services offered, if all the above guidelines can be met, these events are permitted. Additional Comments Please note, these are recommendations for June, and possibly July, based on current data. Houses of worship should immediately refer to the health department's guidance (https://drive.google.com/file/d/107dLRAJaD4ZtNJGy8geSf0UvngesvKYd/view) if there is deemed to be an outbreak in their community. Consider these recommendations as ways to protect your community and the general public. Do not try to find loopholes in order to bypass the recommendations. Be sure to check with your insurance company about liability around COVID-19 exposure in your facility. Areas that request and receive a variance from CDPHE can abide by the guidelines in the approved variance application.796 Shares EXHIBIT 2Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 33-2 Filed 06/08/20 Colorado Page 5 of 9 Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 34-3 Filed 06/10/20 Page 5 of 9 429/Con tact COVID-19-related issues & concerns (https://covid19.colorado.gov/CovidConcerns) Colorado Crisis Services (https://coloradocrisisservices.org/) We provide free, confidential, professional and immediate support for any mental health, substance use or emotional concern, 24/7/365.

JARED POLIS, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Colorado; and JILL HUNSAKER RYAN, in her official capacity as Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment , Defendants. ____________________________________________________________________________ DECLARATION OF MARK HOTALING ____________________________________________________________________________ This Declaration is submitted in support of Plaintiffs' Supplement to their Motion for Preliminary Injunction dated June 30, 2020 (the \"Supplement\"). 1. My name is Mark Hotaling . 2. On June 2, 2020 Governor Polis held a press conference. A true and accurate depiction of the June 2 press conference is set forth here: https://www.cpr.org/2020/06/02/watch -video -polis -colorado -coronavirus -update -9/ June 2, 2020 press conference Governor Polis made the following statements: (a) \" And to those who are peacefully protesting, I want you to kn ow that I see you, I hear you, and I grieve with you. And more importantly, I want to work with you to make Colorado better and America better. \" 3:46 to 4:03 (b) \" I commend those who peacefully join in the protests and help clean up the morning after. \" 4:37 to 4:42 (c) \" It is also divisive and sad to hear some call for a more violent crackdown against peaceful demonstrators exercising their First Amendment rights under our Constitution . . . This is not China. This is not Tiananmen Square, and that's not leadership. \" 5:07 to 5:31 Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 43-1 Filed 06/30/20 Page 1 of 3 741EXHIIBT F2 (d) \" I was glad to see the Denver Police Chief yesterday join arm -in-arm with those who exercised their free speech to protest the unjust murder of George Floyd. \" 6:40 to 6:51 (e) \" One of my greatest fears in wat ching the events over the last weekend is that so many people gathering in one place together will increase the spread of corona virus across our nation and here in Colorado. Only in the coming weeks will we see the full impact of these large gatherings. But health experts tell me it could result in hundreds of new cases and untold pain, death and suffering just as we were making progress. At least I was glad to see many protesters, hopefully most, wearing masks to protect themselves and those around the m from corona virus. \" 7:42 to 8:24 (f) \" Congregating outside is certainly safer than congregating inside. But with so many people in one area and statistically it's a certainty that some of them were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic carriers of coron a virus. There's no doubt that those who congregated faced an increased risk of infection. . . . Exercising our First Amendment rights of speech of gathering is a constitutionally protected right, and we want to make sure that everybody doing it is as saf e as possible. \" 8:49 to 9:52 (g) \" You know we need to remember that we are dealing with a global pandemic. And we should all be wearing masks whenever we are interacting with others outside of our household and take the proper precautions in every situ ation to try to be six feet from others. And while it was encouraging to see so many of the protesters do that, as governor it certainly kept me up at night worrying about thousands or tens of thousands of people congregating and the health risk to our st ate for this justified cause. \" 11:04 to 11:40 (h) \" It is not safe to be clustered together in a small outdoor areas. \" 14:38 to 14:43 (i) \" And by the way, I respect the fact that many Coloradans who joined the protests concluded it is not possible to stay at home. It is not possible to remain silent in the face of the killing of George Floyd, in the face of ongoing racial discrimination. And I completely respect the fact that those Coloradans consider that essential and they would conside r it unconscionable to remain at home. So staying safer at home wasn't possible. And we would not ask anybody to stay at home when it's not possible and when your conscience does not allow you to stay at home. \" 22:28 to 23:10 (j) \" Of course I express ed on the call the concern that protesters might encounter corona virus and that could lead to public health setbacks. I talked about how masks were made available for some of the protesters in Colorado and how we are encouraging testing. And I hope that serves as an example to governors in other states to open up testing and to the extent they can, masks, to help keep those who are exercising their First Amendment rights as safe as possible. \" 33:32 to 34:01 (k) \" That's one of the real public health i ssues around these large protests, is [] you can't do meaningful contact tracing other than that if there is a group of people that went Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 43-1 Filed 06/30/20 Page 2 of 3 742Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 43-1 Filed 06/30/20 Page 3 of 3 743IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH High Plains Harvest Church, and Mark Hotaling, Plaintiff, v. Jared Polis, in his official cap acity as Governor of the State of Colorado, and Jill Hunsaker Ryan, in her official capacity as Executive Direc tor of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Defendants. SUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF RACHEL HERLIHY, M.D. This Supplemental Declaration is submitted in support of the St ate Defendants' opposition to Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. 1. I have submitted two previous decl arations in this lawsuit. The first was in support of the State Defendants' opposition to Plaintiffs' original req uest for a temporary restraining order. The second was in support of the State Defendants' opposition to Plaintiffs' rene wed request for a temporary restraining order. 2. Rather than restate what was said in my previous declarations, I hereby incorporate those declarations by reference herein. 3. The purpose of this declaration is to provide an update on the spread of COVID-19 and recent studies and modeling related to the transmission of the virus. A. COVID-19 remains widespread in Colorado and nationwide. 4. As of July 20, 2020, there are 40,566 known cases of COVID-19 in Colorado. It is estimated that about 240,000 Colorad ans are or have been infect ed with COVID-19. 5. As of July 20, 2020, 6,057 Coloradoans have been hospitalized a nd 1,615 Coloradans have died from COVID-19. 6. 63 of Colorado's 64 counties have reported cases of COVID-19 as of July 20, 2020. 7. As of July 20, 2020, there are 275 people hospitalized with COV ID-19, and an additional 122 who are pers ons under investigation. 8. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have reported cases of COVID-19. 9. As of July 20, 2020, the World Health Organization reports about 14,348,858 cases globally, and 603,691 confirmed deaths. EXHIBIT 14Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 48-1 Filed 07/21/20 Page 1 of 6 810EXHIBIT G10. Nearly every country in the wo rld has reported cases of COVID-1 9. B. COVID in Weld County 11. The incidence of COVID-19 infect ion in Weld County is 1,021 cases per 100,000 population. 12. The incidence of COVID-19 infect ion in the State of Colorado ov erall is 697 cases per 100,000 population. 13. This map shows the incidence of COVID-19 by county over the past two weeks. This information demonstrates the recent burden of disease and strain on the healthcare system: 14. As this data shows, the current burden of disease in Weld County is higher than in many other counties in the rest of the state. 15. This means that someone in Weld County would be more likely to acquire COVID-19 infection than in other counties in Colorado with a lo wer disease burden. 16. On July 16, 2020, due to increasing disease transmission in the state, Governor Polis put a two week pause on the variance process, during whic h no new variances will be approved. 17. Since my last declaration, CDPHE release two additional Public Health Orders, the Seventh and Eighth Amended PHOs . I have reviewed Exhibits 15 and 16 to the Opposition to the Preliminary Injunction. Exhibits 15 and 16 are tr ue and accurat e copies of the Seventh and Eighth PHOs. 18. Pursuant to the Eighth Amended PHO, \"[f]or outdoor worship serv ices, a house of worship must maintain 6 feet d istance between non-household mem bers and work with the EXHIBIT 14Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 48-1 Filed 07/21/20 Page 2 of 6 811appropriate local authority to obtain approval for the maximum number of individuals who may attend in the designa ted outdoor space.\" 19. Under this provision, the outdoor worship service limit for a h ouse of worship in Weld County is set by the Weld C ounty local authority. C. New COVID-19 cases are and will continue to increase in Colorado and nationwide. 20. Beginning around the end of June, Colorado (along with many oth er states) began to see an increase in new COVI D-19 cases and hospitalizations. 21. This is caused by a number of diffe rent factors, including the gradual reopening of restaurants, bars, and churches, which has led to Coloradans ha ve more interactions with one another. 22. There is also an increase in behavioral changes, with people be ing less inclined to maintain social distancing as compared to the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in March. 23. States such as Arizona and Flor ida are seeing a massive surge i n new COVID-19 cases since the end of June. This can be directly attributed to rolling back necessary social distancing and public health ord ers too quickly, and the popula tions of those states not consistently wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. 24. Recent modeling projects Colora do to have continual increases o f new COVID-19 cases throughout the rest of the s ummer and into early fall. 25. CDPHE uses the Colorado COVID-19 Modeling Group to perform thes e modeling projects. The Modeling Group is a consortium of public health e xperts, other scientists, mathematicians, and academics that CDPHE uses to evaluate the c urrent state of COVID-19 spread in Colorado. 26. These researchers have determined that social distancing has be en declining since May. 27. When Colorado transitioned from t he Stay at Home orders in May, social interactions had been red uced by approximately 87%. 28. By early June, that number dropped to 66%, and is now estimated at 41% through late June. 29. An increase in social interacti ons permits the virus to spread again more quickly. The spread of the virus is represented by the effective reprodu ction number. An effective reproductive number above 1 indicates growth in infections. 30. The estimated effective reproductive number is at its highest p oint now since it was in late March. The following chart shows estimated effective re productive numbers. EXHIBIT 14Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 48-1 Filed 07/21/20 Page 3 of 6 812 31. Current projections, released July 16, reveal that the risk of overwhelming Colorado's hospital ICU beds is increasing. 32. If the current 41% social distancing continues, represented by the orange line in the chart below, ICU beds will be overwhelmed in early September. I f social distancing increases to 55%, shown in purple, that date will move to November. And only if Colorado achieves 65% social distancing, represented by the green line, can Colorado avoid exceeding its hospital capacity. EXHIBIT 14Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 48-1 Filed 07/21/20 Page 4 of 6 81333. This modeling now projects another spike of COVID-19 cases arou nd the end of summer and into the fall. 34. Both Colorado and Weld County are experien cing increases in both the number of new cases and the rate at whic h those new cases increase. 35. Similar increases are seen in visits related to COVID-19, inclu ding hospitalizations, emergency department visits, outpatient visits, and in the perc ent of COVID-19 tests that come back positive. D. Recent studies suggests that increased cases in Colorado and nationwide are likely not attribut able to the George Floyd prot ests. 36. Recent studies indicate that COVID-19 transmission in a closed environment, such as a church, may be close to 20 time s greater than compared to an open-air environment. 37. For example, one study found that the odds that a primary case transmitted COVID-19 in a closed environmen t was 18.7 times greater compared to an open-air environment. Hiroshi Nishiura, et al., Closed Environments Facilitate Secondary Transmission of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Apr. 16, 2020) (preprint available from medRxiv), https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029272. Although not yet p eer reviewed or published, this study shows significantly greater indoor case transmission in t he studied cases. A true and accurate copy of this study is attached as Exhibits 17 to the Opposition to the Preliminary Injunction. 38. This is due to a number of factors. First, respiratory droplets, which are primarily responsible for spreading the disease, are more likely to be quickly dispersed outdoors versus indoors. Second, in outdoor environments, temperature extremes and sunlight decrease virus survival times. 39. In closed-indoor environments, respiratory droplets are more li kely to linger on surfaces and/or be recirculated through the indoor space due to either poor ventilation or large numbers of people in the indoor space. 40. Based on available research, transmission in crowded indoor pla ces is significantly more likely than in crowded outdoor places. 41. As a result of the transmissi on difference between indoor and o utdoor spaces, it is not likely that recent increases in COVID-19 are attributable t o the George Floyd protests. 42. In fact, CDPHE has not attribut ed a single COVID-19 outbreak to t h e p r o t e s t s through contract tracing or other means. That is not to say tha t there was no transmission during the protests, but CDPHE has not contact traced an outbreak to t he protests. E. Colorado has linked COVID-19 o utbreaks to houses of worship. 43. Colorado has experienced outbreaks in Colorado houses of worshi p. 44. In one outbreak in a house of worship in El Paso County, there are currently 8 identified cases, including 4 st aff and 4 congregants. Based on the investigation, it appears that the initial cases occurred among church staff and the infection was then transmitted to attendees during church services. EXHIBIT 14Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 48-1 Filed 07/21/20 Page 5 of 6 81445. A large event hosted by a Telle r County ministry has also resul ted in an outbreak with 2 lab-confirmed COVID-19 positive staff, and another 7 con firmed or probable cases among attendees. 46. CDPHE is also investigating a probable outbreak in another El P aso County church, but no further information is available at this time. F. CDPHE did not encourage the George Floyd protests. 47. CDPHE recognized that the George Floyd protests were going to take place regardless of whether it, or any other governmental body, encou raged or discouraged the protests. This is evident by the fact th at protests took place in cities around the world. 48. In recognizing this fact, CDPHE r eleased the Protest Guidance I mentioned in my previous declaration. The guidance was not an endorsement of vi olating applicable public health orders or social dis tancing guidelines. 49. Instead, the guidance was an attempt to best react to an ever-c hanging social landscape at that time. And at t hat time, it was important for CDPHE to release guidance to help people who decided to protest understand measures that would he lp them protect their health. G. Public health interventions are still necessary. 50. It is still necessary to mainta in applicable public health inte rventions, such as social distancing and gradual reopenings. 51. The goal of gradual reopenings is to prevent the pandemic from accelerating further. This will help preven t exceeding hospital capacity and running out of ventilators. 52. There is also a national push to get kids back to school in the fall. This is likely not possible without continuing social distancing and gradual reopening strategies. 53. Absent use of all strategies, Colorado is likely to face a seco nd peak of COVID-19 in late summer to early fall. * * * I declare under penalty of perj ury that the foregoing is true a nd correct. Rachel Herlihy, M.D. EXHIBIT 14Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 48-1 Filed 07/21/20 Page 6 of 6 815SECOND AMENDED PUBLIC HEALTH ORDER 20-36 COVID-19 DIAL November 20, 2020 PURPOSE OF THE ORDER I issue this Public Health Order (PHO or Order) pursuant to the Governor's directive in Executive Order D 2020 235 in response to the existence of thousands of confirmed and presumptive cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related deaths across the State of Colorado. This Order implements levels of restrictions for individuals, businesses and activities to prevent the spread of COVID-19 further in Colorado. FINDINGS 1. Governor Polis issued Executive Order D 2020 003 on March 11, 2020, declaring a disaster emergency in Colorado due to the presence of COVID-19. Since that time, the Governor has taken numerous steps to implement measures to mitigate the spread of disease within Colorado, and has further required that several public health orders be issued to implement his orders. 2. I have issued public health orders pertaining to the limitation of visitors and nonessential individuals in skilled nursing facilities, intermediate care facilities, and assisted living residences; defining the terms of the Governor's Stay at Home, Safer at Home, and Protect our Neighbors requirements as well as Critical Business designations; requiring hospitals to report information relevant to the COVID-19 response; and requiring the wearing of face coverings in the workplace and urging their use in public. These measures all act in concert to reduce the exposure of individuals to disease, and are necessary steps to protect the health and welfare of the public. Additionally, in reducing the spread of disease, these requirements help to preserve the medical resources needed for those in our communities who fall ill and require medical treatment, thus protecting both the ill patients and the healthcare workers who courageously continue to treat patients. 3. As of November 16 ,2020, there have been 167,713 known cases of COVID-19 in Colorado, 11,203 Coloradans have been hospitalized and 2,276 Coloradans have died from COVID-19. Multiple sources of data show that COVID-19 transmission and the use of healthcare due to COVID-19 have leveled off in Colorado. Our work to \"flatten the curve\" EXHIBIT HSecond Amended Public Health Order 20-36 COVID-19 Dial November 20, 2020 appears to be succeeding, and the Governor has ordered some lessening of the current Safer at Home restrictions as a result. 4. Executive Order D 2020 235 requires the harmonizing of the various levels of activities previously described in prior Protect Our Neighbors , Safer at Home , and Stay at Home executive orders into one more simplified dial format. Counties must implement the requirements of the relevant level of the COVID-19 Dial for their jurisdiction, as determined by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), based upon scientific metrics established in the Dial . The Dial still strongly encourages that people at risk of severe illness from COVID-19 remain at home or in the great outdoors as much as possible, but allows levels of business and activities based upon disease prevalence and other metrics in each county. Additionally, individuals are encouraged to remain at least 6 feet away from non-household contacts to reduce the likelihood of disease transmission, and otherwise unregulated gatherings are also limited in each level of the Dial . As we continue to combat COVID-19 in our communities, continuing restrictions to mitigate disease spread remain appropriate. INTENT This Order sets forth the requirements for implementation of the COVID Dial . Individual restrictions remain in place concerning limitations on activities, travel, and public gatherings. Workplace restrictions remain necessary to implement standard Distancing Requirements , cleaning standards, and other items necessary to reduce the possibility of disease spread. Additionally, certain businesses and activities require specific guidance based on their business practices, and those are included in the appendices to this Order. ORDER This Order supersedes and replaces Public Health Orders 20-32 and 20-35, as amended. The Dial levels in PHO 20-36 remain in effect until 11:59 pm on Thursday, November 19, 2020, and the revised Dial levels in this First Amended PHO 20-36 take effect at 5:00 pm Friday, November 20, 2020. I. COVID Dial - Individual Requirements A. All individuals currently living within the State of Colorado are encouraged to stay at home or in the vast, great outdoors and avoid unnecessary interactions whenever possible in order to reduce the spread of disease. Individuals living in shared or outdoor spaces must at all times, to the greatest extent possible, comply with Distancing Requirements , defined in Section IV below, and are encouraged to 2 Second Amended Public Health Order 20-36 COVID-19 Dial November 20, 2020 leave their residences only to perform or utilize Necessary Activities, defined in Section IV below. B. Individuals are urged to wear non-medical cloth face coverings that cover the nose and mouth whenever in public as required by Executive Order D 2020 091 as amended and extended. Additionally, pursuant to Executive Order D 2020 138 as amended and extended by Executive Order D 2020 164, D 2020 190 , and D 2020 219 , D 2020 237 , and D 2020 245 all individuals must wear face coverings in public indoor spaces, as that term is defined in the Executive Order 2020 138 , unless the individual is 10 years of age or younger, cannot medically tolerate a face covering, or is performing one of the enumerated activities in Section II.M of Executive Order D 2020 138 as amended and extended. C. Individuals at Risk of Severe Illness from COVID-19 are urged to stay in their residence at all times except as necessary to seek medical care, and this becomes more critical as a county's level in the Dial becomes more restrictive. Individuals at Risk of Severe Illness from COVID-19 cannot be compelled to work for any business or government function, including a Critical Business or Critical Government Function , during the pendency of this pandemic emergency. People who are sick must stay in their residence at all times except as necessary to seek medical care, and must not go to work, even for a Critical Business, identified in Appendix A of this Order. D. Individuals who are sick or are experiencing flu-like symptoms should get tested for COVID-19. If an individual has tested positive for COVID-19 and/or has developed symptoms of COVID-19, including early or mild symptoms (such as cough and shortness of breath), they should be in isolation (staying away from others) until they are released by public health. In most cases, individuals are released from isolation when they are fever-free, without medication, for twenty-four (24) hours, other symptoms have improved, and at least ten (10) days have passed since symptoms first appeared. A limited number of people with severe illness may require longer isolation. Coloradans who are sick and receive negative COVID-19 test results should continue to stay home while they are sick and should consult with their healthcare provider about the need for additional testing and the appropriate time to resume normal activities. E. Governmental and other entities are strongly urged to make shelter available to people experiencing homlessness as soon as possible and to the maximum extent practicable, and are authorized to take all reasonable steps necessary to provide 3 Second Amended Public Health Order 20-36 COVID-19 Dial November 20, 2020 non-congregate sheltering along with necessary support services to members of the public in their jurisdiction as necessary to protect all members of the community. People experiencing homelessness are urged to protect their health and safety by complying with Distancing Requirements at all times. F. Individuals are encouraged to limit travel to Necessary Travel , defined in Section IV below, including but not limited to, travel by automobile or public transit. People must use public transit only for purposes of performing Necessary Activities or to travel to and from work to operate Businesses or maintain Critical Governmental Functions as authorized in Section III of this Order. People riding on public transit must comply with Distancing Requirements to the greatest extent feasible. II . COVID-19 DIAL LEVELS. A. APPLICATION OF THE DIAL. 1. The COVID-19 Dial consists of six levels that counties qualify for based on meeting specific metrics. Counties will remain in a Dial level so long as they continue to meet the metrics in that level. If the county falls out of compliance with one or more of the metrics associated with that level, they will have two weeks to develop and implement mitigation strategies to get back into compliance with the metric. If after two weeks one or more of the metrics remains out of compliance, the county must participate in a consultation with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) to determine whether additional mitigation time and/or mitigation strategies are warranted, or if the county must move to a lower level. CDPHE reserves the right to move counties one or more levels more quickly as circumstances warrant. 2. Counties that meet all metrics for the next less restrictive level for a two week period may submit a request to CDPHE through their local public health agency to move to that level, which must include supporting documentation from local officials, including the local public health agency, local elected officials, and local hospitals. Counties wishing to move levels from Blue (Safer at Home) to Green ( Protect our Neighbor ) must complete an online certification form and process provided by CDPHE. Counties may individually, or in a grouping of counties together creating a region, certify that they meet the metrics for Level Green . 3. Level Green: Protect Our Neighbors Certification 4 Second Amended Public Health Order 20-36 COVID-19 Dial November 20, 2020 a. Containment and mitigation plan .

Any county meeting the Level Blue or Yellow metrics as described in Section II of this Order that desires to apply for a site specific variance from part of the public health order may do so if they meet certain criteria established below. These variances allow very large indoor and outdoor venues that meet the criteria to operate in an alternate fashion after receiving approval from the county's local public health agency and other local officials, and then final approval from the CDPHE. The application must be submitted by the local public health agency directly to CDPHE. II. VARIANCE APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS A. Application Requirements 1. Eligibility a. Counties that are in Level Blue on the Dial may apply for outdoor and indoor site-specific variances. b. Counties that are in Level Yellow on the Dial may only apply for outdoor site-specific variances. c. Only venues that exceed 30,000 square feet will be considered for a variance. d. If a venue has multiple uses or sectors included in it, the variance request must specify how the venue proposes to meet the requirements for each use or sector. 2. Application Submission . Prior to submitting a variance application to CDPHE, counties that receive a request for a site specific variance must review and determine whether to support the request. If the county supports the site specific variance, the local public health agency may submit a variance application to CDPHE. The application form must include all of the following: a. Identify the site and capacity limit(s) the county is requesting a variance from. b. Describe the disease prevention measures the county will require of the site to meet the state's orders. c. Use the Distancing Space Calculator to determine capacity. d. Use the outdoor and indoor event guidance to create designated spaces within the site. 66 Second Amended Public Health Order 20-36 COVID-19 Dial November 20, 2020 e. Documentation of approval of the variance request must be included in the variance application from all of the following: i. The local public health agency; ii.

Modifications to the requirements for nursing facilities, assisted living residences or intermediate care facilities in PHO 20-20 ; or 6. Modification of the mask or face covering requirements. IV. SUSPENSION, RESCISSION OR TERMINATION OF VARIANCES A. If a site that has an approved variance experiences two COVID-19 cases linked to the site, the county must work with the site to implement mitigation strategies to reduce or eliminate further spread of disease. CDPHE may suspend the variance at any time, as deemed necessary, to mitigate disease spread. For counties moving to Level Red , any site specific variances will be reviewed to determine if the variance should be suspended. Site specific variances in counties moving to Level Purple are automatically suspended when the move to Level Purple is effective, unless otherwise authorized to remain in place by CDPHE. B. Approved site specific variances may also be suspended by the local public health agency. Local public health agencies may also choose to maintain approved site specific variances in the event that a state order becomes less restrictive than the approved variance. At no point may an approved variance request be altered to be less restrictive in any aspect than state orders without updated approval from CDPHE. C. Suspension or rescission of a site specific variance will reinstitute the requirements of this Order at the level for which the county is approved at the time of suspension or rescission for that site. D. All variances granted pursuant to this Order remain in effect until the sooner of: 1. The county moves to a level where the variance is no longer authorized, or to a level where the variance is no longer necessary; 2. The variance is rescinded pursuant to the terms of the variance approval by CDPHE, rescinded for other reasons by CDPHE, or rescinded by the county; or 3. This Order expires without further extension or is terminated. E.

Counties that choose to not comply with executive orders, public health orders, or an approved variance will be subject to the loss of emergency preparedness or other funds. 68 EXHIBIT I1 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO Civil Action No. __________________ HIGH PLAINS HARVEST CHURCH; and MARK HOTALING, Plaintiff s, v. JARED P OLIS , in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Colorado; and JILL HUNSAKER RYAN, in her official capacity as Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Defendants. ____________________________________________________________________________ VERIFIED COMPLAINT ____________________________________________________________________________ Plaintiff s submit the following Verified Complaint: I. INTRODUCTION 1. Today in Colorado it is perfectly legal for hundreds of shoppers to pack themselves cheek by jowl into a Lowes . But if 50 people meet to worship God in a small rural church, they do so at the risk of being fined and imprisoned. Plaintiffs feel as though they have stepped through the looking glass into a world where the right to shop for gardening supplies and home improvement materials is protected by the Constitution , while meeting as a body to worship God corporately has been r elegated to the category of unnecessary of even superfluous. Plaintiffs call upon the Court to come to their aid, vindicate their religious liberties under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and remedy the surreal state of affairs in which they inexplicabl y find themselves. Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 1 Filed 05/25/20 Page 1 of 12 8EXHIBIT J2 II. PARTIES 2. High Plains Harvest Church (\"HPHC\" or the \"Church\" ) is a small church located at 108 1st Street, Ault, Colorado 80610. HPHC is a religious nonprofit organization.

HPHC has associational standing because (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to its purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit. Each of HPHC's members would have standing to assert claims for breach of their constitutional rights as set forth he rein. The interest HPHC seeks to protect, especially the interest in the free exercise of religion, is germane to HPHC's purpose. The claims asserted herein do not require the participation of individual members. HPHC seeks a declaration, injunction, an d other prospective relief, and it can reasonably be supposed that the remedies, if granted, will inure to the benefit of those members of HPHC actually injured. 3. Plaintiff Mark Hotaling (\"Hotaling\") is a resident of Colorado. 4. Defendant Jared Polis (\" Governor Polis\") is the Governor of Colorado. Governor Polis is sued in his official capacity only.

All of the events alleged herein occurred within the State of Colorado (the \"State\") , and all of the parties were residents of the State at the time of the events giving rise to this litigation. IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND 11. HPHC's vision is to be a Christ -centered, rural, regional church that makes a genuine difference in the hearts of people thro ughout northern Colorado. The Church seeks to create an environment where each person is : cultivating daily, life -changing intimacy with the Savior ; experiencing biblical community with others in the body of Christ ; using their time, talents, and treasure s to further God's kingdom ; engaging in intentional discipleship and ministry ; and bringing the Gospel into their sphere of influence with word and action. 12. Hotaling is a former Navy SEAL and a service -disabled veteran. After returning home f rom the Navy, Hotaling followed the Lord's call to serve Him full -time. Hotaling is a devout Christian and a pastor in the Church. Until the recent COVID -19 outbreak, Hotaling frequently attended and/or led services a t the Church. He typically attended and/or led three to Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 1 Filed 05/25/20 Page 3 of 12 104 four services and/or other religious gatherings per week. Hotaling has a sincerely held religious belief that in-person attendance at church is central to his faith. 13. In response to the presence of COVID -19 in Colorado , on April 26, 2020, Governor Polis issued his so -called \"Safer at Home\" order, Executive Order , D 2020 044 (the \"Executive Order\"). A copy of the Executive Order is attached as Exhibit A. 14. In the Executive Order Governor Polis direct ed Director Ryan to issue a public health order \"[prohibiting] public gatherings of ten (10) persons or more in both public spaces and private commercial venues. \" Exec utive Order II.H.3. 15. On May 14, 2020 Director Ryan issued Third Amended Public Health Order 20 - 28 Safer at Home (the \"PHO\"). The PHO \"sets forth the requirements for implementation of [the Executive Order], as directed by Governor Polis .\" A copy of the PHO is attached as Exhibit B. 16. The PHO prohibits all public and private gatherings greater than ten individuals except for \"Necessary Activities.\" PHO I. C. There is no numerical limit on the number of persons who may be present when \"Necessary Activities\" are conducted . Religious worship services are not considered Necessary Activities under the PHO. 17. \"Necessary Activities\" do include activities associated with \"Critical Businesses .\" PHO III. A. 4. \"Critical Businesses\" are listed in Appendix F to the PHO and include numero us business activities, including grocery stores; stands; convenience stores; marijuana dispensaries; liquor stores; gun stores; funeral homes, airlines, mining operations such as oil and gas extraction, hardware stores; laundromats; banks; law offices; and accounting offices . Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 1 Filed 05/25/20 Page 4 of 12 115 18. The PHO states that it \" will be enforced by all appropriate legal means ,\" and that \"[f]ailure to comply with this order could result in penalties, including jail time, and fines . . .\" PHO, VI. A previous version of the PHO invoked the authority of C.R.S. \u00a7 25-1-114 to impose criminal penalties. 19. Director Ryan has also issued \"Gu idance for Places of Worship\" to implement the Executive Order (the \"Guidance\"). A copy of the Guidance is attached as Exhibit C. The Guidance states that religio us gatherings are permitted only as long as the gatherings are with 10 people or fewer . Gui dance, p. 1. 20. The Executiv e Order, the PHO and the Guidance shall be referred to herein collectively as the \"Orders.\" 21. On May 25, 2020 , Hotaling went to a local Lowes. He observed literally hundreds of customers going in and out of the store. The parking lot was pack ed to near capacity , and drivers were circling in hopes of finding a parking spot . See Exhibit D. 22. The Orders have the effect of prohibiting a gathering of 50 worshipers in HPHC's sanctuary - even if all of those worshipers observe social distancing requirements - while at the very same time allowing hundreds of people in the Lowes down the road. 23. The Bible commands Christians not to forsake the gathering together of believers. Hebrews 1 0:24-25. In-person corporate worship is a fundamental ten et of Christian practice and has been for nearly 2,000 years. 24. HPHC and its members , including Hotaling, have a sincerely held religious belief that the physical corporate gathering of believers is a central element of religious worship commanded by the Lord. Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 1 Filed 05/25/20 Page 5 of 12 126 25. It is a substantial burden on the religious exercise of HPHC and its members , including Hotaling, if they cannot meet for in -person corporate worship as a body of believers. 26.

See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Interim Guidance for Communities of Faith , https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/php/faith - based.html?mod=article_inline . These guidelines include: Encourag staff and congregants to maintain good hand hygiene Encourag ing use of cloth face coverings among staff and congregants Clean ing and disinfect ing frequently touched surfaces at least daily and shared objects in between uses Promot ing social distancing at services and other gatherings, ensuring that clergy, staff, choir, volunteers and attendees at the services follow social distancing throughout services 28.

On April 14, 2020, United States Attorney General William Barr issued a statement declaring the Department of Justice opposes discrimination against religious activity in the context of their COVID -19 responses. In pertinent part, the statement said: even in times of emergency, when reasonable and temporary restrictions are placed on rights, the First Amendment and federal statutory law prohibit discrimination against religious institutions and religious believers. Thus, government may not impose special restrictions on religious activity that do not also apply to similar nonreligious activity . For example, if a government allows movie theaters, restaurants, concert halls, and other comparable places of assembly to remain open and unrestricted, it may not order houses of worship to close, limit their congregation size, or otherwise impede religious gatherings. Religious institutions must not be singled out for special burdens. . . . where a state has not acted evenhandedly, it must have a compelling reason to impose restrictions on places of worship and must ensure that those restrictions are narrowly tailored to advance its compelling interest.

V. FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 - Violation of First Amendment Freedom of Religion 34. Plaintiff s hereby incorporate all other paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. 35. The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the State from abridging Plaintiffs' rights to free exercise of religion. 36. Plaintiffs have since rely held religious beliefs that the Bible is the infallible, inerrant word of the Lord Jesus Christ and they are to follow its teachings. Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 1 Filed 05/25/20 Page 7 of 12 148 37. Plaintiffs have sincerely held religious beliefs, rooted in Scripture's commands (e.g., Hebrews 10:25), that followers of Jesus Christ are not to forsake the assembling of themselves together, and that they are to do so even more in times of peril and crisis. Indeed, the entire purpose of the Church (in Greek \" ekklesia ,\" meaning \"assembly\") is to assemble together Christians to worship Almighty God. 38. The Orders, on their face and as applied, impermissibly burden Plaintiffs' sincerely held religious beliefs, compel Plaintiffs to either change those beliefs or to act in contradiction to them, and force Plaintiffs to choose between the teachings and requirements of their sincerely held religious beliefs in the commands of scripture and the State 's regulations . 39. The Orders, on their face and as applied, are neither neutral nor generally applicable, but rather discriminate against the religious beliefs, speech, assembly, and viewpoint of Plaintiffs. 40. The State lacks a compelling, legitimate, or rational interest in the Orders' application of different standards for churches an d faith -based gatherings than those applicable to exempted businesses and other non-religious entities. 41. Even if the Orders' restriction on faith -based gatherings were supported by a compelling interest, they are not the least restrictive mean s to accomplish the government's purported interest. 42. The Orders, on their face and as applied, fail to accommodate Plaintiffs' sincerely held religious beliefs. 43. The Orders, on their face and as applied, burden Plaintiffs' sincerely held religious beliefs while at the same time setting up a pervasive system of individualized exemptions that permit other similarly situated businesses or non -religious entities to continue Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 1 Filed 05/25/20 Page 8 of 12 159 operations while prohibiting faith -based ga therings, such as Plaintiffs' church and religious gatherings, from operating. 44. The Orders, on their face and as applied, have caused, are causing, and will continue to cause Plaintiffs immediate and irreparable harm, and actual and undue hard ship. 45. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to correct the continuing deprivation of their liberties. 46. Plaintiffs respectfully pray for the relief against the State as hereinafter set forth in their prayer for relief. VI. SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 - Violation of Right to Equal Protection Under the Fourteenth Amendment 47. Plaintiffs hereby incorporate all other paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. 48. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees Plaintiffs the right to equal protection under the law. 49. The Orders, on their face and as applied, are an unconstitutional abridgment of Plaintiffs' right to equal protection because in the Orders the State treats Plaintiffs differently from other similarly situated businesses and non -religious entities on the basis of the exercise of their funda mental rights . 50. The Orders, on their face and as applied, impermissibly discriminate between certain non -religious gatherings and religious or faith -based gatherings. 51. The State lacks a compelling, legitimate, or rational interest in the Orders' application of different standards for churches and fai th-based gatherings than those applicable to exempted businesses or non -religious entities. Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 1 Filed 05/25/20 Page 9 of 12 1610 52. The Orders, on their face and as applied, are not the least restrictive means to accomplish any permissible government purpose sought to be served. 53. The Orders, on their face and as applied, do not have a rational basis. 54. The Orders, on their face and as applied, are irrational and unjustifiable and impose irrational and unjustifiable restrictions on Plaintiffs' religious or fa ith- based gatherings. 55. The Orders, on their face and as applied, have caused, are causing, and will continue to cause Plaintiffs immediate and irreparable harm, and actual and undue hardship. 56. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy a t law to correct the continuing deprivation of their most cherished liberties. 57. Plaintiffs respectfully pray for the relief against the State as hereinafter set forth in their prayer for relief. VII. THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 - Violation of First Amendment Free Spe ech Rights 58. Plaintiffs hereby incorporate all other paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. 59. The Orders violate Plaintiffs' freedom of speech by prohibiti ng them from engaging in religious speech through their church services which occur exclusively on private property. 60. The Orders give government officials unbridled discretion with respect to enforcement of the Orders and the imposition of an y penalty, making the Orders susceptible to both content - and viewpoint -based discrimination. 61. Prohibiting or punishing Plaintiffs' religious speech does not serve any legitimate, rational, substantial, or compelling governmental interest. Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 1 Filed 05/25/20 Page 10 of 12 1711 62. The State has alternative, less restrictive means to achieve any interest that it might have. 63. The Orders violate the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, both facially and as applied. 64. In the absence of declaratory and injunctive relief, Plaintiffs will be irreparably harmed. 65. Plaintiffs respectfully pray for the relief against the State as hereinafter set forth in their prayer for relief. VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for relief as follows: A. That the Court issue a Temporary Restraining Order restraining and enjoining Governor Polis, Director Ryan and all persons in active concert or participation with them, from enforcing, attempting to enforce, threatening to enforce, or otherwise requiring compliance with the Orders or any other order to the extent any such order pro hibits in -person services at the Church if the Church meets the social distancing and hygiene guidelines pursuant to which the State allows so -called \"Necessary Activities\" to be conducted without numerical limit. B. That the Court issue a Preliminary Injunction pending trial, and a Permanent Injunction upon judgment, restraining and enjoining Governor Polis, Director Ryan and all persons in active concert or participation with them, from enforcing, attempting to enforce, threatening to enfo rce, or otherwise requiring compliance with the Orders or any other order to the extent any such order prohibits in -person services at the Church if the Church meets the Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 1 Filed 05/25/20 Page 11 of 12 18Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 1 Filed 05/25/20 Page 12 of 12 19IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO C ivil Action No. 20- cv-1480- RM-MEH H IGH PLAINS HARVEST OTALING, P laintiffs, v.

We strongly encourage allparticipants - protestors, law enforcement, and members of the media - to follow these guidelines to stay safe and protectthemselves from COVID-19 transmission if attending protests ordemonstrations. Maintain physical distancing. Whenever people gather in large numbers, there is a potential forthe disease to spread. It's important to maintain at least 6 feet of physical distancing or more. Shouting generates more aerosols andcan spread the virus further, increasing COVID-19 transmission.Some police tactics, such as tear gas and pepper spray, couldexacerbate the situation by prompting people to cough and gaspfor air. We caution police that these tactics can lead to increased EXHIBIT 12Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 39-12 Filed 06/12/20 Page 1 of 4 698EXHIBIT MGuidance for people attending protests | Colorado COVID-19 Updates Cleaning guidance Mask guidance Protest guidance Symptom screeningCOVID-19 Isolation &quarantine Safer at Home Public health &executive orders of COVID-19. Wear a mask. Wearing a mask is very important if you plan to gather in largegroups because people who have no symptoms can spread COVID-19. Wearing a non-medical mask or face covering helps minimize the spread of the virus. Everyone should wear a mask when out inpublic. Instructions for making masks can be found at the Colorado Mask Project . We understand the reasons why wearing a mask can be difficult. We recognize that for people of color, racial bias and stereotypesof criminality have created real fears about going out in public with a mask or face covering. People of color have been removedfrom stores for wearing masks, and many fear for their lives. We understand these concerns, and at this moment, they must beweighed against the additional protections masks can provide fromtransmission and exposure to COVID. We encourage you to wearone. Get tested. Everyone who participates in protests or demonstrations shouldmonitor themselves for COVID-19 symptoms . Anyone with symptoms should be tested right away. People without symptoms who believe they were exposed to someone with COVID-19 maywant to seek testing seven days after they believe they were exposed. That allows people to learn if they are positive early intheir infection. However, some people may not have enough virusto be detected or cause symptoms for up to 14 days after theirexposure. For that reason, people who believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 should minimize their contact with others for14 days after exposure, even if they test negative before the twofull weeks have passed. You can find a map of community testingsites here . You can also consider a telehealth visit or nurseline advice before seeking in-person care. People of color are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. They may be more likely to be exposed to the virus in essentialjobs; are more likely to have limited access to affordable health care, childcare, and transportation; are more likely to live in neighborhoods with high air pollution rates; and are more likely toface unsanitary conditions in prisons, jails, and detention centers.Due to these types of inequities, people of color face chronicdisease health disparities, leaving them with a higher risk of dyingdue to COVID-19.

DECLARATION OF RACHEL HERLIHY, M.D. T his Declaration is submitted in support of the State Defendants' opposition to Plaintiffs' renewed request for a temporar y restraining order and prelimina ry injunction (the Renewed Opposition). I. Identity of Declarant A. Background and Education 1. I am a medical doctor and the Sta te Epidemiologist with the Col orado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE). I have practiced medi cine for 14 years. 2. As the State Epidemiologist, m y duties include providing clinic al, epidemiologic, and administration leadership to the Communicable Disease Branc h of CDPHE. I collect and analyze population health data; design, implement, and evaluate evidence-based public health programs; and identify and investig ate routine and emerging pub lic health threats. 3. I have a Bachelor of Science i n Bacteriology, Medical Microbiol ogy, and Immunology from the University o f Wisconsin, a Doctor of Medicine from the University of Wisconsin Medical School, and a M aster of Public Health from th e Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 4. I completed my residen cies in preventive me dicine at the Johns Hopkins General Preventive Medicine Residency Pr ogram and an internal medicine internship at the University of Virginia Internal Medicine Resid ency Program. I am board certif ied in preventive medicine and general public health. EXHIBIT 2Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 39-2 Filed 06/12/20 Page 1 of 9 497EXHIIBT NB. Prior Experience 5. I have worked for CDPHE since November of 2011. During that tim e, I served in numerous capacities, including as the Immunizatio n Section Chief, managing the Department's Immunization Section; the Deputy Director and Director for the Department's Division of Disease Control and Environmental Epidemiolo gy; and now as the State Epidemiologist. 6. I also worked for the Utah Depar tment of Health where I served as the Assistant Manager of the Communicable Disease Epidemiology Program and ev entually as the Deputy State Epidemiologist. 7. I was also the Deputy Director for the Department of Defense's Infectious Disease Clinical Research Progr am and Assistant Professor of Pr eventive Medicine at the Uniformed Services Univers ity of Health Sciences. 8. Finally, I was an Embassy Scien ce Fellow at the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane, Laos where I participated in various avian/pandemic influence prepar edness and response activities. As a Fellow, I investigated a n outbreak of Hepatitis A in a rur al Lao community. II. COVID-19 A. COVID-19 is a serious disease. 9. COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus, called severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2, which is abbreviated as SARS-CoV-2. Symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breath ing. 10. Most individuals recover fro m COVID-19 by resting, drinking plenty of liquids, and taking pain and fever-reducing medications. But the illness can be severe and require hospitalization. Approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases are mild, not requiring hospitalization. An additional 15% of COVID-19 cases are severe, requiring hospi talization, and another 5% of cases are critical, which requires artificial ventilation. 11. In Colorado, five out of ten hospitalizations, and nine out of ten COVID-19 deaths have occurred in those ove r the age of 60. The risk of d eath from COVID-19 increases with age. Recent data shows t hat 20% of those 65 to 74 died fro m COVID-19 infection. That rate increases to 41% f or those old than 85. B. COVID-19 is widespread. 12. As of June 11, 2020, there are 28,647 known cases of COVID-19 i n Colorado. It is estimated that about 170,000 C oloradans are or have been infected with COVID-19. Availability of COVID-19 tes ting is increasing, but undertestin g and underreporting continue to occur. 13. At the present time, and on any given day, an estimated 1 in 30 0 Coloradoans are contagious with COVID-19. 14. As of June 11, 2020, 5,057 Coloradans have been hospitalized and 1,339 Coloradans have died from COVID-19. 15. As of June11, 2020, 60 counties in Col orado have reported cases of COVID-19. EXHIBIT 2Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 39-2 Filed 06/12/20 Page 2 of 9 49816. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have reported cases of COVID-19, and they all have reported community spread of COVID-19. Community spread means the disease is spreading without being able to id entify the source of the infe ction. 17. As of June 11, 2020, the World Health Organization reports abou t 7.1 million cases globally, and 408,025 deaths. 18. Nearly every country in the wo rld has reported cases of COVID-1 9. 19. During the time that Stay at Hom e was in place, the evidence indicates that social distancing reduced the exponentia l growth of COVID-19 cases in the state. Over the period of March 26-April 7, 2020, COVID-19 cas e growth averaged 300-400 per day, a linear growth rather than the expected exponential growth seen in a pandemic. 20. Modeling by the University of Colorado estimates that social co ntacts decreased by 52% after the first phase of s ocial distanci ng orders, imple mented March 13-23, 2020. During the Stay at Home phase, decrease s in social distancing of 80% w ere achieved. C. COVID-19 in Weld County. 21. The incidence of COVID-19 infec tion in Weld County is 837 cases per 100,000 population. 22. The incidence of COVID-19 infec tion in the State of Colorado ov erall is 497 cases per 100,000 population. 23. This map shows the inciden ce of COVID-19 by county over the pas t two weeks. This information demonstrates the recent burden of disease and strain on the healthcare system: EXHIBIT 2Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 39-2 Filed 06/12/20 Page 3 of 9 49924. As this data shows, the current burden of disease in Weld Count y is higher than in most other counties in the rest of state 25. This means that someone in Weld County would be more likely to acquire COVID-19 infection than in othe r counties in Colorado. 26. Colorado currently has a variance process through which countie s can ask to relax various aspects of the Safer at Home orders. The level at which a house of worship can open depends on the disease burden in the county requesting the vari ance. Based on the current disease burden in Weld Count y, houses of worship would be able to open with a cap of 50 congregants if they met all othe r requirements in the variance process, and if the variance was approved. Weld County has not r equested a variance. D. COVID-19 is highly contagious. 27. Information from the ongoing C OVID-19 pandemic suggests that this virus is spreading more efficiently than influenza. Current data estimat es that COVID-19 is nearly twice as contagious as the seasonal flu. On average, without control measures in place, each infected person may infect 3 other people. A single infected individual can result in t he infection of 81 other people in the span of 3 weeks. 28. COVID-19 is primarily spread by sma ll droplets, such as those produced when someone coughs or sneezes. COVI D-19 may also spread when an ind ividual touches their face after touching a contaminated surface. 29. Infected individuals are contagi ous before they become symptoma tic and can spread infection in the two days before they become ill. Additi onally, some ind ividuals never become symptomatic. This makes it difficult for public health o fficials to conduct contact-tracing or to isolate the infected. Curre ntly, 35% of infections are es timated to be asymptomatic. Current data also suggests that 40% of transmission occurs before symptom onset. E. Epidemiological non-pharma ceutical interventions. 30. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are actions, apart from getting vaccinated and taking medicine, t hat people and communities can take to help slow the spread of illnesses like COVID-19. 31. Traditional NPIs include: soci al distancing; temporary closings of child care centers, schools, places of wors hip, sporting events, concerts, festivals, conferences, and other settings where people gather; c ontact tracing to determine the source of infectious outbreaks; isolation and quarantine of those infected or suspected of bein g infected; and other daily measures such as wearing masks and gloves in public, washing yo ur hands often, and disinfecting work spaces and other highly trafficked areas. 32. Social distancing is intended t o deliberately increase the phys ical space between people to reduce the spread of infectious diseases. 33. The goal of social distancing is to prevent a surge of infected individuals seeking medical care. A large surge in the number of persons with serio us infections can compromise the ability of the healthcare system to deliver necessary healthcar e to the public. If the healthcare system is overrun, the disease wi ll become more fatal and cause more deaths because fewer EXHIBIT 2Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 39-2 Filed 06/12/20 Page 4 of 9 500individuals will be able to obtain the care they need. Once the healthcare system is overrun, deaths from non-COVID-19 causes will also increase because fewe r individuals wi ll be able to obtain care for all conditions. 34. Evidence from previous pandemi cs, such as the 1918-1919 influen za pandemic, indicates that NPIs, like soci al distancing, can mitigate the c onsequences of a pandemic. This includes reducing the t otal number of deaths. 35. The strategy for the Stay at Hom e and Safer at Home orders was to implement these traditional NPIs to contai n the outbreak a nd prevent further infection spread. Based on available data, this included t emporary closing and reopening certain settings where people gather. 36. CDPHE has engaged in modeling to determine what interventions m ake the most sense at each stage of the pandemic response. Those models state that our communities must achieve 65% social distancing. This means that we must reduce t he average number of contacts between Coloradoans by 65%. To achieve this goal, we can have s ome interactions, but must limit or reduce others, in order to avoid overwhelming the healthcare system. 37. There is a finite amount of so cial interaction that can happen while still staying at or below 65% social distancing, a nd preventing the healthcare s ystem from being overrun. Policy makers must decide how to ease re strictions while maintaining 6 5% social distancing. 38. The goals for implementing these strategies are to slow down th e spread of the virus so that we don't exceed hospital capacity and run out of ventilators, get kids back into school in the fall, and prevent ha ving to return to Stay at Hom e. 39. Part of the Safer at Home strate gy is to make gradual changes a nd then evaluate data to see how those changes are affecting the spread of the v irus. Changes are more frequent in this phase than they were in Stay at Home. 40. At this time, monitoring diseas e burden and sur veillance data i s constant, and adjustments and reopenings are driven by changes in that data. III. Houses of Worship in Colorado A. Unique factors for houses of worship. 41. There have been identified outbr eaks that have occurred in hou ses of worship and similar settings, both inside a nd outside of the United States. Houses of worship are a setting within which transmission of COVID-19 is known to occur. 42. One unique aspect of houses of wor ship is that there is signifi cant mixing of people from different age groups within this setting. 43. There is data from th e time and contact survey that is conducte d nationally. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Am erican T ime Use Survey (http: //bls.gov/tus/) survey shows that a substantial amount of contact that older adults have with younger children occurs on Sundays in house of worship setti ngs. This means that there is a significant proportion of intergenerational mixi ng in these settings. EXHIBIT 2Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 39-2 Filed 06/12/20 Page 5 of 9 50144. Young children and young adults are much more likely than older adults to have asymptomatic infection. The probability of symptoms in those ag ed 0 to 29 is 18%, which means that approximately 80% of thos e under 30 are asymptomatic. 45. Because those younger individuals wouldn't necessarily be showing symptoms, the individuals or their parents would not know to stay home an d not go to a house of worship. 46. In addition, these asymptomatic i ndividuals cannot be identifie d in screening by the houses of worship themselves. 47. In other words, it is nearly im possible for a house of worship to identify an asymptomatic individual infect ed with COVID-19 and subsequently prevent that individual from attending a religious service. 48. Asymptomatic infection also mak es contact tracing very difficul t, because people cannot readily identify the source of their infection if their source was asymptomatic. 49. Because of the significant mixing that occurs in worship settin gs, there is a high potential for very vulnerable indi viduals, particularly those o ver 60, to mix with younger individuals and potentia lly be exposed to COVID-19. 50. Customs in houses of worship may also result in increased contact. For example, shaking hands, observing Euchari st, passing a basket, or showing a sign of the peace may all place people in closer contact then they would be in other sett ings. 51. These customs, where observed, i ncrease risk of transmission of COVID-19. 52. Singing has also been demonstrated as a route of transmission. Choirs and other singing in houses of worship have been identified as a source o f infection and transmission. 53. Typically, the risk of transmissi on increases the longer that y ou are in contact with someone. 54. In a grocery store, hardware sto re, or similar setting, individ uals have contact with one another transiently. 55. By contrast, individuals in a school, house of worship, or othe r assembly hall, are in contact with one another for an extended period of time. Tha t extended period of time in contact results in an incr eased risk of transmission. 56. Occupancy data shows that houses of worship and other types of assembly spaces tends to have higher occupancy l imits than other types of setti ngs. Fire codes permit a higher density of occupancy in these se ttings. Houses of worship are s ettings where more individuals tend to congregate than in simila r settings, and for longer per iods of time. Individuals may also feel compelled or obligated to a ttend religious services in a w ay that they do not in other settings. 57. Social distancing during a wors hip service itself is not the only potential route of transmission in a house of worsh ip. C onsideration must also be given to entrances and exits, child care facilities , classrooms, bathrooms, and high touch su rfaces throughout the facility. Spacing individuals apart during the worship service will not a ddress these other routes of transmission. 58. National data (https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-st udy/age- distribution/) shows that indivi duals aged 65 or older are more likely to attend religious services EXHIBIT 2Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 39-2 Filed 06/12/20 Page 6 of 9 502at least once a week than those in other age groups. 48% of ind ividuals over the age of 65 attest that they attend a religious ser vice at least once a week versu s 27% for those between the ages of 18-19, 33% for those between 30- 49, and 38% for those between 5 0-64. This means that houses of worship are a location that m ay present a greater risk of ex posure for older, m ore vulnerable adults. 59. Many of these concerns also apply to other settings. For exampl e, movie theaters, performance theaters, sporting ev ents with spectators, concert halls, music halls, and opera halls all involve people be ing stationary, in close contact, for an e xtended duration. The disease transmission risks described a bove also apply to these other se ttings. Each of these other settings is also closed at this stage of the Safer at Home reopening. B. House of Worship Restrictions in Colorado 60. In Colorado, houses of worshi p have been permitted to operate as critical since the beginning of the pandemic r esponse though with restrictions. 61. From the first Stay at Home Publ ic Health Order, the orders hav e stated that '[h]ouses of worship may remain open, however, these institutio ns are encouraged to implement electronic platforms to conduct se rvices whenever possible to c onduct smaller (10 or fewer congregants), more frequent services to allow strict compliance with Social Distancing Requirements. 62. On June 1, 2020, the Governor issu ed Executive Order D 2020 091 , Safer at Home and in the Vast, Great Outdoors. I have reviewed Exhibit 8 to the Renewed Opposition. Exhibit 8 is a true and accurat e copy of Executive Order D 2020 091. 63. In connection with Executive Order D 2020 091, CDPHE issued Fifth Amended Public Health Order 20-28 (Fifth Amended PHO) on June 2, 2020. I have reviewed Exhibit 9 to the Renewed Opposition. Exhibit 9 is a true and accurate copy of the Fifth Amended PHO. The order was issued pursuant to the Governor's directive in Execut ive Order D 2020 091. 64. In this Fifth Amended PHO, houses of worship are allowed to ope n to 50% of the posted occupancy limit indoors not to exceed 50 people, whichever is less, while meeting the six feet physical distancing requireme nts in every direction. Any a dditional rooms in a house of worship may host up to 10 people impl ementing six feet distanci ng requirements. 65. For outdoor worship services, a hou se of worship must maintain six feet distance between non-household members and work with the appropriate loc al authority to obtain approval for the maximum numbe rs of individuals who may attend in the designated outdoor space. 66. In connection with the Fifth Amended PHO, CDPHE issued proposed guidance on houses of worship. CDPHE provi ded the public with an opportu nity to provide comments on the proposed guidance. 67. On June 4, 2020, CDPHE issued fin al guidance on houses of worsh ip. I have reviewed Exhibit 11 to the Renewed Opposition. Exhibit 11 is a true and accurate copy of CDPHE's guidance on houses of worship. 68. On June 5, 2020, CDPHE issued Sixth A mended Public Health Order 20-28 (Sixth Amended PHO). I have revie wed Exhibit 10 to the Renewed Opposition. Exhibit 10 is a EXHIBIT 2Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 39-2 Filed 06/12/20 Page 7 of 9 503true and accurate copy of the Sixt h Amended PHO. The Sixth Amen ded PHO incorporated the same restrictions on houses of worship as was implemented in th e Fifth Amended PHO. 69. Due to the unique factors asso ciated to houses of worship, this guidance is necessary to prevent the spread of infecti on during services. IV. The George Floyd Protests and Public Health 70. CDPHE recognizes racism as a threat to public health and stands with the American Public Health Associat ion which similarly recognizes racism as a public health issue. Racial inequality has made people of color more suspectable to contracting COVID-19, and ultimately, dying to the virus. Due to this inequality, people of color have limited access to affordable health care, ch ildcare, and transportation. 71. On May 28, 2020, after the death of Ge orge Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, spontaneous protests eru pted in Denver, and around the world, including at the public grounds in front of the state capitol and su rrounding area. 72. CDPHE has not encouraged people to join any protests on any sub ject matter. 73. Instead, CDPHE has issued guidance to people who choose to prot est on any matter. The guidance encourages all participants\u2014protestors, la w enforcement personnel, and members of the media\u2014to follow certain guidance to stay safer and protect themselves from COVID-19 transmission if present at the protests or demonstrations. I have reviewed Exhibit 12 to the Renewed Opposition. Exhibit 12 is a true and accurate copy of CDPHE's guidance on safely participating in protests. 74. As part of this guidance, CDPHE ha s encouraged social distancin g, wearing masks, and for everyone who par ticipates in protests, to monito r themselves for COVID-19 symptoms. These NPIs are no diffe rent than those required for o utdoor worship services. 75. CDPHE does not have statutory a uthority and is not equipped to physically intervene or restrain any prot est or other mass gathering. 76. From an epidemiological standpoin t, there is like ly a lower ris k of transmission outdoors versus indoors because the respiratory droplets primar ily responsible for spreading the disease are more likely to be qui ckly dispersed outdoors. Additionally, in outdoor environments, temperature extremes and sunli ght decrease virus survival times . V. Public Health Interventions are Still Necessary 77. Current data continues to show a be nefic ial effect from the Sta y at Home measures with the R0 below 1. This means that, on average, each infected person is infecting fewer than one additional people . This also signals that the current wave of the pandemic is decelerating or has plateaued due to the implementation of social distancing and other disease control strategies. 78. We are just beginning to have i ndication as to effects of Safer at Home; more time needed to estimate the full effe ct of the current measures with modeling. 79. We need to continue to have a grad ual reopening so that we have time for data to come in that shows the effect those reopenings are having. The goal of the gradual reopenings is EXHIBIT 2Case 1:20-cv-01480-RM-MEH Document 39-2 Filed 06/12/20 Page 8 of 9 504to prevent the pandemi c from accelerating aga in, prevent exceed ing hospital capacity and running out of ventilators, get kids back to school in the fall, and avoid having to return to a Stay at Home model. 80. Future disease burden depends on degree of distancing maintained in the coming months and the extent to which ol der people maintain greater di stancing. 81. Absent use of all strategies , Colorado could face a second peak by late summer. * * * I declare under penalty of perj ury that the foregoing is true a nd correct.
