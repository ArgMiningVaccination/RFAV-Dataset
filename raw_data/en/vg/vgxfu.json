Haller, a 13-year-old male who enjoys outdoor activities such as skateboarding. No previous medical history and there are no known allergies. Terrance had a skateboarding accident where there were multiple lacerations and contusions. The wound on his forearm extending to his elbow was slow healing and therefore became pus producing. The patient has since returned to his primary care physician to find out what is going on. A world called Pluton, where there is gender discrimination and females are superior to the males. Growing the population is Pluton's main purpose. Herein, having the ability to give birth is power, thus females are dominant creatures as they are created with a womb which is able to carry an infant for thirty-six weeks. The only 'capability' that men have is the ability of passing the sperm on to the female to bore a child. The superiority of the female is felt strongly at the workplace, home and community at large. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is normally found in living intestine of humans and animals. A bacterium that are harmless and is important to the health of the human's intestinal tract. The intestinal tract is part of the digestive system; having varies of sizes of intestine that transport the food in order to absorb the nutrients and expel the waste. However, some E. coli are pathogenic, causing illness to the host such as diarrhea or harm the outside of the intestinal tract. The host can be effected by the consumption of contaminated water or food, or having contact with the animals or people. \"The discovery of penicillin not only revolutionized medicine, but changed the world\" (\"Penicillin\"). Penicillin was the first in a class of drugs called antibiotics. The introduction of penicillin ended centuries of failure to cure infections (\"Penicillin\"). Alexander Fleming is, amongst others, the most notable founder of penicillin. During his summer vacation, Fleming went to his trial lab at Saint Mary's Hospital to check on some of his ongoing projects. While he was there, he observed something strange in one of his petri dishes, where he was growing staphylococcus bacteria. A spore of mold had fallen into the dish, and the bacteria near the mold had been broken down (\"Penicillin\"). This mold's Everyone has a passion that they enjoy. But what if that passion you love and thrive was taken away? Anthony Luna, a sophomore at Manchester Regional High School, has faced having to give up his passion, but will try and overcome anything to get back to it. Although the nature of this kind experiment was unable to provide us with numerical data, our graph was constructed using the average percent of E. Coli killed for each pair of cultures. To determine these percents for each substance we used the process of elimination. We put the two petri dishes side by side and used a checklist ranging from 1-100% to narrow down the possibilities. After obtaining a small range of possible percents, we made an estimate to determine the percent. After doing this for both the of cultures for that pair we averaged the two numbers. We repeated this for all of the culture pairs in our experiment. Maggot therapy isn't ones first thought for wound care, but it is becoming more accepted to treat wounds caused by diabetes and trauma. Taking a brief look back at the history of maggot therapy one can explain why it's steadily reemerging, what makes it a useful tool, and why we should educate patients on this wound care option. When you live life in our utopia, Illeonia, the power to speak your mind is in your hands. We do not want a strong bureaucracy that controls our place, we want you! We as democratic socialists believe our society and economy should be in the hands of the people, because without them, our society would fall into the wrong hands, thus leading to the destruction of our world. We think it's beneficial for people who are affected by the choices we make to be in control, so we can live harmoniously and can avoid having bad blood .This will lead to the freedom and ecstasy that many human beings desire. So, come to Illeonia for the freedom and happiness you deserve! Why is chemical research so difficult to get the right chemical or the right reaction? Drugs were an important part of medicine. There were two important drugs from the 17th and 18th century. One was cinchona bark from a plant in Peru that was used for malaria. Cinchona bark may be the first drug used to cure a specific disease. The other drug was digitalis, made from the foxglove plant, which was purified by William Withering and used to treat a swelling of the body, which could be caused by many different kinds of illnesses (46). Good and bad bacteria exist in our environment, depending on which one enters the body the immune system these bacteria can either compromise or aid the immune system's illness fighting capabilities. In class we learned that the skin aids in fighting infection by acting as a protective barrier. In addition, we discussed how normal flora is found on the skin and aids in the defense mechanism because it fights off potential threats by competing with them. The normal flora consists of microorganisms such as protozoa, fungi and bacteria. The normal flora will compete with the foreign bacteria for nutrients and space and has the ability to push out or starve the invader as said in class. Titan was discovered in 1655 by Dutch astronomer, Christiaan Huygens. It is named after the race of gods that used to rule the universe, before being overthrown by the Olympian Gods. It is Saturn's biggest moon, and the second biggest moon in our solar system. Scientist speculate that Titan's development imitates Earth's early years in development, with the only difference being that Titan is farther away from the sun. Sir Alexander Fleming was famous as a Biologist and Pharmacologist. Fleming was the one who discovered Penicillin, a type of antibiotics. He was born on 6 August 1881 at Lochfield, a farm near Ayrshire, Scotland. His father, Hugh Fleming and his mother, Grace Stirling Morton worked as a farmer. He lost his father when he was 7 years. (Alexander Fleming 2014) The Baryonyx was 10m long(32.8 feet) and was over 2 tons. Each claw was 6 inchs long and the long claw was 1ft long and was on the thumb. Baryonyx means heavy claw in greek. Baryonyx was discovered in 1983 by william walker. That was just some of the fact about the Baryonyx. There 's more to learn about this magnificent dinosaur and where it lived. The genus Salvia comprises about 900 species distributed all over the world and is one of the major genera belonging to Lamiaceae family (1). Salvia species have been used since ancient times for different purposes, including perfumery industry and for culinary and therapeutic applications. These plants have been traditionally employed for their cerebrovascular and cardiac benefits, anti-inflammatory, antirheumatic, antimicrobial, tranquilizing, anticancer, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective and many other medicinal properties (2-4). Numerous phytochemical and biological studies have been carried out on a number of Salvia species. Flavonoids and terpenoids are the main "}
