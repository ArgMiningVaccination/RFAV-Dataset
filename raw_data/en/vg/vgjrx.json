Information about your Protective Protocol Cases amongst double vaccinated are going up faster than the unvaccinated - this shows that the vaccination doesn't reduce transmissibility - you can still catch covid and pass it on to others. Reports suggest the vaccination may reduce the severity of symptoms, but this protection wears off after 20 weeks and becomes nearly zero by 5 to 6 months post your second jab. It is therefore vital, that we improve our own immune function and white blood cell numbers so we can all fight back against the corona virus whether you are vaccinated or not. Data from around the world shows a waning immune response to the virus and booster shots will be required regularly. At this stage, we are looking at 3 to 4 booster shots especially for the elderly and vulnerable. More will be developed and rolled out as the virus mutates and further antigen shift occurs. It is the Spike Protein that we are most concerned about - it is toxic and causes inflammation in all tissue it gets found in including the brain, ovaries, uterus, testes, prostate, heart, and lungs. This Pack you are going to use works heavily on neutralising these spike proteins and clearing them from your body. \"Recent reports have raised some scepticism as to the biologic actions of the spike protein and the types of antibodies produced. One paper reported that certain antibodies in the blood of infected patients appear to change the shape of the spike protein so as to make it more likely to bind to cells, while other papers showed that the spike protein by itself (without being part of the corona virus) can damage endothelial cells and disrupt the blood-brain barrier. These findings may be even more relevant to the pathogenesis of long-COVID syndrome that may affect as many as 50% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2. In COVID-19, a response to oxidative stress is required by increasing antioxidant enzymes. In this regard, it is known that polyphenols are natural antioxidants (along with Vitamin C, Zinc, Vitamin D and NAC) providing multiple health effects.\" Some known ingredients of concern in the Covid Injections: - Graphene Oxide - Nanoparticles - SM-102 synthetic amino lipid for nanoparticle formation - Polysorbate - Polyethylene glycol - mRNA material to produce Spike Proteins (the spikes are toxic and dangerous) - Adenovirus Vectors to produce Spike Proteins (it's the spikes that are toxic and dangerous) - Cholesterol and Sugar COVID Injection Side Effects COVID Injection Side Effects and Adverse Reactions reported to Vaccine Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) - over 100,000 reported here in Australia and over 500,000 reported to VAERS in the USA. - Myelitis - Joint pain - Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) - Myocarditis - Pericarditis - Blood clots - Endothelial damage - Neurological dysfunction - Atopy - allergic reactions to foods/airborne particles - Gut dysbiosis - Guillain Barr Syndrome - Bell's Palsy - Shingle outbreaks - Migraines and head aches - Blood shot eyes - Skin rashes/hives - Worsening mood disorders - especially depression and anger A number of these reactions occur within the first 2 to 4 weeks of getting the shots. Many of these conditions become chronic issues that are recognised and treated by Integrative Doctors. They are often \"hidden\" from the public and don't make it into our government statistics because they happened after the 30 days post injection. Many Doctors don't report these issues because they are told that all reactions occur in the first 48-72 hours and it they occur after that then they must be for some other reason. The Covid virus is mostly an issue where the vulnerable are at risk (those over 70 yrs. old and those with co- morbidities such as heart disease, diabetes, and overweight). The average age of death from Covid here in Australia is 84 years of age! The younger population, especially children under 18, may just get a few cold/flu symptoms which can be helped with zinc, vitamin C, herbs, Vitamin D and gain natural immunity to the virus. Many people that catch the Covid flu are asymptomatic and didn't even know they had the virus - they get the virus, their immune system fights it off, and they go on with their lives none the wiser. Vaccination Support Protocol - Focus on a whole food and anti-inflammatory diet (contact the Clinic if you need advice on food choices) - Ensure adequate fibre and water intake - Get out in the sun for 30 minutes everyday - Getting 7 to 8 hours of restful/quality sleep is imperative - Saunas have been shown to be effective in reducing adverse effects and building immunity - Breathing exercises such as Buteyko improve lung strength and resilience - Meditation and relaxation techniques boost white blood cell activity and immune response - Follow the core nutritional support protocol below. Actions and Benefits of Nutraceuticals and Phytomedicines Provided The Nutraceuticals and Herbal Medicines prescribed to you for this protocol are designed to support, improve function, protect, and strength the following areas: - Cardiovascular system/heart: this tissue has the highest concentration of ACE receptors, and the spike proteins are known to activate these and cause heart issues including micro blood clots and inflammation. (Supplements used -CardioPro, Covid Jab Herbal Formula, Vitamin D/K2, Post Vac). - Brain: micro-bleeds and clotting have been found in cerebral tissue. There is continued research coming out indicating damage to the brain and accelerated dementia risks. (Supplements used - Vitamin D/K2, Covid Jab Herbal Formula, Post Vac). - Lungs: protecting the lung tissue and mucous membranes is crucial to maintaining optimal respiratory function. (Supplements used - Covid Jab Herbal Formula, N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC), Vitamin C/Zinc (C-MAX). - Liver Detoxification: improves the clearance of metabolites, adjuvants, damaged cells, excess fluids, heavy metals and graphene oxide from the blood, lymphatics, organs, and cells. (Supplements used - Covid Jab Herbal Formula, Post Vac. - Immune Boosting: increasing the numbers and activity of white blood cells. Stimulates thymus activity. Activates T-Lymphocytes and B cell antibody production to attack and kill enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. (Supplements used - Covid Jab Herbal Formula, Vitamin C/Zinc (C-MAX), Vitamin D/K2). - Genetic/DNA Protection and Defence: improves Nrf2 defence mechanisms to protect the genes from damage. Reverse transcription of the mRNA can occur, and the mRNA messages in this novel technology do impact the epigenetics of the human body. (Supplements used - Post Vac, N-Acetyl- Cysteine (NAC), Vitamin D/K2, Covid Jab Herbal Formula). Core Covid Protection Protocol - NAC ($43.10): protection for lungs, mucous membranes, antioxidant, and neutralising of the spike proteins - CardioPro ($74.60): protection for the heart, blood, and cardiovascular system, micro-clot reduction - Covid Jab Herbal Formula (200ml $72.95 or $139.95): liver detoxifier, - C-Max ($44.90): 3 special Vitamin C's and Zinc to act as an ionophore to halt viral replication, Immune booster. - Post Vac Spray ($49.10): liver detoxification, neutralisation and removal of graphene oxide, spike proteins, heavy metals, vaccine adjuvants, restoring correct cellular electrical charge. - Vitamin D3/K2 5000iu ($39.00): cardiovascular protection, brain support, micro-clot reduction This programme to be started 1 week before the first injection and continued daily until a month after the second injection. The programme should be followed for an extra 30-60 days if any symptoms were experienced from the first or second injection to make sure the cells recover sufficiently, toxins and spike proteins have been neutralised, and no further adverse events arise. This protocol is also essential to deal with potential impacts of long covid which can affect as much as 50% of people who contract covid. We know that vaccination doesn't prevent transmission or illness and the vaccinated are just as susceptible to pick up the covid infection as those that are unvaccinated. Other Nutraceuticals available from the Clinic Russian Pine Needles, Quercetin, Mitochondrial Medicines (e.g. NAD, Resveratrol, Alpha Lipoic Acid etc). These can be prescribed for those with more severe adverse reactions as listed above or those that get long-covid symptoms and chronic fatigue.
