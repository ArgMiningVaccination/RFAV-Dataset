Searching for Satan in 2021: An Update on Satanic Ritual Abuse Claims For a number of years, I've been teaching a graduate seminar at the University of California, Irvine, titled Memory and the Law.

Science Historian Naomi Oreskes: Science Doing Fine; Rejection Is Due to Ideology, Not Distrust Science is alive and thriving, thank you, and so assertions of its impending demise are noticeably premature.

Those were the two key themes of science ...This article is available for free to all. 'Dawkins Effect'? Celebrity Scientists and Evolution Acceptance Can famous celebrity scientists help shape the public's view on evolution? And how do public perceptions about them change that?

Hidden in Plain Sight: Discovering the Bigfoot Bear In memory of Michael Dennett As what some would call a skeptical cryptozoologist, I prefer to think of myself as a paranatural naturalist\u2014one who first considers allegedly paranatural/paranormal entities as hypothetically natural creatures, then seeks to identify them. Here I focus on North America's hairy man-beast. Sasquatch or Bigfoot, long presumed to be a ...

Secrets of Psychic Surgery Q: I know that skeptical explanations for so-called \"psychic surgery\" involve sleight of hand, making blood and tissue appear on a patient, but how much blood could one successfully palm in the hand for such an act?

Letters - Vol. 46, no. 1 Examining Academic Relativists As a professor of rhetoric, I read Sven Ove Hansson's article (\"The Hidden Connection between Academic Relativists and Science Denial,\" September/October 2021) with great interest.

There's been some strange paradigm shifts among the educated classes of the Western world lately concerning gender.

The 'True' Story behind The Entity: Untangling Hollywood Horror The 1970s were a heyday for blockbuster horror films and franchises, including Alien, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Phantasm, Carrie, and many more.

A Design for a Definitive Experiment to Test Homeopathy You may bend over backward to defend your pet \"alternative\" remedy\u2014herbal medicines, acupuncture, Chinese traditional medicine, tribal witchdoctor cures\u2014whatever it is.

Hyped Hollywood Horrors (and Real Ones as Well) Skeptical sniffing at the seeming silliness of lowbrow topics such as Bigfoot, UFOs, or conspiracy theories is neither wise nor productive.
