The abundant practical experiences and classical medical theories in ancient China show that TCM not only studies the diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of diseases but also focuses on prevention before disease onset and rehabilitation after therapy.These factors are characterized by the application of treatment methods, including prescription, acupuncture, and moxibustion. By comparison, western medicine utilizes modern instruments and standardized index analytical tools to evaluate diseases and performquantitative and qualitative research in biological mor- phology and local positioning of life and disease. Therefore, TCM and western medicine are two different medical systems with respective advantages. Challenges in the post-genome era In post-genomic era, international research has shiftedfocus from single gene rare disorders to polygenic complex disorders, such as hypertension and hyperlipi-demia. Microscopically, complex diseases are caused by abnormalities of multiple components, including different genes, cells, and tissues. Macroscopically, complex diseases are related to the integrity of these components at a whole body level. Hence, differentcomponents constitute a complete and distinctive individual, which requires individualized treatment. Furthermore, current medical development faces chal-lenges with the rapid emergence of scienti c innovation and data.Neither TCM nor western medicine is sufcient to address these challenges TCM and western medicine are different medical systems. These categories are distinguished from each other in terms of many aspects, including theories, clinics, and basic research. In TCM, (1) researchers are adept in quoting scriptures; (2) TCM also focuses on the concept of holism at a macroscopic level and (3) applies the theory of Yin-Yang and Five Elements. Furthermore,(4) TCM focuses on the interactions between doctors (subjects) and patients (objects) and considers a human as a combination of \"xing \"(form) and \"shen\" (spirit). In addition, (5) \"sizhen \"(four techniques of diagnosis, i.e., inspection, auscultation-olfaction, inquiry, and palpa-tion) and \"bagang \"(eight guiding principles, i.e., yin and yang, cold and heat, exterior and interior, de ciency and excess) are applied in TCM. Moreover, (6) TCM is adapted to the experimental paradigm of nonlinear dynamics. By contrast, western medicine (1) is appliedin strict accordance with experiments and measurement verications. (2) Western medicine also focuses on the concept of reductionism at a microscopic level and(3) emphasizes microscopic substances, such as molecules and cells. Considering western medicine,(4) doctors (subjects) analyze problems of patients (objects) by using standard and routine methods, (5) modern instruments, and standardized indices.Western medicine also (6) follows a paradigm of random control experiments. TCM focuses on the macroscopic homeostasis of the body and explains \"what \"life is. By comparison, western medicine explores the microscopic details of life and disease processes; western medicine also discusses \"why \"a speci c process happens. These two medical systems exhibit distinct advantages and can be appliedto solve problems at their own features and strong points.EDITORIAL Correspondence: liudp@pumc.edu.cnFront. Med. 2014, 8(3): 268 -271 DOI 10.1007/s11684-014-0369-4In clinical applications, TCM can be effectively used in syndrome differentiation and treatments with compound compositions and synergy; western medicine can be effectively employed in disease differentiation and is good at applications of instruments and indices. In basic research, TCM focuses on comprehensive studies involving the whole body whereas western medicineemphasizes natural details. In drug development, TCM is effectively used for multiple drug targets to some degree; by comparison, western medicine is effectively applied for speci c targets and clear effects. However, separating their respective advantages fails to yield great outcomes. The new era demands for all-directional, three- dimensional, and multi-perspective work. Neither TCM nor western medicine is suf cient to manage the challenges. An in-depth integration of these two medical systems accounts for their great potential to provide maximum bene ts because a whole system is greater than the sum of its parts to some extent. Excavation of the Lingqu Canal for an in-depth integration of TCM and westernmedicine to manage the challenges Excavation of the Lingqu Canal to manage the challenges The integration of TCM and western medicine deals with \"how \"to address the challenges in the post-genome era, that is, how should researchers grasp opportunities to develop medicine in the new era. However, the mechanism by which we can integrate these two medical systems is yet to be determined. In this regard,can we learn from the Xing' an Lingqu Canal? The Lingqu Canal is located in Xing 'an County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. This canal is connected to the Hsiang River (Yangtze tributary) and the Lijiang River (Zhujiang tributary) to link the two majorsouthern river systems (Yangtze and Zhujiang rivers). Similar to the two river systems, the two medical systems (TCM and western medicine) are associated with each other in terms of their perspective thought patterns and application potentials; thus, these systemsshould be connected by a tool similar to the Lingqu Canal. Systems biomedicine can be used to excavate the Lingqu Canal between TCM and western medicine. The concept of systems biology was initially proposed byHood at the beginning of the 21st century when the Human Genome Project was almost completed. In systems biology, the concept of systems is applied tostudy all biological components and factors [1]. For example, systems biomedicine is a speci c applicationof systems biology in the elds of medicine and pharmacy. Furthermore, systems biomedicine encom- passes all components of a biological system under certain conditions in which several methods, such as bioinformatics, are employed to reveal the complex interactions of these components and factors. Systems biomedicine also advocates all-directional, three-dimen-sional, and multi-perspective studies on whole life and disease processes, in which subjects (doctors/research- ers) treat objects (patients/participants) individually [2]. The Xing' an Lingqu Canal simultaneously and tact- fully considers not only distance but also water potentialof the two river systems. Likewise, the development of systems biomedicine cannot be accomplished in an action or by individual effort; instead, this development requires cooperation in many aspects, including TCM and western medicine. Given that these two medicalsystems have their respective advantages, these systems should be integrated in-depth to cope with challenges in the new era. However, respective advantages cannot be easily identi ed and joint points cannot be accurately deter- mined. As life science is a complicated eld of study, it is inappropriate to assess the strengths of TCM andwestern medicine simply or summarily. Based on the concepts of individualization and dynamics of TCM, the two medical systems show different advantages in different parts, processes, or levels. Therefore, we should analyze their \"potential energy \"advantages from multiple angles to determine the joint point elaborately. These advantages are then guided in terms of their general trends to build a fluent canal to transform \"potential energy \"into \"kinetic energy \" smoothly. Integrating TCM and western medicine at both macroscopic and microscopic levels This paper discusses issues from clinical studies to basic research. For example, patients with either hypertension or hyperlipidemia can be treated with either TCM or western medicine, but patients with both diseases are thorny to be cured with only one medicine. Previous advantages of TCM and western medicineshould be considered to develop medicine in the new era at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. Now mass spectrometry and other integrated techniques can be applied to facilitate lipidomics and detect and characterize lipids and biosynthetic enzymes compre-hensively. In the new era, this development helps elucidate diverse biological roles of lipids and provides the foundation of an in-depth integration of TCM and western medicine [3].Jia-Hua Qu et al. 269Clinical diagnosis and treatment In western medicine, which is effective at \"bianbing\" (disease differentiation), advanced medical instruments and standardized indices are used to describe andevaluate the state and degree of diseases; speci c diseases are also identi ed after diagnosis. In TCM, which focuses on \"bianzheng \"(syndrome differentia- tion), a disease is attributed to yin or yang at amacroscopic level, particularly to the profound relation-ships of opposition of yin-yang, mutual rooting of yin- yang, waxing and waning of yin-yang, and mutual convertibility of yin-yang. In TCM, four diagnostic techniques are also applied in \"bianzheng\" and \"lunzhi \" (planning treatment according to diagnosis). Systems biomedicine excavates the Lingqu Canal to inherit the \"potential energy \"advantages of disease differentiation and syndrome differentiation. Thus, a large clinical data platform can be constructed to assess the state of an illness systematically and treat illness comprehensively. For example, neither hypertension nor hyperlipidemia has a corresponding TCM name. These two conditions are usually classi ed into the categories of dizziness and arthralgia. A syndrome in patients with both diseases is \"heart liver-yang access and liver kidney- yin de ciency \"[4] . TCM typically uses several classical prescriptions, such as Qiju Dihuang Pill for the therapy of \"nourishing yin and suppressing yang\" [5]. Qiju Dihuang Pill is composed of Gouqizi (Fructus Lycii) and Juhua (Flos Chrysanthemi), based on the famous prescription Liuwei Dihuang Pill and can delicately modify blood lipid and blood pressure [6,7]. Western medicine treatment, which alleviatessingle disease and targets certain factors, elicits a denite effect, particularly a decrease in blood pressure or blood lipid. However, illnesses are sometimes a consequence of multiple disorders that require atten- tions to the whole body. Therefore, systems biomedicine is the preferred eld. Large data platforms, standardized procedures, and complete sample data of systemsbiomedicine can provide a strong association ofChinese and western medicines to maximize their corresponding advantages. Systems biomedicine dyna- mically connects blood pressure and blood lipid, which were previously considered mutually independent, to weave a complex systematic metabolic network. Sys-tems biomedicine also encompasses genomics, parti- cularly transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data from one individual for a certain period, and reveal different medical risks in diverse molecular components and biological pathways across healthy and diseasedconditions. Furthermore, systems biomedicine com- bines the compound compositions and synergy of TCM and the targeted therapy of western medicine to administer individualized medical treatments, such asmodifying a whole lipid spectrum structure of an individual to reduce his blood pressure and blood lipidsimultaneously. Basic mechanism research TCM shows a long history and medical records offamous Chinese physicians have been collected. With the concept of holism and simple natural philosophy, as well as four traditional diagnostic techniques used in TCM, phenotypes can be observed and recorded in detail. According to \"Wuxing ( ve elements, i.e., wood, re, earth, metal, and water) Theory \"of TCM, the physical universe was composed of these ve elements. These ve elements were later used to explain various physical and pathological phenomena; for example, the ve internal organs (i.e., liver, heart, spleen, lung, and kidney) are placed in the center and diseases arepreliminarily classi ed into the ve major organ systems. In this theory, the interrelationship between generation and restriction of the ve elements is also considered. By comparison, western medicine investigates objectparticles in detail. According to the concept of reduction- ism, studies on genotypes are conducted at microscopic levels, such as molecular pathways and factor interac-tions. The purpose of systems biomedicine is to combine the advantages of TCM and western medicine and to excavate the Lingqu Canal between clinical phenotypic observation at a macroscopic level and basic genotype investigations at a microscopic level.With the help of the Lingqu Canal, studies can proceed smoothly from top to bottom, from the outside in, and at macroscopic and microscopic levels. In TCM, hypertension and hyperlipidemia are possibly attributed to \"the prosperous phlegm inside infringes upon vessels, \"which results in \"yin-yang disharmony. \" In western medicine, pathways as triacylglycerol, low-density lipopro-tein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, are studied intensively. With systems biomedicine, disease phenotypes are accurately recorded and large clinical data are used for basic research. Principal component analysis (PCA) is then adopted to analyzelipid spectrum data to construct an interactive network of internal blood pressure and blood lipid, contributing to studying metabolic mechanism. Systems biomedicine can then combine the \"Five-Element Theory \"of TCM and the \"positive and negative feedback mechanisms \"of western medicine to study homeostasis systematically. Drug research and development In TCM, life exhibits integrity and is composed of different systems and dynamic processes with various270 Capturing opportunities to initiate an in-depth integration of TCM and western medicineconditions. Therefore, Chinese drugs are distributed not only to speci c meridians but also to the whole body. On the contrary, western medicine focuses on the details of life or disease to determine a certain target for drug development. Chinese medicine and herbology treat multiple components simultaneously and hold huge potentialfor treating polygenic complex disorders. For example, a non-toxic Chinese herb called Gouqizi (Fructus Lycii), with sweet taste and peaceful property, is distributed to the liver and kidney meridians; this herb is included in the Chinese medicine prescription of Qiju Dihuang Pilland commonly used to nourish liver kidney-yin and suppress heart liver-yang [8]. Western medicine studies have revealed that Gouqizi contains betaine and atropine, which contribute to modifying blood lipid and decreasing viscosity. Therefore, Gouqizi is supposed todownregulate blood lipid and blood pressure at the same time [9]. Systems biomedicine combines the essence of TCM and western medicine to form a new system, which maximizes the advantages of both medicines and solves problems at microscopic andmacroscopic levels. Systems biomedicine also considers the body as \"holistic. \"In this eld, omics data are collected and analyzed at multiple levels and at various conditions. After combining these data, researchers can perform crossover bioinformatics analysis besides biological correlation analysis. Interactions between blood pres- sure and blood lipid are revealed, which were previouslyregarded as separate or irrelevant. Other drugs, such as Gouqizi (Fructus Lycii), which affects certain meridians and a whole body, should be developed and individua- lized drugs should be manufactured. In the new era, systems biomedicine could function as the Lingqu Canalto integrate TCM and western medicine at both macroscopic and microscopic levels, transform \"poten- tial energy \"to \"kinetic energy, \"and speed up drug development. Summary TCM and western medicine are two different medicalsystems. TCM focuses on the macroscopic home- ostasis of the body and explains \"what \"life is; by comparison, western medicine explores the microscopicdetails of life and disease processes and discusses\"why \"these processes occur. Systems biomedicine is used to excavate a Lingqu Canal to link TCM and western medicine; this eld also deal with \"how \"to manage challenges and understand life and diseasesbecause whole life and disease processes are con- sidered from all aspects by using three-dimensionalmethods and multiple points of view. In summary, several opportunities should be considered to achieve the goal that \"TCM and western medicine are linked and fused by the Lingqu Canal with systems biomedicine tocreate a new medical system. \" Compliance with ethics guidelines Jia-Hua Qu, Bing Liu, Zhu-Qin Zhang, and De-Pei Liu declare that they have no con flict of interest.
