Monday, April Corona Virus will not come near. This was my most recent [Fit Partner letter, sign up today](https://www.katesfaithandfitness.org/mailchimp-signup/) on our website! Hey fit partners! Today is a friendly reminder to walk in faith not fear. As believers in Jesus Christ we believe all the promises found in His Word! Isaiah 41:10 reads \"fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, shocked or distressed for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.\" Fear not related verses are actually found 365 times in the Bible~1 for each day! Faith is the way we respond to God. We are believers so we believe everything God says and that gives us hope! Hebrews 11:1 says \"Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.\" Faith paints a vision of what we hope for-health, peace and safety, success in our marriage, our family or our school or our career. So we can visualize a positive image about our self or our life, then we release faith with our words. So I encourage you to see yourself unaffected by this virus see your family healthy happy and whole then speak accordingly! Words like \"oh I know I am going to get this thing\" or \"I am starting to feel sick\" is not the way believers should be speaking! We speak \"I am healthy and whole today in Jesus name\" Christians everywhere should be shouting \" Corona Virus you will not come near my family and my neighborhood, get our of our country of our world in Jesus name! \" Jesus cursed the fig tree and it withered up, remember?? Amen! Remember Proverbs 18:21 says the power of life and death is in our tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit! And Numbers 14:28- (God said) \"Now tell them this: 'As surely as I live, declares the Lord, I will do to you the very things I heard you say\"! Speak life, health and wholeness today and rest in Psalm 91 and all the faith promises of God!

Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.\" NIV Philippians 4:6-7- 6 Do not be anxious or worried about anything, but in everything [every circumstance and situation] by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, continue to make your [specific] requests known to God. 7 And the peace of God [that peace which reassures the heart, that peace] which transcends all understanding, [that peace which] stands guard over your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus [is yours]. AMP John 14:27- Peace I leave with you; My [perfect] peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid.
