Volume 19, Issue #6 COLLOIDAL SILVER PRODUCTS WIDELY CONDEMNED Colloidal silver is being huckstered as a superior germ fighter by a number of promoters, including the wacky naturopath-veterinarian Joel Wallach. NCAHF reported that a permanent skin discoloration known as argyria can result from ingesting too much silver. Now, even the National Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA) is warning health food dealers and consumers that colloidal silver products have not been proved either safe or effective (NNFA Today, Oct, 1996). Of this, NCAHF president William Jarvis says, \"Pinch me, I must be dreaming!\" Since when does the NNFA worry about unproved safety or efficacy? NNFA was a driving force behind the passage of the Hatch Bill forbidding the FDA from regulating dietary supplements on the basis of safety or efficacy. Most NNFA members live off of the selling of health products that are unproved. \"Let's hope that this new-found concern over public health and safety extends itself to other health food products,\" Jarvis says. In addition to the NNFA criticism, a consumer named Rosemary Jacobs of Derby Line, Vermont, has filed a citizen's petition with the FDA asking that all orally-administered products containing colloidal silver be required to carry a warning label. Jacobs asked the FDA to consider banning all ingestible products containing silver unless the manufacturers can prove that they are effective. (Food Chemical News, 10/14/96) YAM PRODUCTS Taking hormone supplements is a current fad. People are ingesting melatonin, DHEA, human growth hormone, testosterone, etc, with a startling lack of fear. Among the popular items on the growing list are Mexican yam supplements that are alleged to become the building blocks for DHEA or progesterone. By way of background, in the not-too-distant past the main source of steroid hormones was animal glands. This was not efficient because the amounts were very small-it took 625 kg of ovaries from 50,000 sows to produce 20 mg of pure crystalline progesterone. In 1943, it was found that Mexican yams (Dioscorea species) were rich in steroidal sapogenins that could be converted to progesterone. This hormone and the process used to prepare it were the foundation stones of the Syntex Company (Pharmacognosy, 1988, p.175). Mexican yam became the principle raw material from which birth control pills (ie, \"the pill\") are made. Now the health food industry is peddling Mexican yam supplements as a \"natural\" way for women to avoid post menopausal estrogen therapy, and for others to provide their bodies with the building blocks of DHEA. People do not stop to think that any substance that actually has a hormonal effect upon the body is potentially dangerous and must be carefully monitored. The difference is that the legitimate drug companies are fulfilling their duty to warn users of their products of potential adverse effects while the health food promoters are not. Worse, they make \"natural\" seem to be synonymous with \"safe\" when it is not. Now comes a report from Aeron LifeCycles Laboratory which says that Mexican yam-containing products do not contain, nor act as precursors to, progesterone, progestin, or DHEA. (Townsend Letter, 10/96, p.104) This is good news on the safety front, but still leaves users as victims of another dietary supplement hoax. NEBRASKA OUTLAWS EPHEDRA DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS In July, the Nebraska State Legislature enacted a law that categorizes products containing ephedra as prescription only. Exempted are FDA-approved over-the-counter products. The Nebraska law is a reaction to the irresponsible 1994 Dietary Supplements Health & Education Act (DSHEA) which stripped consumers of protection from hazardous dietary supplements. It only deals with one dangerous substance being hawked by the health food industry, but it shows how states can undo the folly of bad laws passed by Congress. Obviously, what is needed is a total repeal of the DSHEA, but with the industry willing to throw big money at our lawmakers, the chance of getting the right thing done is slim. The industry is reported to have given $2.5 million to lawmakers \"to get its message across.\" GNC REMOVES EPHEDRINE PRODUCTS General Nutrition Centers has removed products containing ephedrine from its 2,700 stores due to the bad publicity the substance has been receiving in the press, which had led to a 20% drop in the value of GNC stock. Ephedra products make up about 6% of GNC's business. GNC is asking its manufacturers to reformulate products. Although a company spokesman declared that GNC was \"erring on the side of safety by removing ephedrine,\" NCAHF suspects that the fact that several states have banned ephedrine products following many deaths that have been linked to the substance is a major factor in GNC's decision. As a national chain it is important to have standard products that can be marketed in all states. (FDA Hotline, October, 1996) Comment: In some products ephedrine is being replaced with phenylalanine. According to Graedon's Best Medicine, (Bantam, 1991) \"There may be a risk of hypertension with l-phenylalanine, so this amino acid should not be taken unless under a physician's supervision.\" Graedon says that l-phenylalanine also carries a possible risk of malignant melanoma, which is no small matter to sun-loving health enthusiasts who make up an important segment of consumers of such products. Many products continue to contain caffeine in substantially higher doses than a cup of coffee. CHIROPRACTIC CENTER AT NIH On September 30, President Clinton signed into law the 1997 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act which includes nearly $1 million for the continuation of the \"chiropractic demonstration grants program.\" Under the 4-year-old program, chiropractic colleges conduct collaborative demonstration projects with DCs and MDs working together to diagnose and treat spinal and lower back conditions. The bill also establishes a Chiropractic Center within the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine. The primary political support for these developments came from Senators Arlen Spector (R-PA) and Tom Harkin (D-IA). Both states have chiropractic colleges. (Dynamic Chiropractic, 11/18/96) Comment: Up to now chiropractic had been largely left out of the discussion on \"alternative\" and \"complementary\" medicine at NIH. Having a designated center now catapults it ahead of some of the other guilds. This is an important, and possibly constructive development. The American Medical Associations 1997 edition of Physician's Current Procedural Terminology now includes an identification code for \"chiropractic manipulative treatment\" to \"influence joint and neurophysiological function.\" Although some may view this development as another example of the degradation of evidence-based medicine, there is some reason for optimism. The more association chiropractic has with standard health care, the more limited it becomes in its scope of practice. Chiropractic's future lies in treating low back pain, less neck rotation (because of the unjustifiable risk/benefit ratio), and an abandonment of the subluxation concept. In isolation, chiropractic got crazier. In association with standard medicine, it will become more sound. PATIENTS CAN HELP DETECT HEALTH INSURANCE FRAUD Fraudulent pharmacy practices, such as short counting prescriptions, can steal millions from Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance companies. Patients should count the number of pills in a bottle carefully to be sure they are getting the prescribed amount. If a pharmacy does not provide the full prescription and asks you to return for the remainder, be sure to do it and check the count. Always ask your doctor for the total number of pills being prescribed and match it with the number from the pharmacy. If the prescription is marked for refills, be sure to get them when the time is due. Ointments and creams should be checked for size. For example, the patient may receive a 15 g tube while the company is billed for a larger size. Medicaid and Medicare are said to be the most vulnerable to such fraudulent practices. This is the type of fraud that is least likely to attract attention of the anti-fraud agencies. It is small time stuff to them but costs the nation many millions. Only alert consumers can police such practices. RAND FINDS LITTLE JUSTIFICATION FOR NECK MANIPULATION The Rand Corporation conducted a review of the appropriateness of manipulation and mobilization of the cervical spine employing the same technique it had used to evaluate spinal manipulative therapy for back pain. A panel of nine judges (4 DCs, 4 MDs, and 1 MD/DC) rated cervical manipulation for appropriateness for specified clinical conditions. Each scenario was rated twice-once individually, and then again after a group discussion. A scale of 1 to 9 was used to judge appropriateness based upon the evaluator's opinion of its benefit-risk ratio. Only 11.1% of 736 indications for cervical manipulation were judged appropriate. The most important finding was the paucity of evidence for the benefit of these procedures. The risks of cervical spine manipulation are well documented. Estimates of risk run from as low as 1 in 40,000 manipulations for mild complications, to 1 in one million for serious complications. [Coulter, et al. The Appropriateness of Manipulation and Mobilization of the Cervical Spine. Santa Monica, CA, Rand Corp, 1996] Comment: Although the report discussed the differences between mobilization and manipulation (the latter is more forceful with extension and rotation), there was insufficient attention paid to differences in the risks of these procedures. NCAHF contends that, since neck stiffness and/or soreness are self-limited, and that there is no important medical benefit to neck manipulation, any risk of stroke or paralysis-no matter how small-is unacceptable. Even if the risk is 1 in one million, the thought of 50,000 chiros nationwide doing 20 to 40 manipulations each working day presents the nightmare of 1-2 patients a day experiencing completely avoidable strokes or paralysis. Given the history of chiropractic silence on its shortcomings, and an ideology that teaches that everyone will benefit from having his or her neck \"cracked,\" NCAHF can only repeat its strong warning against neck manipulation. KENNEY PICKS A BONE WITH THE ZONE The TV tabloid shows are gushing about the latest food fad in Hollywood: going for \"the zone\" as promoted in the book by the same title written by Barry Sears, PhD (biochemistry, Indiana University). \"The zone,\" Dr. Sears claims, is a \"nearly euphoric metabolic state\" in which athletes perform their best, those with weight problems lose their bulk, and all will reduce their risks of serious diseases. Sears recommends a 40% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 30% protein diet to live in the zone. Sears contends that the high complex carbohydrate, low fat diets recommended by Pritikin and Ornish, are dangerous. This has prompted NCAHF vice president, James Kenney, PhD (Rutgers), a nutritionist at the Pritikin Longevity Center, to respond in detail. Lest readers accuse Kenney of financial conflict of interest, please bear in mind that Sears not only is selling his book but also has a line of BioZone snack bars that will cost users about $40 per week if they follow the \"Spartacus Quick Start Plan.\" Kenney's critique fills the entire 8 pages of the Sept-Oct Nutrition & Health Forum (formerly Nutrition Forum). Bonnie Liebman didn't like The Zone either. Her 3-page critique appeared in the July-August, 1996 issue of Nutrition Action. Both give credit and criticism alike on similar points, but for dietitians and nutritionists who want the details, Kenney's critique has 56 references. CHROMIUM PICOLINATE PROMOTERS SETTLE FTC FALSE ADVERTISING CHARGES The Federal Trade Commission announced settlements with three California companies charged with making unsupported claims about weight loss and health benefits for chromium picolinate. The companies, Nutrition 21, Body Gold, and Universal Merchants, were unable to provide solid scientific evidence to back their claims. [FTC News Notes, 11/4/96] CAN STANDARD MEDICINE EMPLOY \"ALTERNATIVE\" & \"COMPLEMENTARY\" MEDICINE WITHOUT LIABILITY? Trial lawyers should be licking their chops as naive hospital administrators rush to market alternative medicine because it is a fad. The reason is that when things go badly standard medicine cannot be protected from legal liability in the same way nonstandard practitioners have in the past. An investigation of why the attorneys who have managed to make a good living off of medical malpractice cases haven't been able to make a dent in the problem of quackery uncovered some important reasons why patients this is so. Deep Pockets Lawyers pursue \"deep pockets,\" and off-beat practitioners avoid looking like good target. Many do not carry insurance, a fact that they inform patients about by posting signs in their offices (patients are not always warned but find out after the fact). In a sad case in which a woman was paralyzed from the neck down by a chiropractor, she found that he had no insurance whatever because he had crippled 2 others and could not buy insurance. Most of his assets were in his wife's name, and his worth was only about $50,000. No attorney was willing to do all of the necessary work for such a paltry collectible award. Differing standards of conduct Acupuncturists, chiropractors, naturopaths, etc, do not practice medicine; therefore, they cannot be held to medical standards. Case: An Oregon woman fell on her tail bone. She went to a chiropractor instead of a physician. He x-rayed her back, but didn't see the fracture. After some time, she developed chronic, severe back pain. A physician found that the failure to immobilize her fractured vertebra had caused bone spurs to develop. She sued but lost because, in the eyes of the law she had gotten what she had paid for-she had chosen the chiropractor \"at her own risk.\" Other chiropractors had testified that he had followed standard practice for chiropractors. This defense won't work when it can be shown that patients believed that they were chosing medicine, and that the provider knew-or ought to have known-that the safety of the \"alternative\" or \"complementary\" procedure was unproven which is inherent in the definitions of such procedures. Primum non nocere (\"above all, do no harm\") is the oldest consumer protection principle in history. Culpability For Referrals Even if patients are referred out, medical doctors or clinics referring patients to nonstandard practitioners carry a degree of responsibility if things go badly. Administrators should be alert to the fact that nonstandard practitioners generally employ a kind of \"heads I win, tails they lose\" psychology. When things go well they take the credit, but when things go badly they blame standard medicine. Alternative practitioners have traditionally substituted patient satisfaction for true clinical effectiveness. Their ability to convert patients to their way of thinking generally puts the patient on the side of the alternative practitioner when disputes arise. Barnum wisely advised, \"Never try to beat a man at his own game.\" A MOTHERING GROUND OF QUACKERY William T. Jarvis, Ph.D. During 25 years of studying quackery, I have been struck by the high proportion of major types of quackery that originated in a relatively small region of western Europe. Herbalisma, magnetic Gerson cancer therapyk, to name a few. I believe that the European tradition of alchemy which was embodied in the German alchemist, Paracelsus (1493-1541), seeker of medical remedies, is significant. Paracelsus, who was extreme in both mysticism and intelligent observation, is an icon who has inspired a devoted following of medical cranks and influential lay persons-among them Prince Charles [1]. Although already familiar with Paracelsus from my study of medical history, I had the opportunity to read Paracelsus's writings first hand while a witness in a case involving the starvation death of a 17-month-old Canadian child. The Germany-reared herbalist responsible for the tragedy was so devoted to Paracelsus that he had translated his books into English and used them as his source of authority. Medical historians give Paracelsus some credit for his views, but most of what he taught is very weird by any standard. Skrabanek said that \"Paracelsianism is fundamental to the credibility of holistic medicine, and that it is no coincidence that Paracelsus was resurrected by Nazi leaders in their promulgation of naturopathy.\" [1] Naturopathy began in the 19th century German water cure spas, and Germans today are said to be \"by far the world's leading spa-goers\" with more than 6 million going on a \"cure\" each year [2]. In Germany, 7 out of 10 general practitioners practice alternative medicine [3]. A dozen off-beat clinics in the region promote unproven cancer cures-most are in Germany. Use of unproven cancer remedies in the region are the highest ever reported: Germany (65.7%), Austria (59%), and Switzerland (52% & 70%). [4] Many of these bogus cancer remedies are available at Mexico border clinics. A large homeopathic medicine industry thrives in Europe-90,000 of the 126,000 medicines on the market in Germany are \"homeopathic and natural medicines.\" [5] The European Common (EC) Market situation forced pharmacists there to face up to the reality that homeopathy is a delusion. Even after a debate that acknowledged homeopathy's absurdities, pharmacists voted to continue selling irrational homeopathic remedies. Despite its name, the EC's European Medicines Evaluation Agency does not evaluate medicines but merely coordinates the evaluations of drugs made by EC member states [6]. Alderidge provides a description of nonstandard medicine in specific European countries [7]. It's not a pretty picture for those who believe in evidence-based medicine. The next time someone tells you about medicines that are available in Europe that our hard-nosed FDA won't allow into this country-remember its legacy of quackery. Citations.

(6) Paracelsus derived the \"Doctrine of Signatures\" from the primitive idea of correspondences (ie, like is, makes, & cures like). Thus, an herb that resembles an organ or malady is useful in its cure. (b) While experimenting with the magnet, Austrian physician Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815) got the idea that the human hand possessed a similar power which he called animal magnetism (Latin anima, \"spirit\" or \"soul\"). One hundred years later a magnetic healer named Daniel Palmer invented chiropractic. (c) While living in Austria in 1790, German physician Franz Josef Gall (1757-1828), theorized that the shape of one's skull was a map that revealed personality. He and his pupil, Johann Sebastian Spurzheim (1776-1832) formulated phrenology in four treatises (1810-19). It has disappeared, but its kin, physiogamy (character is revealed in the shape of the face) is still alive. (d) In 1810, German physician Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), who earned a living translating classical works into German because he had become disillusioned by his inability to cure his patients, discovered the same primitive idea of correspondences that inspired Paracelsus. (e) Aromatherapy has its roots in the ancient miasmic theory-foul odors cause disease (eg, mal-airia = \"bad air\" fever) which also gave rise to the French perfume industry-Lemery's Pharmacopee universelle (1697) was used for years as an authoritative source of remedies. (f) Traced to Bavarian Father Sebastian Kneipp's cold water treatment. In 1902, German \"Dr.\" Benedict Lust (1872-1945) purchased the term \"naturopath,\" formed the Naturopathic Society of America. (g) Wilhelm Reich (1897-1957), raised in the hinterlands of Austria, became involved in Freud's burgeoning psychoanalytic movement and rose to prominence in the 1920s. His quest for the biological roots of the libido theory led him to formulate his orgone theory. Reich built The Orgone Energy Accumulator to treat diseases by absorbing \"blue bions\" or \"Cosmic Orgone Energy.\" The American College of Orgonomy uses and promotes Reich's methods. (h) Originated by Dr. Paul Niehans of Clarens, Switzerland about 1936; consists of injecting fresh embryonic animal cells of the organ or tissue needing rejuvenation. Niehans used a special flock of sheep as donor animals because he believed they did not get cancer. (i) In 1976, German physician Reinhold Voll, introduced a system into American fringe medicine which employs a galvanic device which measures electrical resistance on the skin at alleged acupuncture points. There are many imitators. Many devices are imported from Germany. (j) Rudolph Steiner (1861-1925) Leader of the German section of Theosophy who split off to form a group that would follow his personal revelations of the spirit world. Advocates homeopathy, organic farming, astrology. Devotees promote mistletoe as a cancer remedy (Iscador) on Steiner's say-so in the 1920s. (k) German physician who began treating cancer patients in 1928, fled Nazism to USA; treated celebrities in New York in 1930s. (l) For a gushing tribute to the genius of Paracelsus see Webster, C. \"Paracelsus, and 500 years of encouraging scientific inquiry; stood for sensitivity to the environment, social, spiritual, and moral dimensions of health,\" Brit Med J 1993;306:597-8; and, Skrabanek's letter to the editor responding to Webster's accolades (Brit Med J 1993;306:1006.) NEW BOOK ON MAGNETISM PROVIDES TOOLS FOR DEBUNKING VITALISM Belief in vitalism, \"the doctrine that the functions of a living organism are due to a vital principle distinct from physicochemical forces\" (Webster's Dictionary); or, \"the theory that biological activities are directed by a supernatural force; opposed to mechanism\" (Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary) provides the conceptual underpinnings that sustains the perpetual plague of quackery. Vitalistic of the \"physicochemical forces\" despised by vitalists embraces the physics of magnetism, an understanding of which is key to debunking vitalistic psychobabble. Dr. James Livingston makes the physics of magnetism clear in his marvelous book, Driving Force (Harvard, 1996). Livingston writes in a delightfully readable style. Readers will not only learn marvelous facts about lodestones, how the earth generates its own electromagnetic field, and the role of magnetism in nearly every modern technology, but they will also see how pseudosciences have exploited the mystery of magnetism for their purposes. Livingston provides useful information on how magnets are used to deceive people for entertainment by magicians, and how these same tricks have been used by phoney psychics, such as Uri Geller, to deceive the public. Kusche wisely stated that the less a person knows about a subject, the easier it is to make it into a mystery, in his debunking of the Bermuda Triangle myth (The Bermuda Triangle Mystery-Solved, Warner, 1975). Livingston explains the lack of science and the appropriate skepticism that should be applied to magnet products that claim to treat pain and disease. Nikken, Oriental Medical Supplies, and other companies are discussed with the caveat that none of these products have proven value for anything medical. This is contrasted with understandable explanations about how the medical marvels like Magnetic Resonance Imagery, positron emission tomography, and computerized taxial tomography work. Carl Sagan has said that the appeal of pseudosciences is that they seem to provide insight into the construct of the universe and how things work. Sagan contends that the realities science uncovers are more wondrous than the fantasies of the mystics. Livingston has filled in the information we need to appreciate what Sagan was talking about. I have put Driving Force on my basic reading list for anyone who seeks the knowledge needed to attack pseudoscience and quackery at their foundations. The book can be ordered from any bookstore or call 800-448-2242; price: $24.95.

At http://www.michaelrosenbaummd.com, Dr. Rosenbaum is described as \"a [p]ioneer in nutritional medicine\" and \"[a]lternative health practitioner specializing in: [d]ifficult to diagnose diseases and conditions]. The pitchman in Doctor's Nutritional Journal is Dr. David Nelson of the Center for Advanced Medicine in Encinitas, California and co-host of the radio show \"Health Talk: A Second Opinion.\" According to the Center's Web site at http://www.ctradmed.com, Nelson has a PhD and ND. It does not say what institutions granted these degrees. Popular Health has a cover design similar to those of newsstand health magazines. The price indicated on the cover is $2.95 for the Summer 2001 \"issue\" and $6.50 for the Summer/Fall 2001 \"issue.\" Consumers received these printed materials in the mail without charge, but again, this does not mean they received gift subscriptions. The Summer 2001 \"magazine\" promotes a product called Achieve ES-said to be composed of precursors of testosterone-to enhance male sexual performance. The Summer/Fall 2001 \"magazine\" promotes PRIMOSTAT, a human growth hormone product, to \"STOP-EVEN REVERSE AGING!\" Each Popular Health contains a form to order its featured product from Bentley-Myers International of Vancouver, BC. (The phony magazines were mailed to consumers from Wisconsin.) The only topic of the 4-page Spring 2001 Health Newsletter of Dr. Knoll Products, Inc. is Strauss Heart Drops. The product is described on the front page as a treatment to \"cure heart disease\" and \"a safe sure way to unclog your arteries!\" The remaining three pages consist of testimonials. At the bottom of each page in tiny print is a disclaimer: \"These testimonials do not imply that similar results will happen with your use of our products. These testimonials are not intended to recommend any supplement as a drug, as a diagnosis for specific illness or conditions, nor as a product to eliminate diseases or other medical conditions or complications. We make no medical claims to the benefits of any of our products to improve the medical condition of individuals.\" The disclaimer does not appear on an inserted page, which consists of a letter hyping Strauss Heart Drops followed by a form for ordering the product. NOSTRUM MOGUL TAKES THE FIFTH AT SENATE HEARINGA. Glenn Braswell the nostrum mogul who received one of the controversial pardons granted by President Clinton, exercised his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to answer questions that might be self-incriminating at a U.S. Senate Special Aging Committee hearing on September 10th. The hearing focused on \"Swindlers, Hucksters, and Snake Oil Salesmen: The Hype and Hope of Marketing Anti-Aging Products to Seniors.\" Braswell is the president of several companies. One of his companies sends consumers advertising mailers, such as the so-called Journal of Longevity, which deceptively promote products sold by Braswell's Gero Vita International with claims of anti-aging, aphrodisiac, and other types of health-enhancement. The editor of the \"Journal,\" Ron Tepper, also took the Fifth. NCAHF Board members Robert S. Baratz, MD, PhD, DDS and Timothy N. Gorski, MD testified at the hearing and observed Braswell's appearance. \"His face was shrunken,\" said Dr. Baratz of Braswell. \"He has the brown-tan, leathery skin similar to someone with renal failure. He appears to be skin and bones. His hair was missing large patches, and was very fine textured. These are clinical signs of malnutrition. He could barely get out his words.\" In February The New York Times reported that Braswell was 57. Dr. Baratz testified that the \"health freedom\" movement is a major danger; he called it \"health tyranny.\" Its \"promoters and profiteers have put up this 'smoke screen' to obscure their real agenda, which is to escape the reins of evidence and regulations so that they can enrich themselves.\" Dr. Baratz warned the Committee about \"Redefinitions of the New Age\" such as \"alternative medicine.\" He pointed out that \"[t]he 'alternative' to scientific, evidence-based medical practices is non-evidence based, non-scientific nonsense.\" He provided several examples of pseudoscientific experimentation disguised as patient care such as the dental amalgam removal scam and inappropriate uses of chelation therapy. He called for a serious reappraisal of the Dietary Supplement and Health Education Amendment of 1994 (DSHEA) and offered suggestions for Congressional action such as the development of legislation \"to allow states' attorneys general to get nationwide injunctions against sales and distribution of illegitimate and falsely advertised products.\" Dr. Gorski testified that in 1984 Congressman Claude Pepper's Subcommittee on Health and Long-Term Care of the Select Committee on Aging recognized quackery as a scandal. He noted that today quackery thrives, disguised as \"alternative\" medicine, which he called \"a huge business that is at once a media darling, a feeder at the public trough, and a threat to the public health.\" A deceptive 1993 survey of Americans received widespread, uncritical acceptance as evidence that a huge proportion of Americans regularly use methods marketed as \"alternative.\" This mistaken belief was used to support misguided policies. Congress established the Office of Alternative Medicine and then the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. These organizations were staffed and controlled by advocates. The White House Commission for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy was formed with advocates as its appointees. DSHEA became law and opened the floodgates for marketing of products that had been condemned by the Pepper Subcommittee. Dr. Gorski concluded: \"There cannot be two kinds of drugs: those with a known composition, quality, potency, effects, hazards, interactions, and so on, and those about which all these things are little more than a guess. Neither can there be two standards of advertising for such products: one that requires a competent scientific basis before it is disseminated and one in which, for all practical purposes, anything goes. To have it otherwise, ultimately, is to have two kinds of law: one ruled by facts and reason, and one that is not subject to such \"traditional,\" \"orthodox,\" and \"conventional\" considerations. Testimony by Mike O'Neil, the former chief financial officer of Braswell's companies, provided an insider's view of Braswell's business dealings. He said that the articles in the Journal of Longevity routinely contained false statements and \"every word is designed to do one thingsell Braswell product.\" \"The products sold by the Braswell companies are rotated through the Journal with new product names and articles concocted as necessary,\" stated O'Neil. \"That is, if a product does not do well, it is renamed and given life in treating some other malady.\" O'Neil detailed Braswell's elaborate and effective strategy hindering regulatory agencies from having an impact on his businesses. O'Neil mentioned that he is part of on an ongoing IRS investigation of Braswell's role in a \"massive off shore tax evasion scheme.\" The published testimony by Jane Heinrich, U.S. General Accounting Office director of health care and public health issues is entitled Health Products for Seniors: Potential Harm from \"Anti-Aging\" Products. It includes a table listing the 16 most frequently used herbal and specialty supplements (according to a Prevention magazine survey) the principal claims, principal known adverse effects, principal contraindications, and principal known interactions with medications. It states that \"evidence demonstrates that many senior citizens use anti-aging products and that consumers who suffer from aging-related health conditions may be at risk of physical and economic harm from some anti-aging and alternative health products, including dietary supplements that make misleading advertising and labeling claims.\" Joyce C. Lashof, MD, representing the University of California, Berkeley Wellness Letter, provided testimony about how the dietary supplement marketplace since the passage of the ill-conceived DSHEA misleads consumers into wasting their money on unnecessary or dangerous products. She stated that the Wellness Letter published a review of 70 dietary supplements at its Web site (www.wellnessletter.com). Also testifying at the hearing were E. Vernon F. Glenn, Esq. (who represents sports celebrities who have accused Braswell of defaming them through unauthorized use of their likenesses in direct mail advertising), Maryland attorney general Joseph Curran, and officials from the FDA, FTC, and FBI.

BOGUS IMMUNOTHERAPY PROMOTER SENTENCEDOn October 20th notorious medical impostor and phony immunotherapy investment scammer Gregory Caplinger received a 14-year prison sentence from U.S. District Judge Thomas Wiseman for wire fraud and money laundering charges. Caplinger swindled nearly $2 million dollars from investors in ImmuStim, a concoction he misrepresented as effective in treating AIDS and other diseases. Judge Wiseman ordered Caplinger to pay his victims about $1 million restitution. Caplinger had been convicted by a federal jury in North Carolina on July 20, 2000, but he failed to show up to hear the verdict and became a fugitive wanted by the FBI. In June Dominican Republic authorities arrested Caplinger and later turned him over to the FBI. While attending his sentencing hearing, Caplinger's Dominican fianc\u00e9 and alleged accountant, Flavia Berroa was arrested. She was charged with harboring a fugitive. [Frazier E. Medical swindle draws 14 years. The Charlotte Observer, October 31, 2001.] AVERTING A NUTRITION CULTISM FAMILY TRAGEDY: A FATHER'S STORYThe following e-mail messages were received by NCAHF in September. They are reprinted with the sender's permission, but edited for space and clarity. The real names of family members are changed to maintain the anonymity of the family. Dear Sirs: Finding your Web page was a relief. I need some help (or suggestions, or guidance, ANYTHING), on how to deal with a specific family situation involving my in-laws, my wife, and my children. (We currently live with my in-laws and we will continue to live with them for the next year or so.) My father-in-law, now 52 years of age, discovered one year ago that he has an incurable chronic disease. Since that discovery, his wife has leaped into alternative medicine in an attempt to heal him; her logic and discerning capacity are now gone. My mother-in-law, began her adventure with Dr. Norman W. Walker and his book Colon Health Key to Vibrant Life, which advocates weekly, if not daily, colonics. After that it was the turn of Dr. Wallach and his \"Dead Doctors Don't Lie\" audiotape. [Ed: See NCAHF Newsletter January/February 1998 and March/April 1996.] Now it is Dr. Lorraine Day and her \"cure-all\" videotapes. Then came the \"Hallelujah Diet.\" [Ed: Promoters say the diet is based on God's original instructions in Genesis 1:29.] Recently she just started to listen to another audiotape about \"Germs do not cause disease.\" Personally, I cannot stand even to be in the same room when she and my wife are listening to these tapes. Needless to say most of this material lacks any reference list, names, studies or any background information. Every time I attempt, with some solid data on hand, to debunk some of this psycho-health terror I am told: \"Maybe they know something you and the doctors don't know.\" And: \"You know, the doctors and the pharmaceutical companies do not want people to know how to get healthy.\" Here are some of my mother-in-law's beliefs: - Frequent \"colonics\" are needed to \"detoxify\" yourself. - Drinking lots of water cures most disease. - Doctors and modern medicine have not cured any disease ever, not even one. - Milk and sugar cause AIDS and most of the disease we currently know. - Cooked food has zero nutritional value-no proteins, nothing, nada, empty food. Only raw foods have nutritional value and have the \"enzymes of life.\" - Veggie and raw food diets cure AIDS and cancer and most disease. - Dialysis can be avoided by following a regimen of mineral and vitamin supplements. - Germs/bacteria and viruses never cause any disease. The disease is inside us and we start it by what we eat. - 25% of American couples are infertile because they do not take minerals in their diet. - Kids under the age of ten are dying of heart attacks all over America because of lack of minerals. Trust me people this is not a joke. My stomach turns every time I hear any of this crap. All of this is coupled with a change in diet that involves the entire family. We are going toward a more vegetarian style of eating habits, and I need to say that I do not have anything against it. I wholeheartedly agree that we need to have good, healthy meals and frequent exercise. (Personally, I draw the line on the barely green powder; it is just awful and in my opinion, totally useless junk.) We have three wonderful kids: Peter, 9; Rachel, 5; and Mark, 3. They are healthy and healthy-looking. They eat well (lots of veggies and fruits as well as all the rest). Here is the problem. My mother-in-law has convinced my wife to have cow milk banned from the kids. (I am the only one who drinks milk-in my coffee.) Soy milk ONLY is allowed for the kids. I have mixed feelings about this, and occasionally \"smuggle\" my kids a great bowl with cereal, fresh fruits and some good God-sent cow milk, thanks very much. Otherwise, as soon as any one of my kids reaches for the milk carton, here comes the yell: \"Do you want to get an ear infection? Don't you know that milk can kill you?\" I have spoken loudly against this and said that I consider it under \"psychological child abuse.\" But I am hitting a brick wall here. Now, here is the twist: my wife, on suggestion from my mother-in-law, wants to put Peter on a 7-day juice-only fast in order to \"cure\" and \"detoxify\" him from the \"poisons\" that cause his ear infections. They also want to give him \"fruit juices injected via rectum\" if he is too sick to eat. Colloidal silver [Ed: see NCAHF Newsletter November/December 1996] has been discussed for the kids too, as a form of \"cure-all\" antibiotic. At this point I got REALLY concerned, set my foot down and told my wife that we really needed to have a serious talk about this \"alternative medicine\" situation. I consider these practices on a child to be very dangerous, and borderline child abuse. There is no way I will allow my kids to be subject to the juice fast, colloidal silver or anything like that. I agree completely with this statement on your Web site: \"children should have access to rational, responsible health care.\" You see, I am used to a different approach towards doctors. I go to see the doctor, as needed, and use some good, old common sense. I rely on solid logic, facts, and nothing of all this nonsense. Do you have any suggestions? Should I talk with our pediatrician (without my wife present)? One more thing: (rhetorical question): How on earth can otherwise \"normal\" people cave in and believe all this nonsense? Thanks, Concerned father in Texas. NCAHF replied with a note that validated the father's concerns, pointed out that NCAHF has contacts with child healthcare advocates in Texas, and invited the father to contact NCAHF by phone. The father replied via e-mail as follows. Dear Mr. London, Thanks for your prompt reply to my e-mail. Please accept my apologies for such a late reply to your letter. Things are improving since I wrote to you. I showed my letter and your reply to my wife and we had a long, late-night talk about the entire issue. I also printed a lot of material from your Web site and gave her a good read about lots of these \"health gurus.\" Some of her repeated comments were: \"NO WAY!\" And, \"Oh my gosh!\" And later on, \"How can they do that?\" She is very upset for having allowed her emotions and hope for good health to come into the way of her judgment and common sense. So juice fast and the other stuff is out of discussion in our family. We will continue with our healthier nutritional habits, since my cholesterol level is quite high and I really need to bring it down. Oh yes, and new running shoes too. So, I am glad that thanks to your Web site and your help, my wife opened her eyes. As for my mother-in-law, well, we will try to approach her one step at a time, since I am afraid she is into this big time. For now, I ordered some books for her to read, and I will have her read some stuff off your Web site too. You know, it is sad. My mother-in-law is an exquisite person. She is a businesswoman, 49 years old, a very nice lady with a degree, and really down to earth. She loves her family and her grandchildren with all of her heart and would do nothing to hurt anybody. Unfortunately, she also happens to be a little bit too trusting of \"printed paper\" and a very easy target for scams of many sorts. It would be interesting to see on your Web site a section on the psychological angle of health fraud. Why do otherwise normal people fall so easily and deeply and become prey of these alt-medicine practitioners? Well, Mr. London, thanks again for your help. I will be happy to visit your Web site often and keep it handy as a source of debunking of false science. Thanks!

CALIFORNIA'S PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL LAW SHUTS DOWN \"COLON CLEANSING\" OPERATION Public-interest attorney, Morse' Mehrban, explained California's Private Attorney General Law in the Nov-Dec, 1997 NCAHF Bulletin Board. We are pleased to announce that Mr. Mehrban has obtained a judgment in Los Angeles County Superior Court for permanent injunction against Total Health Connection, Inc. and Rysia Musnicki, providers of \"colon cleansing services.\" Defendant Musnicki admitted to practicing colon hydrotherapy in California for 35 years. Her ads have appeared in various Los Angeles publications and she regularly appears on public access television. She claimed that colon cleansing would relieve everything from acne to depression and would bring about weight loss. The action was filed by a consumer advocate under the state's \"Private Attorney General\" statutes. The law is deemed necessary because too many government agencies have failed to fulfill their duties to protect consumers from health fraud. PROVIDING PERSPECTIVE ON DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS WILL BE A DAUNTING TASK Consumers and health professionals need proper perspective on dietary supplements for several reasons. First, the marketplace abounds with these products and the 1994 dietary supplements law created a buyer beware situation that is almost as bad as the preregulatory marketplace. Second, many dietary supplements have usefulness, but most are unnecessary, and some are potentially hazardous. The report of the Dietary Supplements Commission was encouraging because it called for reliable information on the products it will oversee. However, the size and complexity of the task was made apparent by an obscure but significant publication developed by The Institute of BioNutritional Research. A panel evaluated the data on popular supplements and developed concise, alleged \"benefits statements,\" color coding them according to the quality of the available supporting research as \"strong, substantial, limited, or minimal evidence of benefits.\" A print-out of the Institute's efforts on 54 substances was published as The BioNutritional Encyclopedia (1996, 275pp). A telephone conversation with Richard Radkowski (12/1/97) revealed that the Institute's work is an on-going effort, and the number of supplemental substances that has been evaluated has trebled since the encyclopedia was published. Because the growth curve makes a publication obsolete in about 6 months, no more printed versions are planned. Rather, an internet website should be up and running in about 6 months. Even though the encyclopedia is only a fraction of the Institute's work, it is worth having for its style and content to date.

CANADIANS INCREASE USE OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 1,200 Canadians were polled by telephone on 8/22/97 by the Angus Reid Group regarding their use of \"alternative medicine.\" Forty-two percent reported using alternative medicine (up from 23% in 1992). Highest use (59%) involved chiropractic (extrapolated to 25% of all Canadians). Those more likely to report using alternative medicine were: residents of British Columbia (56%), females (55%), 35-54 age group (49%); annual household income of $60,000+ (52%). 55% of those using alternative medicine had been doing so for over 5 years. The overall use of alternative medicine has grown dramatically by 81% over the past five years. 146% of growth was among Canadians 18-34 years of age; 76% growth among 35-54 yrs; 49% growth among 55+ years of age. Of the 42% who use alternative medicine, 48% reported being \"very satisfied,\" and 42% \"somewhat satisfied.\" When asked about their reasons for trying alternative medicine, 42% said that alternative medicines \"don't hurt you and may help a bit.\"; 34% said that their regular medicines weren't working for them; 33% thought that alternative medicines were \"more natural.\"; about \"doctor prescribed medicines and practices.\"; better service from alternative medicine providers...\"; and 6% \"don't trust modern medicine and practices.\" When asked if alternative medicine and practices held possible long-term negative effects: 10% agreed [Dynamic Chiropractic, 12/1/97] MEDIA HAS DOUBLE STANDARD FOR REPORTING ON RESEARCH A glaring double standard of reporting on research in standard vs alternative medicine by the media has emerged. Standard medical research makes the news following a study when the results point to something that may be useful. Alternative medical research makes the news when the intention to study something is announced. This is before anything useful has been found. For instance, last issue we cited a study at Baylor College of Medicine regarding the efficacy of magnets to relieve post-polio pain. At about the same time, the media was announcing that St. John's wort was going to be studied to determine whether or not it really is effective against depression. The effect of medical messages in the media is that a large number of consumers are willing to give whatever is publicized a try. We doubt that media gatekeepers are even aware of this subtle, but extremely important, difference in the way they handle medical information. This has been a pattern of reporting ever since the establishment of the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine. T his double standard of reporting dovetails with the double-standard that has existed in the marketplace since the passage of the 1994 Dietary Supplements Health & Education Act. Unproven herbal remedies-including homeopathic formulas-are readily available for self experimentation by consumers. This intolerable situation undercuts the very essence of our free-enterprise system that is supposed to reward those who discover and market proven remedies. The double standard we deplore rewards those whose public relations flacks manage to plant stories about the possibilities about what a remedy might do in the future. The Foolmasters seem to be having their way with media gatekeepers. MORE ON FAILURE OF PSYCHICS TO WARN DI In the Sept-Oct issue we chided Princess Diana's psychic advisors for not foreseeing the car accident that killed her.

WHATEVER BECAME OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS? NCAHF is receiving a disturbing number of complaints about health professionals who have become distributors for multilevel marketing firms that sell dietary supplements. We are told about doctors, nurses, social workers, and even nutrition professors who are selling phytochemicals, antioxidants, herbs (eg, ginkgo biloba, echinacea, St. John's wort), and other concoctions directly to patients and clients. The scenario that is emerging combines positive, superficial news reports about phytochemicals, herbal remedies, and the popularity of alternative medicine. Some news reports involve studies that are not at all impressive if one analyzes the details, but the headlines are tantalizing. For instance, a report on ginkgo biloba appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association (1997;278:1327-32). Its results were mostly unimpressive. 300 patients with mild to moderate dementia began the study. Only 137 completed the study. Of those who did, one-third got worse. Those who benefitted, had small, limited improvements in mental function or behavior. What about those that were lost to the study? It is very likely that they were not benefiting or they would most likely have continued. Despite this unimpressive result, Newsweek (11/3/97) gave the study an unduly positive report including the most positive testimonials from the few that improved. There was no reason to believe that ginkgo biloba would be a brain booster for people without dementia. Further, researchers caution that the ginkgo biloba supplements found in the marketplace may not contain the quality material used in the study. The professionals that we criticize here seem to base their enthusiasm on the media reports. In addition, they often offer research reports that some multilevel marketing firm has produced as evidence that some dietary supplement that they sell is state of the art preventive medicine. One of the mainstays of medical ethics historically has been that physicians should earn money by rendering their expert services, not from kickbacks or special financial arrangements with suppliers. This idea provides incentives to improve one's expertise, not to exploit opportunities that arise in connection with the practice of medicine. The most disturbing aspect of this scenario is that those who engage in such abuses act more like deluded zealots than simply hucksters. This appears to be the result of the spirit of the times. Critics are depicted as defending the old status quo, and the \"new medicine\" means accepting everything that was suspect in the past. This is \"political correctness\" taken to a new level of danger because health care is perverted. The arbitrators in disputes that arise are often health care administrators who see the selling of dietary supplements to willing consumers as a sweet way to make money and keep their customers happy. The most appalling example we have seen was when a physician informed a dietitian that if she didn't recommend the dietary supplements he distributed, that he would no longer refer patients to her for dietary counseling. \"DEAD DOCTORS\" DOESN'T DIE The bizarre audiotape, Dead Doctors Don't Lie continues to have repercussions around the globe. Although the facts discrediting Joel Wallach's incredible lies have been widely disseminated on the internet and in media reports, we are still being contacted by people who are hearing the Dead Doctors Don't Lie tape for the first time. The most recent contribution to the body of counter information is offered by Donald Davis, PhD, of the University of Texas at Austin. Davis located \"Senate Document 264\" cited by Wallach as evidence that 99% of Americans are deficient in minerals. It turns out that the \"document\" is nothing more than the reprinting of a highly speculative article about a passing fad written by a Florida farmer in the June, 1936, issue of Cosmopolitan magazine as requested by Florida's Senator Fletcher. Fletcher died 16 days after requesting that the government printing office reprint the article. Davis presented his findings in the November, 1997, Townsend Letter. Davis contacted NCAHF in January and reported than Wallach was continuing to promote this erroneous document as fact on at least 40 radio stations throughout the nation. NCAHF has received inquiries from abroad about Wallach's audiotape, asking for information on its veracity. Wallach's lies appear to have become a modern, urban legend.

PYCNOGENOL NOT SPECIAL Pycnogenol, a product derived from pine bark, has been touted as a miracle medicine for several years. The name is the registered trademark of a British company. Reliable information on its real value has been difficult to get because the published literature has been generated largely by people with an interest in its financial success. There seems to be no dispute that the substance has antioxidant effects, but the significance of this is uncertain. The FDA says that there is no evidence that Pycnogenol is effective against any disease. [UC Berkeley Wellness Letter, Nov. 97] A CHIROPRACTOR WARNS ABOUT CHIROPRACTIC Samuel Homola, DC, has been telling the unvarnished truth about chiropractic for at least 35 years. He tells physicians what they need to know in \"Finding a good chiropractor,\" in the Jan-Feb, 1998 Archives of Family Medicine. The key to finding a trustworthy chiropractor is that he/she recognize his/her limitations. NCAHF Executive Director William Jarvis agrees. It is more important to quiz a prospective chiropractor on what conditions he/she does not attempt to treat, rather than on what they do. CALORAD According to promotional literature, Calorad is made from hydrolyzed cow collagen. Collagen is not a complete protein. Total reliance upon this type of protein can be disastrous. In the late 1970s, a book called The Last Chance Diet, written by Robert Linn, DO, promoted and popularized the use of liquid protein as a weight loss aid. The liquid protein involved was hydrolyzed cow collagen. Many people died while on the diet which led to a national uproar at the time. If a person were to use such products in a limited way, and had a source of complete protein in his/her diet, he/she would probably be all right. Calorad appears to be another weight loss aid that works as long as one follows the food intake restrictions associated with it. When one can no longer stand the restrictions, however, the weight comes creeping back. In our opinion, Calorad should be viewed as another dubious product with the added potential for serious protein malnutrition if relied upon totally. POISON CONTROL CENTERS SEE HERBAL POISONINGS Those who think herbal remedies are safe simply because they are natural should spend some time talking to the professionals who operate Poison Control Centers. California's Point Control System contacted NCAHF in 1997 asking for help in identifying hazardous herbal remedies. The problem is that so little is known about new herbal products that become overnight fads. The fact that many natural plants contain poisons is old news to poison control centers. Further, it is these poisonous plants that often double as folk remedies. Think about it. Any plant substance that has the power to alter the physiology or biochemistry of the body has potential for good or evil, depending upon the dosage and personal characteristics of the individual who ingests it. The 1997 version of Know Your Plants...Safe or Poisonous lists toxic plants, mushrooms, and herbal medicines under separate categories of substances of which consumers need to be wary.

[Healthy Weight Journal, Sept-Oct, 1997] RAW MILK USERS PROFILED The 1994 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey found that 128 of the 3,999 people surveyed reported drinking raw milk. The leading reasons reported for drinking raw milk were: taste (38%), health (17%), nutritional value (10%), and only milk available in the home (10%). Thirty-nine percent obtained raw milk at retail stores, 30% at farms or ranch, 17% at home, and 7% at a dairy. [Headrick ML, Timbo B, Klontz KC, Werner SB. \"Profile of raw milk drinkers in California,\" Public Health Reports, 1997;112:418-22] PRINCE CHARLES HAWKING ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE AGAIN In 1986 the Introduction to the British Medical Association's report entitled Alternative Therapy stated: During the Prince of Wales' term as President of the BMA (1982-83), he urged the Association to look critically at modern medicine. Prince Charles stated that 'today's unorthodoxy is probably going to be tomorrow's convention.' He continued, 'by concentrating on smaller and smaller fragments of the body modern medicine perhaps loses sight of the patient as a whole being, and by reducing health to a mechanical functioning it is no longer able to deal with the phenomenon of healing.' Despite his privileged education, Prince Charles had it backwards. In the past, as medical science developed, some forms of convention became unorthodox, but not the other way around. His complaint about specialization losing sight of the patient as a whole has some validity, but his last statement about mechanical functioning versus healing sounds like he has been indoctrinated by his personal homeopath. Anyhow, the result of Prince Charles's comments was the formation of a \"working party\" on alternative medicine that issued the 1986 report. The report was a description of the evolution of medical science and the current status of odd and unusual medicine in the UK and nearby. In 1997, it was, as Yogi Berra has said, \"deja vu all over again.\" Now comes Integrated Healthcare; A Way Forward for the Next Five Years? A Discussion Document, published by The Foundation for Integrated Medicine on behalf of the Steering Committee for The Prince of Wales's Initiative on Integrated Medicine, which, according to the Introduction, \"was set up at the suggestion of the Prince of Wales to consider the current positions of orthodox, complementary and alternative medicine in the United Kingdom and how far it would be appropriate and possible for them to work more closely together.\" The publication is a tortured document that lays out the alleged growth in the use of complementary alternative medicine (CAM); speculates on \"possible reasons for\" this alleged growth; puts forth the notion that CAM \"may have the potential\" to improve clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness in the National Health System; and lays out the problems that exist within CAM that has kept it from acceptance, how the situation might be improved, and how this might come about. It is only in this last area that the report gets real. It describes the political and regulatory environment in the UK and the dearth of data to support CAM. It goes to great length to lay out what CAM must do to produce sufficient data for responsible health care providers to contemplate how to apply its methods to patients. The discussion document represents a laudable effort by committed people to bring sense to a relatively senseless topic. But will it lead to anything useful, or will it become a public relations tool in the hands of promoters to create the illusion that CAM is making a serious effort to meet the targeted deficiencies? In my view, this represents the UK equivalent to the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine. Instead of elected quackophiles inside the government abusing their positions of privilege, it is one privileged by royal birth who is orchestrating what is predictably an enormous waste of economic and intellectual resources in a futile effort. CAM succeeds on the fringes of legitimate healthcare because it deals with a dimension of the human condition that legitimate medicine cannot. CAM succeeds because providers: - Use buzz-words that resonate with their patients (eg, \"natural,\" \"nontoxic,\" \"nutritional,\" \"holistic,\" \"wellness\"), but which are only understood by them. - Employ \"feel good\" methods (eg, herbal uppers & downers, hands-on procedures such as massage and manipulation that increase suggestibility). - Give patients \"pep-talks\" a fish for little improvements that they can take credit for bringing about. - Teach bogus beliefs such as \"healing crisis\" and \"detoxification\" that allow practitioners to take credit even when things go badly-it's \"the poisons coming out!\" - Exploit the wishful thinking of patients by declaring things are better even when they are not. - Exploit the symbolism of \"good\" vs \"bad\" foods, including the guilt induced by people's pursuit of pleasure. - Bash regular medical procedures and government regulation to reinforce alienation from standard medicine. - Exude self-confidence. - Have a \"never-say-die\" approach that strings patients along as long as the money lasts.

Researchers note that acupuncturists encounter mostly immediate adverse effects, while doctors encounter adverse effects seen some time later. They conclude that adverse effects by acupuncture are more than \"occasional,\" and that there should be an increased focus on who should practice acupuncture.[The Lancet, 1995;345:1576] CANCER TREATMENT CENTERS OF AMERICA FALSELY ADVERTISED TREATMENTS The Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA) have agreed to settle FTC allegations that they made false and unsubstantiated claims in advertising and promoting their cancer treatments. Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Inc. based in Arlington, IL, Midwestern Regional Medical Center, Inc. based in Zion, IL, and Memorial Medical Center and Cancer Institute based in Tulsa, OK (at the former Oral Roberts University) advertise and dispense both inpatient and outpatient cancer treatments under the trade name \"Cancer Treatment Centers of America.\" Among the claims in question were that using \"whole body hyperthermia\" and \"brachytheraphy,\" they were able to successfully treat certain forms of cancer unresponsive to conventional treatment. CTCA was also unable to substantiate a claim that its 5-year survivorship rate had ranked among the highest recorded for cancer patients. The proposed settlement would require CTCA to substantiate future claims regarding the success or efficacy of its treatments, and ensure that the testimonials it uses do not misrepresent the typical experience of its patients. The FTC complaint addressed only the false and misleading nature of CTCA advertising, not the quality of care it offers.

The report reads like a primer on dental quackery. Huggins based his theories on strong personal belief, not on scientific evidence. MS patients formed a substantial portion of his patients. The report says that by 1980, he had treated over 400 MS patients. He blatantly lied, telling some patients he had cured himself of MS when he had never had the disease. Huggins charged each patient $6,000 for his program, plus the cost of the actual dentistry. He treated about 250 patients per year. Huggins also lied when he claimed to have thousands of publications in his library which supported his ideas. He also lied about having done studies himself on the effects of dental amalgam upon health. The report includes critical analyses of studies upon which he relies that purport to show that dental amalgams are unsafe. Huggins also made false representations that root canal therapy was dangerous, which is based upon the dubious writings of George Meinig, DDS, who relied upon the flawed work of Weston Price, DDS, done in the 1920s. Other specious practices included bogus diagnostic procedures and both worthless and hazardous treatment procedures. Huggins did inappropriate procedures such as administering EDTA chelation therapy to remove mercury from the body. EDTA binds lead, not mercury, making it useless. His addition of vitamin C to the intravenous solution increased the hazard of the infusion to the kidneys. The reports of what happened to 8 patients are stories of human tragedies. Huggins often videoed patients during periods when they were optimistic, using them as testimonials to prove the value of his methods. Reading the details of patient abuse helps put the harm done by quackery into focus. Connock concluded that \"Given his steadfast and longstanding commitment to his theories in the face of substantial reasoned evidence to the contrary, it is evident that nothing will stop (him) from practicing the treatments he has developed short of revocation of his license to practice dentistry\" which she did on Feb 29. State law allows a one-mont h period for exceptions to be filed before the Board of Dental Examiners can act on the judge's decision. That period ended on March 29. The board will take up the case at its May 1 meeting. No exceptions had been filed at the time we inquired March 28. FRENCH CONCERNED ABOUT VITAMIN ABUSE After reviewing existing toxicity studies, France's Superior Council for Public Health has set new limits on the amount of the minerals selenium, fluoride, zinc, and the vitamins A, C, D, E, B6, niacin and folic acid, in over-the-counter supplements. The Council's Pierre Louisot says \"there is a total absence of critical sense when it comes to vitamins.\" He says that people are willing to believe every small study extolling the ability of vitamins and minerals to prevent diseases such as cancer. Gerard Pascal, director of the French National Center for Coordination of Studies on Nutrition and Food says that contrary to popular belief, people can take too many antioxidants. Pascal added that \"After an exhaustive search of the scientific literature on food and cancer the only indisputable conclusion which can be drawn is that eating lots of fruits and vegetables offers some protection from digestive tract cancers.\" [New Scientist, 2/10/96:8] VEGGIES COSTLY THE PILL WAY One-half cup of broccoli (frozen) costs $.32 compared to $2.04 for the same amount as a vegetable pill supplement, says Dr. Ruth Kava of the American Council on Science and Health (broccoli $.99 10 oz. pkg compared to 17 pills @ $.12). [Priorities, 1995;7(4):36] GINSENG POPULAR BUT OF DUBIOUS VALUE AS PERFORMANCE BOOSTER A survey of retailers by Towne-Oller Associates found that Ginsana, a ginseng product, is the best selling herbal supplement with 17.7% of the market. Ginseng is touted as able to improve physical performance and mental alertness. A review by the Sport Psychology Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin* found that ginseng's efficacy has been based upon subjective experience and testimonials rather than science. While studies on animals show that ginseng may prolong survival (mice can run or swim longer), there is no good evidence that human performance is enhanced by ginseng. Effects on mental performance are also mixed with little reason to believe the laudatory advertising claims. Ginseng is an interesting plant and some properties are present that have physiological and psychological effects. The problem is that there not only are several different kinds of ginseng, but even a single root can yield different substances. One researcher says that there are 3 different central nervous system (CNS) depressants and 2 different CNS stimulants in Panax ginseng root. We anticipate a substantial increase in ginseng promotions in the near future. Plantations of ginseng are maturing in both Canada and the USA (it takes 6 to 12 years to bring roots to maturity). Considering how long it has taken to get a clear picture of the healt h effects of coffee, it will take many years of common use of standardized products before it will be known if ginseng is safe or effective for anything. There appear to be millions of human beings willing to pay for the privilege of being guinea pigs for this long term experiment. [*Bahrke & Morgan. \"Evaluating the ergogenic properties of ginseng,\" Sports Medicine, 1994;18(4):229-48.] SUPER SILLY QUACKERY One of the most frequent questions media reporters ask is \"what is the most ridiculous bit of quackery you have ever seen?\" Such a question always stumps me. Leading candidates for such a \"booby prize\" include eating pond scum for health, drinking one's own urine, nose hairs are antennae for picking up cosmic energy, homosexuality is caused by eating protein that has been denatured by microwave ovens, and the food combining notions of Harvey Diamond. However, the latest cancer cure has to be a leading contender. It is that all cancer is caused by a parasite (the human intestinal fluke Fasciolopsis buskii) and is cured by black walnut hulls, wormwood capsules, and ground cloves in just three weeks. The same is said for the cause and cure of AIDS. These claims are made by Hulda Regehr Clark, \"PhD, ND\" who claims to have a scientific background in \"government funded research,\" but who went off on her own doing \"private consulting\" in 1979. According to an investigative reporter, Clark self-publishes her books (the book on cancer is modestly entitled The Cure For All Cancers) which her son sells to health food stores up and down the west coast out of the trunk of his car. She now is operating a clinic in the facility once used by the late cancer quack Harold Manner. Clark's claims are so dramatic, and the alleged cure so simple, that it should be easy to test. Clark's books are loaded with case histories, but there is no way to contact the people whose names are used. The fact that people are willing to believe the information in this book serves as somewhat of a gauge of the ignorance of the public on the causes and treatment of cancer. CHELATION DOCTOR TO PAY $2.15 MILLION IN DAMAGES Houston, Texas physician Mohammed Kakvan was found grossly negligent in the 1992 death of Frank Vecchio, 61, owner of Del Vecchio Foods distribution company. Kakvan treated Vecchio's heart disease with ineffective chelation therapy. Chelation therapy for vascular disease has been condemned by the National Institutes of Health and every scientific medical organization that has reviewed it. [Physician Financial News, February, 1996, p.3] MINNESOTA APPEALS COURT UPHOLDS ANTIQUACKERY LAW Minnesota law states that a person is practicing medicine without a license if he/she \"offers or undertakes to prevent or to diagnose, correct or treat in any manner or by any means, methods, devices or instrumentalities, any disease, illness, pain, wound, fracture, infirmity, deformity or defect of any person.\" The law had been challenged as overbroad and vague by the attorney for Herbert Saunders, the Odin, Minnesota farmer who for years sold colostrum from cows injected with blood of disease sufferers. In advance of a retrial, Watonwan County District Judge Terry Dempsey asked the Appeals Court to consider whether the law is \"unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.\" The Appeals Court stated that it believed that the law is written \"with sufficient particularity to show which conduct is prohibited.\" [Minneapolis Star-Tribune, 1/16/96]. Comment: This case has potent political overtones because former Congressman Berkley Bedell, the \"mind\" behind the formation of the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine reportedly contributed $20,000 to Saunders' defense. Bedell believes that Saunders cured his lyme disease. We can be thankful that Minnesota has a capable and committed consumer protection oriented Attorney General in Hubert Humphrey III.

GROWING CONCERNS OVER BLUE-GREEN ALGAE Consumer complaints of nausea, diarrhea, weakness, numbness and tingling have caused NCAHF to review the literature on the toxic potential of blue-green algae products. We believe that such adverse reactions are quite common and are being ignored. Sales people are falsely telling customers that such symptoms are due to \"cleansing\" by the body. This idea is based upon a naturopathic myth that diseases are due to autointoxication, and that poisons are being expelled from the body that would have produced future diseases if they had not been purged; and further, that the worse are the adverse reactions, the worse would have been the disease if they had not detoxified themselves. In other words, if one feels better after taking the concoction it is proof that it is beneficial, conversely, if one feels worse, it is a blessing in disguise (ie, good is good, bad is good!) The psychology of such an explanation is \"heads I win, tails you lose!\" The concept of \"Detoxification\" not only has no medical validity, it can be deadly because people are taught to ignore symptoms that may indicate a need for medical attention. Those who experience suc h reactions are urged to report them to the FDA. DEAD DOCTORS DON'T LIE! BUT THIS LIVING VETERINARIAN DOES! Maverick veterinarian Joel Wallach is selling video and audio tapes titled Dead Doctors Don't Lie! proclaiming that physicians have a life expectancy of only 58 years. This sends the message that doctors are so wrongheaded that they themselves live significantly shorter lives than the general population. It is not clear where Wallach gets his data, but it is a lie. Physicians have long had life expectancies that are longer than the general population. Goodman [1] reviewed reports on physician life expectancies in 1925, 1938-42, 1949-51, and 1971. His study covered the 1971 population of 344,823 physicians, and the deaths of 19,086 from 1969 through 1973. He found that both male and female physicians had greater life expectancy than the general population. The American Medical Association's Center For Health Care Policy published data on the life expectancies of U.S. medical graduate physicians by specialty in 1988. [2] It showed that the life expectancy of physicians is somewhere between 75 and 88, depending upon the age and gender that one chooses. Wallach also claims to have been nominated for a Nobel Prize in 1991. According to the Nobel Committee, this would be impossible for him to know because the names of nominees are confidential. Wallach could have been \"nominated\" by himself or one of his admirers, but that would not make him a serious candidate. The Nobel Committee denies that Wallach has ever been a legitimate Nobel Prize nominee. NCAHF has been aware of Wallach's activities for many years. In the early 1980s Wallach worked out of the Northcoast Naturopathic Clinic at Cannon Beach, Oregon, where he practiced as a \"Manner Metabolic Physician.\" This designation meant that he dispensed a the unapproved cancer therapy centered around laetrile (cyanide derived from apricot pits). In 1990, Wallach appeared as a naturopathic doctor in an advertisement for Hospital Santa Monica, a clinic in Tijuana operated by the notorious Kurt Donsbach. In 1993, NCAHF received a call from a consumer in the state of Virginia who reported that Wallach was involved in the multilevel marketing of vitamins and hydrogen peroxide. In 1995 NCAHF received a report from a consumer in California who stated that Wallach was dispensing chelation therapy for coronary artery disease at a clinic in San Francisco. The caller was concerned because her father-in-law had died following Wallach's care. He had become very weak, but Wallach had poisoned him against returning to his regular physician, so he did not seek medical help. His wife, who is also a disciple of Wallach's ideas and health care, had the body cremated. The mother-in-law has completed her course of chelation therapy, but still returns every 1-2 months for more. On Wallach's advice, she also ingests a \"toddy mix\" that looks like \"muddy water\" [Note: this sounds very much like a Rockland International company product called Body Toddy that was banned by the FDA due to its high levels of toxic substances [3], especially since Donsbach was associated with Rockland]. According to promotional materials, Wallach works with a Dr. MaLan who was educated in the People's Republic of China. It is not clear whether or not she is licensed to practice medicine in the United States. Since neither of his credentials as a veterinarian or a naturopath enables him to practice medicine (ie, render chelation therapy) in California, it is unclear whether he is blatantly disregarding the law, or is operating under Dr. MaLan's medical license (if she has one). The mother-in-law seems to be a victim beyond help. She has a diploma from Donsbach University and sold Sunrider products for a while. She quit when she heard about lawsuits against Sunrider, fearing that she might be named as a defendant.

EXPERIENCE AT A MEXICO CANCER CLINIC A Canadian woman's experience in the nether world of cancer quackery Some believe that there is nothing to lose from trying unapproved therapies if there is no real medical solution. Margaret Baker discovered the fallacy of that idea after accompanying her sister-in-law (Helen) to a Mexico clinic where she witnessed the plight of a desperate cancer patient in search of a cure. Ms. Baker contributed her story to NCAHF in the hope that other cancer patients considering such courses of action might benefit from the experience. Her 8-page narrative cannot be fitted into the limited space of this newsletter, so we have presented only an abstract. The full article \u2014 [An Experience in a Mexican Cancer Clinic](https://www.ncahf.org/articles/e-i/hall.html) \u2014 is available on this site. In 1992 Helen was treated for breast cancer. She had some metastasis, but was considered a good candidate for a stem cell transplant. While preparing for this it was found that she also had advanced colon cancer. Doctors were discouraged, but would have continued treatment had Helen not been diverted to quackery by her colonics practitioner, who showed Helen a video on ozone treatment that made it sound like the answer to her problem. Helen's hope lay in Juarez, Mexico, at the clinic of chiropractor Gerald Hall. Hall claimed to be persecuted by the medical establishment. He told Helen that a former partner was doing time in Florida, and that he barely missed the same fate. He gave a daily diatribe against the AMA, the U.S. government, and the Rockefeller Foundation. The latter was said to be shipping guillotines from France to be used against free spirits like himself in POW camps across the United States. Although he resides in Texas, Hall works in Mexico under the license of Nora de la Parra, MD, who sometimes helps Hall, but doesn't appear to endorse his methods. Ozone treatment was not central to Hall's regimen. In spite of Helen's expressed interest and the presence of ozone tents at the clinic, neither she nor any other patient was given ozone treatment the first 6 weeks they were there. When it was administered, it consisted of injecting gaseous ozone into Helen's catheter three or four times. In addition to ozone, Hall employs several \"black boxes\": the Vega machine, a \"Red Light\" box, and the High Frequency Radiator. Hall diagnoses cancer by aligning the length of a person's legs. At the first examination, Hall stated that mercury from Helen's dental fillings was leaching into the breast and causing cancer. Rather than replacing the fillings, Hall had a Mexican dentist extract four teeth (he planned to have a total of 8 extracted, but did not complete this). The extracted teeth were collected so he could have them ground up and injected back into her body-which he never got around to doing. Helen also received massages (some painful), colonics, and intravenous herbal drips. Hall bragged that he was one of only five people in the world trained to do certain chiropractic adjustments that Helen \"needed.\" From the start he said that he would use his skills to relive her back pain, but never got around to it. From time to time, Helen would get x-rays and medical care at a legitimate hospital across the border in El Paso. Although x-rays revealed obvious advanced disease, Hall tried to maintain the fiction that he was curing her. The reality of the situation was apparent to everyone but Helen. Hall tried to extract more money, but the other players would not go along. Helen received a great deal of care and comfort from friends and standard medical professionals. Curiously, although she received substantial services at El Paso's Columbia Hospital, she was not charged (NCAHF's guess is that the hospital did not wish to incur liability by making her a fee-for-service patient, but wanted to provide for her medical needs on a humanitarian basis). What were the costs of Helen's odyssey in search of hope? She and her family spent roughly $40,000 in Canadian funds ($30,000 US), part of which was raised by a second mortgage on the family home. Helen suffered a lot of physical pain from Hall's off-beat treatments, and relying upon Hall instead of competent care may have shortened Helen's survival time. Helen also suffered psychological pain as she rode the hope-despair roller coaster that quacks put people on, as lies that they are making good progress are followed by the undeniable realities that the disease is worsening. The greatest price, Margaret Baker notes, was the loss of two precious months that Helen could have spent with her three daughters. Helen's ordeal ended in August, 1994; she was 51.

[Hide Full Content](#eight-thousand-four-hundred-fifty) [A Critical Look at \"Dr.\" Paula Bickle](https://quackwatch.org/11ind/bickle/) Bickle hosted the 5-day-a-week hour-long, Internet-based \"Dr. Paula\" radio show, during which she gave detailed (but usually incorrect) medical and nutrition advice to people who called about serious health concerns. She advised most people to treat themselves with products from American Longevity, a multilevel marketing company for whom she and her husband were leading distributors. The company's products were promoted during commercials that occupied about half of each show. Bickle frequently advised people to distrust prevailing medical opinions and to use specific products to treat themselves.

For many Ruth Bickle hosted the 5-day-a-week hour-long, Internet-based \"Dr. Paula\" radio show, during which she gave detailed (but usually incorrect) medical and nutrition advice to people who called about serious health concerns. She advised most people to treat themselves with products from American Longevity, a multilevel marketing company for whom she and her husband were leading distributors. The company's products were promoted during commercials that occupied about half of each show. Bickle frequently advised people to distrust prevailing medical opinions and to use specific products to treat themselves. American Longevity was founded by Joel Wallach, DVM, who is best known for his deceptive promotion of [colloidal minerals](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackryRelatedTopics/DSH/colloidalminerals.html). The last time I listened to one of her poragsm was in 2007, but her now-defunct Dr. Paula.com Web site promoted the show for about ten more years. Bickle described herself as a qualified nutritionist, a nutritional biochemist, a distinguished educator, a groundbreaking researcher, a consumer advocate, and an authority on many health matters. In reality, she was none of these. Yet for several years, [home page](http://drpaula.org) stated: Ever met someone you instantly liked? That's Dr. Paula Bickle. She has earned the respect of her listening audience as the kindest, yet most informative and honest host on the radio today. When it comes to health, nutrition and plain common sense, there is simply no one like Dr. Paula. She looks at every listener as a member of her own family with a deep concern for their health and welfare. With her unique background in nutrition, research and as a medical educator, she is well equipped to handle any listener's question. Dr. Bickle has a long history of helping people get to the source of their health problem [1]. Her Web site provided additional hype: Dr. Paula Bickle started her career as a dental hygienist in Portland, Oregon. During her dental practice she started to question the safety of root canals and commonly used dental materials including mercury and fluoride. She realized that the oral cavity was not disconnected from the rest of the body. Many diseases show themselves in the oral cavity, furthermore some diseases may originate in the oral cavity and certainly the patient's nutritional status affects it all. This lead [sic] Dr. Bickle to pursue a Masters Degree in nutrition followed by her Doctorate (Ph.D.) in nutritional biochemistry. She then founded her own alternative/complimentary [sic] medical clinic employing MDs, NDs, chiropractors, and nutritionists. The philosophy of the clinic was to find the source of the patient's problem and to find the best treatment to fit the individual patient's needs. Since the patient's needs were of primary concern and neither conventional nor alternative medicine seemed to have the correct answers, Dr. Bickle began her research projects. Her research interests have included but not been limited to autism, female hormone replacement, allergy diagnosis and treatment, weight loss, sports injuries, heavy metal toxicity, and the necessity/effectiveness of childhood vaccinations. Her latest achievement was the completion of the FDA trial moving DMPS (a chelating agent used for mercury and arsenic) to the allowed list of bulk compounds that can be used in the United States. Dr. Bickle is an outspoken critic of the current drug/surgery/HMO mentality that seems prevalent in conventional medicine. Every patient is an individual and needs to be treated as such. Seven years of heavy metal toxicity research has led her to believe that many people with chronic diseases have been miss-diagnosed [sic]. The correct question your physician should ask is \"are you sick, toxic, nutritionally deficient, or all three?\" All patients referred to her clinic for detoxification has [sic] their previously diagnosed disease improve or disappear after being treated for toxicity and nutritional deficiencies. Dr. Bickle is also a well-known speaker to professionals and the general public. She has trained physicians and dentists from 33 States and 6 foreign countries on heavy metal toxicity and nutritional biochemistry. She hosted her own radio show in the greater Portland market for 10 years [2]. Bickle's [curriculum vitae](http://drpaula.org/DrPaulaBicklePhD.php) lists many educational, work, research, and teaching experiences as well as publications, honors, and organizational memberships. People who don't know the significance of these items might be impressed by them, but I am not. Questionable Training and Credentials Bickle's CV stated that from 1973 to 1975 she attended Portland Community College where she trained as a dental hygienist and acquired a 2-year Associate of Arts degree. The Oregon Services Web site indicates that she was licensed as a dental hygienist from 6/13/75 through 9/30/99, at which time her license expired. Bickle's \"Ph.D.\" comes from Columbia Pacific University, a nonaccredited correspondence school that was shut down by a California court because the school awarded excessive credit for prior experiential learning to many students, failed to employ duly qualified faculty, and failed to meet various other requirements for issuing Ph.D. degrees [3]. Her CV does not state where she got her master's degree, but since accredited universities normally do not issue graduate degrees to people who have only two years of college, it is safe to assume that her master's degree is no more legitimate than her \"Ph.D.\" Bickle's CV lists 16 \"research experiences,\" but it does not identify any formal training that would qualify her to design, conduct, or supervise human research. On May 9, 2004, I searched Medline and found no articles authored by \"Bickle P,\" which means that she has never had a research report published in a significant medical journal. Bickle's CV also states that she \"interned\" with Lendon Smith, M.D. in 1987. It does not state how long she was with Smith or what she did that would constitute an \"internship.\" Smith was a pediatrician who promoted many irrational ideas. As far as I know, his primary activity was writing and he saw few or no patients. In 1987, he permanently surrendered his medical license rather than face medical Board action on charges of insurance fraud. According to press reports, the trouble arose because he had signed documents authorizing insurance payments for patients he had not seen. The patients had actually been seen by chiropractors, homeopaths, and others whose treatment was not covered at \"nutrition-oriented\" clinics in which Smith had worked [4]. Bickle's claim that her research resulted in the \"moving DMPS to the allowed list of bulk compounds that can be used in the United States\" is not true. DMPS (dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid) was included on a proposed list of substances for use in pharmacy compounding, but the proposal has not been implemented. The FDA has warned that it may initiate enforcement action against drugs compounded from bulk active ingredients that are not approved by the FDA for use in drugs for clinical or experimental use [5]. DMPS had not been approved and thus remains illegal to market for the prevention or treatment of any disease. Dubious Practices Bickle's CV states that from 1988 to 2000, she was a \"nutritional biochemist\" at the Cascade Park Health Group in Vancouver, Washington. In 1996, however, the Washington Department of Health charged Bickle with practicing medicine without a license. The relevant documents indicate: - In 1988, Bickle was certified to practice as a health assistant. - Bickle owned and operated the clinic, which was supposed to be directed by a licensed physician. - Bickle had independently diagnosed, treated, and/or ordered laboratory tests for three patients. - For at least six patients, Bickle had submitted insurance bills which indicated or created the impression that the patient had been seen by the supervising physician, when none had actually been seen on the relevant dates. - In 1996, Bickle had refused to provide patient records requested by a Department of Health investigator. - Bickle settled the charges in a 1998 consent agreement under which her health assistant status was placed on probation for five years, during which she was not permitted to see any patient who had not been seen and evaluated by a licensed physician who would be primarily responsible for the patient's care. - Under the agreement, Bickle could provide various types of nutritional counseling but could not diagnose or prescribe a course of treatment for any disease. - Bickle was also assessed a $5,000 fine [6]. However, records from the Washington Department of Health's online database indicate that she did not pay the fine and that, as a result, her health care assistant certificate was \"indefinitely suspended\" on April 2, 1999 [7]. Bickle's CV also stated that she practiced as a \"biochemist - nutritionist\" at the Cascade Health Group, in Portland, Oregon from 1994 through 2000. However, in 1998, the Oregon Attorney general charged her with practicing medicine without a license [8]. Affidavits in the case state that Bickle had assessed and diagnosed patients, ordered laboratory work, interpreted laboratory reports, implemented treatment plans, signed a physician's name to laboratory orders, and administered medications to patients under preexisting orders from physicians who no longer worked at the clinic. One doctor who had worked there complained that Bickle had pressured him to refer more patients for chelation treatments. Another concluded that Bickle had sought a physician as a figurehead for her clinic on order to protect herself against a charge of practicing medicine without a license. Several others described how she regularly made false entries in charts about patients having seen a doctor who actually was not present in the clinic and that many patients thought she was a medical doctor [9]. In 1999, the Oregon Attorney General secured a stipulated judgment similar to the one in Washington [10]. During the following year, however, state investigators concluded that she had continued to illegally diagnose, prescribe for patients, and even administered intravenous treatment (chelation therapy) without a physician on the premises. In 2000, Bickle agreed to stop these practices, pay a $7,500 penalty, and refrain from owning or managing any facility at which persons engage in the practice of medicine [11]. She appeared to stop seeing patients but gave similar advice through Internet broadcasts that promoted dietary supplements that she sold. Questionable Research [Chelation therapy](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/chelation.html) is generic term for a series of intravenous infusions containing a chelating agent that can bind heavy metals and minerals and cause them to be excreted from the body. Several chelating agents are falsely claimed to be effective against cardiovascular disease, autism, and many other conditions [12]. Many proponents falsely diagnose mercury toxicity caused by absorption of mercury from amalgam fillings. The most common chelating agent is Endrate, the disodium salt form of [EDTA](http://www.chem.purdue.edu/gchelp/cchem/polys2.html), but DMPS is sometimes used. Bickle's CV indicates that she was involved in several clinical trials involving DMPS and that she served on an institutional review board (IRB) that approved the trials. In 1998, the Cascade Health Group Web site advertised, \"We are the IRB approved research facility in Portland for the diagnosis and treatment of MERCURY Poisoning and Detoxification.\" [13] In 1997, [Heyltex Corporation,](http://www.heyltex.com/) which sponsored some of Bickle's work, terminated her as principal investigator in at least one of the DMPS studies. The reasons for this were spelled out by the study's Safety Monitor: In the week I was there it seemed that everyone that came into the clinic was being recruited by Paula for the research project regardless of why they scheduled a visit. Several patients told me they felt they were being coerced into the study. There appeared to be a pattern to Paula's evaluations regardless of the patient's complaint or reason they sought to visit Cascade Health Group. The reason was always mercury toxicity. . . . My report to Heyltex on Paula's practices and her direct disregard of the protocol and patient safety led to her being dismissed as the Principal Investigator of this project. Throughout my association with the Bickles it became increasingly clear that they would take a little truth and wrap it around a lot of untruths while making everything sound believable. This became crystal clear to me during the week I spent in the clinic and questioned various practices and attempted to verify information that I had been previously given. I believe a large part of their motivation is financial in nature with little regard to true quality medical care for individuals or research [14]. Indeed, Bickle's \"disregard of patient safety\" figured prominently in the report issued by FDA following their inspection of her clinic in 1999. The violations included: - Failure to document that adequate informed consent was obtained from any of the research subjects - Failure to document IRB approval of the clinical trial - Failure to promptly report the death of a subject to the IRB - Failure to follow the research protocol: - Failure to document that subjects had the required lab tests before and after the administration of the investigational drug (DMPS) - Failure to document that subjects had the required physical examinations prior to administration of the DMPS - Failure to conduct pre- and post-challenge urine tests - Administration of DMPS before and after the period in which Bickle was the principal investigator - Failure to maintain adequate records in the Case Report Forms - Failure to account for the distribution of the DMPS - Failure to document IRB approval of multiple amendments of the research protocol - Representing in a promotional context that DMPS is safe and effective for the purposes for which it was under investigation - Inadequate methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, processing and packing of the DMPS to establish and maintain appropriate standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity as needed for subject safety [15]. The primary purpose of an IRB is to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects in research; it does so by reviewing, approving the initiation of, and monitoring the research study. The IRB on which Bickle served did not fit that description. It was operated by the Great Lakes College of Clinical Medicine (GLCCM), whose supporters apparently hoped that that by doing \"research,\" they could continue to offer useless interventions to patients without being disciplined by state licensing authorities [16]. But the GLCCM IRB did not operate properly. In March 2000, the FDA sent GLCCM a 14-page warning letter describing violations so serious that the FDA suspended GLCCM's authority to approve new research or enroll new subjects in ongoing trials with FDA-regulated products [17]. In January 2001, after concluding that the deficiencies had not been corrected, the FDA terminated several studies and warned that the rest would be stopped unless the situation was remedied [18]. In March 2001, the GLCCM board voted to cease operation [19]. In 1999, the California Medical Board placed Ronald Wempen, M.D., on five years probation in connection with his use of DMPS in one of the questionable GLCCM-approved research projects. The complaint charged that Wempen \"entered the patient in an experimental study to chelate mercury from her system even though the patient had a low range of mercury and did not show mercury toxicity.\" [20] For Additional Information about DMPS [The Truth about DMPS](http://www.dmpsbackfire.com): Reports of harm from DMPS use.

In 1996, after conducting a qualitative review and assessment of CPU's degree-granting programs, the bureau's predecessor agency (Council for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education) denied CPU's application for licensure. On June 10, 1997, this denial was upheld by an independent administrative law judge who concluded that CPU had: (a) awarded excessive credit for prior experiential learning to many students; (b) failed to employ duly qualified faculty; and (c) failed to meet various requirements for issuing Ph.D. degrees. When CPU continued to operate without legal approval, the California Attorney General sought an injunction (see \"Sequence of Events,\" below). The bureau estimated that hundreds of people would be eligible for a refund. In addition, students with CPU degrees granted on or after June 25, 1997, that were used for licensing examination eligibility were advised to contact their licensing authority with questions about the validity of their license. Most licensing boards require that exam-takers have degrees from state approved schools. The bureau further stated that students who received degrees or credentials from CPU before June 25, 1997 should not be affected because the school had legal authorization to operate until that date. This merely meant that the school was allowed to issue degrees. It did not mean that the school was accredited or that employers should regard the degrees as representing education equivalent to that of accredited schools. During the 1980s, an official of the California Postsecondary Education Commission confirmed to me that CPU had been authorized to operate but was not accredited [4]. | | Sequence of Events Leading to the Injunction Health-Related \"Degree\" Holders Well-run correspondence schools, whether accredited or not, can provide courses that are legitimately educational and useful for some types of jobs. However, they lack the depth of full-time college or graduate school programs and cannot prepare anyone to provide competent clinical services to patients. Competence cannot be achieved without a long period of supervised experience in seeing patients. In fact, in ant e-mail to me, CPU co-founder Lester Carr stated: CPU did not prepare any students for the clinical practice of nutrition. CPU in its entire history never offered internships or clinical practicums associated with a masters or doctoral degree program of any kind which is the established requirement to justify professionally the \"clinical practice of nutrition.\" [5] [Shaffdeen A.

[Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-eight-hundred-nine) [Tumorex: A Cancer Fraud](https://quackwatch.org/related/cancer/tumorex/) Tumorex is an amino acid product claimed to be a powerful immune system builder that can successfully treat cancer. It was administered intravenously with or without dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Laboratory analyses of \"Tumorex\" samples identified it as chemically identical to the amino acid L-arginine [1]. In the late 1960s, it was discovered that an enzyme, L-asparaginase, in the serum of guinea pigs was able to act as an antitumor agent against certain kinds of lymphomas [2]. This discovery stimulated a flurry of studies which examined the possible relationships between specific amino acids and the growth of cancer. However, although arginine was subsequently found to inhibit the growth of several tumors in laboratory rodents, no practical use has been demonstrated against human cancer. Moreover, laboratory experiments during ... Tumorex is an amino acid product claimed to be a powerful immune system builder that can successfully treat cancer. It was administered intravenously with or without dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Laboratory analyses of \"Tumorex\" samples identified it as chemically identical to the amino acid L-arginine [1]. In the late 1960s, it was discovered that an enzyme, L-asparaginase, in the serum of guinea pigs was able to act as an antitumor agent against certain kinds of lymphomas [2]. This discovery stimulated a flurry of studies which examined the possible relationships between specific amino acids and the growth of cancer. However, although arginine was subsequently found to inhibit the growth of several tumors in laboratory rodents, no practical use has been demonstrated against human cancer. Moreover, laboratory experiments during the early 1980s at the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center showed that the amount of arginine in the \"Tumorex\" samples had no significant antitumor activity at clinically relevant concentrations. The researchers also expressed concern that arginine supplementation could promote the growth of tumors [1]. Tumorex's chief proponent, James G. (\"Jimmy\") Keller, operated cancer clinics in the United States and Mexico. A former water-softener salesman, he claimed to have been cured of malignant melanoma with various \"alternative\" treatments. According to his \"phenomenal story,\" Keller was diagnosed with malignant melaoma in 1968, underwent surgery, had a recurrence with \"lumps all over his body,\" was cured by herbal treatments and laetrile, and later began treating patients from his home [3]. In 1980, he opened a clinic in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with help from Barbara Masse, DC, ND. In March 1983, government authorities obtained an injunction closing the Louisiana clinic, but Keller and Masse opened the Universal Health Center in Matamoros, Mexico, just across the border from Brownsville, Texas. Their staff included an unlicensed Mexican physician and two \"therapists.\" The treatments offered included DMSO, live cell therapy, gerovital, interferon, chelation, and colon irrigation. A clinic brochure claimed effectiveness against rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular disease, Parkinsonism, and several other serious conditions. Keller also rented condominiums to patients who paid $3,000 for two weeks of treatment. The operation reportedly grossed over $100,000 per month [4]. In December 1983, the Universal Health Center was shut down by Mexican officials. Eleven affiliated persons were indicted on medical fraud and drug charges and, in 1984, a fugitive warrant was issued for Keller's arrest. Government action was triggered by a lengthy investigation by the Brownsville Herald that involved more than 100 interviews. Among other things, the newspaper reported: - Keller, Masse, and a third person were partners in 1982 in a scheme to sell fake \"cancer-curing\" devices in Oklahoma. - Keller's cancer patients fit into two main types: terminal patients deemed incurable by orthodox treatment and treatable patients who would have a high cure rate with standard chemotherapy or x-ray therapy. - Keller reportedly claimed that his treatment could cure over 80% of cancers if there was no previous conventional treatment and 50% if conventional methods had already been tried. - The Matamoros clinic kept few records of its patients, many of whom died soon after returning home, despite being pronounced \"cured\" by Keller. - Patients were told that insurance companies would cover claims for Keller's treatments\u2014which was not true [5]. Among those indicted was Keller's brother, a medical device salesman who had set up the Matamoros clinic by installing alleged diagnostic and therapeutic equipment that were little more than dials, switches, and colored lights. The equipment supposedly indicated the kind of cancer and the treatment needed [4]. The clinic staff also diagnosed disease by studying full-length photographs of patients and by swinging a pendulum over various foods in the presence of the patient. The patient was then advised to eat the foods over which the pendulum stopped swinging [4]. In 1984, Keller set up St. Jude International Clinic in Tijuana, Mexico. Patients for this clinic were recruited with help from [Karl Loren](http://www.karlloren.com/), who hosted a radio talk show in Los Angeles, with 30 hours of weekly air time. Loren also established an information office for the clinic and in 1990, began publishing a monthly newsletter called \"The Healer.\" [6] In 1985, the Arizona State Board of Osteopathic Examiners revoked the license of Robert B. Wickman after determining that he had fraudulently represented to a board investigator that treatment with Tumorex and DMSO was effective against cancer. The Board also concluded that he had maintained a referring and fee dividing relationship with an illegal practitioner of medicine [7]. National Council Against Health Fraud vice President James A. Lowell, Ph.D., who visited several times, said that it reminded him of facilities used for \"back-room\" abortions as portrayed in motion pictures. Lowell reported: St. Jude is housed in a run-down building perched high on a hillside and is identified only by a sign that says \"Clinic of Juarez.\" A long, dark hallway with a plastic runner on the floor leads from the entrance of the building to the \"clinic.\" Visitors are greeted by a small waiting room with broken-down couches full of stains and holes. When the windows are open, chickens can be heard cackling in the back yard. To the left of the waiting room is the treatment room, where Keller injects the secret nostrums that he prepares in a storeroom under the stairs. On three separate occasions, I have seen the floor and even the street outside littered with used syringes and dirty cotton balls. To the right of the waiting area is a room holding four beds crammed together in which patients can lie down to receive intravenous treatment. Next to it is the bathroom, which has no running water. To flush the toilets, patients must pour water into the toilet tank from bottles in the bath tub [8]. In 1991, Keller was apprehended by Mexican officials and turned over to the FBI to stand trial on the 1983 wire-fraud charges. Two years later a jury in McAllen, Texas, convicted him of 11 counts of using interstate communications to defraud patients. At the trial, family members of former patients testified that Keller had said his \"digitron\" device could detect what part of the body had cancer and could cure the cancer when a photograph of the patient was placed into part of the device. Witnesses also testified that Keller used the device to conclude that the cancer was cured [9]. Stanford University professor William Tiller testified that Keller's device\u2014a \"radionics\" device\u2014could transmit \"subtle energies\" from a person with a hair strand, a drop of blood, or even a photograph, and would send and receive \"healing energies to that particular object.\" [10] [Joel Wallach](../../DSH/colloidalminerals.html) also testified on Keller's behalf. Keller received a two-year prison sentence plus three years of probation. In 1998, he was arrested and returned to prison gain for treating cancer patients in violation of his probation. He was released from prison in November 1999, at which time he was 70 years old. References - Monaco GP, Green S, and others. An Evaluative Database on Unproven and Untested Cancer Remedies.
