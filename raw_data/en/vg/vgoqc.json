Contents How do you balance chakras? There are several ways you can try to balance and align your chakras. The methods people use are typically based on personal preference. For example, if you are a yoga enthusiast, you'll most likely be interested in incorporating chakra balancing into your yoga practice. Or, if you are interested in nutrition, you may decide to heal the subtle body with food. However, bear in mind that as the chakra system is not scientifically proven, there is no evidence to suggest any of the following ways work. - Yoga poses - It is believed that specific yoga postures can stimulate each chakra, removing blockages and promoting the free flow of life force to aid in healing. - Visualization meditation - You can work on the chakras through meditation using different techniques. The most popular is visualizing the [color and energy in the physical chakra](https://www.theyoganomads.com/chakra-colors/)location. [Foods - All chakras](https://www.theyoganomads.com/chakra-food/)have an associated color, which matches the frequency of that energy center. Therefore, some people believe that eating foods of the same color and frequency are beneficial to the chakra system. - Crystals - Every crystal has specific qualities, and many match the qualities of a particular chakra. If a crystal or stone has the same attributes and the same color as an energy center, it is believed it has the power to heal or open it. [Mantras](https://www.theyoganomads.com/mantra-examples/)or affirmations - You can use your voice to align your chakras in two ways. Firstly, all chakras have an associated Bija (seed) mantra, a Sanskrit word you can chant. Alternatively, you can speak positive affirmations using the qualities of that energy center. - Sound healing and frequencies - An easy way to work on your chakras is to listen to sound healing music tuned to the frequency of the chakra you are looking to heal. - Mudras (hand gestures) - A specific hand gesture (mudra in Sanskrit) that is said to evoke the energy of a chakra. There are associated [mudras for each of the seven chakras](https://www.theyoganomads.com/chakra-mudras/)that you can use while meditating. - Breathwork - One of the best ways to promote free-flowing energy in all seven major chakras is with [pranayama breathing techniques](https://www.theyoganomads.com/pranayama-breathing/). Deep breathing, such as in [Nadi Shodhana](https://youtu.be/OhBU2CcOkSM), is known to cleanse the Nadis, part of the energetic body. - Reiki - Reiki practitioners work with the energy in your body and can sense any blockages and heal them by using their hands and sometimes the addition of crystals.
