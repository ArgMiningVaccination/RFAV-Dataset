My oldest child, whom my husband tried for years to get pregnant with, was vaccine injured as an infant. She suers from seizures, a tic disorder and brain damage that her neurologist has conrmed is a result of adverse eects from vaccines. I can only imagine how biased a module from the state would be when it comes to the topic of vaccines. I do not understand why this has to be such a hot topic and why parents are so incredibly pressured when it comes to vaccines. Children today receive many more shots than we received as children. The schedule is forever growing and has never been tested for safety. It is unfair and a violation of our rights to be forced to watch what I'm certain will be fear mongering propaganda. As the parent of a child who suered as a result of vaccines, it is a slap in the face. Parents have the God given right to make medical decisions for their children, and should not be forced to watch biased videos. Vaccines can and do carry real risks and this bill is overstepping big time. "}
