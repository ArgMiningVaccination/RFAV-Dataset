When you are diagnosed with aplastic anaemia you may be neutropenic and at a greater risk of infection from bacteria or fungus in foods. Neutropenia means that neutrophils, which are one type of white cell, are at a low level and you are therefore at greater risk of food poisoning. It may therefore be necessary for you to follow a 'neutropenic' or 'clean' diet. Levels of neutropenia People with a neutrophil count of between 0.5 and 2.0 are considered to be neutropenic. If your neutrophil count is below 1.0, you should follow the advice on this page. Following a clean diet The advice on this page will help you to avoid infection, while still having as varied a diet as possible. It also gives general advice on safe food handling and storage for patients at risk of neutropenia. You, your family and friends, should follow this advice at all times. General advice - Shopping Avoid buying food with damaged or broken packaging Do not buy food from fridges or freezers that are overloaded as the food may not be cold enough Buy chilled and frozen foods last and get them home as quickly as possible. If it is not possible to get food home immediately, an insulated container or cool bag can help to keep food at the correct temperature Buy foods in small, individual packets. Avoid large packets that will be open longer and increase the chance of bacteria contaminating them Always check 'best before' or 'use by' dates on packaging Avoid shops where raw and cooked meats are stored in the same fridge or in a deli counter without a separating wall. Where possible buy pre-packed deli items. Storing food Keep your fridge between 0\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 Keep your freezer below -18\u00b0. Always ensure that food is still frozen solid when it is removed from the freezer Store cooked food at the top of the fridge Raw or defrosting meat or fish should be stored at the bottom of the fridge in a covered container to prevent dripping or leaking into the fridge Do not overload your fridge or freezer as this will increase the temperature Always store eggs in the fridge Use and store food following the manufacturer's instructions and within 'best before' or 'use by' dates Never refreeze thawed food. Food preparation Always wash your hands with warm water and soap before preparing food Always wash your hands after going to the toilet, sneezing and after touching pets, hair, dirty washing, rubbish, ready- made or raw food Use a separate towel or kitchen paper to dry your hands. Do not use a tea towel Cover any cuts and grazes with a waterproof plaster Keep pets away from work surfaces, food and your dishes Ensure any cloths or sponges are regularly bleached, disinfected or changed Avoid cross- contamination of food by changing or washing chopping boards and utensils between raw and cooked food. Ideally you should have three boards: one for raw meat, one for cooked meat and one for other foods. Avoid reheating rice or takeaway food, as harmful bacteria can survive the heating process Always cover food to prevent contamination Kitchen hygiene Disinfect work surfaces regularly Wash can tops before opening them Wash fruit and vegetables before eating Clean tap spouts regularly Wash the roof and the inside of your microwave regularly. Cooking Defrost food in the fridge, not at room temperature Cook all food thoroughly and ensure it is piping hot all the way through. Ensure that food reaches a temperature of 70\u00b0c or more before serving Cook meat until the juices are clear Pre-heat the oven to ensure food is cooked at the recommended temperature Always follow manufacturer's guidelines and do not shorten cooking times. Reheating food Eat rice as soon as it is cooked and do not reheat cooked rice as harmful bacteria can survive the heating process Microwave cookers can be used for defrosting and for heating prepared foods according For home-cooked foods, cool food at room temperature within an hour after cooking and then refrigerate or freeze Do not reheat food more than once Do not reheat takeaway food Do not put hot food in your fridge as this will increase the temperature of all food in the fridge making it unsafe to eat Cover food and allow it to cool to room temperature before putting it in the fridge. Eating out Ensure food is piping hot when served and cooked all the way through Choose freshly prepared foods from reputable outlets. Avoid salad bars, street vendors, market stalls, buffets, all-you- can-eat restaurants and ice cream vans Avoid foods which have been left out on display such as doner kebab meat Check restaurant hygiene ratings at ratings.food.gov.uk. To keep yourself safe, make sure that the restaurant or takeaway has a food hygiene rating of 5. Talk to your doctor or healthcare team about eating out in restaurants or visiting crowded places Foods to be avoided Safer alternatives Meat and poultry Raw or undercooked meat and poultry, e.g. meat which is still pink - rare steak Smoked or cured meat, e.g. salami or Parma ham Unpasteurised pat\u00e9 Rotisserie chicken Meat from a barbeque Well-cooked meat and poultry.
