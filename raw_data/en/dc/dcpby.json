The assessment needs to be spread over the duration of the- course. There are two types of assessments: Formative Assessment: Formative assessment should be continual and should assess medical knowledge, patient care, procedural & academic skills, interpersonal skills, professionalism, self-directed learning and ability to practice in the system. i. General Principles: Internal Assessment should be frequent, cover all domains of learning and used to provide feedback to improve learning; it should also cover professionalism and communication skills. The Internal Assessment should be conducted in theory and clinical examination. ii. Quarterly assessment during the training should be based on following educational activities: a. Journal based / recent advances learning b. Patient based / Laboratory or Skill based learning c. Self-directed learning and teaching d. Departmental and interdepartmental learning activity e. External and Outreach Activities / CMEs The student to be assessed periodically as per categories listed in post graduate student appraisal form(Annexure1) Summative (at the end of training) i. Summative Assessment: i.e., assessment at the end of training Following record is to be maintained during the training period: ii. Maintaining Log Book: The log book is a record of the important activities of the candidate during his training. Internal assessment should be based on the evaluation of the logbook. Collectively, logbooks are a tool for the evaluation of the training program of the institution by external agencies. The record includes: a. All academic activities as well as the presentations and procedures carried / assisted /Observed out by the candidate. b. Record of Seminars c. Record of Journal Club d. Record of clinical cases e.
