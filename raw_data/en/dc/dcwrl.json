Andrew follows with his own first-person take on certain aspects of the tests. Joe Nickel), there as an observer, puts the Natasha business into broader perspective of other \"eyeless vision\" claims. This is just the latest of a long series of tests over the years that CSICOP has encouraged, stimulated, or sponsored. It all brings back fond memories of a trip to China with a CSICOP delegation in 1988 when we tested, among others, Chinese children who were being promoted worldwide for alleged psychokinetic abilities. Our tests, led by James Randi, revealed that the girls were, with the complicity of their naive mentor, engaged in childlike chicanery. (Our report appears in the SI anthology The Hundredth Monkey.) In this issue Randi returns to offer a revealing and heartfelt tribute to Johnny Carson, and Paul Kurtz adds a note about Johnnys support of CSICOP as well. Carson, an amateur astronomer, was a good friend of science and skepticism. In addition to Randi's appearances, he had Carl Sagan on his show thirty times. Each gave Carl an opportunity to talk about the passion of scientific discovery and show how scientists strive to get at the truth about nature. We continue a series of articles about evolution. Charles Sullivan and Cameron Smith discuss four commonly (mis)used phrases (e.g. \"missing links\") about it. \u00bb * I recently judged at a regional science fair. Although my section was earth and space sciences, I encountered creationism. One high school student compared the modern scientific view of big bang cosmology with the creationist/intelligent design view . .. and claimed to find die former heavily influenced by ideology and dogma and the latter strongly supported by evidence! Not surprisingly, since she based much of her analysis on a well-known creationist physicist's book, promi\u00ad nently displayed, on this theme. Worse, in talking to her I found that her interest in these ideas wasn't casual. She already had a deeply ingrained ideological\u2014almost strident and proselytizing\u2014commitment to the creationist worldvicw of cosmo\u00ad logy, and of science generally. For me, there were two consolations: The judges assigned to her (I wasn't) were as appalled by ihis as I. And two booths away a project by an elevcndi-gradcr ana\u00ad lyzed the evolution of the human species through ages and locations of major fos\u00ad sil finds in Africa, Europe, and Asia. The brightest student I talked to, he had come to the United States from Manchuria in 2001 knowing no English. He has a pas\u00ad sion to become a paleoanthropologist and do field work in China on human evo\u00ad lution. I think he will. ' Be sure to check out the amusing Periodic Table on the back cover as it might be labeled by creationists. It is die work of Loren Williams, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Georgia Tech. \"The point I am trying to make,\" he says, \"is that the creationist/intelligent design attack on biology is truly an attack on all science.\" It sure is.

Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER NEWS AND COMMENT Florida Legislators, FSU Faculty Clash over Proposed Chiropractic School at University A proposed chiropractic school at Florida State University (FSU) has pitted state legis\u00ad lators against school faculty in a battle that is equal parts science and politics. In January, FSU considered a proposal to build the first public chiropractic school in the country. Florida Governor Jeb Bush and the state legislature have already set aside $9 million of annual funding for the proposed school. (Governor Bush has been quoted as saying that the deal was more about making peace between warring politicians than any particular interest in chiropractic medicine.) The proposal was voted down by the University Board of Governors. Several Florida politicians voiced support for the chiropractic school; they contend that it would have attracted students and develop\u00ad ment dollars, as well as boosting the reputa\u00ad tion of the chiropractic community. However, many FSU faculty members opposed it. They argued rhat chiropractic medicine is a pseudoscience and that such a school would hurt FSU's academic reputa\u00ad tion. They also protested the way in which the deal was arranged, with little to no input from faculty members. Several pan-time fac\u00ad ulty members had threatened to quit if the school was approved. One of the professors created a parody map of the campus, which designates a building for Chiropractic Medicine along\u00ad side other paranormal departments such as the Yeti Foundation, the School of Channeling and Remote Sensing, and a Circle Simulation Laboratory. This is not the first time that a partner\u00ad ship between a major university and a chi\u00ad ropractic organization has been attempted: in 1995, York University in Toronto con\u00ad sidered a plan to affiliate themselves with the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College. (There are several parallels: the proposal was not made public until 1998, and advocates promised that the deal would bring in millions of dollars and many new students while faculty opposed the deal on academic and scientific grounds.) After a protracted fight, York rejected the proposal in 2001. \u2014John Gaeddert John Gaeddert is Assistant Director of Public Relations for CSICOP. Shark Cartilage Cancer 'Cure' Shows Danger of Pseudoscience The rising popularity of shark cartilage extract as an anti-cancer treatment is a tri\u00ad umph of marketing and pseudoscience over reason, with a tragic fallout for both sharks and humans, according to a Johns Hopkins biologist writing in the December 1, 2004, issue of Cancer Research. \"Since shark cartilage has been promoted as a cancer cure, not only has there been a measurable decline in shark populations, but cancer patients also have been diverted from proven, effective treatments,\" said Gary K. Ostrander, a research professor in the depart\u00ad ments of Biology and Comparative Medicine at The Johns Hopkins University. In the paper, titled \"Shark Cartilage, Cancer, and the Growing Threat of Pseudo- science,\" Ostrander writes, \"Crude shark cartilage is marketed as a cancer cure on the premise that sharks don't get cancer. That's not true, and the fact that people believe it is an illustration of just how harmful the pub\u00ad lic's irrationality can be.\" In fact, Ostrander's paper details more than forty examples of tumors in sharks and related species, dating back to the mid-1800s. In the paper, Ostrander and a team of researchers from the Registry of Tumors in Lower Animals not only dissect what they call the \"fallacious arguments\" that have successfully convinced desperate cancer patients to purchase and ingest crude shark cartilage extract, but they also call for society to become more scientifi\u00ad cally literate and, rhus, less vulnerable to skill\u00ad fully mass-marketed illogical claims. \"People read on the Internet or hear on television that taking crude shark cartilage extract can cure them of cancer, and they believe it without demanding to sec the sci\u00ad ence behind the claims,\" Ostrander said. \"This shows how the electronic media have increased the potential harm of pseudo- science, turning what would otherwise be quaint cultural curiosities into potential seri\u00ad ous societal and ecological problems. The only way to combat this is to ensure that government leaders and media professionals receive adequate scientific training based on reason, and that they also develop critical thinking skills.\" Ostrander traces the popularity of crude shark cartilage as a cancer treatment and pre\u00ad ventive measure to I. William Lane's 1992 book tided Sharks Don't Get Cancer, which was further publicized by the CBS News pro\u00ad gram 60 Minutes in 1993. Though Lane acknowledges in the book that sharks do, in fact, get cancer, he bases his advocacy of crude cartilage extracts on what Ostrander calls \"overextensions\" of some early experi\u00ad ments in which the substance seemed to inhibit tumor formation and the growth of new blood vessels that supply nutrients and oxygen to malignancies. \"The fact is that it is possible that highly purified components of cartilage, including from sharks, may hold some benefit for treat\u00ad ment of human cancers,\" Ostrander said. \"The key will be to isolate these compounds and design a way to deliver them to the site of the tumor. Lane and others ignore these existing barriers and suggest that consuming crude cartilage extracts by mouth or rectum could be curative of all cancers\u2014an approach for which there is no scientific basis.\" \u2014Johns Hopkins University 'Psychic' Con Artist Caught in Police Sting At the 2004 Bayou Lacombe Crab Festival in Louisiana last July, a resident of Slidell, Louisiana, had a reading performed by a sup\u00ad posed psychic who called herself \"Miss Jackson.\" While the woman sought the read\u00ad ing as entertainment, upon being informed that she had a terrible curse on her, she began to take the episode more seriously. But to her relief. Miss Jackson quickly informed her that the curse could be removed with the proper ritual, and the next day, the two arranged to get together and discuss remov\u00ad ing the curse. That procedure, predictably, involved a large sum of money which was to be ceremonially buried in a specified loca\u00ad tion in a paper bag\u2014with a banana. Fortunately, the victim realized that she was being targeted by a con artist and con\u00ad tacted the Slidell Police Department. She was asked by investigators to go through with the meeting so that Miss Jackson could be caught SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 5 NEWS AND COMMENT committing an act of fraud. Unfortunately, at die site, something raised the supposed psy\u00ad chic's suspicion, and she quickly gathered her magical implements and left the scene widi- out performing the \"necessary\" ritual. (The victim did manage to retain the $5,000 in marked bills.) On July 13, 2004, a team of officers arrested Jackson, also known as Lecia Urich, who operates a fortune-telling parlor in Kenner. Urich was booked on charges of attempted theft of an amount greater than $500. Another woman later came forward, reporting that she was similarly duped out of $37,000, so further charges have been added in the case, which is still awaiting a court appearance. For a more detailed account of a similar case, see Amy Davis's article, \"Psychic Swindlers\" on page 38 of this issue. \u2014David Park Musella David Park Musella is an editorial assistant with SKEPTICAL INQUIRER. Internet Group Donates Evolution Texts to Dover High School An international e-mail group that focuses on opposing the teach\u00ad ing of Intelligent Design (ID) creationism has donated over twenty science books to the Dover High School Library in Dover, Pennsylvania. The books include What Evolution Is by evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr, Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics by Robert Pennock, and Finding Darwin's God by biologist Kenneth R. Miller. Dover became the scene of a legal fight after supporters of Intelligent Design dieory attempted to insert their viewpoint into science classes. The donated books arrived as lawyers argued in court over the fate of Intelligent Design \"textbooks.\" Similar conflicts over ID theory are tak\u00ad ing place in Ohio, Kansas, Alabama, Arkansas, and elsewhere. The cyber-activists from the Debunk- Creation e-mail list at Yahoogroups, from the United States, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada, Australia, and Sweden, say they were motivated by reports that an \"anonymous donor\" gave sixty copies of the ID textbook Of Pandas and People to the school district. \"We wanted students in Dover to have access to accurate information about science, about evolutionary biology, and about the real agenda of the Intelligent Design movement,\" says list founder Lenny Flank, a freelance writer from St. Petersburg, Florida. CSICOP Launches Creation Watch Web Site In an effort to help counter the misinfor\u00ad mation spread on the Internet by creation\u00ad ist groups, the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) has recently unveiled a \"Creation Watch\" Web site. In its early stages the site will collect all SKEPTICAL INQUIRER and Skeptical Briefs articles on the subject. The site will help promote good science education and an understanding of the evolutionary sciences, and address the fallacies of creation and Intelligent Design arguments while exposing the tactics used to mislead the public. In addition we hope to add valuable educational materials and links to other online sites containing useful information for educators, activists, and concerned citizens. The highlight of the site will be a Web column by Eugenie Scott, director of the National Center for Science Education (NCSE) and up to date report\u00ad ing of news items from around the world. The Creation Watch Web site is at www. csicop.org/creationwatch/. 'Ancient Universe' Booklet Explains the Great Age of the Changing Cosmos In several U.S. states there have been demands that discussions of the Big Bang and the vast age of the universe be excluded from science curricula in K-12 classrooms. In response, the Astronomy Education Board of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) put together an article first published in a newsletter for teachers on the Astro\u00ad nomical Society of the Pacific Web site. The AAS has now expanded this article into \"The Ancient Universe,\" an illustrated guide explaining how astronomers know that the cosmos is old and that it changes with time. The booklet is designed for school boards, principals, parents, and anyone interested in the scientific perspective on the age of Earth and the physical world. The authors explain the evidence show\u00ad ing that we live in a universe that is between 10 billion and 15 billion years old and that both the universe and its contents undergo evolutionary change. A list of written and Web resources is also included. The 20-page nontechnical booklet is available for free downloading on the Web site: http://education.aas.org/ publications/ancienruniverse.html. Astronomy, Astrology\u2014What's the Difference? It's Politics A saturation radio ad tiiat confused astronomy with astrology was used to ridicule political incumbent Joel Trella for taking college courses in astronomy while serving as sheriff for Bergen County, New Jersey. The political ad, broadcast on a New York City radio station, derided Trella for using \"astronomy\" to make professional decisions. At die beginning of the fifty-second spot, a male voice, pretending to be that of Trella, is singing the opening line from the song \"Aquarius.\" He is interrupted by an alarmed female voice announcing that a prisoner is escaping from the jail. The Trella impersonator responds in shock, \"That's impossible. Jupiter's orbiting!\" At die end of 6 Volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER NEWS AND COMMENT the ad, the female exclaims, \"Look, another prisoner is escaping!\" This time die Trella voice moans, \"Ooh! What would the Maharishi do?\" The ad closes with state\u00ad ments urging listeners 10 vote for Leo McGuire \"because Bergen County needs a sheriff\u2014not an astronomer.\" Although die ad's writers arc aware diat Maharishi Yogi represents a particular school of astrology (Vedic), they must be clueless as to what astronomy is. The apparent scientific illiteracy of die campaign ad's writers produced a negative political spot criticizing die incumbent's educa\u00ad tion that is so far off base as to sound moronic A call to Trella's office revealed mat die astronomy courses were taken to meet a uni\u00ad versity's degree requirements and were approved under die County's long-standing employee tuition reimbursement plan. In addition, according to Bergen County Community College, the incumbent played a critical role in die development of die school's criminal-justice program, one of die few in die state. Bill Maer, McGuire's campaign manager, when asked about die confusion between astronomy and astrology would only reply, \"I'm sorry if die ad has offended any\u00ad body.\" It seems diat the greater cost for get\u00ad ting a science education, at least in this case, is not die tuition, but die public ridicule for having improved one's critical thinking skills. \u2014Frank Reiser Frank Reiser is in the Department of Biology at Nassau Community College in Garden City, New York. Loftus Wins $200,000 Grawemeyer Award for Her Memory Research CSICOP Fellow Elizabeth Loftus, a noted memory expert and professor of psychology and law at die University of California, Irvine, has been named recipient of die $200,000 Grawemeyer Award for Psychology. The award was announced December 1 by UC-Irvine and the University of Louisville, which administers the award, endowed by industrialist H. Charles Grawemeyer in 1984. Loftus's work has emphasized that mem\u00ad ory is not like a tape recorder but creative and reconstructive, and thus susceptible to suggestion and manipulation. Her research has cast doubt on the validity of past \"repressed\" memories often brought out dur\u00ad ing psychotherapy. She has testified on such matters in many high-profile cases. The Grawemeyer Web site said her re\u00ad search \"has implications for law and for psy- chodicrapy's mediods of probing memory.\" Loftus told the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER she was \"shocked and delighted to be honored in such an enormous way.\" In an earlier Los Angeles Times article, she called the award \"a validation of work that I have been passionate about but also had to do in a climate of hostility and difficulty. So there's a special sense of vindication and appreciation diat the enemies who have been trying to do me in for at least ten years did not succeed.\" CSICOP Fellow Elizabeth Loftus. She said she would use some of die money to support her research. Loftus is ranked 58th by the Review of General Psychology on its list of the 100 top psy\u00ad chologists of die twentieth century. CSfs Anthony Zuiker: TV's Man of the Century? I nominate Anthony E. Zuiker as TV's man of die century. Okay... I'm talking about diis century, not last, and, second, just who is Anthony Zuiker? Mr. CSI. The creator of the dure blockbuster hits on CBS: CSI; CSI: Miami, and CSI: New York. All this from a guy who was apparently operating a tram not too very long ago. My reason for naming him? Not die usual ones. While I'm sure that CBS is mak\u00ad ing plenty of money and spread-eagling die competition widi its holy trinity of crime fighters. Zuiker has given us something much more important than any of diat. He's given us back our sanity. He's also given us back our rationality, our empiricism. He has, widi his stories of forensic spe\u00ad cialists using science and scientific mediod, given us back our very reason. The diree CSI shows, which began in 2000, have all been in die top ten of die ratings and have made sci\u00ad ence, reason, and even thinking itself fash\u00ad ionable again. Amid the so-called reality shows, the Springer-esquc talk shows, and the inane sit\u00ad coms, critical thinking and intelligent fare are hard to find. We have seen die flourishing of die super\u00ad natural on television, instead of a naturalistic view of life. Touched By an Angel, Joan of Arcadia, The Others, Medium, John Edward, James Van Praagh, not to mention supernat\u00ad ural shows like The X-Files, often champion superstition over science, belief over proof, wishful diinking over scientific mediod. Viewers become indoctrinated into die fantastical, avoiding scientific mediods and reasoning. CSI stepped up like a drill sergeant and began putting the people through their intellectual paces. Evidence, proof, reason, and scientific method arc always stressed. Will Zuiker continue his winning ways? Who knows? Will he continue to spread his brand of scientific Hellenization, a la Alexander the Great? Let's hope so. But this much is certain. From both a rat\u00ad ings and a pro-science point of view, Anthony Zuiker is easily TV's early man of die century. \u2014Chris Volkay Chris Volkay is a freelance writer in Los Angeles who specializes in championing science over superstition, rationality over religion, and debunking the paranormal Anthony Zuiker.

But if the coastal resi\u00ad dents were prepared for Jeanne's wrath, it was no thanks to the coast's Florida Today newspaper, headquartered in Melbourne. Or at least not to what die paper refers to as its three \"psychic experts.\" A September 20 story tided \"Local psy\u00ad chics predict the weather: Will more storms Brevard?\" carried the following predic\u00ad tions from its telepathetic trio, who \"for the past three years . .. have participated in New Year's forecasts on politics, celebrities, weather, etc.\" None foresaw Florida's historic run of four major hurricanes or the role Jeanne would play. According to staff writer Billy Cox, Shiraa Roccelle \"was certain [Jeanne] wouldn't splat\u00ad quoted as saying (or seering), \"My sense is that it will come much closer to Georgia or South Carolina, and it'll miss us.\" Next Elizabeth Cooper came to the plate: \"It's going to dissipate\u20141 don't think it'll be a hurricane.\" Batting third, and playing way out in left field, Chris Jones: \" Georgia is the first word that comes to mind with Jeanne,\" Jones said. \"Jeanne is full of steam, but she'll hit land and blow out ratiier quickly.\" Jones was instead more concerned about Hurricane Karl, which, alas, never approached the United States. \u2014Gary Posner Gary P. Posner is founder of Tampa Bay Skeptics and a CSICOP Scientific Consultant. Centuries-old Puzzle Solved by Calgary Teen In the early part of the sixteenth century, German artist, engraver, and master of per\u00ad spective Albrecht Durer, who often brought his powerful interest in geometry into his artistic pursuits, wondered whether all polyhedral forms could be reduced to two-dimensional forms with no overlapping by cutting along the edges of their faces. The question arose from the artist's pursuit of more accurate methods of representing the proper proportions of three-dimensional objects in two-dimensional an. That question remained unanswered until it was solved last year by a fourteen-year-old Canadian student, Daniel Bezdek, who, like Durer, has a keen interest in geometry and math in general. The project won its author five awards at the Canada Wide Science Fair, held in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada, in May 2004, garnering the young mathematician over $8,000 (Canadian) in prizes. The judges stated that Bezdek's research was so complex they needed to bring in additional mathematicians to properly evaluate it. Though five centuries have passed since Durer first asked the question, Bezdek is reported to have spent just two weeks solving it. \u2014David Parle Musella Recent Deaths Ernst Mayr, considered by some the leading evolutionary biologist of the twentieth century, one of the architects of the modern evolution\u00ad ary synthesis that reconciled Darwin's theories of evolution with new findings in genetics, pop\u00ad ulation biology, and diversity, professor emeri\u00ad tus of zoology at Harvard (the Museum of Comparative Zoology), promoter of evolution\u00ad ary biology as a discipline and the philosophy of biology as a field, author of such works as Birds of the Southwest Pacific, Animal Species and Evolution, The Growth of Biological Thought, The Evolutionary Synthesis, This is Biology Ernst Mayr.

Alleged Reagan Astrologer Dies Joyce Jillson, the actress turned self-styled \"Hollywood Astrologer\" who claimed to have cast horoscopes for President and Mrs. Reagan, died October 1, 2004. Her obituary again raised questions about the Reagans' reliance on astrology, as well as Jillson's alleged role in providing such advice. Jillson, one-time actress on die racy 1960s television scries Peyton Place, garnered worldwide publicity for her astrology busi\u00ad ness in 1988. She claimed that she was actu\u00ad ally a guest at the White House in 1981 fol\u00ad lowing the attempted assassination of President Reagan. Through their spokesper\u00ad sons, the Reagans denied that was true. Jillson's claim followed revelations by for\u00ad mer White House chief of staff Donald T Regan in his book. For the Record In addi\u00ad tion to characterizing President Reagan as likeable but disturbingly susceptible to manipulation, especially by a meddling First Lady, Regan exposed what he called \"proba\u00ad bly the most closely guarded domestic secret of the Reagan White House.\" He revealed that the First Lady relied on an astrologer to determine the best time for every presiden\u00ad tial move, from travel to speeches and more: The astrologer, according to Time magazine, cast the charts of Reagan (an Aquarius) and Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev (a Pisces) and \"determined that 2 P.M. on Dec. 8, 1987, was die most propitious moment for them to sign the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty.\" Don Regan did not name the prognosti- cator except to say that she was \"an astrologer in San Francisco.\" Joyce Jillson was instead from Los Angeles, but she quickly claimed that she had \"spent a lot of time of the White House\" after the assassi\u00ad nation attempt and had recommended George H.W. Bush as Reagan's running mate in 1980. However, as Time reported, \"Neither the President nor the First Lady recalls ever meeting Jillson.\" 8 Volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER NEWS AND COMMENT Soon, reporters had identified die real astral consultant as Joan Quigley, who was said to be \"not unlike many of the First Lady's California friends\": a wealthy conservative socialite. Quigley had authored three books on astrology and had been advising the Reagans ever since die early 1970s when television talk- show host Merv Griffin introduced her to Mrs. Reagan. A long-time acquaintance de\u00ad scribed Quigley as \"a little wacky.\" President Reagan tried to minimize his con\u00ad nection to astrology, but, according to Time. Both Reagans have always been supersti\u00ad tious, observing such harmless rituals as knocking on wood and walking around, not under, ladders. The President puts a certain coin and a gold charm in his pocket each morning, and routinely tosses salt over his left shoulder not just when he spills some but before all his meals. Also, in his autobiography, written in 1965, Reagan described his and his wife's attraction to published astrological forecasts. Reagan's son Michael told me, when I was on his radio show, that his father often mentioned how his dog Rex would refuse to enter the Lincoln bedroom which was sup\u00ad posedly haunted. Reagan's daughter, Patti Davis, recalled he once replied when asked about Lincoln's ghost: \"1 haven't seen him yet. But 1 do believe he's here.\" In her 1989 memoir, Nancy Reagan also attempted to play down the astrology issue, stat\u00ad ing it had had no impact on American policy matters. However, die following year Quigley wrote in her own book, What Don Joan Say?, that her involvement with Mrs. Reagan gave her \"a direct line to the President.\" She said she per\u00ad suaded him, for instance, to soften his \"evil empire attitude\" toward Gorbachev prior to their Geneva Summit meeting. There may have been further unintended consequences. According to Jack Anderson and Dale Van Atta, syndicated columnists, the Soviet consulate was believed to have tapped into unsecured phones lines over which Mrs. Reagan and her stargazer routinely discussed national policy matters. Reportedly, White House sources, the CIA, and rhc National Security Council believed that the Soviets had recorded hundreds of such calls. However credible the superstitious Reagans initially found astrology, \"In 1981,\" reported Time, \"Quigley made Nancy a believer by showing how the astrologer's charts could have foretold that the period on or around March 30, 1981, would be extremely dangerous for the President.\" Apparendy Mrs. Reagan did not stop to recall die adage diat hindsight is always 20/20. Astrologers, like other mystics, often make such retroactive claims. (One psychic, Tamara Rand, seemed especially accurate in predicting die attempted assassination of Reagan, reputedly on a TV show on January 6, 1981. She mentioned the initials \"J.H.\" and other details, saying Reagan would be shot in the chest during a \"hail of bullets,\" and that it would transpire in late March or early April. Indeed, John Hinckley shot Reagan on March 30. However, an AP reporter discovered the video was a fake, filed die day after die assassination attempt.) \u2014Joe Nickell Joe Nickell is CSICOP's Senior Research Fellow. Indian Rationalist H. Narasimhaiah Dies at 84 Eminent rationalist H. Narasimhaiah, founder of die Bangalore Science Forum, CSICOP Fellow, and eminent skeptic, died January 31, 2005, at the age of 84. He was one of die greatest minds in India, promoting die public understanding of science and die spirit of critical inquiry. He was cremated in his native Hosur village with full state honors. \"Do not accept anything widiout ques\u00ad tioning\" was his guideline. During the infor\u00ad mation technology revolution, he remained committed to promoting pure science and a scientific outlook to life. His outstanding con\u00ad tribution was the founding of the Bangalore Science Forum in 1962, which is dedicated to promoting the scientific temper. Developing scientific temper is incidentally one of die Fundamental Duties enshrined in die Indian constitution, and he was one of die few who took diis duty seriously in a country where courting fraudulent god men, whom he vehe- mendy opposed, has become fashionable. Narasimhaiah strongly opposed super\u00ad stition and obscurantism and had challenged god men, including Sai Baba. Ten years ago, I was fortunate to have a brief talk with him. Students I asked immediately knew where his office was. I was struck by the utter simplic\u00ad ity of his office, equipped widi a few simple, toldablc chairs and small table. I learned th.it he had also been living in a similarly simple room wirhout even a bed for fifty-three years. This was a man who had, besides founding H. Narasimhaiah. the Bangalore Science Forum, been the vice- chancellor of Bangalore University from 1972 to 1977 and known worldwide because of his commitment and activities to promote science. I have never met someone so promi\u00ad nent and humble at the same time. Full-page newspaper reports in several Bangalore newspapers reviewed his lifelong achievements. They lauded his humor and discussed many of tricks he used to lure students into science classes. Among the honors bestowed on him were the Sir M. Visweswaraya Award for the popular\u00ad ization of science and die Padma Bhushan Award of the Government of India. Skeptics worldwide will miss him. \u2014Amardeo Sarma Amardeo Sarma is chairman of the German skeptics group GWUP and a member of the CSICOP executive council- Quoteworthy \"Science is always more unsolved questions, and its great advantage is you can prove something is true or something is false.

We called it The Longest War: Sex Differences in Perspective. The publisher briefly worried about the title, on the grounds that it was unduly gloomy, though she was cheered when someone from the U.S. Army called to order sev\u00ad eral thousand copies\u2014until he learned it wasn't about Vietnam. There is a benefit to having written about sex differences for so long. You get to take the long view of an issue, to see it, as it were, in perspective\u2014for exam\u00ad ple, how women's rights have risen and fallen, come and gone, and returned and gone again, depending on the state of the economy and the current level of hysteria among religious conservatives about sex, marriage, and morals. In America, anything over ten years is the long view, and everything over twenty- five years is die ancient view. There is a disadvantage to having written about sex differences for so long. It makes me feel ancient and irritable. You would feel that way too, if you had to read the same damned debate over and over and over and over. In America, hardly anyone remembers anything that happened more than a few years ago, and so, every time someone comes along speculating that, say, men have an innate advantage over women in math and science, the country gets riled up all over again. This time the someone was the president of Harvard, Lawrence Summers, so he caused a lot of riling. CAROL TAVRIS So first, some perspective. Amer\u00ad icans, being an individualistic culture, tend to ascribe the origins of people's difficulties to something in them\u2014low motivation, bad personality, wonky hor\u00ad mones, or a gene for laziness. (They make personality attributions even when, in experiments, they have been explicitly informed that the other person is doing what they were ordered to do.) Therefore, whenever some individual or some group isn't doing as well as others, the immediate temptation is to assume the reason lies in the \"inherent\" qualities of the individual or group. No serious scholar disputes any longer that motives, hormones, and genes affect behavior; it's just that they are not the only factors that do. For example, in the 1970s psychologists worried that women suffered from an internal \"fear of success\" that was keep\u00ad ing them out of law and medical schools and other traditionally male careers. When discrimination was made illegal, \"fear of success\" was trampled under the crush of women entering professional schools and occupations formerly closed to them, including bar\u00ad tending and boxing. I will be very happy to entertain Summers's specula\u00ad tions about why more women are not at the higher echelons of math and science when the notion that they don't belong mere is as dead as fear of success. We are not there yet by a long shot. Just read any of the letters to the editor written, in the aftermath of the Summers affair, by women in science, and those who abandoned the science they loved, describing the insults, rejections, and humiliations they have endured. Dr. Summers has had many defend\u00ad ers who have argued that this whole kafuffle is just a politically correct tem\u00ad per tantrum by those who can't abide even asking sensitive questions such as whether sex differences occur and if so, why they do. These questions should certainly be on the table, they say, and scholars should be able to debate them without uproar and censorship. Indeed they should! They have been doing so for thirty years! If Dr. Summers had discussed the matter by offering any data at all from those thirty years of research to bolster his case, I doubt his audience would have been so appalled. For the record, let's note that Dr. Summers did not present any data in his remarks. A New York Times editorial observed wryly that \"the transcript pro\u00ad vides the best possible refutation of the charge of political correctness. Whatever Dr. Summers was doing at the conference, it had nothing to do with serious intellectual inquiry. 'I don't think anybody actually has a clue,' was one operative phrase.\" Carol Tavris, Ph.D., is a social psychologist and author, among other books, o/\"The Mismeasure of Woman: Why Women are Not the Better Sex, the Inferior Sex, or the Opposite Sex (Touchstone) and, with Carole Wade, Psychology, and Invitation to Psychology (Prentice Hall). She is a CSICOP Fellow. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 11 So let's examine some of the evi\u00ad dence, starting with Summers's anecdote about his daughter's preference for dolls over trucks\u2014parents' favorite kind of data. Developmental psychologists have shown that three- to seven-year-old chil\u00ad dren do indeed often behave like sexist piglets, to the despair of egalitarian par\u00ad ents and die gloating of traditionalist ones. It doesn't much matter how par\u00ad ents treat their children during these years; the kids know what they want to play with, and don't try giving a boy a Barbie. During those years, children are acquiring a \"cognitive schema\" for gen\u00ad der, fitting in the qualities and activities that seem to fit into each category\u2014 rough, spiky, black, mechanical things are \"male,\" for example, and soft, pink, fuzzy, or flowery things are \"female\"; black bears are male and pink poodles are female. At this age, they will insist that only boys can be doctors, even if their mother is a doctor. But dieir gen\u00ad der-typed behavior as five-year-olds often has little to do with how they will behave at twenty-five or forty-five. Children can grow up in an extremely traditional, gender-typed family and yet, as adults, find themselves in careers or relationships they would never have imagined for themselves\u2014as the grow\u00ad ing number of men who are nannies, nurses, and homemakers confirms. But what about all those studies that are finding sex differences in the brain\u2014say, those that find a sex differ\u00ad ence in lateralization? For some types of tasks, especially those involving lan\u00ad guage, men seem to rely more heavily on one side of the brain whereas women tend to use both sides. This is incredibly interesting, but consider these three caveats: First, in diese studies both sexes usu\u00ad ally do equally well on the task at hand. So what does the lateralization differ\u00ad ence actually mean for anyone's behav\u00ad ior in real life? Who knows? Second, die overlap between die sexes in diese studies is often greater than any average difference between them. Scientists keep saying diis, but no one seems to listen. Jeannette McGlone sum\u00ad marized her own findings on sex differ\u00ad ences in die brain this way: \"One must not overlook perhaps die most obvious conclusion, which is that basic patterns of male and female brain asymmetry seem to be more similar dian they are different.\" Of course, everyone dien overlooked it. Third, sex differences in the brain could be the result rather than the cause of behavioral differences. Experiences in life are constantly sculpting the circuitry of the brain, affecting the way brains are organized and how they function. For example, bilingual people who learned both of their languages in early childhood tend to use a single, uniform Broca's area when they generate sentences in the two languages. But in people who learned a second language during ado\u00ad lescence, Broca's area is divided into two distinct regions, one for each lan\u00ad guage. Playing a stringed instrument in childhood enlarges parts of the brain associated with music production, and driving a taxi for years enlarges parts of the brain involved in spatial orienta\u00ad tion. Obviously, women and men often have different experiences in childhood that could affect their brains accord\u00ad ingly. A scientist who identified lateral\u00ad ization differences in one MRI study concluded, \"We don't know if the dif\u00ad ference [we found] is because of the way we're raised, or if it's hard-wired in the brain.\" Lawrence Summers posed two expla\u00ad nations for the underrepresentation of women in math and science: die \"intrin\u00ad sic aptitude\" hypodiesis and \"socializa\u00ad tion.\" The current evidence suggests diat bodi are wrong. Males may indeed have an \"innate\" advantage at die extreme end of die bell curve, up there in die stratos\u00ad phere of genius, but for everyone else in die vast middle, die similarities between die sexes in behavior and aptitude are far greater dian die differences. But \"socialization\" is wrong too. Occupational choices are not especially determined by events in our childhoods or by how our parents raise us. They are, as sociologists have found, more deter\u00ad mined by the structure of occupations and how much time and commitment a career demands of its employees; the existence of good day care for workers who have children; die percentage of women in a field (to women, a signal of how welcome they are, and to men, a signal of what their income will be); what a person's friends and peers are doing; what the economy encourages or discourages; and the cultural norms within a profession. Suppose a chocolate factory has an assembly line that is geared to die average height of a man, say 5'9\". Workers who are 55 or shorter cannot be hired. Would we conclude mat women's underrepresen- tation in that factory was due to Chocolate Aversion Disorder, Fear of Chocolate, or a Just Don't Wanna factor? We would say, oh, for crying out loud, adjust die height of the \u00a3V\u00a991!T)&! assembly line, or find comparable work for die women\u2014and men\u2014who are shorter dian 5'5\". Therefore, in the final analysis, I think it's time to dump the ancient, bor\u00ad ing question: \"Do 'men' have a greater intrinsic aptitude for madi and science dian 'women' do?\"\u2014as if the sexes were separate categories like furniture and fruit. The question should be: \"What can we do to make sure that anyone who has any interest in or aptitude for science\u2014 anyone of any sex or ethnicity or age or background or income\u2014is encouraged to learn more and succeed in a career in sci\u00ad ence?\" Today, when the president of the United States thinks the jury is still out on evolution; when teachers are afraid to teach evolution lest they incur die wrath of parents; when the majority of Americans embrace astrologers, psychics, and scam artists; when government agencies and Web sites are censoring sci\u00ad entific findings diat do not support administration policies on everything from global warming to die alleged psy\u00ad chological effects of abortion and non- marital sex\u2014we cannot afford to make a single citizen feel unwelcome in die halls of science. The president of Harvard, of all people, should know diat. 12 Volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER SPECIAL REPORTS Johnny Carson Remembered JAMES RANDI A very bright light in my life has gone out. Forgive me if what follows is a little disorganized, but I've just heard diat we've lost Johnny Carson. It doesn't seem possible. We were in touch just a week ago. I'm writing this as a sort of catharsis. The phone has been ringing incessandy, and I'm hardly able to speak coherently to those who express dieir grief and shock. Just a few years ago I asked John about his triple bypass and how it was affecting his life. Typically, he told me diat it had made such a difference to him in so many ways, diat he would recommend it to everyone, \"whether tliey need it or not.\" I now regret diat I was never able to ask him a burning question: whether he'd given up smoking. I suspect he hadn't, since those of us who appeared on his show were well aware diat he smoked all through die taping, concealing diat fact by waiting until die camera was on a guest and would probably stay diere for at least thirty seconds. There was an exhaust fan under die desk, always a lit cigarette within reach, and the audience had been prompted to simply not nouce diat he was smoking in between camera shots. I mention diis because it seems pretty evident diat tobacco got die man, as it does so many of us. It makes me hate Johnny Carson laughs on the set of The Tonight Show. Carson, of late night television comedy, died January 23, 2005. at the (AFP/Getty Images) die product\u2014 and those who promote it\u2014even more than I did previously; it took away my father, too. John was generous, kind, and caring. The James Randi Educational Founda\u00ad tion received several checks\u2014six-figure checks\u2014from this prince, because he really believed in what we were doing, he followed our Web page closely, and he would call every now and dien widi com\u00ad ments and suggestions for subjects he believed to be important. The phone will never again give me die delight of hearing his voice, and diat is the burden I will have to live with. I will miss him more than I can say. There was always a bit of mystery connected with my appearances on the show. John would never wish to meet guests before they actually walked out onto die set, but I was accustomed to hearing a tap on the door about ten min-a pioneer age of 79. utes before airtime, opening it to find him standing diere. He was thoughtful enough to want to ask me what I wished to pro\u00ad mote during my appearance, and always had some sort of anecdote to share with me. Once, after he'd left my dress\u00ad ing room, I was asked by the prop man, \"Do you know where the body's hidden, or something?\" He just couldn't understand why John had bro\u00ad ken his rule in my case. When the famous expose of Peter Popoff occurred on his show, conditions had been somewhat changed over those diat usually applied. Earlier that afternoon I had met widi Fred DeCordova, his director, I had shown him die video footage that we had exposing Popoffs scam, and when Fred said that he would show the video to Johnny, I'd suggested diat it might be better to surprise him. \"No,\" Fred had insisted, \"Johnny doesn't like surprises.\" \"Well, just think for a moment about the expression he'll have on his face,\" I told him. That did it. We went on-camera that evening without Johnny knowing the big surprise \u2014 that Popoff had a James \"The Amazing\" Randi was a founding member of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal and is currently head of the James Randi Educational Foundation. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 13 concealed receiver in his ear. John let out an expletive that was dropped out of the tape before it was broadcast later in the evening, and DeCordova had to agree that we'd made the right decision. John and I were fond of pertinent quotations. We'd exchange them by e- mail or phone, really, I suspect, trying to out-quote one another. Here's one I'll send him right here and now: Love is a bad tenant for one's bosom; for when compelled to quit, he always leaves the mansion more or less out of repair. \u2014C.F. Hoffman 1806-1884 I loved you, Johnny. We all did. Yes, I'm rambling, because I just don't know what else to say. I will miss Johnny Carson like no other per\u00ad son in my life. He was such a good man, one of my minor gods, and a good friend that I regret to say I did not meet again in person after he left television so long ago. Just one small example, if I may, of how generous he was. When 1 called and asked him if he might place a telephone call to Martin Gardner on that gentleman's ninetieth birthday, John had no hesi\u00ad tation agreeing to do so. \"I've got most of his books,\" he told me, \"and it'll be fun to speak with him.\" They did speak, on the afternoon of Martin's birthday, for some twenty minutes. That's the kind of gentleman that Johnny Carson was. John, I will miss you, as will so many millions here and around the world, but your legacy lives on. I've just run out of words. The editors of SKEPTICAL INQUIRER wish to add their lament at the death of Johnny Carson. He had a skeptical mind, ever willing to poke holes in sham and pretense. In addition to Carson's broadcast of Randi's classic expose\" of Peter Popoff, he was complicit in the scuttling of Uri Geller! Interestingly, Carson once featured a young lady who claimed to be a psychic card reader. \"I'll be damned it I know how she did it,\" he is alleged to have remarked. This prompted CSICOP to invite her to SUNY at Buffalo in order to test her pow\u00ad ers. We were able to demonstrate that she was a trickster. Martin Gardner said that she used the Matt Schulien forced card trick, and Randi caught her on camera peeking! That's psychic? Carson was a subscriber to SKEPTICAL INQUIRER (and Free Inquiry), and he made several four-figure contributions in response to our fund appeals. Alas, there are all too few figures in the media with enough guts to criticize hoax\u00ad ers and defend skeptical inquiry. Steve Allen was a notable exception, but he is gone as well. Luckily, Penn and Teller are still in action, as is, of course, the inimitable Randi. \u2014Paul Kurtz Claims of Invalid 'Shroud' Radiocarbon Date Cut from Whole Cloth JOE NICKELL Longtime Shroud of Turin devotee Ray Rogers, a retired research chemist, now admits there is the equivalent of a watercolor paint on the alleged burial cloth of Jesus. By tortuous logic and selective evidence, however, he uses the coloration to claim the \"shroud\" image was not the work of a medieval artist (Rogers 2004, 2005). Rogers follows many other shroud defenders in attempting to discredit the medieval date given by radiocarbon test\u00ad ing (Nickell 1998, 150-151). In a paper published in Thermo- chimica Acta, Rogers (2005) claims that earlier carbon-14 dating tests\u2014which proved the linen was produced between 1260 and 1390 (Damon et al. 1989)\u2014 were invalid because they were conducted on a sample taken from a medieval patch. \"The radiocarbon sample has completely different chemical properties than the main pan of the shroud relic,\" Rogers told BBC News (\"Turin\" 2005). 14 Volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER In fact, the radiocarbon sample (a small piece cut from the \"main body of the shroud\" [Damon 1989, 612]) was destroyed by the testing. Rogers (2005) relied on two little threads allegedly left over from die sampling,' together with segments taken from an adjacent area in 1973. He cites pro-authenticity re\u00ad searchers who guessed that die carbon- 14 sample came from a \"rewoven area\" of repair\u2014\"As unlikely as it seems,\" Rogers admitted to one news source (Lorenzi 2005). Indeed, textile experts specifically made efforts to select a site for taking the radiocarbon sample that was away from patches and seams (Damon et al. 1989, 611-612). Rogers compared the threads with some small samples from elsewhere on the Shroud, claiming to find differences between the two sets of threads that \"prove\" the radiocarbon sample \"was not part of die original cloth\" of the Turin shroud (as stated in his abstract [Rogers 2005, 189]). The reported differences include the presence\u2014allegedly only on die \"radio\u00ad carbon sample\"\u2014of cotton fibers and a coating of madder root dye in a binding medium that his tests \"suggest\" is gum Arabic. He insists the sampled area was that of an interwoven medieval repair that was intentionally colored to match the \"older, sepia-colored cloth\" (Rogers 2005, 192, 193). However, Rogers's assertions to die con\u00ad trary, both the cotton and me madder have been found elsewhere on the shroud. Both were specifically reported by famed micro- analyst Walter McCrone (1996, 85) who was commissioned to examine samples taken by die Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP). After McCrone discov\u00ad ered die image was rendered in tempera paint, STURP held him to a secrecy agree\u00ad ment, while statements were made to die press diat no evidence of artistry was found. McCrone was then, he says, \"drummed out\" of the organization (Nickell 1998,124-125:2004,193-194). As evidence of its pro-authentkiry bias, STURP's leaders served on die executive committee of the Holy Shroud Guild. Not only did McCrone find \"occa\u00ad sional\" cotton fibers on die Shroud, but die source of Rogers's sample, Gilbert Racs, has since been challenged as to his claim, cited by Rogers (2005, 189), that \"the cotton was an ancient Near Eastern variety.\" In fact, others\u2014including French textile expert Gabriel Vial and major pro-shroud author Ian Wilson (1998, 71, 97)\u2014believe the cotton may be entirely incidental. They point out it could have come from the cotton gloves or clothing of the Turin cloth's handlers or a similarly mundane source. On the tape-lifted STURP samples (affixed to microscope slides), McCrone found a variety of substances (including mold spores and wax spatters). Major pigments were red ocher (in \"body\" areas) and vermilion (together with red ocher in the \"blood\" areas), contained in a collagen tempera binder. He also found the madder,-' in addition to orpi- ment, azurite, and yellow ocher pig\u00ad ments, as well as paint fragments, including ultramarine and titanium white\u2014together suggestive 1996,85, 135). Astonishingly\u2014and with serious implications to the spirit of peer review\u2014Rogers omits any mention of McCrone's findings from his report while insisting elsewhere, \"let's be hon\u00ad est about our science\" (Rogers 2004). Although Rogers is a research chemist, unlike McCrone he is not an internationally celebrated microanalyst with special expertise in examining questioned paintings. Working in his \"home laboratory,\" he did not, as far as his report informs, use a \"blind\" approach as McCrone did to mitigate against die subjectivity diat has contin\u00ad ually plagued the work of shroud advo\u00ad cates. Moreover, McCrone once referred to Rogers's STURP co\u00ad author's \"incompetence in light microscopy\" and pointed out errors in the test procedures they relied on (McCrone 1996, 157, 158-171). Rogers (2005) now also reports die presence of vanillin in the lignin of the radiocarbon-sample area, in contrast to its reported absence in other areas of the clodi. This is a dubious finding given his extremely limited samples. He attempts to date the shroud by die amount of the lignin decomposition but admits diat diat method can offer only an accuracy range of a whopping 1,700 years (contrasted with about 150 years by radiocarbon dat\u00ad ing). He concedes diat the decomposition could have been accelerated by the baking of the clodi in its reliquary diat occurred during the fire of 1532, but diinks it unlikely die cloth is medieval. However, apart from the fire damage, the cloth is remarkably well preserved for a reputed age of nearly 2,000 years. Also, no examples of its complex her\u00ad ringbone weave are known from the time of Jesus when, in any case, burial cloths tended to be of plain weave (Nickell 1998,35; Wilson 1998,98-99, 188; Sox 1981). In addition, Jewish bur\u00ad ial practice utilized\u2014and the Gospel of John specifically describes for Jesus\u2014 multiple burial wrappings with a separate cloth over the face. Other evidence of medieval fakery includes the shroud's lack of historical record prior to the mid-fourteenth cen\u00ad tury\u2014when a bishop reported the attist's confession\u2014as well as serious anatomical problems, the lack of wrap\u00ad around distortions, the resemblance of the figure to medieval depictions of Jesus, and suspiciously bright red and picturelike \"blood\" stains which failed a battery of sophisticated tests by forensic serologists, among many odier indicators. These facts argue against Rogers's assertions that the shroud is neither a forgery nor a miracle\u2014that \"the blood is real blood\"1 and the image was produced by \"a rotting body\" (Rogers 2004). Science has proved the Shroud of Turin a medieval fake, but defenders of authenticity turn the scientific method on its head by starting with the desired conclusion and working backward to the evidence\u2014picking and choosing and reinterpreting as necessary. It is an approach I call \"shroud science.\" SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 200S 1 S Notes 1. Ian Wilson (1998, 187) reported that the trimmings \"are no longer extant.\" 2.

Joe Nickell has attacked my scien\u00ad tific competence and honesty in his \"Claims of Invalid 'Shroud' Radio\u00ad carbon Date Cut from Whole Cloth.\" Everything I have done investigating the shroud had die goal of testing some hypothesis [Schwalbe, L.A., Rogers, R.N., \"Physics and Chemistry of die Shroud of Turin: Summary of the 1978 Investigation,\" Analytica Chimica Acta 135, 3 (1982); Rogers Shroud of Turin: an amino- carbonyl reaction (Maillard reaction) may explain die image formation,\" in Meianoidins vol. 4, Ames, J.M., ed., Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, Luxembourg, 2003, pp. 106-113].

Rogers Fellow (Retired) University of California Los Alamos National Laboratory Los Alamos, New Mexico Rebuttal to Joe Nickell RAYMOND N. ROGERS 16 Volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Joe Nickell Replies: Ray Rogers largely sidesteps my criti\u00ad cisms. He claimed to have uniquely found cotton and madder on the shroud's radiocarbon sample area\u2014thus supposedly indicating it came from an He admits this sce\u00ad nario seemed \"highly ing come, he says, from \"the lunatic fringe\" (shroud zealots). He is unhappy that I disproved his claim by citing the earlier discovery, elsewhere on the cloth, of both cotton and madder. Rogers now questions that Walter McCrone actually discovered madder on the cloth. If McCrone did not, how pre\u00ad scient of him to claim so, since its pres\u00ad ence would be confirmed over two decades later by Rogers! Rogers's belated discovery follows the death in 2002 of McCrone, thus precluding his response. I have not said Rogers was not a research chemist, rather that he is not an expert in the field of detecting an forg\u00ad eries. Rogers's pro-shroud colleague, Alan Adler (whom Rogers cited in his report), admitted that McCrone \"had over two decades of experience with this kind of problem and a worldwide repu\u00ad tation,\" whereas Adler conceded that he (and fellow researcher John Heller) \"had never before tackled anything remotely like an artistic forgery.\" Apparently the same is true of Rogers. Why, then, were they chosen for such important work? Having taught FBI and other foren\u00ad sic analysts, McCrone was termed \"the best-known forensic microanalyst the world\" and his lab \"the most com\u00ad pletely equipped laboratory of its kind in this country or the world.\" Rogers himself once conceded McCrone was \"the best in the world\" in his highly specialized field. Rogers claims \"A cloud still hangs over Walter with regard to the Vinland Map.\" In fact, as shown on a Nova television pro\u00ad gram February 8, 2005, tided \"The Viking Deception,\" McCrones finding of has been con\u00ad firmed. Aldiougli McCrones conclusions were once challenged by chemist Thomas Cahill and colleagues, in 2002 scientists using Raman microprobe spectroscopy proved that the Vinland Map's ink did contain anatase. (See Katherine L. Brown and Robin J.H. Clark, 2002, \"Analysis of Pigmentary Materials on the Vinland Map and Tartar by Raman Microprobe Spectroscopy,\" Analytical Chemistry 74 [15], 3658-3661.) With the Vinland Map as with the Shroud of Turin, apart from debates over sensitive tests, powerful historical and other evi\u00ad dence still strongly indicates forgery. Regarding the rate of the shroud linen's vanillin loss, again Rogers is drawing doubtful conclusions from lim\u00ad ited samples. Moreover, the results would have been affected not only by the fire of 1532 but also by the cloth's unknown storage conditions. This alter\u00ad nate linen dating \"test\" is not an accepted, proven one, but rather one newly improvised, and Rogers's conclu\u00ad sions are contradicted by much other evidence. As to the additional analyses Rogers refers to, please see McCrones Judgement Day for the Turin Shroud (1996) and my Inquest on the Shroud of Turin: Litest Scientific Findings (1998). \u00bb * \u00ab Since writing the above, I am saddened to learn of Ray's death (on March 8). I know that he sincerely wanted to do good science, and I praised him in my book for backing away from his earlier position that the shroud image \"was formed by a burst of radiant energy.\" He had the courage and integrity to dis\u00ad tance himself from shroud zealots, and I know that on many other issues he and I would have been on the same side.

INVESTIGATIVE FILES JOE NICKELL Second Sight: The Phenomenon of Eyeless Vision Natasha a suppos\u00ad edly peer inside people's bod\u00ad ies, observe their organs, and diagnose malfunctions and disease (\"The Girl\" 2004; Baty 2004). For a Discovery Channel documentary. The Girl with X-ray Eyes, CSI- COP was asked to test the Russian 17-year-old's alleged visionary abilities. (Results of the test, conducted in New York City on May 1, 2004, are presented elsewhere in this issue.) This column pro\u00ad vides background and per\u00ad spective on such claims. Natasha's alleged ability falls under the heading of clairvoyance (\"clear seeing\"), also long known as \"second sight.\" This is the purported perception of objects, people, or events\u2014other than by the normal senses. It is thus a sup\u00ad posed form of extrasensory perception (ESP). Mystics claim there are var\u00ad ious states of clairvoyance, including two that are relevant to Natasha's claims. The Joe Nickell, CSICOP's Senior Research Fellow, is a former professional magician and author of numerous investigative hooks, including Real-Life X-Files. Figures 1 and 2. The author dons an opaque blindfold, after it examined, followed by a black cloth hood. He then performs brated \"blindfold drive\" feat\u2014a supposed demonstration of sight.\" (Photographs by Robert H. van Outer) first is X-ray clairvoyance, supposedly \"the ability to see through opaque objects such as envelopes, containers, and walls to perceive what lies within or beyond.\" The other is medical clairvoyance, \"the ability to see disease and illness in the human body, either by reading the aura or seeing the body as transparent\" (Guiley 1991, 111-113). Needless to say, perhaps, as with other forms of ESP, nei\u00ad ther of these alleged abilities has been scientifically verified. Let's look at each in turn. X-Ray Clairvoyance Demonstrations of X-ray clairvoyance date back many centuries, as do revelations that they could be accom\u00ad plished by deception. For example, in the six\u00ad teenth century, Reginald Scot explained how a trickster could use a confederate, or accom\u00ad plice, to receive secret informa\u00ad tion. \"By this means,\" he wrote in his classic treatise. The Discoverie of Witchcraft (1564), \"If you have ainc invention [that is, any inventiveness] you may seem to doo a hundreth miracles, and to discover the secrets of a mans thoughts or words spoken a far off.\" Just such feats were being performed in 1831 by the \"Double-sighted Phenom\u00ad enon,\" an eight-year-old Scottish lad named Louis Gordon M'Kean. Blind\u00ad folded and facing away from the audi\u00ad ence, the kilted youth readily identi\u00ad fied watches, coins, snuffboxes, and the like. He could also repeat what others had spoken, even though they has been the cele- \"second 18 volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER whispered the words at a distance of a hundred yards (Nickell 1992, 70). In die following decade came similar performances by an English woman known only as \"the Mysterious Lady.\" She appeared at the Egyptian Hall in Picadilly in 1845 and also toured New England, where she apparently came to die atten\u00ad tion of Nathaniel Hawthorne. He por\u00ad \"The Mysterious Lady\" was Scotland's John Henry Ander\u00ad son, styled the \"Wizard of die North.\" In his magic act he featured his blindfolded daughter, billed as \"die Second-Sighted Sybil.\" Anderson would leave the stage for this routine, going into the audience to select the objects for remote viewing (Dawes 1979, 110-111). To thwart skeptics who might have guessed a prearranged code was used, some performers utilized a method in which not a single word was uttered. Such a version was employed in 1848 by the great French conjurer Robert- Houdin (from whom young Ehrich Weiss would later derive the name Houdini). He performed his \"La Second Vue\" (i.e., \"Second Sight\") with his young son, Emile. The boy's eyes were bandaged and his father merely rang a bell to indicate when an object was being held up for identification. There are many clever ways of accomplishing such a feat (Nickell 1992, 73-74). The ability to see while apparently securely blindfolded is a magician's secret employed by many who lay claim to mysterious powers. One such alleged power is known variously as dermo- optical perception, paroptic vision, skin vision, or simply eyeless sight. Sup\u00ad posedly, this involves reading printed matter by means of the fingertips, divin\u00ad ing colors by holding objects to the cheek, or similar demonstrations. The reputed phenomenon has appeared in various guises over the centuries, being associated, for example, with mes\u00ad merism in the 1840s. Experimental work in both the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1960s sparked new interest in eyeless sight For example, in 1962 a Soviet newspaper reported that Rosa Kuleshova, a twenty- two-year-old patient, could read with her middle finger and accurately describe magazine pictures. Before long, other Soviet women had discovered that they also possessed this amazing gift. Ninel Kulagina, a housewife in Leningrad, was not only able to read while blindfolded but could also propel small objects across a table, apparendy by mere concentration (Christopher 1975, 77-86). In the United States, Life magazine carried accounts of the Russian marvels in its issue of June 12, 1964. Years ear\u00ad lier, in its April 19, 1937, issue, Life had already featured the phenomenon of dermo-optical perception. At that time it was being demonstrated by a thirteen- year-old California lad named Pat Marquis, \"the boy with the X-ray eyes.\" Alas, each of the various X-ray won\u00ad ders was soon discredited. Pat Marquis was tested by ESP pioneer J. B. Rhine and caught peeking down his nose. When the Soviet marvels were tested in ways that did not allow them to benefit from peek\u00ad ing, die remarkable phenomenon ceased. As magicians know, it is difficult to prevent a determined trickster from peeking, since there are numerous means of making it possible. For example, one ten-year-old Soviet girl took advantage of her turned-up nose, which helped her to circumvent a pair of opaque goggles. As well, many circus entertainers, such as high-wire walkers, jugglers, knife throw\u00ad ers, and archers, have long employed trick blindfolds (Christopher 1975 81-86; Gardner 1987, 63-73). Among the most famous of rhe eye\u00ad less-sight feats is the celebrated \"blindfold drive,\" which has a long and colorful his\u00ad tory. The \"thought reader\" Washington Irving Bishop (1856-1889) performed it with a horse-drawn carriage in the late 1880s, and many others followed suit. In modern times an automobile has been used. I have performed the feat myself, wearing an examined blindfold followed by a black cloth sack placed over rhe head and tied at die neck (see figures 1 and 2). Laymen observing such feats often come up with imaginative theories to explain them. A British performer\u2014 only one in a long line of claimants to the tide \"The Man With the X-ray Eyes\"\u2014prompted several unique guesses when he drove a car around a farmyard. One observer opined that the alleged visionary had \"fiber optics up his nose,\" another that he possessed \"supersensi\u00ad tive hearing which detected the sound of squeaking mice hidden in straw bales.\" The actual secrets are far simpler (Nickell 1992, 69-80). But what of a performer whose abil\u00ad ity to perceive is limited neither by blindfolding nor shielding by solid metal? Such a \"phenomenal mysti- the Great Houdini Joaquin Maria Argamasilla, \"the Spaniard with X-ray Eyes.\" He could tell time from a watch whose case was snapped shut or read a calling card or message locked in a box. Houdini investigated the Spanish marvel in 1924. Noting first that Argamasilla used a simple blindfold and was obviously peeking, Houdini maneu\u00ad vered into a position behind the mysti- fier that enabled him to peer over Argamasilla's shoulder. Houdini discov\u00ad ered that, upon receiving a watch, the Spaniard opened it a trifle under cover of a sweeping motion, and that the lid of the padlocked box allowed a corner to be raised slightly to permit a brief glimpse of the contents. Houdini offered a test by supplying two boxes, neither of which could be opened even slightly. He later wrote, \"Argamasilla railed by refusal to make a test in both instances\" (Gibson and Young 1953, 248-257). Another X-ray clairvoyant appeared on The Jerry Springer Show in 1992, seeming to successfully divine the con\u00ad tents of a locked and guarded refriger\u00ad ator. I was on the show as well and was suspicious of the whole performance. I challenged the marvel to a test of his ability using sealed envelopes, which he failed. Later, I analyzed a videotape of the fridge stunt. The descriptions of the various items were not visually accurate (for instance the psychic described a \"carton\" rather than a jug of milk) but only cognitively so\u2014con\u00ad sistent with the hypothesis that the alleged clairvoyant had been tipped off as to the refrigerator's contents (Nickell 2001, 54-59). SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 19 To date, no one has demonstrated convincingly, under suitably controlled conditions, the existence of X-ray sight or any other form of clairvoyance or ESP Medical Clairvoyance The other type of alleged clairvoyance that is relevant to the Girl with X-ray Eyes is medical intuition, a resurgent pseudoscientific fad based on so-called \"energy medicine.\" It involves psychi\u00ad cally divining people's illnesses and, often, recommending treatment. The approach is as ancient as it is primitive, being akin to the magical, div- inatory efforts of die shaman, medicine man, or witch doctor, or the practice of astrological medicine in the Middle Ages (Porter 1997, 14, 25). A forerunner of modern spiritualists, Andrew Jackson Davis (1826-1910) was known as the \"Poughkeepsie Seer\" for diagnosing ill\u00ad nesses while in a \"Clairvoyant \"Sleeping Prophet\" Edgar Cayce (1877-1945) who gave diagnostic and prescriptive readings while supposedly hypnotized. His early studies of osteopa\u00ad thy, homeopadiy, and other quaint theo\u00ad ries of healings influenced his approach, and in addition to osteopathic manipu\u00ad lations he prescribed electrical treat\u00ad ments, special diets, and various strange remedies. According to Martin Gardner (1957, 218) these included such medi\u00ad cines as \"oil of smoke\" (to treat a leg sore), \"peach-tree poultice\" (for a baby's convulsions), and \"bedbug juice\" (to treat dropsy). Cayce's touted successes at diagnosis and treatment are not surprising. He was obviously aided in his diagnoses by die letters he received usually containing specific details about die illnesses for which readings were sought. Moreover, Cayce's responses were laced widi such expressions as \"perhaps\" and \"I feel diat,\" as he avoided positive declara\u00ad tions. Even so, sometimes he gave his supposedly psychic diagnoses for per\u00adsons who had already died! (Randi 1982, 189-192) As to Cayce's supposedly successful treatments, diey seem nothing more than those often claimed by \"alterna\u00ad tive\" medical practices including faith healing. Successes may simply be due to the body's natural healing ability, the spontaneous remission of some condi\u00ad tions, the placebo effect, delayed results of prior medical intervention, and other factors, including misdiagnosis and selective reporting of positive outcomes. (The dead do not give testimonials. See Nickell 1998, 131-166.) In recent years, die practice of medical clairvoyance gained new impetus from some popular books. One, published in 1996, was Second Sight, written by Judith Orloff, M.D., a psychiatrist who fancies she has psychic abilities. Another book was the 1997 best-selling Why People Don't Heal and How They Can, by Caroline Myss, \"who has a background in theology\" (Koontz 2000, 102). is typical of other self-styled \"medical intu- itives,\" Orloff and Myss have with a fantasy-prone per\u00ad sonality (Nickell 2004, 214-216). ability com\u00ad bines features of bodi X-ray clairvoyance and medical clairvoyance. I find it a curious admixture. For example, she declined my sug\u00ad gestion that she attempt to identify simple, easily recognizable objects\u2014 such as a pair of scissors\u2014merely placed inside my sport coat. 1 thought this a far easier and potentially less ambiguous test than having to look through both clothing and flesh and trying to identify subtle alterations in organs. However, she told me (through a translator) that\u2014inexplic\u00ad ably\u2014she could only \"see\" through living tissue, leaving me to wonder if some of her touted successes were not dependent on the ambiguity diat nec\u00ad essarily resulted from such a descrip\u00ad tive process. On die other hand, while a few med\u00ad ical intuitives purport to see die body as transparent, most do not, instead claim\u00ad ing to get dieir knowledge by reading the subject's \"aura\" or by some odier\u2014even more remote\u2014means. (Some nine- teendi-century practitioners had curious techniques: one offered \"Medical Diagnosis by Lock of Hair,\" while another worked via his \"Spirit- Physicians\" [Medium 1975].) Natasha's claimed power, then, is rather distinctive, but it also seems nonexistent. In Britain she appeared on ITV's This Morning and, at first, impressed the program's resident physi\u00ad cian, Chris Steele, saying he might have problems with his stomach, liver, pan\u00ad creas, and kidneys; however, subsequent medical tests revealed Natasha's claims to be erroneous. For the results of her CSICOP test, see the accompanying articles by Ray Hyman (pp. 27-33) and Andrew Skolnick (pp. 34-37). References Baty, Phil. 2004.

Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER THINKING ABOUT SCIENCE MASSIMO PIGLIUCCI The So-called Gaia Hypothesis Is Earth a living organism? Broadly speaking, diis is die chief claim of a family of ecological theories often referred to as \"Gaia\" (from the Greek god\u00ad dess of die earth). The idea was proposed in the 1960s by atmospheric scientist James Lovelock, and elaborated in the early 1970s by him in collaboration with biologist Lynn Margulis (author of the widely accepted theory that many sub\u00ad cellular organelles, like mitochondria and chloroplasts, were once living organisms that began a symbiotic relationship with other cells). The Gaia hypothesis is often taught in mainstream college-level courses in ecology, despite being a hopeless mix of pseudoscience, bad science, and mysti\u00ad cism. It dierefore provides an ideal topic of discussion for diis column, widi our focus on how science works and what dis\u00ad tinguishes science from pseudoscience. One reason the theory is slippery and difficult to address is because there are several forms of it, with claims tang\u00ad ing from the trivial and uncontroversial (the Earth is a complex system with positive and negative feedback loops) to complete nonsense (Earth is a sentient and conscious being whose purpose is to keep life thriving). Lovelock and Margulis's original version was closer to the nonsense end of the spectrum. For example, Lovelock wrote that Gaia is a cybernetic system \"which seeks an opti\u00ad mal physical and chemical environment for life on this planet\" (quoted at http:// en.wikipedia.org\u2014a good, neutral introduction to the theory and contro\u00ad versy); or consider this statement: \"Earth's atmosphere is more than merely anomalous; it appears to be a contrivance specifically constituted for a set of purposes\" (Lovelock and Margulis 1974, source as above). Notice the reference to Gaia \"seeking\" an end- result, or it being \"a contrivance,\" with the clear implication of purpose. In response to harsh criticism in this regard, Lovelock and Margulis later retreated to a less controversial (but, alas, less interesting) position, even denying any previous intention to attribute purpose to Gaia: \"Nowhere in our writings do we express the idea that planetary self-regulation is purposeful, or involves foresight or planning by the biota\" (1990, source as above). Regardless, is there anything scientif\u00ad ically interesting in any version of the Gaia hypothesis? Let us consider two fundamental components of the theory: the idea that Earth is a complex system characterized by feedback loops; and the idea that the planet is, in some interest\u00ad ing sense, akin to a living organism. I will leave out of this discussion the most nonsensical member of the Gaia family of hypotheses, one claiming that the planet is a conscious being whose pur\u00ad pose is to keep life safe and sound. Notice, however, that it is something like the latter version that is diriving at the margin of academic circles and in the popular media, fueling mystical and New Age \"thought\" about \"mother Earth\" and other such pseudoscientific concepts. Given some of the quotes reported above, I think it is fair to hold Lovelock and Margulis at least partially responsible for yet another form of sloppy thinking and poor scientific liter\u00ad acy among the general public. Oh well. Back to the first component of me Gaia hypothesis: Earth seen as a complex system with feedbacks. Lovelock devel\u00ad oped a simple (some would say simplistic) computer simulation to make die point: his \"Daisyworld\" explores what would happen on a planet widi just two life forms, light daisies and dark daisies. The former ones reflect light (and cool the atmosphere), the latter ones absorb light (and warm up die atmosphere). The main result of the model is that, in response to a gradual increase of luminosity by the sun (a phenomenon that actually happened during the history of life on Earth) the population of daisies adjusts the frequency THE SO-CALLED GAIA HYPOTHESIS Continued on page 26 Massimo Pigliucci is a professor of evolu\u00ad tionary biology at SUNY Stony Brook, a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the author of Denying Evolution: Creationism, Scientism, and the Nature of Science.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 21 NOTES ON A STRANGE WORIP MASSIMO POLIDORO There's a UFO in My Painting! ^* \"T\" \"TTOs are not a recent I invention, they were ^^*S seen by our ances\u00ad tors as well!\" This is one of the typ\u00ad ical claims [hat can be found in books by Erich Von Daniken, Peter Kolosimo, and similar authors. The proof for it? A variety of strange objects depicted in paintings by some of rhe world's greatest artists. del The Madonna's Spaceship A typical example is the Madonna con Bambino e San Giovannino (Madonna and Child with the Infant Saint John) attributed to Sebastiano Mainardi or Jacopo Sellaio. The painting is from die end of the fifteendi century and is now on dis\u00ad play in the Sala d'Ercole in Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. Examining it, we see in the upper background, behind die Madonna, a strange oval shape sus\u00ad pended in the sky. Some UFOlogists describe it as \"an airborne object, leaden in color, inclined to port, sporting a 'dome' or 'turret,' apparently identifiable as an oval-shaped moving flying device.\" Massimo Polidoro is an investigator of the paranormal, author, lecturer, and co- founder and head of CICAP, the Italian skeptics group. His Web site is www. massimopolidoro. com. Carlo Crivelli's Annunciazione (Annunciation). In order to understand what this and other ancient paintings really portrayed, however, it is essential to learn how ancient artists really worked. \"Not one of those that see UFOs in paintings,\" says Italian art expert Diego Cuoghi, \"ever tries to understand the real sym\u00ad bolical meanings of those strange things in die art of that period, and so they take them as realistic depictions of unidentified flying objects seen live.\" The object in Mainardi's painting diose times,\" says Cuoghi, \"the subjects for paintings were almost exclusively of a religious nature and, in the case of the 'adorations,' like Mainardi's, there often appeared in the sky an angel or, as some apocryphal Gospels have it, a radiant cloud. Another example of this kind is in the Nativity of Lorenzo Monaco.\" The litde man on die right of the painting that shields his eyes looking at the sky is another typi\u00ad cal element of such paintings. However, that man does not appear to look at the radiant cloud, but at the Nativity Star and three other small stars (or flames) to the far left, a symbol of the \"trifold vir\u00ad ginity\" of the Madonna (before, during, and after the virgin birth). Crivelli's UFOs In Carlo Crivelli's Annunciazione (Annunciation), a i486 painting now on display at the National Gallery in London, some believe diat a UFO is in the sky and diat from it a ray of light comes down to touch the head of die Virgin Mary. All mystery mongering prints of diis painting show poor-quality repro\u00ad ductions of the details. However, it would be enough to visit die gallery or look at a better print of die painting to see that it is not a UFO at all. \"It's a vortex of angels in die clouds,\" says Cuoghi, \"a very com\u00ad mon artistic device used to represent die presence of God, and it can be seen in many Medieval and Renaissance religious paintings, like in Correggio's fresco at die Dome of Parma or in Gustave Dore's engraving of Canto XXI from Dante's Paradiso from his The Divine Comedy, but above all in most Anunciations and Baptisms of the Christ.\" Another Crivelli painting, the Madonna con Bambino (Madonna with Child) at die Pinacoteca of Ancona, is believed by some to show \"objects very 22 Volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER similar to modern nuclear missiles ready to launch\"! Those making such claims, however, never take die time to research the life of die artist, his work, or die place where die painting was originally displayed. It would be enough to compare this with odier paintings by die same artist, in fact, to establish that die \"missiles\" are actually towers and bell towers, like those that appear in almost all of Crivellis paintings. Anodier example is die famous Mayan bas-relief that Von Daniken and others believed represented an astronaut, but was actually a depiction of Pakal, die Maya . One cannot simply give a modern interpretation to events and depictions outside of dicir original Peter's Basilica at Montalcino, is one of die most famous \"UFOs\" in a painting. The mysterious \"spherical object with anten\u00ad nae\" that appears between Christ and God has frequently been referred to as \"Montakino's Sputnik,\" due to his similar\u00ad ity in appearance to the old Soviet satellites. In truth, the globe represents Creation, with the Sun on top and the Moon below left (some interpreted it as the periscope of the satellite!). The \"antennae\" are actually two sceptres held by Christ and God. The same kind of astronomical illus\u00ad tration on the Globe of Creation can be found in a painting by Pieter Coecke, depicting the Trinity and now on dis\u00ad play at Prado's Musem in Madrid. Here as well it is possible to see the Sun, the Earth, with the cone of shade, and the Moon, smaller, down below. \"The representations of Sun and Moon\" continues Diego Cuoghi \"have fre- quendy misled some UFOlogists who have completely misunderstood meir meaning. The majority of the crucifixion paintings and mosaics done in the Byzantine style, for example, show die same odd 'objects' on eidier side of die cross, die Sun and die Moon, and they are often represented with a human face or figure.\" An example of this is the sixteenth- century fresco Crucifixion of Christ located on the wall of the Visoki Decani Monastery in Kosovo, Yugoslavia. Some did interpret the Sun and the Moon as \"spaceships with a crew.\" \"Only those that are unfamiliar with artistic symbol- ogy of the time,\" says Cuoghi, \"can claim that these are mysterious elements.\" The Flying Hat In Paolo Uccello's Tebaide (also known as Scene di Vita Ermetica, or Scenes of Monastic Life), now at the Gallerie dell'Accademia, in Florence, some claim to see \"a saucer object, suspended in the air and surmounted by a red domed top. Red in color, the object comes out over the dark background by contrast. The dynamic movement of the flying object is rendered by means of light brush strokes, again red in color, which provide the effect of a sudden turn.\" One can't help but smile at such a description. When viewing die whole paint\u00ad ing (not just a close up of the red object) it is quite clear that the object is located inside a cave, on die ground beneath the crucifix\u00ad ion, and diat it represents a large red hat belonging to St. Jerome, who is seen praying before die crucified Christ. The first one to write about St. Jerome was Giovanni di Andrea of Bologna, and in his writings legend overruled historical truth. The same autlior gave precise details on how artists had to depict the Saint: \"Cum \"(\"With hat, of the kind still in vogue for cardinals, placed on the ground, and with meek lion.\") The hat in question is present in various representations of the Saint. UFO Invasion There are two other famous paint\u00ad ings where flying saucers are said to be represented. One is the Baptism of Christ by Aert DeGelder, now at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. In this painting, a UFO seems to light from above the scene of Christ's baptism. Actually, the \"thing\" in the sky is not a flying saucer but a circle of light with a dove inside, a typical representation for the Holy Spirit. The scene repro\u00ad duces exactly the description in the Gospels and is also represented in the same way in other paintings of the time. The other UFOlogical painting is the Miracolo delta neve (Miracle of the Snow) by Masolino Da Panicale, painted in 1428 and on display at the Museo Nazionale di Capodimontc, Naples. Here the mystery mongers claim to see \"a UFO invasion\" in die clouds above the scene. But those lenticular clouds are not infrequent subjects in the artworks of the fif\u00ad teenth century. \"It is to represent clouds,\" says Cuoghi, \"such non-realism was seen in the sacred art of the first half of the fif\u00ad teenth century.\" As for the event depicted in the painting, a snowfall in August, it can certainly be seen as an extraordinary event, but not an impos\u00ad sible one. Exceptional atmospheric events of this kind are sometimes recorded in Italy. Unseasonal snow, for example, took place on the seaside of Calabria on May 12, 1755; in Lunigiana on July 1, 1756, in Bologna on June 1, 1481; and recently in Prato on August 5, 2000. The memory of such an extraordinary events might easily be handed down through the centuries, gaining details and particu\u00ad lars and being transformed into the \"miracle of the snow.\" Aliens Everywhere! \"The method used by so-called UFO hunters,\" concludes Cuoghi, \"requires no knowledge whatsoever on the history of an. What you need is just to pick up a book with reproduction of paintings, better if painted before the seventeenth century, and try to find any little object that may have a lenticular shape. This way, you will find no difficulty at all in locating elements that may appear bizarre and out of place. Now, you only need to claim that these objects are inconsistent to the time, place, or con\u00ad text of the artwork, and so you can cer\u00ad tainly term them as 'alien' or 'unidenti\u00ad fied.' And so, you can now call yourself an 'ancient UFOs' expert!\" Reference A detailed study by Diego Cuoghi on UFOs in ancient paintings can be found at www. sprezzatura.it/Anc/Ane_UFO_cng.htm. LJ SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/lime 2005 23 PSYCHIC VIBRATIONS ROBERT SHEAFFER Tsunami Conspiracies and Hollow Moons Almost as soon as the scope of the destruction became clear from the recent tragic tsunami that devastated much of coastal southern Asia, claims began to surface of strange events associated with it. Humans are pattern-seekers, and to many it seems impossible that an event so awesome and destructive could occur without at least some violation of the natural order, no matter how small. One of the first survivors of die dis\u00ad aster to return to Britain, nurse Debbie Bates, told the Daily Record (December 28, 2004), '\"I saw a palmist the day before [in Sri Lanka]. He said, 'Stay out of the sea, big wave coming.' At the time, I thought it was a joke\u2014now I just think it is freaky.\" Unfortunately, we don't know how many thousands of people may have received that same warning for days on which nothing unusual happened. Indeed, given the popular custom of visiting fortune-tellers in Thailand and other Asian countries, it seems remarkable that there was any\u00ad one left unwarned, unless the prognosti- cators tliemselves were equally in the dark. Meanwhile, a prominent Thai for\u00ad tune teller blamed the tsunami on the \"bad luck\" of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. of the International Astrology Robert Sheaffer's World Wide Web page for UFOs and other skeptical subjects is at www. debunker. com. People from a nearby camp for the displaced bathe in a river January 26. 2005, in the tsunami-ravaged town of Meulaboh. Indonesia. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Association, said that Thailand's astro\u00ad logical sign was already under the adverse influence of four ill-omened stars and, worse yet, one of the stars was further aggravated by malicious influ\u00ad ence from Thaksin's astrological sign (The Nation, Bangkok, December 28). Once the tizzy over the mostly clueless fortune-tellers died down, media outlets were rushing to report how ani\u00ad mals seemed to have a \"sixth sense\" caus\u00ad ing most of them to avoid die coming tsunami. H.D. Ratnayake, deputy direc\u00ad tor of Sri Lanka's Wildlife Department, told Reuters, \"No elephants are dead, not even a dead hare or rabbit. I think ani\u00ad mals can sense disaster. They have a sixth sense. They know when things are hap\u00ad pening.\" Even the National Geographic News was reporting (January 4) anec\u00ad dotes of how \"elephants screamed and ran for higher ground\" and \"Dogs refused to go outdoors.\" What is usually not mentioned is that the tsunami was preceded by an extremely powerful earth\u00ad quake, capable of alarming bodi man and beast. Furthermore, it does not appear to be the case that wild animals cluster along die ocean's open shore in the same manner that humans do\u2014diey usually 24 Volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER prefer to remain hidden in the relative safety of the forest. Lynette Hart, an animal researcher at the University of California\u2014Davis, explained to the Sacramento Bee (January 14) that many animals are exquisitely sensitive ro sounds and to vibrations in the ground. \"It may only take one antelope becoming frightened by sensory changes to communicate, 'Let's get out of here,' and they all go.\" Andy Michael, a geophysicist at die U.S. Geological Survey, told National Geographic, \"What we're faced with is a lot of anecdotes. Animals react to so many things\u2014being hungry, defending their territories, mating, predators\u2014so it's hard to have a controlled study to get that advanced warning signal.\" Next, just as predictably, the con\u00ad spiracy theories began to emerge (these usually don't surface immediately, as it takes a while to cook them up). The Egyptian Nationalist weekly Al-Usbu published an investigative report by Mahmoud Bakri on January 1. In it he suggests that the earthquake and tsunami were a consequence of secret nuclear testing by the U.S., Israel, and India: \"The three most recent tests appeared to be genuine American and Israeli preparations to act together with India to test a way to liquidate human\u00ad ity. In the[ir| most recent test, they began destroying entire cities over extensive areas. Although the nuclear explosions were carried out in desert lands, tens of thousands of kilometers away from populated areas, they had a direct effect on these areas.\" These alleged nuclear tests \"destabilized the tectonic plates,\" leading to disaster. A (possibly fictitious) American scientist was quoted saying \"the center of an earthquake that took place some forty kilometers under the ocean floor could not have caused such destruction unless nuclear testing had been conducted close to the tectonic plates in these countries, or unless several days previ\u00ad ously there had been [nuclear] activity that caused these plates to shift and col\u00ad lide.\" A Saudi professor attributed the tragedy to divine retribution for homo\u00ad sexuality and fornication, while various religious leaders warned that it was caused by corruption, the presence of infidels, and other sins (see http:// memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=archiv es&Area=sd&ID=SP84205). Abd Al-Baset Al-Sayyed of the Egyptian National Research Center said in an interview on Al-Majd TV on January 16 that NASA had discovered that Earth is emitting short-wave radia\u00ad tion. \"When they discovered this radia\u00ad tion, they started to zoom in, and they found that it emanates from Mecca\u2014 and, to be precise, from die Ka'ba\" (see www.memritv.org/Transcript.aspPP 1 =545). What's more, diey radia\u00ad tion was \"infinite.\" NASA found diat the radiation extends well past Mars, apparently extending to \"the celestial Ka'ba,\" effectively connecting heaven and earth. NASA, says Al-Sayyed, had this information on their Web site for twenty-one days, but then took it down, apparendy as part of yet another cover- up of amazing findings in outer space. * * * Speaking of NASA, the recent, highly successful Cassini mission to Saturn has returned a wealth of scientific data, especially the Huygens probe that landed on Saturn's moon Titan, the first such landing on a planetary satellite other than our own Moon. However, NASA conspiracy theorist Richard Hoagland, the chief promoter of die \"Face on Mars,\" claims he has made dra\u00ad matic discoveries from its photos, not of Titan, but instead of Saturn's moon lapetus, an unusual body having one rel\u00ad atively dark hemisphere and one lighter: In our opinion, Cassini's discovery of \"the Great Wall of lapetus\" now forces serious reconsideration of a range of staggering possibilities . . . that some will most certainly find upsetting: it could really be a \"wall\" ... a vast, planet spanning, artificial construct!!... There is no viable geo\u00ad logical model to explain a sixty thou- sand-foot-high, sixty thousand-foot- wide, entire planetary hemi\u00ad sphere\u2014let alone, located in the precise plane of its equator! (See www.enter- prisemission.com/moon I .htm.) Hoagland has further discovered that some of Iapetus's craters appear to be somewhat \"square,\" and are allegedly lined up along north-south, east-west lines: \"Clearly these are not random, 'square craters'\u2014but remarkable, highly ordered evidence of sophisticated, aligned, repeating architectural relief! . . . The impression of a vast set of extremely ancient ruins\u2014most now without roofs, but with ample surviving walls\u2014cov\u00ad ered unavoidable.\" Stressing the near-impossibility of these structures being built by living creatures on the surface of a cold, airless, waterless world, Hoagland leaps to a conclusion that presupposes an even greater engineering impossibility: \"what if lapetus is not a natural satellite at all . . . but a 900-mile wide spacecraft\u2014an artificial 'moon?!'.\" He suggests that lapetus was assembled millions of years ago by some alien intelligence using the principles of Buckminster Fuller's geo\u00ad desic domes, and that many of are in fact \"deformed hexagons,\" where the moon's surface is collapsing from eons of meteoritic erosion, reveal\u00ad ing the underlying hexagonal supports. My brief summary cannot possibly do justice to the zaniness of Hoagland's \"hollow lapetus\" dieory\u2014you need to read the original on his Web site. It is telling that Hoagland does not discuss the problem that his \"hollow lapetus\" theory poses in accounting for that moon's measured mean density of about 1.21 grams per cubic centimeter, less than our own moon's but greater dian that of Saturn. This is perplexing, since he begins die piece arguing that Iapetus's relatively low density and slow rotation means that the centrifugal force at the equator would be extremely small. It's too bad that Hoagland didn't follow through and give us any calculations designed to show how it would be pos\u00ad sible for an essentially hollow sphere to have a mean density greater than that of water. He must have realized die fatal flaw this calculation would pose for his wild assertion, which is why he avoids the subject. A NASA Web site notes: \"Cassini's next close encounter with lapetus will occur in September 2007. The resolution of images from that flyby should be 100 times better than the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 20C5 25 ones currently being analyzed. The hope is that the increased detail may shed light on lapetus's amazing features and the question of whether it has been volcanically active in the past\" (see www.nasa.gov/niission_pages/cassini/ media/cassini-010705- html). Until then, we can only wonder what Hoagland's amazing \"artificial struc\u00ad tures\"\u2014which, like all allegedly anom\u00ad alous objects photographed, are near the limit of resolution of the cameras\u2014 will look like with one hundred times finer detail revealed. \u00bb * * Last December 8 The Telegraph of London carried an item written by Uri Geller, the noted Israeli-born spoon bender, about an \"alien egg\" allegedly given to him by the late John Lennon. According to Geller, he, Lennon, and Lennon's wife Yoko Ono were having dinner in a New York restaurant one THE SO-CALLED GAIA HYPOTHESIS Continued from page 21 of the two types, and the overall tempera\u00ad ture of the planet remains constant (and favorable to the survival of the daisies). While this is interesting, it is also not particularly surprising. Self-regulatory systems (more complex than Daisy- world) are well known to ecologists and planetary scientists, and they are fairly well understood in their mechanics. Moreover, a related claim that Daisy- world shows that self-regulating behav\u00ad ior can emerge without selection is sim\u00ad ply false: the population of light and dark daisies evolves to adjust its own fre\u00ad quency and co-evolves with the environ\u00ad ment in which the daisies live (inciden\u00ad tally, the coevolution of organisms and their environment isn't a new idea either). The simulation doesn't superfi\u00ad cially look like biological evolution only because the underlying genetics of the system has been subsumed in the struc\u00ad ture of the equations defining the model, but evolution occurs nonethe\u00ad less. And it is evolution (by natural selection) that is the only known mech\u00ad anism that produces complex self- regulation in living organisms. evening when Lennon surprised him with the following account: About six months ago, I was asleep in my bed, with Yoko, at home, in the Dakota Building. And suddenly, I wasn't asleep. Because there was this blazing light round the door. It was shining through the cracks and the keyhole, like someone was out there with searchlights, or the apart\u00ad ment was on fire. .. . There were these four people out there. . . . They were, like, little. Bug-like. Big bug eyes and little bug mouths and they were scuttling at me like roaches . . . 1 tried to throw them out, but, when I took a step towards them, they kind of pushed me back. I mean, they didn't touch me. It was like they just willed me. Pushed me with willpower and telepathy. (See www. telegraph. co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml =/arts/2004/12/08/ftgeller08.xm.) Today, \"insectoid\" aliens play a sig\u00ad nificant role in many stories of UFO abductions, which was not the case More important, even if we grant that Daisyworld tells us something interest\u00ad ing about self-regulatory systems, it does not follow that we can jump to the sec\u00ad ond, more interesting and controversial, claim of the Gaia theory: that Earth itself is in any meaningful sense a living organ\u00ad ism. First, we know of clearly nonliving systems that achieve self-regulation. For example, the classical studies by Ilya Prigogine on nonequilibrium thermo\u00ad dynamics and emergent complexity have shown how sets of chemical reactions (e.g., the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reac\u00ad tion) can achieve stable, self-regulating equilibria, just like living organisms. Yet nobody in his right mind would suggest that a Belousov-Zhabotinskii system is a living being! Second, and most important. Love\u00ad lock and Margulis seem to be missing the obvious mark, as pointed out by Richard Dawkins in an early critique of the Gaia hypothesis (back in 1983): Living organ\u00ad isms, as we understand rhem, are entities capable of much more than just metabo\u00ad lism and homeostasis (self-regulated equi\u00ad librium). They are capable of evolving by differential reproduction. No reproduction, no evolution, no living being; and the last when Lennon allegedly related this account. So either John Lennon was a pioneering \"experiencer\" of a now- common alien encounter, or else Geller made up this story long after Lennon's death. The next thing that Lennon could reportedly remember, he was back in bed with Yoko, left holding a smooth, metallic egg-like object he subsequently gave to Geller in the hopes that Uri could figure it out. Says Geller, \"1 have a strong sensation that John knew more about this object than he told me. Maybe it didn't come with an instruc\u00ad tion manual, but I think John knew what it was for. And whatever that pur\u00ad pose was\u2014communication? Healing? A first-class intergalactic ticket?\u2014it scared him.\" Yet despite all the hype, Geller seems to have made no attempt to initi\u00ad ate any serious scientific analysis of his potentially miraculous \"egg.\" time I checked there aren't any baby Earths out there in the process of popu\u00ad lating the solar system.... But, one could object, Gaia is just a metaphor, aren't the critics being a bit too harsh about it? Yes and no. Yes, Gaia is a metaphor, and science cannot do without metaphors. But no, the criticisms have not been too harsh because metaphors have to do some work in order to be beneficial in sci\u00ad ence. Thinking of Earth as a living organism doesn't do any useful work, in the sense that it doesn't generate any new insight or testable hypotheses about emergent systems or ecosystem ecology (Daisyworld isn't a new way of thinking about self-emergence, and it doesn't make predictions that can be empirically tested). On the contrary, Gaia seems to have done mostly nega\u00ad tive work, in the sense of having encouraged sloppy thinking about what living beings are and how they work, as well as what sort of system our planet really is. So, please let Greek gods and goddesses rest in peace on Mount Olympus, and let us get back to developing a much-needed real science of planetary ecology. 26 volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER TESTING 'THE GIRL WITH X-RAY EYES' Testing Natasha Can a seventeen-year-old girl truly \"see\" inside a person's body? Ray Hyman and colleagues conducted tests to search for the truth inside The Girl with X-Ray Eyes. RAY HYMAN Our assignment might seem straightforward. A seventeen-year-old Russian girl, Natasha Demkina, says she can look at people and \"see\" the status of their internal organs. The Discovery Channel asked Richard Wiseman, Andrew Skolnick, and me to test her claim for their television program, The Girl with X-ray Eyes. You might think that testing Natasha's claims would be routine. The test of a psychic claim, however, is rarely cut-and-dried. Most such claims do have much in common. Each also offers unique challenges. We had to conduct the test of Natasha's claim to fit the constraints of a television program. We had only a month to devise a protocol that would be acceptable to all parties. After everyone agreed to the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 27 procedure, we had less than a week to locate a testing site in New York City and to find seven willing and suitable test subjects.' The Claim and Its Support Monica Garnsey, director and producer of the program, told us how Natasha operates and what she claimed to do. Many news sources and reports on the Internet described her accomplishments. (This information was consistent with what wc observed when Natasha diagnosed volunteers at the Open Center in New York City the day before the test.) Garnsey e-mailed us the following information from Russia, where she was taping material for the television program: I double-checked a few things with her last night. Since the age of ten, a few days after having a religious dream, and also having had an operation to have her appendix removed that went wrong, swabs were left in her and she had to have another operation, Natasha has claimed to be able to sec into people... . Natasha can see through clothing, but not see what someone is holding behind their back. She cannot see inside people if she shuts her eyes. Daylight is better. She does not need to talk to them to diagnose. She can also diagnose from a photograph. She usually scans people all over first, by making them stand up fully clothed and looking them up and down; delivers a general diagnosis; and then goes into more detail when the patients have discussed their concerns with her. She says she can certainly see ribs, heart, lungs, initially in general \"like in an anatomy book,\" but can see right down to the cell level if she concentrates. She says that she can examine the whole body, but it can give her a bad headache if she docs too much. The idea of restricting the test to the chest area appeals [to her], though her claims extend further than that. Natasha's story is like thousands of other accounts. Alleged psychics and dieir supporters make claims that, if true, defy the physical limitations and laws of modern science. The pro\u00ad ponents support die reality of these claims with testimonials of outstanding successes. They argue for the reality of the claim passionately and unreservedly. Although some proponents have had scientific training, none of die supporting evidence comes from well-controlled scientific studies. In the long history of psychical research, not one of these claims has produced convincing scientific evidence for die existence of paranormal ability (see Joe Nickell's column in diis issue, p. 18). A few researchers have claimed that they did have scientific proof for a paranormal claim. Scrutiny by other scientists, however, showed that the \"scientific Proof' had seri\u00ad ous flaws. Furthermore, none of these claims could be inde\u00ad pendently replicated. The evidence supporting Natasha's abilities comes from selected anecdotes of reactions to her readings. No matter how subjectively compelling, the context of such readings makes it impossible to separate how much of die apparent success is due to such possibilities as: guessing; external clues from die Ray Hyman is emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Oregon.

A meaningful test would allow Natasha to show her powers and, simultaneously, control for guessing and the use of normal sensory clues. Problems With Testimonial Support of Natasha's Claims The stories told by Natasha's proponents are consistent with her having X-ray vision. This does not show diat she does have X-ray vision because die same stories are consistent widi many odier alternatives. Two possibilities are the following: 1) her statements have no connection with the client's condition but appear to do so because of luck, selective reporting, and/or odier reasons diat I will discuss; or 2) her statements accurately reflect the subject's condition, but this information comes through normal means such as the subject's appearance and behavior. Consider, first, the ways that her statements can falsely appear to describe the patient's condition. 28 Volume 29.

The subjects are wearing opaque glasses to prevent communication through eye move\u00ad ment. The head test proctor. Ray Hyman, is sitting in the bottom right corner. Photo credit: Andrew A. Skolnick. Similarly, when she tells the clients something that disagrees with previous medical diagnoses, they still credit her with a hit; the clients and her support\u00ad ers argue that she picked up on some\u00ad thing that the medical professionals missed. We witnessed some examples of this when wc watched her giving read\u00ad ings to volunteers at the Open Center in New York. She told one volunteer that she saw a problem with his right shoul\u00ad der. After the reading, this volunteer told Monica that he had not previously realized something was wrong with his shoulder. Neither his previous medical examinations nor anything in his expe\u00ad rience suggested something was wrong with his shoulder. I thought, as a result, he might be skeptical about Natasha's claim. Instead, he was impressed. He decided she had detected a problem that neither he nor his doctors had noticed. She Might Have No Knowledge About the Client's Condition But Get Credit Anyway Natasha has been giving readings to a steady flow of clients for more than six years. By now die number of such readings is huge. Her supporters naturally emphasize the most striking examples of apparent hits. The number of diseases and internal parts that could be defective is limited. Some conditions, such as cancer and heart problems, are more common dian others. We should expect that her supporters will find some examples of \"correct\" diagnoses. With so many diagnoses, a certain num\u00ad ber will match the client's condition just by chance. To evaluate a diagnostic procedure properly we need to clearly decide what is a \"hit\" and what is a \"miss.\" Most important, we should set the criteria before we know the outcome. In Natasha's readings, no clear and objective standards were ever established. This allows for her generally vague utterances to be retrofitted to what die client or observer knows to be true. An example of such retrofitting occurred when Natasha was doing a reading in London. Dr. Chris Steele, described by The Daily Mail (January 29, 2004) as one of her champions, was observing. The newspa\u00ad per quotes him as saying, \"Natasha doesn't know any medical terms at die moment. WitJi one person this week she was trying to describe a kidney stone, and her translator came up widi die words, 'sand' and 'gravel' before I suggested stones. When kidney stones start off, tiiey do look like sand.\" Dr. Steele gives her credit for correcdy diagnosing kidney stones. Yet we have no idea what Natasha was \"seeing\" or what she had in mind. Dr. Steele made the medical diagnosis, not Natasha. Other features of Natasha's readings foster the illusion of accuracy. When she tells clients something diat agrees with previous medical diagnoses, they credit her with a hit. Possibilities of Natasha Picking Up Clues by Non-paranormal Means I have described just some ways that testimonials can appear to support Natasha's claim even if she is picking up no informa\u00ad tion about her clients. Those possibilities would suffice to make such testimonials useless as evidence for her ability. The testimonials become even more suspect when we realize how the circumstances of her readings allow her to pick up infor\u00ad mation about her client without having X-ray vision. Natasha is looking directly at her client when she does her diagnosis. This means that we cannot rule out die possibility that she is picking up clues from subde (and not-so-subtle) client reac\u00ad tions. To make matters worse, the clients begin a session by asking Natasha questions about their concerns. This provides obvious clues about their condition. I watched one reading where the client began asking Natasha about her back. This narrows considerably the number of possibilities diat Natasha needs to consider. Natasha can also gain considerable infor\u00ad mation from verbal exchanges with the client. Another source of clues is how the clients react, bodi ver\u00ad bally and nonverbally, to her statements. Some of her clients say that they find it unsettling when Natasha is staring at them. This could enhance die tendency for individuals to react to her statements widi subtle, unwitting bodily movements, breathing changes, pupil dilations, and other signs of emotional and cog- nitive states. Although psychological research has documented how humans frequently provide unconscious clues to their cur\u00ad rent thoughts and emotions, most people seem unaware of this possibility. The research also shows diat subtle clues can influ\u00ad ence us without our consciously realizing it. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 29 One classic case involved the German horse Clever Hans.-' In the early twentieth century, Hans became a celebrity in Germany and throughout the world. People could ask him questions about addition, the identity of musical pieces, about foreign words, spelling, and many other topics. Hans would answer by tapping his hoof or by nudging an alphabet board with his nose. He usually was correct. Prominent educators certified that he had the intelligence and competence of a thir\u00ad teen- or fourteen-year-old German student. Oskar Pfungst, a German psychologist, investigated Hans with exemplary thor\u00ad oughness. He eventually discovered that Hans was clever only in having \"horse sense.\" Typically, a questioner would focus on the horse's right hoof, which Hans used to tap out the answer. When questioners focused on the hoof, they would almost imperceptibly lean forward and become tense as they watched the horse tap out the answer. This slight leaning and tensing were Hans's cues to begin tapping. When Hans had tapped the appropriate number of times, the questioner would uncon\u00ad sciously relax and move his or her head upwards very slightly. Often this movement was one millimeter or less. This was Hans's clue to stop tapping. Pfungst then carried out experiments to confirm this find\u00ad ing. He played the role of Hans. He would invite people to stand beside him and think of a number. Pfungst would then begin tapping with his right hand. He would stop when he thought he detected a very slight bodily movement\u2014usually a very slight displacement of the subject's head. These move\u00ad ments were extremely subtle, rarely more than a millimeter in extent. Pfungst amazed his volunteers, stopping his tapping at the number they had in mind. Pfungst tried this experiment with twenty-five persons ranging in age from five years to adult. He succeeded in pick\u00ad ing up cues from all but two of them. They insisted they were unaware of giving him any information. Pfungst used the same method to divine other kinds of thoughts the subjects had in mind. The subjects again denied that they had provided any clues about what they were thinking. Other psychological experiments have confirmed these results. Some skilled per\u00ad formers have made careers out of pretending to read minds when, in fact, they were relying upon subtle and unwitting clues provided by their volunteers. Some reports supporting Natasha's claim describe outcomes consistent with the possibility that she is picking up such clues. For example, a Russian reporter says that he became a convert to Natasha's cause when she found the exact spot on his arm where he had fractured his wrist many years before. In another case, a reporter from a British tabloid validated Natasha's abil\u00ad ity when Natasha succeeded in identifying the location of the fractures she had received in an accident. Both cases seem ideal for picking up the sorts of dues that Pfungst found that most people provide without realizing they are doing so. What I have just written does not show that Natasha lacks X-ray vision. We do not know from the evidence offered by her proponents whether she does or does not have a paranorm\u00ad al capacity to see into people's bodies. What we do know is that the accounts that seem to support Natasha's claim are con\u00ad sistent with both normal and paranormal possibilities. We also know that nonparanormal mechanisms can and do operate in the real world. We do not know that paranormal ability, such as that claimed for Natasha, exists. So far, no one has displayed such ability with scientific credibility. Given these two possible explanations for Natasha's apparent successes, rationality tells us to bet on the nonparanormal one. We should demand con\u00ad vincing evidence that is scientifically acceptable before we give credence to the paranormal claim. The Test Protocol With input from Richard and me, Andrew wrote the test pro\u00ad tocol, titled \"Test Design and Procedures for Preliminary Study of Natasha Demkina.\" The goal was to make every aspect of the test explicit. The protocol stated how we would conduct the test and how we would interpret the results. We wanted all parties to be clear about what would and would not be considered a \"successful\" outcome. What makes a scientific experiment or a test meaningful is just such an explicit com\u00ad mitment to the interpretation of the outcome before we observe the data. This is a critical distinction between the post hoc interpretation of testimonial evidence and the prior commit\u00ad ment to specified outcomes of a meaningful test. Natasha's defenders apparently fail to grasp this essential point. The written protocol protects the interests of all parties. Natasha and her supporters had the opportunity to study the document, to suggest modifications, and finally to agree or disagree with its provisions. The protocol also protects the investigators against a variety of false accusations about how we conducted the test. We made sure to include in the protocol the statement that the \"test is not in any way a definitive test. Deciding the truth of Natasha's claims with comfortable certainty is too simple and brief. It can only help to decide whether further studies of Natasha's claimed abilities are warranted.\" This statement is worth elaborating. Understanding what the test can and cannot do is essential. Even under ideal circum\u00ad stances this test could not clearly decide if Natasha does or does not have X-ray vision. Any scientific hypothesis\u2014espe\u00ad cially a paranormal one\u2014cannot be confirmed or disaf\u00ad firmed by one test or one experiment. Scientific investiga\u00ad tion requires a series of experiments. Each new experiment builds on the results of previous ones. The more we learn from the early experiments, the better we can understand what we need to control and what we can safely ignore. If the hypothesis is implausible and/or controversial\u2014as Natasha's claim certainly is\u2014then the original investigators must replicate their findings. In addition, independent investigators must also replicate the findings before they gain scientific credibility. 30 Volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER We knew that our test could not distinguish between two possibilities: (1) she can make correct matches using external clues; or (2) she can make correct matches using paranormal X- ray vision. The alternatives we could control or reduce were that she gets correct matches just by luck or that her correct matches are due to those factors that make vague statements seem like hits. We were also aware that our test could only detect a large effect. Natasha's claim can be considered in several contexts. The testimonials imply that she is highly accurate. This has practical consequences. If clients are depending upon her for medical diagnoses, Natasha's readings should be reliable. Otherwise, she can do much harm. Of course, Natasha could possess paranormal powers, but they could be weak and erratic. Such unreliable and weak ability would be useless for medical diagnosis, but would still be of theoretical interest. We lacked the resources and time to try to detect such a weak effect. We used all our resources to obtain seven subjects. If we had been trying to test for a moderate or weak effect, we would have had to use many more subjects. Given the constraints of our task, this was impossible. Our test, then, was aimed at detecting a large effect. We reasoned that if she possessed the reliability of diagnosis that her proponents claimed, our test would reveal this. Such an effect would encourage us to inves\u00ad tigate her abilities in more detail. The outcome of the test could be from zero to seven cor\u00ad rect matches. We set the criterion for success at five correct matches. We clearly stated this criterion in the test protocol and all parties agreed to this in advance. Although Natasha's mother says that her daughter never makes a mistake, we did not want to demand that Natasha perform perfectly. We wanted to give her some margin for error. Keep in mind that if she got five or more correct this would be consistent with her having the X-ray power that she claims. Yet it would also be consistent with the possibility that she was matching the tar\u00ad get condition by normal means such as the appearance and behavior of the subjects. The Test Richard Wiseman, Andrew Skolnick, and I collaborated in designing the test. We arrived at a mutually satisfactory plan after exchanging several e-mails. The task of finding appropri\u00ad ate subjects, and coordinating the many details was left to Andrew. He had less than one week to accomplish all this. He had to do this from Amherst, more than 350 miles from New York City. Austin Dacey, executive director of the Center for Inquiry-vW^WVY, obtained an excellent set of rooms for the test at the City College of New York and helped recruit several subjects. Dr. Barrie Casselith, Chief of Integrative Medicine Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, helped us with the daunting task of assembling seven appropriate and willing subjects. On the morning of the day of the test we learned that two of the subjects had withdrawn. Again, Andrew and Austin saved the day by finding two replacements at the last moment. (Andrew's separate article about certain aspects of the tests follows mine.) During the test, we seated the seven subjects in a semicircle facing the chair where Natasha sat. Each volunteer had an internal condition that should be easy to detect if Natasha's claim is correct. The target conditions were as follows: One patient had metal surgical staples in his chest from open heart surgery; one had a section of her esophagus surgically removed; one had a large section of one lung removed; one had an artificial hip replacement; one had a missing appendix (we discovered afterwards that another subject also had a miss\u00ad ing appendix, which he didn't mention when we recruited him. Natasha chose neither of these two as the one with the missing appendix); one had a large brain tumor removed and now has a large hole in his skull covered by a metal plate; and the final subject had none of these target conditions. During the test, when Natasha was looking at the sub\u00ad jects, the subjects wore sunglasses whose lenses were covered with opaque tape. This prevented the subjects from knowing when Natasha was looking at them. This also prevented Natasha from picking up clues from their eye movements or pupillary dilations (which are a sign of emotional reaction). Before the test, I instructed and rehearsed the subjects on how to behave. They were to sit as still as possible when Natasha was in the room. If Natasha needed to observe them in a standing position, I would tell Natasha to turn her back while they stood up and when they sat again. We used simi\u00ad lar precautions if Natasha needed to look at them in profile. These precautions reduced the possibility of reactions by the subjects from knowing which target condition Natasha was currently studying. We also wanted to reduce external move\u00ad ments (for example, the subject with a hip replacement might give herself away from her efforts to stand or to change the position of her body).' The test room was large and had chairs for our seven sub\u00ad jects, for Natasha and two interpreters. One interpreter was Natasha's friend Sveta Skarbo. We allowed her in the test room to make Natasha feel comfortable. The other interpreter was supplied by the Discovery Channel. Ideally, only I, as the head proctor, Richard Wiseman as my co-investigator, Natasha and the two interpreters, and the seven subjects should have been present during the test. The realities of television production and the requests of Natasha's companions forced us to com\u00ad promise here, and in some matters of protocol. The test room also included a television crew of tJiree persons from the pro\u00ad duction company (Shine, Ltd.); Austin Dacey, who was video\u00ad taping die proceedings for CSICOP; Joe Nickell as an observer; a still photographer from the Discovery Channel; and Will Stewart, a British journalist living in Russia who was acting as a representative for Natasha. Except for the subjects (and Austin Dacey), everyone in the test room, including myself, was blind to the condition of each subject. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/Jure 2005 31 A small room, attached to rear of the test room, was used for briefing Natasha. We could retreat to this room when we wanted to discuss mat\u00ad ters out of sight and hearing of the subjects. Because Andrew was in charge of recruiting the subjects and was not completely blind to their con\u00ad ditions, he stayed out of the testing room. He remained in the briefing room during the entire test (which lasted more than four hours). We used this room to brief Natasha before each of the six required matches (once she had made six matches, the seventh was determined by default). Before each trial Andrew gave her a clear description, along with images and diagrams, Ot the target condition that Natasha Demkina stands between her friend Svetlana Skarbo (who served as her translator instead of the one hired she was to match to a subject. We also by Discovery Channel) and Richard Wiseman, who helped to design and conduct the CSICOP-CSMMH test. Photo credit: Andrew A. Skolnick discussed any of Natasha's questions or concerns in this room. Andrew and I met with Natasha in this room before the test to review the procedure and to remind her about the details of the protocol. She had agreed to this protocol, which Monica had shown her five days previously. We reviewed each condition that we would ask her to detect. She expressed concerns about the removed appendix and the resected esophagus. She was worried that if the appendix had been removed long enough ago it might have grown back. Andrew assured her that appendices do not grow back. Her concern about the resected esophagus was that individ\u00ad uals might normally differ in the length of their esophagus and this could mislead her. Andrew told her that instead of the length she should look for the scar that completely encircled the place where the two ends of the resected esophagus had been surgically joined. The test consisted of six trials. On each trial Andrew gave Natasha a test card that clearly described, in Russian and English, the condition she was to match to a subject. The card contained an illustration of the target organ or condition. Andrew also showed her relevant illustrations from an anatomy text. When she was satisfied, I accompanied Natasha to the test room, where she sat between the two interpreters and equidistant from each subject. After Natasha had studied the subjects for the given condition, she chose the subject she believed had the specified condition. She would circle the sub\u00ad ject's number on the test card and both of us would sign the card. We then returned to the back room to prepare for the next condition and trial. We wanted to make the test as comfortable and nonstress- ful for Natasha as possible. I made sure not to rush or pres-each match. She took one hour to make the first match\u2014 which was to find the subject who had a large section of the top of her left lung surgically removed. She required more than four hours to complete the matches of conditions to the seven subjects. Throughout this process I repeatedly asked her if she was comfortable and if we could do anything to make the process more agreeable to her. She could ask for a break in the proceedings whenever she wished. Her mother had decided to remain outside both the test and briefing rooms because she wanted to be with Natasha's younger sister. Midway through the proceedings, Natasha told us she would feel better if her mother could be in the briefing room. 1 immediately agreed to her request.' The Outcome Natasha succeeded in correctly matching four target conditions out of a possible seven. Our protocol required that Natasha get five or more correct matches to \"pass\" our test. Understandably, Natasha's supporters were disappointed. They expressed their misgivings about the test on the televi\u00ad sion documentary, in media interviews, on Web sites, and through e-mails. They accused the testers of bias and of delib\u00ad erately manipulating the procedure to prevent Natasha from succeeding. Natasha has complained that if she had gotten five correct she would have been a success. Isn't four close enough? Our answer is that five was the minimum score that every\u00ad one agreed upon. It was also the minimum score that would convince us of a possible ability to diagnose subjects with suf\u00ad ficient reliability to be useful. We designed our test to detect a large effect. We were looking for something that would distin- sure her in any way. I gave her all the time she wanted to make guish Natasha's claims from many similar ones. We wanted a 32 Volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER good reason to justify using the additional time and resources to investigate her ability further. Although Natasha's score did not meet our criterion for \"success,\" it is possible that she can pick up information about the subject's condition. Some of her choices might show some accuracy on her part, although of a low level. If this is true, her correct matches could be the result of three possibilities: 1. She gathered some information paranormally. That is. she can see into people's bodies, but impcrfecdy. 2. She gathered information by deliberately exploiting available dues such as outward appearances and behavior of the subjects. 3. She obtained information unconsciously from available clues. To me, this is the most likely explanation, other than chance or in addition to chance. Much recent work in psy\u00ad chology demonstrates implicit learning: how people uncon\u00ad sciously learn to exploit a variety of clues, often subde ones. Both inherent and unforeseen limitations of our test pro\u00ad vided possible clues to the target conditions for some subjects. I already discussed the daunting task of finding seven appro\u00ad priate subjects. We had to settle for a less than optimal set of subjects. These subjects differed sufficiently in outward appearance to provide possible clues about their conditions. Anotlier problem occurred through two violations of the test protocol. Together these problems created the possibility for identifying the target conditions\u2014by external, normal means\u2014for the following four subjects: 1) The \"control\" subject, the one who had no internal medical condition, was obviously the youngest of the group. He also looked in good physical condition and appeared much health\u00ad ier. He was a good candidate for the person with no defects. 2) The subject with the staples in his chest (because of major heart surgery) was male, the oldest of the group and looked the least healthy. He was an obvious choice for the person with the staples in his chest. 3) A breach of protocol occurred on the first trial. Natasha posed a question and her interpreter translated it aloud in front of the subjects. The question, contrary to our proto\u00ad col, allowed the subjects to know that Natasha was looking for the subject with part of her lung removed. Here it was possible that, knowing which condition Natasha was look\u00ad ing for, the subject with the missing lung might have given herself away through bodily reaction. 4) After the test was over, I learned that Natasha and her com\u00ad panions, because of an apparent misunderstanding, had arrived at the test site before we had expected them. They waited outside the test building where they reportedly observed at least two of the test subjects climb the long flight of stairs and enter the test building. This breach of protocol may have provided them clues about which sub\u00ad jects did or did not have the artificial hip. We do not know if Natasha took advantage of the clues I've described in the previous four paragraphs. However, it is sug\u00ad gestive that these were just the four subjects for whom Natasha achieved her correct matches. The probability that she was rely\u00ad ing upon nonparanomal clues increases when we consider her misses. She wrongly picked the subject who was wearing a base\u00adball cap as the one who had the metal plate in his head. Conceivably, she picked this subject because one might assume (falsely in this case) that the subject was trying to cover a scar on his head. We should also emphasize that her failure to cor- recdy match the subject with the metal plate in his head further argues against any fledgling paranormal powers. If she truly can see into bodies, she should have easily detected the large area of missing skull along with the metal plate covering the hole. Our test included five subjects for whom external clues were available concerning their internal condition. The clues correctly pointed to the true target condition for four subjects. The external clue for the fifth subject falsely pointed to the hole in the skull. In each of these five cases Natasha made her choice consistent with how the external clue was pointing. Because a single test, even one done undet ideal conditions, cannot setde a paranormal claim, we conceived our test as the first stage of a potential series. The first stage would not nec\u00ad essarily rule out nonparanormal alternatives. If Natasha could pass the first stage, this would justify continuing onto the next stage. If she passed that stage, then we would continue study\u00ad ing her claim. On the other hand, if she failed at any of the early stages, this would end our interest in her claim. Keep in mind that the burden of proof belongs to the par\u00ad ties making an extraordinary claim. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. Our test had its limitations. None of these limitations, however, worked against Natasha's claim. If anything, they may have artificially enhanced her score. Our task was not to prove that Natasha does not have X-ray vision. Rather, Natasha and her supporters had the responsibility to show us that she could perform well enough to deserve further scientific investigation. This they failed to do. Acknowledgments I thank Richard Wiseman (University of Hertfordshire) and Andrew Skolnick (Commission for Scientific Medicine and Mental Health) for their many constructive criticisms to the earlier drafts of this paper. Richard convinced me to eliminate over half the material I had intended to include. This was a great improvement. Notes I. Wc debated about how to refer to the seven volunteers who had conditions which Natasha had to detect. Each of the candidate terms such as volunteer, par\u00ad ticipant, patient, or client seemed ambiguous or not quite correct. Although not completely satisfactory, we decided to refer to these individuals as subjects. lPfungst. O. 1911. OeixrHam. New York Henry Holt & Co. Abo sceVogt.LZ.. and Hyman. R. 2000.

Ideally, every\u00ad one in the test situation should be blind as to the true target condition for each subject. In our case, the subjects were not blind to their own conditions. Because the subjects had to be in the test room and Natasha had to study them visually, the test lacked this blindness. The use of the opaque sunglasses hope\u00ad fully kept the subjects blind as to which target condition Natasha was looking for on a given trial, but this is not completely satisfactory. 4. At the Stan of the test some initial confusion existed as to who would be allowed into the test and briefing rooms. This was quickly corrected and Natasha's mother and Will Stewart were given the option of staying in one of these rooms. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 33 Natasha Demkina The Girl with Normal Eyes Many people in Russia and the United Kingdom believe a teenage girl can identify diseases in patients better than their physicians. Investigators who tested the medical psychic for a Discovery Channel program don't agree. ANDREW A. SKOLNICK One hundred ten years ago, German physicist Wilhelm Roentgen announced the discovery of an invisible form of radiation that could make pho\u00ad tographs of bones and organs inside a living human body. At first, many scientists called the discovery of mysterious \"X-rays\" a hoax, but when the skeptics put Roentgens claims to the test, they were quickly convinced about one of the greatest discoveries in science and medicine. Indeed, just six years after his discovery, Roentgen was awarded the first Nobel Prize in physics. Now comes a teenage girl from Saransk, Russia, who claims to have X-ray-like vision that lets her see inside hum\u00ad an bodies. And she uses this vision to make medical 34 Volume 29, Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER After the CSICOP-CSMMH test of Natasha Demkina, a Discovery Channel photographer takes publicity shots for The Girl with X-ray Eyes.

Skolnick diagnoses that, she claims, are often more accurate than those of doctors. Widely hailed in Russia as \"die girl wirii X-ray eyes,\" seventeen-year-old Natasha Demkina has a growing number of patients, doctors, journalists, and others who are convinced her powers are real.1-2 That following is proving lucrative for Natasha and her family. The young psychic reportedly charged about $13 per reading and provided about ten readings each weekday night. That income, about $2,600 a month, is more rJian forty rimes the average monthly income of government workers in Saransk. In March 2004, Monica Garnsey, the producer-director of a Discovery Channel documentary on Natasha, asked the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of die Paranormal (CSICOP) to scientifically test the young woman's claims for die program. Because Natasha's paranormal claims involved medical diagnoses, I was asked to join CSICOP fellows Ray Hyman and Richard Wiseman in designing an appropriate preliminary test, to see if the medical psychic's abilities war\u00adranted further study. (Hyman's accompanying article, \"Testing Natasha,\" is the report of those tests.) Examining the claims of medical psychics like Natasha Demkina presents unique difficulties beyond the usual problems involved in testing dowsers, mind readers, and most other para\u00ad normal claimants.

We wanted a test that would prevent Natasha from making diagnoses that could not be dis\u00ad proved, as is her usual practice. So we settled on a simple test design that required Natasha to find already established med\u00ad ical abnormalities in the test subjects. This not only elimi\u00ad nated the problem of her giving us a long list of health prob\u00ad lems that cannot be disproved, it eliminated the problem of subjects trying to force Natasha's vague comments to fit their existing problems. And it prevented die potential harm diat could result from subjects being frightened into undergo\u00ad ing unnecessary and invasive medical tests to rule out dis\u00ad eases that Natasha claims to see. Such a calamity happened to Dr. Christopher Steele, the host of a medical television show in the United Kingdom, who in 2004 invited Natasha on his show to provide \"medical readings.\" When she read Steele, she said she saw somediing wrong with his gall bladder and that he had kidney stones and an enlarged liver and pancreas. The physician rushed off to have a battery of expen\u00ad sive and invasive clinical tests\u2014which found nothing wrong with him.1 In addition to being exposed to unnecessary diagnostic radi\u00ad ation, he had a colonoscopy, which is not without risks. Studies have found that .2 percent (two tenths of one percent) or more of patients who undergo colonoscopic screening suffer a bowel per\u00ad foration, which can lead to life-threatening infection and the need for surgery.4'' We wanted to conduct a blinded test. Natasha claims to see through peoples clothing, yet she says she cannot see through a fab\u00ad ric screen, which we wanted to use to prevent her from seeing the test subjects. We found this unexplained contradiction curious\u2014 and frustrating: Any test she would agree to would have to allow her to study the test subjects using her normal senses. As Hyman points out, this study flaw alone could provide an astute person powerful dues about a person's health problems. It would be less of a prob\u00ad lem if we were able to recruit subjects who were physically and demographically similar. Unfortunately, we had great difficulty recruiting subjects for the test and had to settle for several people with characteristics that suggested their target conditions. >- 4IU44, This is one of the six test cards that were used to assess Natasha's ability to see abnormalities within the subjects' bodies. In English and in Russian, the card directed Natasha to identify the number of the subject who doesn't have an appendix. Natasha answered subject number 2\u2014a woman who still has her appendix. Natasha protested during the test that appendixes can grow back after an appendectomy. When told this isn't possible, she insisted that they do grow back in Russia. Photo credit: Andrew A. Skolnick Natasha claims she can see everything inside of peoples bodies down to the cellular level, and her mother says her readings are 100 percent accu\u00ad rate. So the test\u2014which required her to match at least five of the target medical condi\u00ad tions to the correct subjects\u2014 should have been very easy com\u00ad pared with her normal readings. She didn't have to scan entire bodies looking for unknown conditions. She was told exactly what to look for and exactly where to look. Yet it took her more than four hours to com\u00ad plete the test and, inexplicably, she took an hour to examine the seven subjects before deciding which one was missing a large pan of her left lung! She guessed that one correcdy, but why would anyone who claims to be able to see \"every cell\" inside a person take an hour to decide which person was missing a large portion of one lung? Natasha matched only four of the conditions correctly\u2014a score that everyone prior to the test had agreed would not justify further testing. Natasha's most dramatic misdiagnosis was her failure to see a large metal plate covering a missing section of skull in a man who had a large brain tumor removed. Instead, she indicated that she \"saw\" a metal plate and missing skull section in a man who had his appendix removed but a normal skull. There was an error in our test protocol, which could have been much more embarrassing for us, had Natasha had the power to see it. Although our test design'1 required no more than one subject to have any of the target medical conditions, we dis\u00ad covered after the test was over that the man who had a metal plate in his head also had undergone an appendectomy. He had forgotten to mention this when he was recruited but brought it up after the test because a missing appendix had been one of the test target conditions. This mistake gave Natasha twice the chance of correctly guessing which subject was missing his or her appendix. Despite having twice the odds of being correct, she still chose a subject with an intact appendix. After the test, Natasha asked if she could give me a medical reading in the hope of convincing me that her powers are real. With CSICOP's Senior Research Fellow Joe Nickell taking notes, I agreed. Her reading, in which she scanned me from head to toes while describing the abnormalities she saw, took 36 Volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER about ten minutes. Few of my organs passed the inspection: My neck vertebrae were too tight, too close. The bronchial tubes of my lungs had phlegm causing me to cough. The muscle on the left side of my heart is a bit weak and the valve closes late. The mucosa of my stomach is abnormal. A segment of my liver was enlarged and I was suffering poor bile circulation. The head of my pancreas is increased and abnormally dark (although not seriously). My duodenum has a little scar. My prostate gland has a nodule and is inflamed. My right kidney has \"sand,\" while my left kidney's urethra is enlarged. In other words, I should forget about ever again sign\u00ad ing an organ donor card. Neither my physician nor I are aware of any of these prob\u00ad lems. Nevertheless, Natasha and her supporters claim she sees what doctors and tJieir tests often miss. The only way 1 could prove her wrong would be to submit to an autopsy\u2014which I'm not quite ready to do. I believe Natasha may have been making some bad guesses based on non-paranormal observations. While die test was ongoing, I swallowed some water down my wind pipe, which triggered a loud fit of coughing. It was so loud that someone had to close die briefing room door. Natasha apparently misjudged the cause of my coughing. My shoulders and neck were sore and tired from lugging around my luggage and a heavy camera bag. She apparently misread my drooping posture as a sign of a spinal problem. And earlier, I had complained to the Russian transla\u00ad tor that I had a headache (from stress and lack of sleep). I sus\u00ad pect that information may have been passed on to Natasha, who wrongly attributed die problem to narrowed blood vessels in my neck. Even more telling was what Natasha didn't \"see.\" She failed to point out any of my confirmed health problems, which include hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, recent colon surgery, nasal polyps, a very narrow pharynx, and sleep apnea. She also didn't see die calcified plaque in two of my coronary arteries that was documented by spiral CT scan. The Discovery Channel program, The Girl with X-ray Eyes, has already been broadcast several times over the past six mondis in Europe and Asia,\" but has not been broadcast in North America. The program highlights one of Natasha's most impressive diag\u00ad noses, involving a man who says he had been treated for tubercu\u00ad losis for a year yet hadn't gotten any better. In desperation, he turned to Natasha for help. Unable to describe what she saw in Natasha Demkina supporters widely cite this \"diagnostic' drawing of a \"sarcoido\u00ad sis granuloma\" as evidence of her remarkable \"X-ray\" vision. Yale Rosen, M.D., a leading expert on sarcoidosis granuloma, however, disagrees. Frame from the Discovery Channel program The Girl with X-ray Eyes. O2004 Discovery Channel the man's lungs, she drew a pic\u00ad ture. With the help of Natasha's drawing, the man got a referral to a doctor in Moscow, who claimed to see die same diing through her microscope and that the drawing is indicative of an inflammatory disease lesion called sarcoidosis granuloma. That's a remarkable confirma\u00ad tion of the young psychic's powers\u2014at least for viewers who don't have a clue what sar\u00ad coidosis granulomas look like. It didn't look like any pathological finding I've seen, so I sent an image of the draw\u00ad ing to Yale Rosen, M.D., Professor of Pathology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center, a leading expert on sar\u00ad coidosis granuloma, whose Atlas of Granulomatous Diseases is widely used in the training of pathologists.\" Here is Dr. Rosen's opinion of Demkina's drawing: Try as I might I can sec no resemblance whatsoever of this draw\u00ad ing to a granuloma or to any other microscopic pathologic find\u00ad ing that I know of. If I were presented with this drawing and no background history I would guess that it was made by a 4\u20146 year old child who was trying to depict a human-like head with four appendages (? arms and legs) attached. If Ms. Demkina is claiming that a physician made a diagnosis of sarcoidosis based upon this drawing I would say that that's simply unbelievable. We've asked the producer/director several times when the documentary may be broadcast in the United States. We have not received an answer. I am afraid that Discovery Channel may consider the program too skeptical for the American audience. I hope I will be proven wrong. Notes 1. Moniche, Igor. 2004.

D SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 37 Psychic Swindlers An investigative television reporter looking into a shady psychic uncovers a dangerous underworld of fraud and scams. AMY DAVIS As an investigative television reporter in San Antonio, I am bombarded on a daily basis by questions, faxes, e-mails, and phone calls. Everyone has a problem, and they all want me to help solve it. Shoddy contractors, sketchy sales pitches, get-rich quick schemes. Eventually, they all run together in a maelstrom of malfeasance. But a call to our news desk in February 2004 piqued my interest, with its claims of curses and clans, psychics and scams. A phone call from a panicked mom and dad first turned me on to the Evans clan. Terry Trotter wanted help when she called our station. Her twenty-one-year-old daughter, Shame Smith, had just confessed she'd taken out cash- advance loans and department-store credit to the tune of 38 Volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER $25,000 and turned it all over to a psychic by the name of \"Miss Brooks.\" By the time Shante told her parents and the police what had happened, she was drowning in debt and ducking bill col\u00ad lectors at every turn. \"I didn't know what else to do; and I couldn't tell anybody, or Miss Brooks would say, 'If you tell anybody, I could die.'\" Naturally skeptical of anyone who would willingly give a perfect stranger thousands of dollars, I was hesitant to take on the assignment. Even if the psychic had used half-truths and intimidation to get the money, the headline forming in my mind didn't strike me as newsworthy or a revelation by any\u00ad one's standards. \"Psychic Swindles Sucker\" could share the same page as \"Pickpocket Takes Wallet.\" 1 pushed those thoughts to the back of my mind for later consideration and agreed to interview Smith. My first question was the most obvious. What in the world would convince her to give a psychic so much money? A naive college sophomore. Smith struck me as the type of student who spends more time studying what clothes she'll wear to class than the subjects she signs up to study. Like many girls her age, she was impressionable, boy-crazy, and wanted to be liked. Smith told me she and some girlfriends had recendy talked about going to see a palm reader for fun; so when she found a flyer for \"The Psychic Spiritualist\" tucked under her windshield wiper at a shopping-mall parking lot, she thought it must have been a sign. The superstitious student called the number on the card that day and knocked on Miss Brooks's door the next. \"I thought 1 was gonna pay $35. She was gonna tell me a lit\u00ad tle bit of information; and then I was gonna be on my merry Hi\u00ad de way,\" Smith recounted. But that's not how it happened. In Jennifer Evans's husband Tommy Evans hides behind groceries when confronted by the author about theft allegations. that first visit, Smith figuratively showed her cards before Evans had a chance to literally read them. Smith spilled her guts, revealing she was smitten with a boy on campus. The girl wanted Miss Brooks to tell her if she had a future with her crush. The answer wasn't simple. Yes, Shante would win the heart of her beau. But Miss Brooks ominously disclosed that the man would die of cancer if Shante didn't do something soon. Smith said the brazen crystal-ball reader convinced her she was cursed; and only Miss Brooks (whose real name we later learned was Jennifer Evans) could break the spell. \"Anybody I truly loved dearly would die from a horrible disease,\" Smith said. \"I got all nervous and worried, just like anybody would if somebody told you someone who you love was gonna be dying of cancer.\" Once the psychic succeeded in scaring Shante, she quickly offered a solution. She ordered Shante to immediately with\u00ad draw all of the money from her bank account and bring it back. Within minutes, Smith returned with $400. Evans told her she would be in touch. Less than 24 hours later, Smith woke up to her ringing cell phone. Evans told her to get up; the two had lots of work to do if they wanted to reverse the fate of Shante's true love. Evans's first instructions were easy enough. \"You need to get all of your credit cards and get your limits raised as high as you can.\" Not satisfied with the few cards Shante already had in her wallet, Evans sent her to the mall to fill out applications. In just one day, Saks, Sears, and Zales all extended credit to the college coed. Smith said Evans called her cell phone constantly. \"She's like, 'When you get to each store, call me when you get there, and let me know what they approved you for.'\" Under the psychic's direction, Smith purchased gift cards in the full amount of her credit line, and handed them over. The plan, as relayed by Evans to Smith, was to lavishly dress two life-size Brazilian statues. The sculptures supposedly sym\u00ad bolized Smith and her soon-to-be lover. Adorning the effigies with the best clothing and accessories would mean Smith could expect the same luxuries in her own life. Even three months later, flat broke and no closer to the boy she gave so much for, Smith still thought Evans might come through for her. Smith's mother believes her daughter was easily duped because the smooth-talking psychic preyed on her religious convictions, lighting votive candles and speaking of angels that could help her case. \"When you talk about churches and God and blessings, that creates trust. You want to believe in some\u00ad one because you know that He is real.\" Getting the Story Armed with one side of a possible story, I had to decide how best to get the other side. Simply confronting Evans with Smith's accusations would give the psychic an opportunity to say any\u00ad thing, leaving me with no real way to evaluate her responses. I needed a firsthand account of Evans's psychic talent and tactics. We needed to get her spiel on camera, but first we needed a vol\u00ad unteer victim. In television news, these adventurous assignments are usually doled out to producers. They're smart, they under\u00ad stand the legalities of using hidden cameras, and because they're not on-air, they aren't recognized as station employees. Our Special Projects producer offered to take a camera hidden in a purse. We gave her $40 and a blank tape for what we thought would be the first of several visits with die accused. Even my Amy Davis is an investigative reporter for WOAI- TV, the NBC affil\u00ad iate in San Antonio, Texas. Her in-depth reports on racial discrimi\u00ad nation, nursing home abuse, and government waste have prompted the Justice Department, the North Carolina State Legislature, and the Texas Comptroller to effect change. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 39 news director doubted die psychic would pounce on our pro\u00ad ducer's first appointment. We all suspected Evans would want to feel out her new prey and gain her victim's trust before she tried to get any money. We were wrong. What our producer captured on tape in just one session was all we needed to convince us Evans wasn't just selling fortunes, she was stealing them. Evans's shop, a storefront pancd with dark-tinted glass and with a huge sign reading \"The Psychic Spiritualist,\" doubled as her home. When she unlocked the door to greet our producer for their 10 A.M. appointment, she was still wearing her pajamas. Small and slender, without a touch of makeup, the brunette could have easily passed for a teenager. But her speech exuded confidence, and her tone was reassuring and authoritative. \"What I would like you to do, sweetie, is cut the cards one time and make one wish when you cut the cards.\" The producer truthfully confided, \"I wish that my husband and I will buy a house here in San Antonio.\" Then Evans cut to die chase. \"It'll be $35 up front for the reading,\" then promptly added\u2014after she had the producer's two twenties in her hand\u2014\"I don't have change. Is that okay?\" Assuming it would have to be, our producer nodded her head in agreement; both women were working to gain each other's trust. The next line of conversation confirmed Evans not only deceives her customers about their own futures, she concocts tall tales of her own travels and adventures. \"I'm not even from here,\" offered the psychic. \"I'm from Canada. I lived in Brazil for fifteen years, New York for ten, Chicago, California when I became the celebrity psychic. And for the last five years, I've been here.\" By her account, the psychic would be at least thirty, but Evans's driver's license reveals she is only twenty-three. A lie like mat is easy to disprove widi documents, but Detective Ray Patterson of die Bexar County Sheriffs Department says it doesn't always work that way. \"The other stuff is so intangible,\" he explains. \"If I say I'm going to cure cancer for you, and you don't get cancer. how can you prove otherwise?\" Patterson said Shame's experience was familiar \"They targeted somebody who was weak-willed and extorted money from her. I just think it was a giri tfrat came in diat was at a low point in her life, and was looking for some type of direction; and Jennifer Evans took advantage of it.\" Evans used the cancer-curse fortune on many customers, and our producer was no exception. Evans said an old enemy paid someone to cast a spell on my coworker. \"Sweetie, what's on you is so serious. She put for you not to lose your soul mate to another woman, but for you to lose him to some type of sickness or colon cancer.\" The producer was shocked. \"Colon cancer?\" \"Yeah,\" nodded Evans, her lips curled in a knowing purse. \"She doesn't want you to be happy. She does not want you to be content. She wants to see you sad. She wants to see you weep. 'Cause she could never be happy ... so she wants to make you miserable. You always had everything she wanted. Morals, true love, that charisma . . . you know. She's wicked. She's jealous. You should know that.\" About halfway through the session, Evans revealed the pro\u00ad ducer's nemesis also put a curse on her that would cause her to never have as much money as she would like. This conve\u00ad niently spurred a line of questioning that would make even a used-car salesman blush. Evans looked up from a tarot card and said, \"It's also telling me you've been trying to save up for something. But if you really want to be honest, tell me. You got to talk to me. What do you want?\" \"To go on a trip to Ireland,\" admitted the producer. Evans pressed her. \"How much do you need?\" \"I don't know ... a couple of thousand or two.\" Moving on, but tying it all together as if she needed to know, Evans continued. \"Okay ... do you owe any money on any credit cards or anything like that?\" \"Some ... but we're paying them off\",\" replied what else do you owe on? What's a major debt you want to get rid of?\" All of a sudden jumping back into her heroine roll, Evans said, \"Tell me what's a major debt you want to get rid of cause I'll help you get rid of it.\" \"Cars\u2014car debt\u2014and credit cards,\" the producer ratded off her financial portrait. \"We have about diree credit cards. They're not really high or whatever. But we'd like to pay diem off.\" \"Okay ... how much would you say you owe on each one?\" \"Um . .. \"What was your limits on each one?\" \"Um, our limit on die card ... I diink a lot higher rhan mat.\" Unabashed, the psychic then wanted to know about the producer's checking and savings accounts, even how much she expected to get back in taxes. She finally concluded her inter\u00ad rogation by making a promise. \"Whatever's in checking, what- ever's in savings, is gonna quadruple for you in five days after I do this. I'm gonna walk you dirough everydiing so you understand. What's the amount in checking and what's the amount in savings?\" \"Umm ... I have about five diousand dollars, and it's only in one account.\" Evans urged our producer to rush to die bank immediately, withdraw all of her money, and return with it as quickly as pos\u00ad sible. The producer did leave, but she never went back to Evan's 40 Volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER shop. At this point, she was more than ready to end her involvement in our investigation. Evans had taken her cell number; and when the producer didn't return within ten min\u00ad utes, the soothsayer started dialing nonstop. Her voice-mail messages went from sweet to pleading to threatening. After the last beep, Evans said she had already opened the case; if the pro\u00ad ducer didn't come back ro finish what she'd started, she could die. The producer is still very much alive. While she admits she doesn't want to ever face Evans again, she says it's the woman's menacing vibe and very real propensity for criminal behavior that frighten her more than any voodoo hocus-pocus. As I did more research, I found a nefarious streak running throughout her family's lineage. Members of the Evans clan don't only pose as palm readers, they arc involved in a long list of shady activi\u00ad ties. When Detective Patterson began investigating Jennifer Evans and her family, he found hundreds of social security numbers and names linked to just a handful of the family members. \"There appears to be a lot of names floating around. It seems like their practice is . . . they'll assume alias names, they'll change a few numbers in their Social Security number and pull a scam. And then after that's all done, they'll move on to a different name, different Social and continue on.\" The Evans Family In a modest Van Nuys, California, neighborhood, far from San Antonio, an elderly man slowly hobbled to his front door, bal\u00ad ancing his frail figure on a sturdy wooden cane. The knock annoyed the nearly ninety-year-old man, until he looked out\u00ad side. A Hispanic-looking woman in her late forties told him she worked as a home-health nurse, and had been sent by Medicare to look after him and his bedridden wife. For two weeks, this unexpected miracle of a maid washed and cooked. Then she cleaned out the couple's life savings. Federal investigators never figured out how this nefarious nurse found die elderly couple or how she convinced AARP and Vanguard to cut checks for the entire amount in their retirement accounts. The mysterious woman vanished as quickly as she appeared, but detectives did trace the checks to a bank in San Antonio, where they'd been deposited by a man named Nicky Evans. Nicky is Jennifer's uncle by marriage; and even though many stories like the Van Nuys scheme are con\u00ad nected to his name, his record is clean. When police began questioning Nicky Evans, a pillowcase stuffed with $179,000\u2014the exact amount taken from the California cou\u00ad ple's accounts\u2014turned up on the doorstep of the district attor\u00ad ney's office. No charges were filed. The cross-country-con case was just one of many relayed to me by local investigators when I began asking around about the infamous yet mysterious Evans family of San Antonio. Other common trades in the family are driveway paving, roof\u00ad ing, and remodeling, which cops say are sometimes fronts, providing the Evans family a way inside to case people's homes. Jennifer Evans's husband has been busted for insurance fraud at least twice. Many times when victims try to file com\u00ad plaints against members of die Evans clan with police they're told they are dealing with a civil, not criminal, matter. An FBI Nicky Evans, Jennifer's uncle, walks out of his own San Antonio psychic shop. agent confided to me that the San Antonio office simply doesn't have the resources required to devote to sorting through the multiple aliases, business fronts, and fraud. At the local level, manpower is usually shifted to more tangible crimes like property theft and murders. But most veteran officers know the self-proclaimed clan of Gypsies by name, and they all have their own personal accounts of bizarre encounters with them. Some people swear that the clan has state and local officers on their payroll. While I haven't been able to confirm this rumor, I don't doubt it. It would certainly explain why there are so many crimes reported but so few prosecuted. I spoke to investigators who helped me absorb as much information as possible before my face-to-face with any of the family members, knowing they would undoubtedly use any ignorance of mine to their advantage. Confronting the Con Artist When I pulled up to Evans's storefront, her husband was just getting out of his Lincoln Navigator with groceries in hand. As I introduced myself, our photographer recording rhe entire exchange, Mr. Evans shielded his face with his bags. Jennifer opened the door to let him in. \"I'm coming to ask you about a girl who says you took $25,000 from her,\" I blurted out before she could close the door. She denied the accusation. \"It's all lies. I'm a psychic. People can say whatever they want about me,\" shouted Miss Evans. \"Right,\" her husband jumped in. \"They can say I bought a Rolls Royce, too. Do you see a Rolls Royce over here?\" After hurling several insults and threats laced with profanity, rhe pair slammed the door. I tried repeatedly to talk to them without success. But my efforts didn't stop there. There are seven psychic shops in San Antonio owned by Evans family members, but none were willing to talk to us about their psy\u00ad chic abilities or address the complaints of fraud against them. One irate anonymous caller claimed she was a member of the clan, adding, \"Why are you going after us Gypsies? Is it because we drive brand-new cars and you don't? Because you have to work for yours?\" Jennifers mother-in-law operates another psychic business. When I called her, she told me she'd been meaning to get in SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 41 touch with me. She said she needed to warn me that she saw some \"pretty scary things\" in her cards. \"Miss Davis, you should know, if you don't stop messing around with these psy\u00ad chics, you're going to get hurt.\" The threats certainly didn't stop me from proceeding with die story, but the Evans's intimidation campaign did keep oth\u00ad ers from coming forward. One man who'd been shot by Jennifer's father-in-law in the early 1980s could certainly tes\u00ad tify to the family's tendency toward violence. When I tried to track him down, 1 discovered he moved away from San Antonio shortly after the shooting. I left several voice-mail messages for the man but got no response until one day when I checked my e-mail. This is the message I found in my in-box: If your (sic) the one asking about (the man shot by Steve Evans) just stop, he got screwed in the deal and they tried to kill him more than once and he just wants to be left alone, if you dig it up again your name will be added to there (sic) hit list, the guy deserves some peace, your bio sounds nice, looking for justice and all but you must leave this one alone, thx. a friend The Police Step In Two weeks after our story aired, deputies arrested Jennifer Evans as she turned on the glowing neon \"open\" sign in the front window of her home. Since that time, over a dozen other victims have come forward. A school teacher who refinanced her home lost $50,000; another woman gave Evans up to $15,000 and even bought her a kitchen stove. Jennifer Evans covers her face while being arrested for theft by deception. To Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Schattman, the most interesting part of it all is that the victims self-select. Most often, those who lose the most have the least to give. Widowers, the terminally ill, people who've hit rock bottom and exhausted all the traditional sources of help. \"They were remorseless con artists,\" Schattman says of the seven Evans family members he prosecuted in the Dallas-Fort Worth area four years ago. \"The people we convicted crossed the line, and they did it repeatedly.\" Seven members of the Evans family were convicted of mail fraud and aiding and abetting for using the mail as a part of the psychic scams. The victims included lawyers, accountants, and doctors, many of whom did not want to cooperate with the investi\u00ad gation out of embarrassment. Schattmann says in some of the cases, victims were reas\u00ad sured that their money would benefit a church or religious organization, although no such affiliation was ever proved. Jennifer Evans used the same tactic in San Antonio with Shante Smith, convincing the young woman that she owed a debt to a church that was helping with \"her case.\" Evans told Smith to order a big-screen television from a major electronics store and have it delivered to a church in Piano. But upon fur\u00ad ther investigation, we discovered there is a home at the address Evans gave to Smith. At the time the store delivered the TV, Evans's own mother was renting the house. \"It fit a pattern of theft. It looked like she'd been either coerced or threatened into doing something,\" said Detective Patterson. That one delivery allowed prosecutors to charge Evans with theft by deception. \"Hopefully, her life has been turned upside down, just like she turned my life upside down within three months,\" said Smith after learning deputies had arrested Evans. Police arrested Jennifer Evans outside a San Antonio post office on January 24, 2005- While preparing for her upcoming trial, prosecutors with the Bexar County District Attorney's office asked U.S. Postal Inspectors to screen the psychic's mail. To date, they've identified five more victims who have mailed Evans nearly $80,000. Inspector Ed Moreno said Evans was placing ads in West Coast yellow pages advertising psychic phone lines. For an initial $150, she tells callers she will begin praying for their cause. Other promises and miracles would cost a greater amount, usually thousands of dollars. Evans was picking up a $25,000 check mailed to her post office box the day she was arrested. Officers say she gave them a fake name and date of birth. Nine of her alleged victims are claiming a total of $230,000 was stolen from them. Prosecutors have now backed away from their offers of a plea deal and say they have filed Evans's case as a first degree felony. Evans is currently on house arrest awaiting an April 11 trial date. \"If the case just goes away, we lose the ability to track her,\" says Patterson, now at the mercy of prosecutors. The seasoned investi\u00ad gator confessed that his sergeant never would have assigned him the case if it weren't for pressure from our broadcast. Response from our story gave the district attorney's office a list of about a dozen victims. As people called me with similar stories of how they'd been swindled, I passed them on to prosecutors. Most had not called police to report the theft; those who had hadn't gotten far. Complaints against soothsayers get lost among reports of property theft, robbery, and other routine crimes. Some officers actually refuse to take such reports or at least strongly discourage victims from reporting the offenses. Another college student ripped off by Evans told me she will never forget what cops told her. \"They laughed at me. They were just like, 'Oh, you're just going to have to chalk it up to experience because you're not getting your money back. There's nothing we can do,'\" she recalls. But since Detective Patterson invested so much rime and energy in the case, he wants to see Evans prosecuted. A convic\u00ad tion might send a message to psychics and soothsayers who prey on the hopeful and vulnerable. LJ 42 Volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Getting the Monkey off Darwin's Back Four Common Myths About Evolution Evolution is poorly characterized by certain commonly used phrases. Properly communicating how evolution works requires careful attention to language and metaphor. CHARLES SULLIVAN and CAMERON McPHERSON SMITH Nearly 150 years after Charles Darwin published On The Origin of Species, the theory of evolution is still widely misunderstood by the general public. Evolution isn't a fringe theory, and it's not difficult to under\u00ad stand, yet recent surveys reveal that roughly half of Americans believe that humans were created in their present form 10,000 years ago (Brooks 2001, CBS 2004). The same number reject the concept tJiat humans developed from ear\u00ad lier species of animals (National Science Board 2000). But the evidence is clear that no species, including humans, simply \"popped up.\" Each life form has an evolutionary history, and those histories are intricately SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 43 intertwined. If we don't understand that complex evolu\u00ad tion, we will make poor decisions about our future and that of other species. Should we genetically modify humans? How about our food crops? What effects will global warm in have on human biology? None of these questions, nor many others of immediate concern to human\u00ad ity, can be usefully addressed unless we understand the evo\u00ad lutionary process. In examining how evolu\u00ad tion is portrayed in die mass media, we found many prob\u00ad lems; chief among diem was the use of inaccurate expres\u00ad sions. In this article we examine the commonly-used phrases \"evolution is only a theory,\" \"the \"missing and \"only the strong survive.\" These expressions are mis\u00ad leading at best, and simply wrong at worst. Most of these phrases have ancient roots, describing biology as it was under\u00ad stood centuries ago. They lead to a distorted picture of what evolution is and how it works. evolution is not obtained by labo\u00ad ratory experiments, as in chem\u00ad istry and physics, the same can also be said for geology and cosmology. A geologist cannot travel back in time to observe first hand the formation of Earth's crust, and a cosmologist cannot witness the collapsing of a star into a black hole, but this doesn't mean diat scientific theories about the nature of these phenomena are simply unsubstantiated guesses. Some scientific theories do a better job of accounting for the facts than others, and in biology there is no competing scientific theory with more explanatory power than evolution. Biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky put it best when he said, \"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.\" Evolution Is Only a Theory Have you ever heard people challenge evo\u00ad lution by claiming that \"it's only a theory?\" The Cobb County School District in Georgia did just that when it sought to put stickers on high school biology textbooks stating that, \"Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origins of living things.\"1 The problem with this claim rests with two different uses of the word theory. In popular usage the word refers to an unsubstantiated guess or assumption, as when someone theorizes that a light moving across the night sky must be an alien spaceship. When scientists use the word theory, however, they're referring to a logical, tested, well-sup\u00ad ported explanation for a great variety of facts.2 In this sense the theory of evolution is as well supported as the theory of grav\u00ad itation or other explanatory models in fields such as chemistry or physics. While it's true that much of the evidence for Cameron McPherson Smith has a doctorate in archaeology and teaches at Portland State University's Department of Anthropology in Portland, Oregon. Charles Sullivan has masters degrees in both phi\u00ad losophy and English and teaches writing at Portland Community College in Portland Oregon. The authors are currently writing a book on the top ten myths about evolution. While it's true that much of the evidence for evolution is not obtained by laboratory experiments, as in chemistry and physics, the same can also be said for geology and cosmology. Many people confuse evolutionary theory with Lamarckism, named for the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829). In one sense Lamarck was an evolu\u00ad tionist in that he favored the view that new species had evolved from ancestral species, but he was mistaken about the mecha\u00ad nism by which species change, and about the time required for these changes. Lamarck thought that the mechanism for bio\u00ad logical change was the transmission to the next generation of characteristics acquired during the life span of an individual His most famous example is that of the giraffe. According to Lamarck, the giraffe's ancestors had shorter necks, and they would stretch their necks to reach higher foliage in trees. Their descendants then inherited longer necks because the charac\u00ad teristics of these newly stretched necks of the parents were passed down to their offspring. Moreover, Lamarck thought that the evolution of a new species could occur within a few generations or even one. His position was reasonable for its time, yet it happens to be incorrect. 44 Volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER But acquired characteristics are not passed on.' If you lose your arm in an accident, your offspring will not be born with a missing arm. If you lift weights to gain muscle mass, you will not transmit larger muscles to your offspring. Jews have been practicing circumcision for hundreds of generations, yet tfierc is no evidence that this acquired feature is biologically inherited. The position of modern evolutionary theory (Neo- Darwinism4) is that some ancestors of giraffes acquired slightly longer necks through random mutation. These animals could eat food that was a little out of reach of others of their species, and so they tended to be healthier, to live longer, and have a better chance than their fellows at mating and passing on to the next generation their genes for longer necks. Many such incremental changes over a long period of time are required for a new species\u2014or a neck as long as a giraffe's\u2014to arise. The evolution of giraffes or other life forms should not be thought of as a singular process. There are at least three inde\u00ad pendent processes that, when taken together, form our idea of evolution. These are replication, variation, and selection. Replication is essentially reproduction. Variation refers to the random changes\u2014typically mutations\u2014arising in offspring, making them different from their parents. Selection refers to the process whereby those individuals best adapted to their environment tend to be the ones that survive, passing on their genes. These three processes occur every day in nature, and it is their cumulative effect that we call evolution. Evolution is indeed a theory, but it's a theory with a lot of evidence on its side, and with more explanatory power than any competing theory in biology. If an entirely new scientific theory with more explanatory power is formulated, then Neo- Darwinism will have to be swept aside just as Lamarckism was. Creationism and Intelligent Design don't qualify as competing scientific theories because they're not scientific. They don't offer natural expla\u00ad nations for biological phenomena, but rather super\u00ad natural explanations which cannot be tested scientif\u00ad ically. Neo-Darwinism offers a natural explanation to account for the facts of evolution, and rejects supernat\u00ad ural explanations. When discussing the theory of evolution it's important to realize why it's misleading to say that evolution is only a the\u00ad ory. Evolution is indeed a tlicory, but it's a theory with a lot of evidence on its side, and with more explanatory power than any competing theory in biology. The Ladder of Progress The word evolution is sometimes used to mean progress. People speak of moral evolution when discussing certain cultural changes tfiat have been for the better, such as the increased recognition of die rights of women. Or ffiey speak of techno\u00ad logical evolution when comparing present-day technology with that of ancient hunter-gatherers. This sense of die word evolu\u00ad tion implies a progressive development toward better or more advanced stages. It is diis non-biological sense of evolution that influences people to diink of biological evolution as involving ladder-like progress from lower to higher stages. The idea of an evolutionary ladder of progress has its roots in Classical Greek and Medieval European concepts about the nature of the universe. The most common manifestation is known as the Great Chain of Being, which was most influen\u00ad tial in Europe from the fifteenth through the eighteenth cen\u00ad turies. The basic idea of the Great Chain of Being is that God and his creation form a hierarchy which is ordered from the least perfect things or beings at the bottom of the chain to the most perfect at the top, namely, God himself. Simply put, the ranking from bottom to top is as follows: rocks or minerals, plants, animals, man, angels, God. The Great Chain of Being scheme wasn't designed with evolution in mind since the prevailing idea of the time was that God made all existing species, in their modern forms, long ago. The Great Chain of Being is best described as a method of classification. This idea began to lose support before the Darwinian revolu\u00ad tion, but Darwin's ideas and their refine\u00ad ment ultimately broke the links of the Great Chain of Being. The modern biological understanding of evolution does not involve progress in the sense of a natural upward goal toward which life is striving.' Generic mutations arise randomly. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 45 A study of the DNA of Darwin's finches on the Galapagos Islands (Petren et al. 1999) provides a good example of why the idea of progress makes no sense in evolution. The study's find\u00ad ings suggest that the first finches to arrive on the islands were the Warbler finches {Certhidea olivacea), whose pointy beaks made them good insect eaters. A number of other finches evolved later from the Warbler finches. One of these is the Geospiza ground finch, whose broad beak is good for crushing seeds, and another is the Camarhynchus tree finch with its blunt beak which is well adapted for tearing vegetation. Even though the seed-eating and vegetation-eating finches evolved from insect-eating finches, the former are not \"more evolved\" than the latter, or \"higher\" on some evolutionary lad\u00ad der. Since finch evolution on the Galapagos Islands was driven primarily by diet, the ground finches simply became better adapted at making a living on seeds, the tree finches on vege\u00ad tation, and the Warbler finches on insects. If seeds were to become scarce on the Galapagos Islands, it's conceivable that the seed-eating finches\u2014which are a more recent species\u2014 could become extinct, while the insect-eating finches\u2014which have been around much longer\u2014would continue to thrive. The concepts of \"higher\" and \"lower\" do not apply to the Galapagos finches or anywhere else in evolution. It is fitness or adaptability relative to the environment that matters. Species cannot foretell the future in order to adapt themselves deliber\u00ad ately to environmental changes, and if the environment changes drastically, those adaptations that were once favorable may turn out to be unfavorable. Even though biologists reject the Great Chain of Being or any similar ladder-of-progress explanation of evolution, the idea still persists in popular culture. A more accurate analogy would be that of a bush that branches in many directions. If we think of evolution over time in this way, we're less likely to be confused by notions of progress because the branches of a bush can grow in various directions in three dimensions, and new branches can sprout off of older branches without imply\u00ad ing that those farther from the trunk are better or more advanced than those closer to the trunk. A more recent branch that has split off from an earlier branch\u2014like a species that has evolved from an ancestral species\u2014does not indicate greater progress or advancement. Rather, it is simply a new and different growth on the bush, or more specifically, a new species that is sufficiendy adapted to its envi\u00ad ronment to survive. The Missing Link \"Fossils May be Humans' Missing Link\" reported the Washington Post on April 22, 1999. The story states that fossils discovered in Ethiopia \"... may well be the long-sought immediate predecessor of human beings.\" But almost fifty yean earlier, paleontologist Robert Broom published Finding the Missing Link (1950), about his discovery of fossil \"ape men\" in South African caves. And since 1950, reports of the discovery of \"missing links\" have been con\u00ad tinuous. What's going on? How is it that the \"missing link\" has been discovered repeatedly? The problem lies in a false metaphor. When we say \"missing link,\" we invoke a metaphorical chain, a set of links that stretch far back in time. Each link represents a single species, a single variety of life. Because each link is connected to two other links, each is intimately connected to past and future forms. Break one link, and the pieces of the chain can be separated, and relation\u00ad ships lost. But find a lost link, and you can rebuild the chain, reconnect separated lengths. One potent reason for the attrac\u00ad tiveness of this metaphor is that it allows for the drama of the quest, the search for that elusive missing link. But the metaphor is as misleading as it is attractive. The concept that each species is a link in a great chain of life forms was largely developed in the typological age of biology, when species \"fixity\" (the idea that species were unchanging) was the dominant paradigm. Both John Ray (1627-1705) and Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1797), the architects of biological classification (neither of whom believed in evolution), were concerned with describing the order of living species, an order they each believed was laid out by God (Ray suggested that the divinely specified function of biting insects was to plague the wicked). But while the links of a chain are discrete, unchang\u00ad ing, and easily defined, groups of life forms are not.'' We gen\u00ad erally define a species as some interbreeding group that cannot, or does not, productively breed with another group. But since species are not fixed (they change through time), it can be dif\u00ad ficult to be sure where one species ends and another begins. For these reasons, many modern biologists prefer a continuum metaphor, in which shades of one life form grade into another.\" Life is not arranged as links, but as shades. The metaphorical chain is far less substantial than it sounds. Thus the chain metaphor is wrong. It doesn't accurately represent biology as we know it today, but as it was understood over four centuries ago. The myth persists berauw of conve\u00ad nience; it is easier to think of species as types, with discrete qualities, than as grades between one species and another. In school, we learn the specific characteristics of plants and ani\u00ad mals; this alone is not a problem, except that we are not often 46 Volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER exposed to the main ramification of evolution: that those char\u00ad acteristics will change through time. Clearly, both the Post article and Broom's book describe die discovery of australopithecenes, African hominids8 that lived well over three million years ago. Australopithecenes walked upright, like modern humans, but they had large, chimp-like teeth, and smallish, chimp-likc brains. Australopithecenes made rudimentary stone tools that are more complex than any chimpanzee's termite-mound probe stick, but far less complex than the symmetrical tools made by early members of our genus. Homo. In terms of anatomy and behavior, some aus\u00ad tralopithecenes really do appear to be \"half human.\" Additionally, it's widely believed that early Homo descended from some variety of late australopithecenc. Broom was right after all, but so was the Post, a \"missing link\" has indeed been found. It is Australopithecus. But there were many varieties of Australopithecus, as well as Homo, and diere is no obvious place to draw a discrete line separating a shade of late Austrabpithecus from an early grade of Homo. Therefore, it's more accurate to say that we have found some \"grade\" or \"shade,\" rather than \"die missing link.'\"' We can curb me false metaphor by changing our wording. In classes, in textbooks, in discussions wirJi our students, and in press releases (die critical connection between academia and die general public), we have to Stan saying that we're looking for a missing link, radier than //v missing link. Better yet, we should replace the \"missing link\" stock phrase with somediing more accurate. Only the Strong Survive Around a million years ago, an ape so large that it's now known as Gigantopithecus roamed the bamboo forests of South Asia. Standing nine feet tall, weighing from 600 to 1,000 pounds, and with a bamboo-crushing jaw the size of a mailbox, this was a truly strong creature. But today, all that remains of Gigantopithecus are a few fossil teeth and jawbones, quietly rest\u00ad ing in museum vaults. If only the strong survive, how did early Homo\u2014protohu- man bipeds that were in the same area at the same time, and were less than half the size of Gigantopithecus\u2014survive? Wouldn't any clash between these creatures result in die strap\u00ad ping uber-ape annihilating the competition? Yesterday's giants can be today's museum specimens. If only the strong survive, though, how is this possible? Indeed, how is it that humans are now ascendant on Earth, but, when stripped of tools and culture, we arc among die most helpless of animals? The answer, of course, is that strength can be measured in many ways. Brawn is one measure; brain is another. But this distinction is often lost in popular culture. When we say \"the strong,\" or even \"die fittest,\" most people immediately think of competition between individuals. These individuals, we imag\u00ad ine, are pitted against one another in some evolutionary arena, where they fight for survival and mates. The strongest survive, pass on dieir genes, and propagate dieir lineage. The loser, and its entire lineage, goes extinct. But diis notion of single combat in a single arena of compe\u00ad tition is too simple. In reality, diere arc dozens of arenas, dozens of problems any organism must face in life. Perhaps direct com\u00ad petition with odier individuals is one, but every day individuals are kicked from one arena to die next. If the river dries up, you're now in the Arena of Water Conservation. If die temperature suddenly drops, you're pushed into die Arena of Heat Conservation. If die properties of die vegetation you eat begin to change, you're now in the Arena of Metabolic Versatility. In short, survival is much more complex than is implied by the single-arena concept of combat between individuals. Life forms struggle against a wide array of factors, and often against more than one factor at a time. In biology, diese factors are known as selective pressures. Selective pressures also change. A certain selective pressure can be particularly hard-pressing for a period, shaping the course of evolution, but later diat pressure may ease, and another concern becomes primary. And since the environment is always changing, no species can ever be sure what selective pressures it will have to cope with tomorrow. Indeed, such con\u00ad scious anticipation of the future is precluded for most species (could deer have anticipated die invention of guns?), and evo\u00ad lution is entirely reactive, shaping species according to past and present environments, but never \"looking\" into die future.'\" We humans, and all life forms, exist and struggle not in any single arena, but in an immense web of selective pressures diat is incomprehensibly complex and ever-changing. Survival is much more involved dian simply beating down your immediate peers. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 47 Why does the single-combatant, evolutionary arena myth persist? The answer is probably deeply intertwined witli renais\u00ad sance values of individualism too complex to examine here\" but it is clearly related to nineteenth-century Social Darwinism. Social Darwinists grafted Darwin's basic ideas about biological evolution to human society and economy. To them, progress could only be made by eliminating imperfections from human\u00ad ity, and this was best done by competition. That competition, neady summarized by Herbert Spencer's term \"survival of die fittest,\" was taken to mean the competition between individu\u00ad als. It is significant that today's reality-TV programs are steeped in this metaphor, in which the concept of survival via ruthless individual competition is paramount. The best way to curb this myth is to teach that brute strength does not guarantee long-term success. In fact, no sin\u00ad gle characteristic does. More importantly, we need to describe why there is no single key to long-term success, because we never know how our selective environment is going to change. For humanity, then, the only hope for success, for survival, is in remaining flexible and adaptive. Real strength is in adapt\u00ad ability, which comes from genetic and cognitive variation. Conclusion A picture of evolution based on the common myths we've out\u00ad lined is a mosaic of confusion. It's very important to remedy this confusion, because how we think of ourselves, and every other species on Earth, is directly related to how we under\u00ad stand evolution. We can either see ourselves as separated from a natural world that simply serves as a theater for our evolu\u00ad tion,\" or as one of many coevolving species of life on Earth. The former view is more likely to persist if we continue to describe evolution using obsolete or faulty expressions. The latter view, which is accurate, will be promoted by a better use of language, and by acknowledging what we have learned about biology in the past 150 years.13 Solutions for conveying this accurate view must include more careful use of language and metaphor to explain exactly what evolution is, and how it happens. Notes 1. The entire disclaimer reads: \"This textbook contains material on evolu\u00ad tion. Evolution is a tiieory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully, and crit\u00ad ically considered.\" This led to a lawsuit, Selman v. Cobb County School District. On January 13, 2005. a federal judge found this policy unconstitutional. 2. See, for example, \"What's Wrong with 'Theory not Fact' Resolutions.\" National Center for Science Education. 7 December 2000. Available at www.ncseweb.org/resources/anicles/8643_whais_wrong_with_thcory_noi 12_7_2000._sp. 3. However, a recent study on fruitflies suggests that some genetic instruc\u00ad tions that are not encoded in the DNA may be passed on to offspring by way of material encompassing the DNA (Lin et al. 2004). 4. Developed in die 1930s. Neo-Darwinism (also called the Modern Synthesis) integrates Darwin's theory of natural selection with the theory of genetic inheritance first proposed by Gregor Mendel and subsequently refined by later biologists. 5. Biologists disagree about whether there is an evolutionary tendency toward complexity, primarily because there is no consensus on how complex\u00ad ity should be defined and measured. 6. The species concept is introduced in Strickberger (1985:747-756), but also see Mallet (1995) for the need to review how we define species. 7. Lions and tigers once coexisted naturally in India, and although they are outwardly very different, they can mate to create tigons or ligers. Since such hybrids were never found in nature, however, it is known that lion and tiger did not interbreed naturally. Thus, genetically, lion and tiger can be clas\u00ad sified as one species, but behaviorally, they differed enough to be considered separate species by biologists, and in nature this difference was maintained by the animals themselves (Wilson 1977:7). 8. Hominids arc large primates that walk upright. Those of the genus Australopithecus (which predate the human lineage Homo) are referred to as australopithcccncs. They appear over 4 million years ago. Many hominid vari\u00ad eties have existed, but Homo sapiens sapiens is the only living hominid. 9. The link metaphor also suggests that any given species is represented by only one chain, as when we sec a diagram of hominids. first knuckle-walking, then hunched over in a half-stand, then upright as modern man. This depic\u00ad tion docs not show several other bipedal hominid varieties to which we are related, such as the robust australopiuSeccncs (appearing over 4 million years ago, disappearing about I million years ago) or the Neanderthals (who appear around 300,000 years ago and are extinct by c.30,000 years ago). The depic\u00ad tion suggests that there was one, unbroken chain, from quadruped to biped, but actually there have been bipeds that have gone extinct (as well as quadrupeds that exist today). 10. Humanity, of course, is uniquely proactive. We can imagine the future, and we prepare for it by controlling our evolution with all sorts of social and biological methods. Social methods include complex kinship and marriage rules that ensure gene flow among different populations. Biological methods include mass vaccination programs against polio and smallpox. 11. Sec for example Shanahan (2004), an interesting comment in Commager (1965:82-83). and Butterfield (1965:222-246). 12. We suggest that this view of humanity contributes to wasteful use of resources; for example, humanity has chronically overfished nearly every fish\u00ad ery ever discovered; sec Jackson et al. (2001). 13. It's not sufficient to constandy explain away old, inaccurate expres\u00ad sions: we must develop new ones. What is the use in keeping old metaphors or phrases that do not point to reality? Por example, we may say \"The Bush of Evolution\" or \"The Labyrinth of Evolution,' rather than 'The Ladder of Evolution.\" A good way to find such new metaphors may be to create a Web site where anyone could suggest them, and, after a time, select new ones to start incorporating into our common speech. Perhaps poets, being familiar with the power of image and metaphor, could be helpful. References Brooks, D.J. 2001.

Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER The Psychologist, the Philosopher, and the Librarian The Information-literacy Version of CRITIC The information-literacy version of CRITIC expands upon Wayne R. Bartz's development of that acronym. This step-by-step method for introductory critical thinking is reinforced by an exercise inspired by Bertrand Russell. BRAD MATTHIES In my role as an academic librarian, I am frequently asked by faculty members to teach information-literacy skills to their students. Broadly defined, an information-liter\u00ad ate person knows when information is needed and also has the ability to \"locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information\" (Association of College and Research Libraries 1989). The notion of creating lifelong learners who have the ability to think critically about all manner of information is central to the philosophy of information literacy (Associa\u00ad tion of College and Research Libraries 2000). An informa\u00ad tion-literate person has acquired a skill set which allows him to continue learning throughout his lifetime. During the fall of 2002, my colleague and I designed a SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 49 Information backing Testing Independent verification Conclusion series of library-instruction sessions for a newly developed freshman course. Among the many requirements for this par\u00ad ticular course was an emphasis on helping students to think critically about information. In effect, we needed to provide the students wirh a basic set of information-literacy skills. Aside from being a librarian, I also consider myself to be a \"rational skeptic\" (Shermer 1989, 17), and on more than once occasion, 1 have been known to practice philosophy and sci\u00ad ence without a license. It was while developing the evaluation component of our sessions that I happened to read an article by Wayne R. Bartz, published in the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER (September/October 2002). Calling his methodology an acronym, CRITIC, Bartz described a simple mnemonic method that he successfully used to teach beginning psychol\u00ad ogy students the scientific method. My colleague and I adapted Bartz's work and created what I like to call the information-literacy version of CRITIC. Our acronym' is a step-by-step process that helps students to eval\u00ad uate and select credible sources based on die available facts. Like Bartz, we have incorporated elements of die scientific method into our acronym; however, being librarians, we also relied on our expertise in source evaluation, source selection, and information literacy. What follows is our adaptation of Bartz's original idea. Brad Matthies, M.L.S., is a reference and instruction librarian at Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana. He can be reached at bmatthie@butler. edu. The Information-literacy Version of CRITIC Claim? Role of Information backing the claim? Testing? Independent verification? Conclusion? (Note: Our last three words vary slightly from Bartz's original acronym.) Claim What is your source saying? Is the source's claim both timely and relevant to your par\u00ad ticular question or thesis? Has the source presented the claim in a clear and reasonable manner, or is there evidence of motivationally biased language? If the source is overtly biased or totally unintelligible, you should reconsider 1 * ^~- using it to support your paper or diesis. Role of die Claimant Is the author of the information clearly identifiable? If so, can his or her credibility be established? Also, based on your prior examination of the claim, is there any rea\u00ad son to suspect bias on the part of the author? This may include political, religious, philosophical, cultural, and financial biases. For example, could a concern for profits and sales cause the C.E.O. of an automotive company to state that her company makes the most reliable cars in the world? If you suspect bias or a lack of credibility, this does not automatically invalidate the information. Rather, it means that you will have to place more emphasis on the other steps of CRITIC before you can make a decision on this source. Information Backing the Claim What information does the source present to back the claim? Is it information that can be verified, or does this source rely on testimony or anecdotal evidence? If this source presents original research, does the source explain how the author gath\u00ad ered die data? If the source is an article, does it cite references and are they credible? If the source is a journal article, is die journal peer-reviewed? Finally, you should always remember the skeptic's rule: extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Consider diese examples: Example 1: The reason that Brand X's car is more reliable tiian similar cars in its class is diat Brand X uses a computer-auto\u00ad mated assembly line. Example 2: The reason that Brand X's car is more reliable than similar cars in its class is that Brand X utilizes secret, alien technology that only that company is privy to. Example 1 presents a reasonable claim that could be backed up with ordinary evidence. On the other hand, example 2 presents an incredible claim that would require some extraordinary evi\u00ad dence to prove. 50 Volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER How might you test die claim your source is making? Conduct your own qualitative or quantitative research (e.g., marketing research, statistical analysis, design a research study, etc.). Example: Claim: All business majors are Republicans. Possible test: A survey measuring the political preferences of all business majors may support or disprove this claim. It may not always be possible or practical for you to con\u00ad duct a detailed analysis of the information or to carry out actual testing. If this happens to be the case, can you devise a possible way to test the claim? If a claim cannot be tested, then that claim should not be taken seriously. Independent Verification Has another reputable information source evaluated the claims the source is making? Does this source support or refute the original claim? After conducting a review of the literature, what do the experts have to say about die claim? Are the experts basing their opinions on detailed analysis and testing, or are they just presenting opinions widi little or no evidence? Moreover, are the experts truly experts on the topic, or are they presenting opinions about a topic they are not qualified to dis\u00ad cuss? This step may also include speaking to professors, librar\u00ad ians, or someone in the relevant business or industry. If you find that numerous experts confirm the original claim your source is making, dien it is probably true. If numerous experts dispute the original claim, then the original claim is probably false. If you find that the experts do not agree, then the claim that your source is making is, at best, inconclusive. Sometimes, the experts will conclude that there is not enough information to reach a consensus either way. In this instance, you should suspend your judgment until you can find more information.'' Conclusion What is your conclusion about the source? Taking into account the first five steps of CRITIC which apply to your source, make a judgment: Should this source be used in a paper or report? Information evaluation can be very subjective, so it is important to consider all of the ascertainable facts. Remember that the first five steps of CRITIC need to be looked at as a whole before you can make a final decision about your source. Also, not all information sources can be examined using each of the five steps. In this case, you should then consider the steps that do apply to your particular source. Finally, you should always be prepared for undiscovered infor\u00ad mation that may later invalidate your source. CRITIC in the Classroom We developed our version of CRITIC, but still needed an exercise to foster student learning and impress upon students the importance of why they should critically evaluate all infor\u00ad mation. Being a bibliophile and a skeptic, I decided to consult the skeptical literature for an idea. I found myself rereading Bertrand Russell's Sceptical Essays, which soon led me to a solu\u00adtion. Russell writes: \"If there is to be toleration in the world, one of the things taught in schools must be the habit of weigh\u00ad ing evidence, and the practice of not giving full assent to propositions which there is no reason to believe true\" (Russell 1928, 169-170). Following this observation, Russell goes on to describe one such exercise that would do exactly that. He proposes that to teach the value of skepticism, students should be encouraged to study a controversial issue that is well-cov\u00ad ered in the media. Naturally, some of this media coverage is biased. Thus, he reasoned, by exposing diem to the bias early on, students could be taught to infer what really happened. According to Russell, teaching this type of skepticism \"would make the children in later life immune from those appeals to idealism by which decent people are induced to further the schemes of scoundrels.\" So, with Russell's eloquently simple idea as my inspiration, we designed a similar activity that we could use to reinforce CRITIC. In our exercise, students are divided into groups and given a preselected source. Using the information-literacy ver\u00ad sion of CRITIC, each group is required to evaluate its source for credibility. The overall goal is to report to the class on whether the group's source should be used to support the topic of a fictitious paper. Naturally, the key to making this activity work is for the instructor or librarian to select a topic that is widely covered and controversial. For example, one fictitious topic we often use is a paper that investigates Wal-Mart's \"Made in the U.S.A.\" campaign, which was used in the late 1980s. Despite Wal-Mart's claims to the contrary, many of Wal-Mart's products were\u2014and continue to be\u2014made over\u00ad seas. Moreover, there is what could be best described as a sub\u00ad culture of anti-Wal-Mart activists who generate a prolific amount of anti-Wal-Mart literature. Some of this literature is true, some is biased, some is apparently false, and all of it is suited for this exercise\u2014especially when it is compared to sim\u00ad ilar, credible sources. Yet the question remains: does our exercise3 foster critical thinking? My colleague and I purposely designed this activity around active learning techniques, and we incorporated ele\u00ad ments of constructivist learning pedagogy.' These strategies allow the instructor to observe learning as it happens; so, while our observations are admittedly anecdotal and potentially biased, we have concluded thus far that CRITIC does indeed work/ In fact, from a pragmatic point of view, even if the stu\u00ad dents do not remember all of the component steps of CRITIC, they do walk away from our workshop with the real\u00ad ization that information can be easily manipulated. This, of course, is the main thrust of Russell's simple idea and likely why the exercise is so effective. Many of the instructors we work with often create addi\u00ad tional class assignments that require their students to use CRITIC (e.g., using CRITIC to evaluate sources in a final project, questions about CRITIC on a quiz, etc.). After pre\u00ad senting the acronym and exercise at a recent library instruction conference, we received many positive comments from our peers, including frequent references to the exercise itself. So far members of the academy seem to be enamored with Russell's SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 51 idea. Of course, it is likely that Russell would not be surprised. In fact, were Russell alive today, I suspect that he would sar\u00ad donically shake his head at the wealth of misinformation, con\u00ad fusion, and outright quackery that abounds in the information age. Such examples as the Sokal Hoax, which challenge die infallibility of scholarly publications (Sokal 2000), the forged burial box of James, brother of Jesus, the New York Times pla\u00ad giarism case (Adler 2003), and the Raelian fiasco (Mirsky 2003) would only serve to bolster Russell's skeptical mission of outreach and education. Skeptics should seek out an often-overlooked partner in academia: the librarian. By the very nature of their profession, librarians are constantly organizing, evaluating, and selecting all formats of information to support the cause of education and information literacy. In conclusion, I issue a two-part challenge to all educators in the skeptical community. First, I challenge all skeptics to teach basic skepticism whenever and wherever they can and to whomever will listen. Moreover, do not be afraid to teach out\u00ad side of academia and do not be dissuaded by colleagues who might criticize your efforts. Despite being admonished by his peers (Lieber 2004, 12\u201413), Russell still took the time to make philosophy and critical thinking6 presentable to the layperson. So, let Bertrand Russell serve as your inspiration! Pan two of my challenge is for all skeptics in education to seek out an often-overlooked skeptical partner in academia: the librarian. By the very nature of their profession, librarians are constantly organizing, evaluating, and selecting all formats of information to support the educational enterprise. Moreover, being staunch proponents of democracy and the freedom to read, they are likely to not shy away from many of the controversial issues that skeptics often become embroiled in (American Library Association 2000), and they certainly are willing to collaborate with anyone who is willing to further the cause of information literacy (Association of College and Research Libraries 2001). Whether labeled skepticism, critical thinking, or informa\u00ad tion literacy, these merJiods need to be widely taught. Indeed, were skepticism taught on a wider scale, perhaps Russell's dream could come true and, collectively, we would finally \"rev\u00ad olutionise human life\" (Russell 1928, 13).

HarperCollins, New ISBN 0-0662-1413-0. 603 pp. Hardcover, $27.95. Michael Crichton's latest book, State of Fear, is a novel in name only. More accurately described, it's a work of thinly disguised political commentary, in which a wildly implausible plot\u2014ecoterrorists supplant Al Qaeda as the leading global menace, unveiling dastardly weather modifica\u00ad tion schemes to convince the public of a nonexistent global warming threat\u2014 serves as an excuse for a string of Socratic-style dialogues about climate science. Since Crichton's characters repeatedly find themselves jetting across the globe to stop the latest ecoterrorist menace (blowing off parts of Antarctica, unleashing a tsunami, and so on), they have plenty of time in transit to ques\u00ad tion the reality of human-caused global warming. The plot contrivance of a pending climate-change lawsuit (aban\u00ad doned once its proponents realize they don't have a case) provides yet another didactic opportunity for the author. When the legal team cross-examines one of our heroes about climate science, Crichton seizes the chance to insert tem\u00ad perature-trend diagrams and copious footnotes into the text. All of these \"educational\" dialogues take the same format: A smart-guy char\u00ad acter, holding forth in technical banter that bears little resemblance to spoken English, runs rings around a character who holds misguided beliefs that he or she cannot defend with reference to the scientific literature. These erroneous MICHAEL STATE of FEAR beliefs all hinge on the notion that Earth is wanning significantly, that this has resulted at least in part from human activities, and that the consequences have begun to make themselves felt and could grow quite severe over time\u2014a robust mainstream scientific view, although apparently not one shared by Crichton. Hilariously, at the end of his book, Crichton states: \"A novel such as State of Fear, in which so many diver\u00ad gent views are expressed, may lead the reader to wonder where, exactly, the author stands on these issues....\" As if it wasn't obvious. Crichton's central smart guy is Richard John Kenner, a scientist who heads the fictional MIT Center for Risk Analysis while doubling as a secret agent who likes to bring lawyers and hot babes along on his adventures. Kenner seems a composite of Richard Lindzen, the famed MIT prof and global warming \"skeptic,\" John Graham, who headed the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis before joining the Bush administration, and Vin Diesel. In essence, Kenner's character serves as a vessel into which Crichton can pour his agenda-driven reading of the scientific evidence. Here's an example of how Kenner talks: There are one hundred sixty thousand glaciers in the world, Ted. About sixty-seven thousand have been inventoried but only a few have been studied with care. There is mass bal\u00ad ance data extending five years or more for only seventy-nine glaciers in the entire world. So, how can you say they're all melting? Try reading that aloud and then ask yourself whether real people, even real scientists, speak this way. Though per\u00ad haps intended to make Kenner seem smart, such contrived dialogue only makes him seem fake. Nevertheless, Kenner excels at get\u00ad ting equally fictitious lawyers and Hollywood celebrities to see the error of their ways. But for some reason, Crichton never has his mouthpiece argue against anothet scientist who Chris Mooney writes the \"Doubt and About \u00b0 column for wunv. csicop. org and is a SKEPTICAL INQUIRER contributing editor. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 53 REVIEWS reads the evidence on climate change differently and can cite literature to back his or her view as well. In the real world you can find a small army of these. I have interviewed many of them, heard others lecture, and met still more at con\u00ad ferences. In Crichton's universe, how\u00ad ever, they seem not to exist. Crichton's scientific footnotes\u2014 which he promises \"are real\"\u2014similarly misrepresent reality. In the text of State of Fear as well as in its twenty pages of citations, Crichton glosses over a high- profile 2001 National Academy of Sciences report titled Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Key Questions, which opens with the following passage: Greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earths atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise. Temperatures are, in fact, rising. The changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to human activi\u00ad ties, but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural variability. Human-induced warming and associ\u00ad ated sea level rises to con\u00ad tinue through the twenty-first cen\u00ad tury. Secondary effects arc suggested by computer model simulations and basic physical reasoning. These include increases in rainfall rates and increased susceptibility of semi-arid regions to drought. The impacts of these changes will be critically depen\u00ad dent on the magnitude of the warm\u00ad ing and the rate with which it occurs. The mention of \"human-induced warming and associated sea level rises\" is particularly interesting, because Crich\u00ad ton seeks to debunk concerns about ris\u00ad ing sea levels. Crichton's footnotes also exclude statements by the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union, which broadly agree with NAS. No wonder real-life climate experts, of the sort that Crichton excommunicates from his \"novel,\" have scathingly critiqued his depiction of their field and the level of understanding it has achieved. As riiese examples suggest, Crichton's skewed reading of the scientific literature leads him into an utter abandonment of literary verisimilitude. For this author, at least, bad science fuels bad fiction. Nowhere does that shortcoming become more apparent dian in Crichton's inabil\u00ad ity to capture human character. His envi\u00ad ronmentalists are total creeps; and not just that\u2014they're nefarious schemers, who won't even stop at mass murder to achieve their greater goals. As one ecoter- rorist puts it, shortly before Kenner silences him with a bullet: \"Casualties are inevitable in accomplishing social change. History tells us that.\" Sorry, but I've hung out with plenty of environmental activists (although no ecoterrorists), and they're just not as Crichton describes them. They have many flaws\u2014naive idealism and politi\u00ad cal impotence, perhaps\u2014but they're not cold-blooded killers. They would never dream of causing the types of disasters they're pledged to work against. In Crichton's fictional universe, however, global warming concerns are all made up. Therefore, environmentalists must transform into outright evildoers\u2014how else to account for their real-life behav\u00ad ior? Crichton should have realized, from the unreality of his characters, that he'd been tugged in the wrong direction. The audior's depictions of journalists have similar flaws. In State of Fear, reporters exist solely as environmentalist lapdogs. Crichton makes this plain in a scene in which his characters find them\u00ad selves watching a newscast: They cut to a younger man, appar\u00ad ently the weatherman. \"Thanks, Terry. Hi, everybody. If you're a long\u00ad time resident of the Grand Canyon State, you've probably noticed that our weather is changing, and scien\u00ad tists have confirmed that what's behind it is our old culprit, global wanning. Today's flash flood is just one example of the trouble ahead\u2014 more extreme weather conditions, like floods and tornadoes and droughts\u2014all as a result of global warming.\" Sanjong nudged Evans, and handed him a sheet of paper. It was a printout of a press release from the NERF [an environmental group] Web site. Sanjong pointed to the text: \"... scientists agree there will be trou\u00ad ble ahead: more extreme weather events, like floods and tornadoes and droughts, ail as a result of global warming.\" Evans said, \"This guy's just read\u00ad ing a press release?\" \"That's how they do it, these days,\" Kenner said. \"They don't even bother to change a phrase here and there. They just read the copy out\u00ad right. And of course, what he's saying is not true.\" In fact, no self-respecting journalist would take an environmentalist press release and copy it verbatim. Members of the mainstream national media do view environmental groups as self-inter\u00ad ested, and check their claims with inde\u00ad pendent scientists. What Crichton can't admit, or can't stand, is that in reality these scientists often agree with the environmental groups. In State of Fear, however, Crichton is God, and his views become the book's laws of nature. That's never more appar\u00ad ent than in Crichton's numerous \"con\u00ad version\" scenes, in which characters who had previously believed in the dogma of global warming suddenly see the light. At one point in the novel, two such fig\u00ad ures confide in one another following a legal cross examination: \"I mean, when I gave those answers, I wasn't saying what I really think. I'm, uh . . . I'm asking some\u2014I'm chang\u00ad ing my mind about a lot of this stuff.\" \"Really?\" \"Yes,\" he said, speaking softly. \"Those graphs of temperature, for instance. They raise obvious ques\u00ad tions about the validity of global warming.\" She nodded slowly. Looking at him closely. He said, \"You, too?\" She continued to nod. Let's face it: such writing is pure porn for deniers of global warming, in much the same way that fictional accounts of UFO-abduction skeptics converting into true believers titillate UFO fans. In the end, State of Fear bears little resemblance to Crichton's most success\u00ad ful sci-fi thrillers, like Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain. Instead, it's far 54 Volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER REVIEWS more reminiscent of Disclosure, Crichton's perverse attempt to address the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace by focusing on a case in which a woman harasses a man, rather than vice-versa. Similarly, in State of Fear, the specter of a vast environmen\u00ad talist conspiracy\u2014a problem even less significant than sexual harassment of men by their female superiors\u2014gets trumpeted, while real concerns (climate change, for instance) get scoffed at. By the book's end, one can only ask: What planet is Michael Crichton living on? Because this one is clearly getting warmer. Editor's Note: The SKEPTICAL INQUIRER invited Michael Crichton to publish in SI his own comments about global warming and the politicalization of science from his viewpoint but received no response. Kindness Explained PETER LAMAL Kindness in a Cruel World: The Evolution of Altruism. By Nigel Barber. Prometheus Books, Amherst, New York. 2004. ISBN 1-59102-228-2. 415 pp. Hardcover, $28. Why do people donate their blood, leave tips for people they will never see again, and throw themselves on hand grenades that are about to explode? Nigel Barber makes a convincing case that altruism can be understood as the result of evolu- tionary-adaptationist processes, and he consistently applies an evolutionary- adaptationist framework throughout his new book Kindness in a Cruel World. And in doing so, he addresses questions about, and criticisms of, the concept of altruism and its origins. Barber defines altruism as \"actions that help another individual at some cost to the altruist.\" This approach enables us to include nonhuman species in our consid\u00ad eration of altruism. As Barber notes, the biological definition of altruism he advo\u00ad cates is sometimes criticized on the grounds that supposed acts of selflessness are really only selfishness in disguise. If Peter Lamal is an emeritus professor of psy\u00ad chology at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte and a Fellow of the Division of Behavior Analysis of the American Psychological Association. E-mail: plamalQcarolina. rr. com. altruistic behavior is biologically based, it is only undertaken to make the altruist feel better, to increase the reproductive success of the altruist, or to increase the prevalence of genes for altruistic behavior. In response. Barber maintains that altru\u00ad ism is real because it is predicated on evolved moral emotions like empathy and shame. Furthermore, humans and other species can engage in altruistic actions that have no ulterior motive, other than whatever pleasure comes from the altruis\u00ad tic behavior itself. And there might also be no delayed benefit for the behavior. In order for altruistic tendencies to have evolved, it was not necessary that every altruistic act should have a reproductive payoffi rather, altruistic behaviors should generally increase the biological success of those acting altruistically. The well-established principle of kin selection provides support for the biol\u00ad ogy-driven perspective on altruism, and Barber points out that the simplest and most widespread type of altruism is parental care of offspring. The principle of kin selection is valuable, because it allows us to make important predictions about people's behavior. But it is impor\u00ad tant to bear in mind that the predictions derived from evolutionary-adaptationist theory are about the behavior of groups, not individuals. And Barber provides numerous examples of individuals who have behaved selfishly. Organisms are not born into and do not live in vacuums. As Barber shows, environmental variation has as much to do with altruism (or its absence) as with genetics. The famous experiments of Stanley Milgram and Phillip Zimbardo are part of a large body of research that indicates that aggression and discrimination, in addition to altruism, are traceable to powerful forces of the social environment. As we have been adapted for group life, the influences of our social environment are understandable. This history explains the capacity of humans for altruism toward strangers as well as the frequent hostility of members of an in- group to members of an out-group. The sensitivity of human altruism to the social environment means that it is weakened in developed countries because of the lack of close relation\u00ad ships between people and their neigh\u00ad bors. During our evolutionary history, we behaved most altruistically toward those with whom we lived in close proximity for long periods of time. Barber maintains that among some mammals, including primates and humans, \"moral emotions\" may be nec\u00ad essary for altruistic behavior. Such moral emotions as guilt, embarrassment, out\u00ad rage, empathy, and gratitude are expressed in all human societies. For example, moral outrage at cheats or \"free riders\" is a necessary enforcement sys\u00ad tem of reciprocal altruism among humans, and it plays an important role in keeping people honest. In addition to his exposition of the concept of altruism and its development in humans, Barber discusses the social impact of altruism (kindness) on health, kindness among strangers, conformity as altruism, and when altruism fails. As throughout the book, the topics are illus\u00ad trated with interesting examples. The book's last section deals with altruism and SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 55 REVIEWS politics broadly conceived and includes discussion of the potential benefits and costs of religion, saving the environment, and criminals (\"evil people\"). With respect to religion, it is clear that religious belief is neither a necessary nor a suffi\u00ad cient condition for altruistic behavior. Readers should be aware of the fol\u00ad lowing: Contrary to Barber's glowing description of Pitcairn Island, in 2004 (presumably after this book was sent to Students of language have long argued that common usages of words are as important as official definitions, since words often soak up assumptions of the day. This causes problems when commonplace usages of words override all other possible mean\u00ad ings. As Francis Bacon observed, lan\u00ad guage can trick us into uncritically accepting assumptions associated with particular words\u2014a fallacy he called the \"idol of the marketplace.\" Consider the common advice that \"we must be careful not to generalize.\" This adage implies that generalization is inherently wrong and we should take special care to avoid it. Yet generalization is needed to understand the complex world we live in, and science and rational thought would be impossible without it. In addition, note the paradox that the statement \"we must be careful not to generalize\" is itself a generalization, so we would disobey the advice if we followed it! Clearly, words like generalization carry unstated cultural assumptions that con- Phil Mole wrote \"Nurturing Suspicion: What College Students Learn about Science\" for our May/June 2004 issue. the printer), the island's mayor and five other Pitcairnian men were sentenced to prison for a string of rapes and sexual assaults dating back forty years. Barber also conveys the distinct impression that the Kyoto agreement to deal with the world's polluted atmosphere is dead. This is not true. This book is written for a general audience and includes citations of references for those who wish to delve deeper. I highly recommend this book. fuse rather than clarify discussions. When we ignore the biases piggy\u00ad backing on common words, we perpet\u00ad uate a kind of linguistic con game. We may convince ourselves that certain words carry inevitable implications, but the perceived implications may not necessarily follow. The implications we perceive may merely come from widely held ideas about the words, and we err if we identify these ideas with legiti\u00ad mate definitions. If we do so, we com\u00ad promise the intellectual honesty of public debate and contribute to philo\u00ad sophical confusion. For these reasons, many writers have protested the infiltration of language by unrecognized biases. A few have ad\u00ad dressed this problem by writing satirical dictionaries emphasizing the unstated ideas lurking within word usages. These dictionaries often replace the official definitions of words with comical exag\u00ad gerations of their common meanings or expose deeper truths about the words in question. The great novelist Gustave Flaubert appended such a document to his novel Bouvard and Pecuchet. This addendum eventually earned separate publication as The Dictionary of Received Opinions, which has been justly celebrated for satirical definitions such as these: Memory. Complain of your own; indeed, boast of not having any. But roar like a bull it anyone says you lack judgment. Principles. Always \"eternal.\" Nobody can tell their nature or number; no matter, they are sacred all the same. The American writer Ambrose Bierce also contributed to this genre with his classic book The Devil's Dictionary, pub\u00ad lished in its final form in 1906. The book is a comedic favorite because of its caustic humor (it defines disabuse as \"to present your neighbor with another and better error than the one he has deemed it advantageous to embrace\"), yet its function was partly serious. Bierce, like Flaubert, disliked the prejudices and unexamined ideas packaged in fre\u00ad quently used words and phrases and wanted to do something about it. Ophelia Benson and Jeremy Stang- room wanted to do something about it too, and The Dictionary of Fashionable Nonsense is the result. Proprietors of the excellent rationalist Web site Butterflies andWheels.com, Benson and Stang- room fight fashionable nonsense of all flavors, whether it's the wishful think\u00ad ing of Intelligent Design proponents or the latest examples of political group- think. Some of the nonsense fashion\u00ad able today was also popular in the days of Flaubert or Bierce, particularly the automatic distrust of anyone claiming authority in matters of knowledge. But our times are also filled with new and more pernicious absurdities, particu\u00ad larly those of an extreme-leftist variety. Radical postmodernism denies that sci\u00ad ence is superior to other \"ways of knowing,\" and theory-obsessed writers \"lean on clotted jargon and tortured syntax to make no point at all.\" As rational leftists, Benson and Stangroom are rightly concerned about the popu\u00ad larity of such illogical thought in pub\u00ad lic discourse. Inevitably, some fashionable non\u00ad sense uses the linguistic sleight of hand Nonsense in Vogue PHIL MOLE The Dictionary of Fashionable Nonsense: A Guide for Edgy People. By Ophelia Benson and Jeremy Stangtoom. Souvenir Press, London. 2004. ISBN 0-285-63714-2. 128 pp. Softcover, $14. 56 Volume 29, Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER REVIEWS discussed here. For instance, as the authors demonstrate, natural often serves as a synonym for good, thereby implying that all natural herbal remedies are better than \"artificial\" scientific remedies. The authors explore these biases particularly well, and their satiri\u00ad cal definitions are funny and insightful. Ponder these: Anything goer. Technical phrase in the philosophy of science coined by Paul Feyerabend. Means, roughly, it's too much trouble to explain deduction and induction so go figure them out for yourself. Empiricism: Absurd notion that observation and measurement are useful in finding out about things. Herbs: The best medicine. Natural, organic, pure, wholesome. Can cure everything. Western medicine ignores herbs, preferring artificial chemical substances made in test tubes no one knows how. Herbs are much better because not chemical\u2014chemicals, of course, are toxic. Hierarchy. A highly suspect category. People who accept it are the lowest of the low. Human naturr. Fantasy. Fictitious entity, like Santa Claus or the tooth fairy or the free lunch. Humans have no nature, only culture; we can learn to fly, or live in the ocean, or echolocate, or pick things up with our trunks, if we will only concentrate. Ideology. Ideas we don't agree with. Probably exploitative. Judgment Bad, wicked, excluding, discriminatory attitude to other peo\u00ad ple's ways of knowing. Paradigm. A thing that shifts, thus proving that scientists merely make up their findings. See KUHN. Skeptics have probably noticed many of these dubious uses of language without fully understanding die pur\u00ad poses rhey serve or the reasons they seem attractive as substitutes for real thought. The Dictionary of Fashionable Nonsense is valuable because it high\u00ad lights these tactics in a clear and very humorous way. And this is a noble pur\u00ad pose precisely because, as the authors note, \"truth matters.. .. And it also matters because if human intelligence matters, if clear thinking and reason and open eyes are good things, then fashionable nonsense really is important and worth resisting.\" This book is an excellent contribution to the small but important genre of satirical dictionaries, and is warmly recommended to anyone wishing a deeper understanding of die follies of our time.

The network that gave the world the intentionally dis- informative In Search Of that suppressed known facts in order to create a mystery where none existed, is at it again. Medium could have been a legitimate fantasy series about a character with powers that exist only in fantasy, com\u00ad parable with such similar series as Charmed, Tru Calling, Early Edition, and Quantum Leap, none of which tried to buy ratings by pretending that the concepts presented exist in the real world. In contrast, NBC continues to claim that Medium is based on the real- life experiences of a self-pro\u00ad claimed psychic. In fact, it is based on a fantasy novel (pos\u00ad ing as nonfiction) by Allison DuBois, in which she claims to have solved crimes and demonstrated other extrasensory powers that simply have not been proven to exist. When asked by CSICOP if the network had checked on DuBois's claims and background before they employed her as a consultant for rhc show, an NBC representative admitted that they had not, and gave the impression that she believed that the show's concept, although not specific scripts, is nonfic\u00ad tion. NBC did, however, remove from its William Harwood is a member of the Editorial Board of Free Inquiry, and a Contributing Editor of American Ration\u00ad alist. He is the author of twenty-six books, including The Disinformation Cycle. Web site DuBois's claims that she had worked with specific law enforcement agencies while continuing to endorse her claim that unidentified law enforcement agencies use her services. Nonetheless, instead of beginning the pilot episode with a disclaimer, \"This story is fantasy, and has no resem\u00ad blance to any real person or event,\" it started with the subtitle, \"There really is an Allison. Really.\" The pilot then con- Medium executive producer Gordon Caron, actor Patricia Arquette, Allison DuBois attend a panel discussion for the television show. Ph Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images. centrated on making DuBois's pre\u00ad tended \"powers\" seem believable, much the way Uri Geller devoted much of his performances to convincing his audi\u00ad ence that he was not a blatant humbug. While Medium has entertainment value for persons who believe DuBois's pow\u00ad ers exist outside of her own imagina\u00ad tion, it is bound to disappoint viewers who recognize that passing off a teleplay about a psychic solving a child's murder as nonfiction contributes to the dumb\u00ad ing of America. Viewers of Medium should ask them\u00ad selves why psychics are not allowed to testify in court cases. The answer is that evidence has to be judged on the basis of science and rationality, rather than hunches that have never been shown to have more validity than those of tea-leaf readers. If self-styled psychics were some\u00ad thing other than self-deluded cranks and self-serving humbugs, crime solving would be an exact science, and psychic testimony would be the most valid kind, taking all the guesswork out of rendering a verdict. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a psychic. No psychic has ever helped law enforcement officers to solve a crime, anytime, anywhere, in any way. A year-long study of such claims led to the conclusion that, as CSICOP Senior Research Fellow Joe Nickell wrote, \"care\u00ad ful examination reveals no successful crime solving, but instead only tangled webs of misinformation, generalization, opportunistic credit-taking, and, in some instances, proba\u00ad ble deceit.\"' Michael Shermer, in his book The Borderlands of Science, states that when NBC broadcast a pseudodocumen- tary claiming that Egyptian pyramids were built by an alien civilization 10,000 years ago, \"not a single archaeolo\u00ad gist, scientist or skeptic of any academic or mainstream credi\u00ad bility appeared on the show to present even an iota of dis\u00ad sent.\"' And lest anyone think NBC is the only or most bla\u00ad tant offender, CBS's Incredible Discovery of Noah's Ark and Fox's alien autopsy hoax similarly perpetrated lies. Shermer notes that \"Most people that work in the television business realize that most of the claims presented on these paranormal shows are utter non\u00ad sense . . . but they were restricted by the networks from saying so on the air.\" The \"vast wasteland's\" attitude a quarter-cen\u00ad tury ago was: If it gets ratings, what does it matter that it contributes to the dumbing of America? The attitude today is: If it gets ratings, what does it m.uicr that it contributes to the dumb\u00ad ing of America? Since the opening episode. Medium has departed from the specific claims made in DuBois's pseudo-autobiography. and oto by SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 59 REVIEWS and has switched to stories that even DuBois acknowledges are fictitious, die rationale being that the series is designed to be entertainment, not a documentary. But die repetitive scenes in which die fic\u00ad titious DuBois has to overcome the skep\u00ad ticism of new investigators in every episode have zero entertainment value and are included only to stress the programs pretense that her claims are not fantasy. And whereas the opening episode depicted DuBois receiving information from the past and present by non-sensory means, subsequent episodes showed members of her family of psychics seeing images of die Listing does not preclude future review. Debunked! ESP, Telekinesis, and other Pseudoscience. Georges Charpak and Henri Broch. Translated by Bart K. Holland. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, Maryland, 2004. 137 pp. $25, hardcover. Two distinguished physicists, one a Nobel laureate (Charpak, CERN) and one a prominent French skeptic (Broch, University of Nice), team up to expose the tricks of the trade that keep astrologers, spoon benders, and TV psychics in business. They also show how pseudoscientists use sci\u00ad ence, statistics, and psychology to bamboozle audiences. Along the way they demystify coincidences and radiation and assert the values of science and teason. Just a Theory: Exploring die Nature of Science. Mod Ben-Ari. Prometheus Books, New York, 2005. 265 pp, $21, paper. A short modern overview of the nature of sci\u00ad ence\u2014philosophy, history, and sociology\u2014 written for a general audience so readers can understand and appreciate the scientific claims diat bombard us every day. The goal is to help readers \"distinguish claims that are provisional and debatable from claims that are so well established that rejecting them drives you over die border into pseudo- science and antiscience.\" There are lively chapters on \"Just a Theory.

The Case for Decentralized Generation of Electricity Regarding your article \"Critical Thinking about Energy: The Case for Decentralized Generation of Electricity\" (January/ February 2005): First off, kudos to SI for publishing such a visionary article that is rel\u00ad evant to our contemporary world in which energy demand is causing increasing envi\u00ad ronmental and geopolitical challenges. All too often, skeptics act as little more than cynics who resist change and defend die sta\u00ad tus quo, regardless of the consequences. In chis case, the skeptics are actually acting as visionaries and are well out ahead of the rest of society on a vitally important issue\u2014our ever-increasing demand for energy and how to deliver it efficiently. One criticism I have of the way die issue is framed in the article is that it dwells on old decentralized-powcr-gencration techniques and fails to focus on modern ones. The author relies on the model of decentralized power generation used in die early twentieth century, in which electricity was generated locally from coal or oil, and the waste heat was then used to heat local buildings. The author fails to even casually mention mod\u00ad ern, mainstream deccntralizcd-powcr-gencr- arion options that are in use in the real world today, such as fuel cells, solar/wind, tidal, biomass, landfill gas, etc. There is no controversy regarding whether or not diese decentralized-powcr- gencration technologies are real and viable. I do not understand why die author did not include a broader presentation of the decen\u00adtralized power generation currently available? John Coviello Somerset, New Jersey The near future of electrical-power genera\u00ad tion should be by use of photovoltaic solar panels and wind turbines. Solar panels can cover rJiousands of square miles of deserts in America and Asia. Wind turbines can be installed by die thousands in die Rocky Mountains and the mountains of Europe and Asia. Wind turbines can be installed also on anchored platforms on the ocean just off\u00ad shore of all major cities and on top of high- rise buildings. Solar panels can be installed on the roofs of residences, apartment build\u00ad ings, factories, warehouses, and schools. The resulting pollution-free electric power will also provide power to produce hydrogen gas by electrolysis from seawater for use in hydrogen-fuel-cell cars. We will have eco\u00ad nomical and pollution-free electric power and fuel in great quantities. Martin Annenberg Hunungton Beach, California Thomas R. Casten and Brennan Downes make an excellent case for decentralized gen\u00ad eration of electricity. But a sensible argument doesn't seem to go far in this political cli\u00ad mate. It may be that the best way to sell this idea is to stress the security aspects of smaller, distributed plants\u2014fewer big targets make it harder for terrorists to disrupt electrical sup\u00ad plies over wide areas. David B. Lewis Hamden. Connecticut It was great to see SKEPTICAL INQUIRER expand coverage beyond pseudoscience and religion. I was impressed with \"Critical Thinking about Energy.\" 1 brought the arti\u00ad cle to the aitcmion of my city government, which owns our local powcr-disrribution company. However, I found that die article was overly complex and a bit confusing. For SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, it should have been more concise and simplified. I do hope that SKEPTICAL INQUIRER will continue to delve into other subjects where groupthink is raking us in the wrong direc\u00ad tion. How about \"sustainable growth\"? Roy F. Johnson Columbia, Tennessee The fetal flaw in the \"critical thinking\" of die authors is diat the waste heat produced by generating electricity must be used when it is made. There is no way to store it on a large scale. In other words, die demand for waste heat must be directly proportional to the demand for electricity at all times. There are only very specialized applications where this can work. Anodier \"critical\" flaw by the authors is trying to identify a physical energy problem as a political problem that can be solved by legislation. If only it were that easy. George Ascroft H. Douglas Lightfoot Montreal, Quebec Canada What happened to the laws of thermody\u00ad namics in \"Critical Thinking about Energy\"? For one thing, the heat rejected by a gas or steam turbine is not \"waste\" heat; it is a requirement of these laws. The efficiency of an ideal heat engine is [7\"(hot) - T (cold)] / T (hot). T stands for temperature and is counted from absolute zero. This is about - 460\u00b0F. Modern coal electric plants have a 7(hot) of about 1000\u00b0F, so their best possi\u00ad ble efficiency would be 62 percent, if the heat sink (cooling tower or river water) were at 100\u00b0F. Other losses unfortunately bring this down to just over 40 percent. However, these low efficiencies are not caused by carelessly rejecting waste heat but arc the inevitable consequence of obeying Mother Nature. Two alternatives are used in practice if there is a second use for the heat from a steam or gas turbine. One is to raise die T (cold) to perhaps 300\u00b0F, so useful energy can be extracted from this heat stream. This, of course, reduces the efficiency of the electric plant, and you end up, at best, breaking even. The other is to use heat direcdy from the boiler or odier heat-input device and couple it with a smaller turbine. The elec\u00ad tricity generated is less, but you have a source of high-temperature heat that is often required at a factory, such as a chemical- manufacturing plant. The reason why efficiencies for electrical generation haven't improved since Edison's day is diat die laws of thermodynamics have not changed since then. This is not a utility conspiracy. Edison may have been able to use the waste heat because the technology of get\u00ad ting to a low 7\" (cold) had not yet been invented, or perhaps he didn't understand die ramifications of attempting diis. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 200S 61 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Another important factor not brought up is the subsidies that decentralized electric- power plants get. The electricity they pro\u00ad duce, but don't happen to need, their utility is forced to buy. This is a terrible penalty to the utilities, because they don't want or need the additional electrical capacity at night or on weekends any more than the decentral\u00ad ized producers do. How would the decen\u00ad tralized power scheme fare if they had to shut down and sell their power to the utilities during the afternoon electrical demand peak? This would be great for consumers, since supplying the peak is the most expen\u00ad sive part of electrical generation. It forces you to overbuild to meet it. This is also the main reason for the surge in the use of gas turbines in die last twenty years. They're cheap to build and expensive to run, but you only need to run them at times of peak demand. I think the authors also underestimated or ignored how much more expensive oil and natural gas are compared to coal and nuclear power. Their use would be contrary to the goal of energy independence, and their wide\u00ad spread use is sure to create shortages and sub\u00ad stantially raise the price of these fossil fuels for homeowners. Thomas R. Freeman Columbia, South Carolina Thomas R. Casten responds: Regarding the Coviello and Annenberg letters, deployment of current solar photovoltaic and wind-generation technologies involves deep analysis of government subsidies and their eco\u00ad nomic effect, which goes beyond the article's examination of whether utilities have made opti\u00ad mal economic choices. Solar and wind genera\u00ad tion, while technically proven, have all-in costs substantially above central fossil generation and four to six times the all-in costs of power gener\u00ad ated by recycling waste energy. Off-grid or remote solar power is often cost effective, but on-grid wind or solar receive significant subsidies or cause electric users to pay more for power. Yes, govern\u00ad ments also use taxpayer dollars to subsidize fossil fuel, hydroelectric projects, and nuclear power and do not require old fossil plants to pay for the environmental damage they cause. Analyzing the economic distortion and resulting damage to standards of living of these subsidies is a fascinat\u00ad ing topic but also beyond the scope of our article. Our focus was to show that deploying existing technologies locally would dramatically reduce current power costs and associated pollution by enabling energy recycling. Ascroft and Light/hot are largely correct in stating that waste heat from electric generation must be used instantaneously. Thermal energy can be stored economically as hot water, and such storage is widely used in Scandinavian countries to feed hot-water district-heating loops. These hot-water tanks store heat from weekday peak electric generation for use the following night or weekend to heat homes. But storage is not key to recycling heat to most industrial plants, university and medical cam\u00ad puses, and urban district-heating loops. More than 200 combined-heat-and-power plants developed and operated by organizations we have led or helped manage recycle waste heat by feeding base thermal bads and displacing boiler fuel. Extracting more value from fossil fuel by siting appropriately sized generation near thermal users is technically and econom\u00ad ically feasible. The power industry foils to optimize because of regulatory systems that tie utility profits to invested capital, ignore or penalize efficiency, give grandfather emission rights to old central plants, and shelter electric generation and distribution from competition. Contrary to Thomas Freeman's letter, there are no violations of the laws of thermo\u00ad dynamics in the article. The major assertions have been through something better than peer review\u2014extensive and repeated market review. There are multiple examples, often with decades of operating experience, of local generation with energy recycling of every gen\u00ad erating technology described. These plants save fuel. They use less fuel to produce heat and power than would be used to produce the same useful energy in separate thermal and electric plants. In spite of many barriers to efficiency, power entrepreneurs have deployed more than 70,000 megawatts of combined- heat-and-power plants in the U.S., produc\u00ad ing roughly 8 percent of U.S. power. In Denmark, Finland, and the Netherlands, where many regulatory barriers were removed, roughly 50 percent of all power is generated in combined-heat-and-power plants. The problem is not thermodynamics. Optimizing the power system is a techno- economic issue. Freeman claims that extracting 300' Fahrenheit energy from an electric plant \"reduces the efficiency of the electric plant and you end up, at best, breaking even.\" Let us be more precise. Steam-turbine plants will gener\u00ad ate more electricity as the temperature of heat rejection is lowered. The very best electric-only steam-turbine plants are located next to very cold bodies of water\u2014the North Sea or Lake Ontario\u2014and reject their heat at a few degrees above freezing. Removing the heat at a higher temperature will reduce the amount of electricity produced, but heat at that tempera\u00ad ture is useful and can displace boiler fuel Overall efficiency increases dramatically when 40 percent to 60 percent of the energy in the fuel displaces boiler fuel instead of warming lakes and rivers. Our research, which matches our operating experience, shows that power plants that extract and recycle useful-tempera\u00ad ture heat save $10 to $20 per megawatt-hour versus electric-only plants, not exactly \"at best breaking even.\" Finally, Freeman wrongly assumes that all decentralized generation will use oil or natural gas. The article demonstrates that every fuel including coal and nuclear, will produce more value in decentralized plants that recycle ther\u00ad mal energy than in central plants that heat lakes and rivers. More important, the cheapest power, which causes no incremental burning of fossil fuel and no incremental pollution, is generated from presently wasted industrial energy\u2014from gas that is flared, heat from process exhaust, and gas or steam-pressure drop. A draft EPA study identified nearly 100,000 megawatts of power\u2014nearly equal to the U.S. nuclear fleet\u2014that could be gener\u00ad ated by recycling industrial-waste energy. But U.S. DOE statistics show only 2.5 percent of that potential or 2,500 megawatts of genera\u00ad tion based on recycled energy currently being used. Nearly 15 percent of all U.S. power could be produced out of thin air\u2014-from industrial-waste energy. What is the article \"Critical Thinking about Energy: The Case for Decentralized Generation of Electricity\" doing in SKEPTICAL INQUIRER? I read the Editor's Note; I understand you are \"applying critical inquiry to science-related claims and issues of public importance,\" but this seems far, far removed from the mission and unique role of SI that 1, at least, am subscribing for\u2014 which is to serve as an expert critic of pseu- doscience in our culture. Michael Abrahams Boyds, Maryland Kendrick Frazier responds: Our main task is\u2014and will always remain\u2014 as Mr. Abrahams aptly puts it in his letter, \"to serve as an expert critic of pseudoscience in our culture.\" But we have never been limited to just that role. And for reasons stated in that Editor's Note and in my editorial in our January/February 2004 issue, we will also con\u00ad tinue to apply critical inquiry and investigative analysis to certain wider issues that affect 62 Volume 29. Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER LETTERS TO THE EDITOR society\u2014especially when we have knowledge\u00ad able authors with something unique and important to add that is not available else\u00ad where, as was the case with this article. Responding to Demagogues The article by Vitaly Ginzburg (\"Dema\u00ad gogues against Scientific Expertise,\" January/ February 2005) contained a disturbing sug\u00ad gestion near the end that I would hope scien\u00ad tific minds in general will sensibly reject. After spending much of the article bemoan\u00ad ing the advance of pseudoscience, Ginzburg shares an anecdote of how he once informed a journalist he would no longer answer the journalist's scientific questions while his pub\u00ad lication continued to promote pseudoscience in the form of horoscopes. He goes on to sug\u00ad gest diat a majority of members of the scien\u00ad tific community should take similar stands. Perhaps I am too uneducated to see die logic here, but it seems to me this is a remarkably poorly thought-out strategy. Surely, the most effective way to combat pseudoscience lies in trying to spread science and rational thinking to the masses as often as one can in order to offset die avalanche of misinformation being promoted. To take the attitude that these publications arc unworthy of the benefit of a true scientist's time is hard to see as anything but intellectual elitism. If those who oppose them retreat from the field, die demagogues Ginzburg so disdains simply win the war of ideas by default. Charles Fusner Bethlehem, Pennsylvania Piltdown and Science Massimo Pigliucci is quite correct to insist that die Piltdown affair should be celebrated as a scientific victory (\"Piltdown and How Science Really Works,\" January/February 2005). Nevertheless, he omits a crucial ele\u00ad ment that grants the story greater signifi\u00ad cance. The real hero of the Piltdown story is an infant-hominid fossil found by Raymond Dan. Australopithecus africanus fundamen\u00ad tally contradicted the interpretation of hominid evolution represented by the Piltdown skull. The large cranium was not the first hominid characteristic to evolve. Although Dart's interpretations were legiti\u00ad mately questioned by the scientific commu\u00adnity, further discoveries of fossils in South Africa corroborated them. By die 1940s, many prominent anthropologists accepted die radical idea that die first hominids were small-brained bipeds. Aldiough few anthro\u00ad pologists today africanus as a direct human ancestor, die les\u00ad son it taught us about early hominid evolu\u00ad tion remains valid to this day. The fact that the Piltdown forgery was falsified by its fundamental contradiction with the fossil record demonstrates the way in which paleontology is conducted. With the discovery of new fossils, an initial hypothesis is proposed to establish tin-it place within the present understanding of evolution. Each claim will be skeptically evaluated relative to the quality of evidence that supports the claim and will always be subject to the challenge of the discovery of still more new fossils. Within the evolving paradigm of hominid evolution, Piltdown became a serious anomaly that did not fit the evidence and therefore warranted re-evalua\u00ad tion. It would be reasonable for the antievo- lutionists that cite the Piltdown forgery to acknowledge die role that authentic fossils played in exposing the forgery. If diey are unwilling to be reasonable, then it is our obligation to remind them of these facts. Dennis C. Shaw Instructor of Anthropology Lower Columbia College Longview, Washington Early Humans' Ability to Talk Key Regarding Ralph Estling's comments about the organization of Cro-Magnon brains compared with of Estling speculates diat the Cro-Magnons' main advantage was a brain evolved to a state of superior organization, making it possible for them to \"conceive vastly more.\" He docs talk about their sophisticated linguistic abilities, but attributes this to dieir better-organized brains, which, he says, made this talk possible. It is at least as likely diat die cause of die more sophisticated Cro- Magnon culture is simply the ability to talk. There has been speculation that the Neanderthal had a more limited vocal appa\u00ad ratus that was more like that of apes. If this were so, then\u2014no matter how well orga\u00ad nized their brains\u2014the Neanderthals would have been unable to pass on their acquired skills to others beyond the simple imitation shown by apes. There would have been no cumulative development of culture\u2014no \"standing on the shoulders of giants.\" They would have been left continuously reinvent\u00ad ing die wheel, while die skills of the Cro- Magnons were steadily improving. This is consistent with die relative stabil\u00ad ity across hundreds of thousands of years of pre-sapiens human cultures compared with the explosive advance of Homo sapiens. It is the ability to learn from die mistakes of oth\u00ad ers rather than our own that makes a com\u00ad plex civilization possible. Paul K. Brandon Psychology Department Minnesota State University Mankato, Minnesota JFK Assassination Car In die photograph of a presidential motorcade in the article by Massimo Polidoro, \"Notes on a Strange World: Facts and Fiction in the Kennedy Assassination\" (January/February 2005), the open-top Lincoln Continental in die photograph on page 22 is white. The Zapruder film and other contemporaneous photographs clearly show the president, Mrs. Kennedy, and Governor Connally riding in a black, open-top Lincoln on November 22, 1963. Other details also make it unlikely diat the published photograph was taken in Dallas on die date of die Kennedy assassination: i.e., the unidentified person seated to the left of die First Lady, and die absence of Governor Connally in the jump seat just in front of the president. In defense of the SI editors, die published photo caption is vague but not, technically speaking, wrong, in that it identifies the date as November 1963, not specifically November 22, 1963. While the photo and caption are not technically wrong, SI readers who are too young to remember the Kennedy assassination could easily be con\u00ad fused by die publication of a \"stock\" photo image in a conspiracy-debunking article. The photograph and caption should have been as carefully vetted as the text. Robert J. Coffey Thousand Oaks, California Kendrick Frazier responds: Mr. Coffey is correct. The photo we used was not of the presidential motorcade on that SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2005 63 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR fateful day of November 22, 1963. We should have published a photo from that day. Images and Expectations As a boy growing up in Spain in the 1970s, I was subjected to many TV discussions of the \"inexplicable\" faces in Belmez de la Moraleda, and I used to be scared by sensationalist radio shows exploiting this \"mystery.\" Somehow, 1 grew up to be generally skeptical of such phe\u00ad nomena. That is why I enjoyed Joe Nickell's piece titled \"Rorschach Icons\" (November/ December 2004). May I suggest one more reason for skepticism? If our brains are rigged to see what we expect to see, that explains why no Protestant ever claims to have seen the Virgin Mary but only Jesus, while Catholics report seeing either of the two. Jose Antonio Cabo Villaviciosa Spain Ghost Ship Mary Celeste Terence Hines's review of Brian Hicks's Ghost Ship (January/February 2005) implied that die book presents a new theory about what happened to the crew of the Mary Celeste. I have not read Hicks's book, but based on the review, his theory is a rehash of the one pre\u00ad sented in great detail by Charles Edey Fay in The Story of the Mary Celeste (Salem, Massa\u00ad chusetts: Peabody Museum, 1942; reprinted in 1988, New York: Dover Books)- Fay care\u00ad fully analyzed the testimony of the eyewit\u00ad nesses who found the ship, the prevailing weather patterns in the Atlantic, and nine\u00ad teenth-century maritime practice in general. His conclusion was the same as the one that Hicks proposes: that the crew temporarily took to the boat because they were concerned about leaks in the ship's cargo of alcohol. In particular, Hines incorrectly stated that Hicks is the first to make the point that the crew apparendy intended to return to the ship. Fay described in detail how they (apparently) rigged the main peak halyard as a towline, pre\u00ad sumably because it would be quicker than breaking out a new line from the lazarette. Hines opined that Hicks \"has written the definitive work on this case.\" Based on the review. Ghost Ship actually adds nothing to Charles Fay's exhaustive work. Peter Ansoff Alexandria, Virginia The alcohol theory of the Mary Celeste was described by John Harris in his book. Without a Trace: A Fresh Investigation of Eight Lost Ships and Their Fates (New York: Atheneum, 1981, pp. 42-79), in which he credits Sir William Crocker. This can be found in an article by H.H. Trotti that appeared in the Georgia Skeptic electronic newsletter (January/February 1991) and was reprinted in The Skeptic (March/April 1991). I wonder whether Brian Hicks has been decent enough to mention this earlier source just as Harris and Trotti did. Jan Willem Nienhuys Waalre The Netherlands The theory that the ship was abandoned because of alcohol vapors has been around in one form or another since at least J.G. Lockhart's A Great Sea Mystery (1927). And Hicks is certainly not the first to suggest that Captain Briggs and associates intended to leave die ship only temporarily and return later, as the review states. Captain More\u00ad house, who found the Mary Celeste back in 1872, offered this interpretation. And it isn't correct to say that Briggs and others took nothing with them. The ship's papers were not on the Mary Celeste, and (as the most reasonable explanation) they must have been taken along by Briggs. This poses a problem: Why did Briggs take the papers if he intended to return in a few hours? And why not the log, which is usually consid\u00ad ered prime? Everett F. Bleiler Interlakcn, New York Terence Hines responds: Hicks does mention Fay's 1942 book, calling it a \"fine work of scholarship\" (p. 9) and discusses that author's theory at some length. Hicks's the\u00ad ory, however, differs from Fay's in several respects, based on new evidence uncovered since Fay wrote. Hicks does not mention John Harris, his 1981 book, or Sir William Crocker. 2005): Here's an idea: host a debate between Stephen C. Meyer of the Center for Science and Culture and Rael of the Raelians con\u00ad cerning the nature of the \"designer\" in Intelligent Design. That way, the Christian believers in ID can sec who they've ideologi\u00ad cally \"shacked up\" with and Meyer can point out the obvious flaw in the Raelian's view, that it only begs the question of life's origins to say it was brought here from an alien civ\u00ad ilization. You could kill two birds with one stone\u2014and provide skeptics with a memo\u00ad rably bizarre and entertaining event. Kent Barnett Fayetteville, Arkansas History of Science: H. Pylori and the Making of a Myth This is Kimball Atwood's response to letters in our March/April 2005 issue about his article \"Bacteria, Ulcers, and Ostracism?: H. Pylori and the Making of a Myth\" (November/ December 2004).\u2014EDITOR I am happy that readers seem to have found my article entertaining and instructive. I'm also happy to report that Barry Marshall, the protagonist of the H. pylori story, caught wind of it and wrote me, in part: \"I must say that it was well researched and true enough. Given the communication systems in place in the 1980s (pre-Intemet) I agree that 10 years was about right for acceptance to occur, as it did in 1994. Also, there is always a dis\u00ad crepancy between what comes out of my mouth and what ultimately appears in the medical page of the Sydney Morning Herald.\" I grant the last point and apologize to Dr. Marshall for not having given him more benefit of the doubt. Donald Weitzel wonders if the consider\u00ad able time that elapsed between early reports of bacteria found in human stomachs and the eventual characterization of H pylori constitutes evidence of ostracism. It does not, for the same reasons that Alan Harris discusses in his letter about continental drift. Over the decades following 1930, there were sporadic reports of bacteria found in human stomachs (demonstrating that investigators paid attention when they found them), but these findings were not necessarily associated with diseases and, more to the point, could not reliably be reproduced. The bacteria that Weitzel read about were streptococci, now known to have been contaminants. 64 Volume 29, Issue 3 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER LETTERS TO THE EDITOR At least two distinct technological ad\u00ad vances were necessary to set the stage for die discovery and characterization of H. pylorr. first, a simple and safe method for obtaining gastric mucosa specimens from live patients had to be devised; second, the field of bacte\u00ad riology had to appieciaic die existence of highly fastidious organisms and devise meth\u00ad ods for growing them in culture. Suffice it to say that these advances were not fully in place until die 1970s, at best. Harold Scarbro takes issue with my dis\u00ad missal of \"stress\" as a cause of peptic-ulcer disease (PUD), offering several pieces of evi\u00ad dence to support the stress hypothesis. Space precludes a comprehensive discussion, but here are a few points: 1. I'm not sure what \"stress\" is, and neither are those who tout it as a cause of disease. More precisely, its definition varies from study 10 study. 2. All associations between mental stress and peptic ulcers are compli\u00ad cated by confounding variables, some of which were unknown at the time the associations were noticed. An obvious example from Scarbro's list: \"ulcers increased dra\u00ad matically after disasters such as London blitz and the Kobe earth\u00ad quake.\" H. pylori is transmitted by the fecal-oral or oral-oral route and is far more common in crowded, unsanitary conditions such as occur in disaster settings. Since die organism was unknown at the time of these disasters, it didn't occur to anyone to look for it. Headaches are also associated with \"stress,\" and their most common treat\u00ad ments are nonsteroidal anti\u00ad inflammatory drugs (most notably aspirin)\u2014now known to be die odier major cause of peptic ulcers. Cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption are also indepen\u00ad dently correlated with bodi stress and ulcers. 3. Prospective studies that define \"stress\" from the outset and con\u00ad trol for confoundcrs would seem to be the most likely to yield reli\u00ad able data, but these have shown an inconsistent correlation between \"stress\" and PUD. Scarbro mentions one such study in which subjects who scored \"highest on a perceived stress scale were 2.9 times more likely to develop ulcers,\" but a similar study found an odds ratio of 1.7 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.0-3.1\u2014hardly convincing. Neither of these studies con- Uolled foi //. fiylori. Glenn McQuaig was a drug salesman during the \"ulcer wars,\" presumably the 1980s.

Quite frankly, the physicians never stood a chance.\" He con\u00ad cludes dial this pressure delayed acceptance of the H. pylori hypodiesis. My article has already refuted McQuaigs last assertion. Regarding drug salesmen exerting pressure on physicians, this certainly occurs. The question is whether physicians are as vulnerable to such pressure as McQuaig thinks. I argued last year, in my reply to Myra Jones, that \"virtually all doctors recognize drug sales\u00ad men for exactly what they are: salesmen\" (SI, January/February 2004). A recent study agrees: Pharmaceutical drug companies spend upward of $25 billion per year on pro\u00ad moting new drugs and distributing free samples to doctors, but new research shows such marketing devices have little impact on physicians and their prescrib\u00ad ing behavior.... Scientific papers, advice from col\u00ad leagues and a physician's own training and experience also influence prescribing prac\u00ad tices and, he said, most physicians view these sources as far more reliable and trust\u00ad worthy than salespeople. [Gardner 20041 Not that this has anything to do with the original point of the article, which is that die story of H, pylori lends no support to die argument that implausible medical claims deserve to be investigated. Kimball Atwood, M.D. Waban, Massachusetts Reference Gardner. N. 2004. Pharmaceutical marketing tac\u00ad tics hold little sway with prescribing Off the Mark Even letter writers should not be allowed to get away with blatant untruths. In the November/December 2004 issue, George Rowell states: \"One study found that 10,000 Americans were murdered each year by murderers released from prison.\" Since there are about 20,000 murders each year in America, he would have us believe that half arc coiiiiniucd by mur\u00ad derers released from prison, which seems rather extreme. The only official source I could find in a few minutes on the Internet was a report from the Washington State Department of Correc\u00ad tions, which suggested that about 3 per\u00ad cent of murders are committed by persons previously convicted of that crime. Mr. Rowell seems to be off the mark by a fac\u00ad tor far exceeding ten. Barry G. Clark Socorro, New Mexico The letters column is a forum for views on matters raised in previous issues.
