The application and use of this document are the responsibility of the user. IPAC Canada assumes no liability resulting from any such application or use. Background The use of essential oils in various settings is growing , in part due to a move to 'natural' products and increasing marketing of these as substitutes for conventional medicine and vaccines , and as cleaning products. Oils are being applied topically, ingested, and diffused , often without sufficient scientific evidence to support these uses , or considerati on of potential toxic effects .1 While the use of essential oils may have perceived positive effects for an individual, such as a reduction in stress ,2 there is currently insufficient scientific evidence or consensus that they are effective to prevent or treat communicable diseases like influenza , or for use as cleaning products or pesticides /insect repellants , and they should not be promoted as such.3-6 Studies have shown some essential oils to have antiseptic or antiviral properties (e.g. , tea tree oil,7-9 elderberry extract ,10 and natural phenols11), and while there is some promising research to show that essential oils may assist in illness prevention and treatment ,8, 11 inhibit organism growth ,7 or help to eliminate biofilms when used in conjunction with tradition al antimicrobials ,12 the majority of these studies are in vitro7,11, 13. There are no established standard concentrations of essential oils , and currently insufficient evidence exists to recommend their use in healthcare setting s such as hospitals , long -term care homes, and clinical offices (including physiotherapy and massage), residential settings such as retirement homes and group homes, and community settings s uch as schools and daycares. Some natural products may cause harm to individuals, when used as an adjunct to traditional medicine.14 In addition, the scents and ingredients of essential oils and products containing these may cause allergic reactions ,15-17 sensitization or phototoxic effects ,18 and contravene facility \"no scent\" policies. Health Canada has explicit information regarding the use of essential oils, including that these should not be ingested, should not be applied to more than 10% of body surface area, and should not be used topically undiluted .18 Organisms have been found to grow in essential oils and equipment used to diffuse these , and improper storage and /or sharing of equipment between individuals have been associated with outbreaks .19 Position Statement Essential oils are not a substitute for conventional treatment or vaccines. IPAC Canada recommends following national guidelines for immunization , including annual influenza vaccination . Essential oils are not sufficient for cleaning and disinfecting surfaces or reusable items in a healthcare setting . At minimum, e nvironmental surfaces and inanimate items, or noncritical medical devices should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected with a low-level disinfectant that has a drug identification number (DIN) from Health Canada indicating its approv al for use in Canadian healthcare settings20, along with appropriate efficacy and contact time for the intended use , following manufacturer's instructions for use . Diffusers/vaporizers should not be used in healthcare settings. If diffusers/vaporizers are used for/by an individual, they should be completely emptied and thoroughly cleaned and disinfected daily a nd more frequently if necessary, to prevent contamination, biofilm development, and resultant inhalation of any potentia lly pathogenic organisms.21 Glossary/Definitions As per the Canadian Standard Association (CSA) : \"SHALL\" is used to express a requirement, i.e., a provision that the user is obliged to satisfy in order to comply with the standard; \"SHOULD\" is used to express a recommendation or that which is advised but not required; and \"MAY\" is used to express an option or that which is permissible within the limits of the standard, an advisory or optional statement. Healthcare setting (CSA): \" any location where health care is provided, including emergency care, prehospital care, hospitals, long -term care, home care, ambulatory care, and facilities and locations in the community where care is provided (e.g., educational institutions, residential facilities, correc tional facilities, dental offices, and physician's offices). Note: Definitions of health care settings can overlap, as some settings provide a range of care, such as chronic care or ambulatory care provided in acute care, and complex care p rovided in long -term care. \" Clause 1.2 defines healthcare settings as: \"including, but not limited to, all acute care hospitals; trauma centres; emergency care facilities; medical clinics with or without overnight stay or observation; endoscopy centres; laser eye clinics; outpatient surgical services; cosmetic surgical offices; dental general and surgical facilities; other office surgical facilities; general physician offices (with and without treatment spaces); stand -alone laboratory facilities; diagnostic imaging centres ; nursing homes; long -term care facilities; assisted -living facilities; mental health facilities; forensic facilities; reprocessors; educational settings; and private entrepreneurs. \"22 Stakeholders Healthcare an d other workers in acute care facilities, long -term care homes , clinical offices, and communal settings in the community Participants in Development of Position Statement This position statement was developed by IPAC Canada Standards and Guidelines Committee Chair: Madeleine Ashcroft Principal Authors: Madeleine Ashcroft, Katherine Paphitis References 1.
