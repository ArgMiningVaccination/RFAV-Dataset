Homeopathic drugs, says Dr Kishore in his defence, are non-toxic, non-addictive and in fact so safe that they are accepted and preferred for usage by children. How safe is homeopathy? Though a homeopathic drug has been implicated in the death of the eminent demographer and economist, Dr S. N. Agarwala, in New Delhi on December 31, this has been strongly denied by practitioners of homeopathy. However, the suggestion has created a public issue which, despite reassuring statements from the Ministry of Health and Dr Jugal Kishore - one of the country's leading homeopaths and homeopathic adviser to the Government of India - has not ended the debate. The preliminary reports suggest that Dr Agarwala died of a massive coronary attack, and the police have sent his viscera for chemical examination. The final report is still awaited. Dr Jugal Kishore has pointed out in his statement that in the 175-year-long history of homeopathy, no death or adverse reaction has been known to occur due to homeopathic drugs. Homeopathic drugs, says Dr Kishore in his defence, are non-toxic, non-addictive and in fact so safe that they are accepted and preferred for usage by children. But the reassurances by homeopaths have not wiped out the suspicions of leading allopaths who continue to view the homeopathic system dubiously. Typical of their doubts are the misgivings expressed by one doctor at a major government hospital in New Delhi. He was critical about the fact that homeopaths treated symptoms rather than causes. A doctor, he felt, could only give a patient his money's worth by administering all bona fide tests possible: electrocardiograms, biopsies, microscopic examination of blood, tissue samples and others which are likely to yield more objective and reliable measurements of disease parameters. A major bone of contention amongst allopaths about homeopathy is the homeopathic process of microdilution. The minimum dose, the law of similars (creation of anti-bodies in the system by introducing a minimum dose of the toxin or \"disease\" sought to be eradicated which works on the same principle as the vaccine), and the single remedy were the foundations on which the great German chemist and doctor, Hahnemann, established his system of medicine. These are the principles which have been under constant attack. According to Hahnemann, cures could be affected by giving infinitesimally minute doses of the drug to the patient. These astounding \"micro\" doses use one millionth of the usual allopathic strength of l/432,000th of a grain. The technique for preparing the dose or the process of \"dynamization\" is basic to homeopathic procedure and sometimes invokes the ridicule of allopaths. It consists of mixing one part of the drug with 99 parts of milk and sugar (if the drug is in powder form) or 99 parts of alcohol (if the drug comes in the form of a tincture). The dry mixture is then finely ground and the liquid form is methodically shaken. This produces the first 1:100 or centisimal dilution. If one part of this diluted mixture is again mixed with 99 parts of milk and sugar, or alcohol as the case may be, and again ground or shaken, it produces the second centisimal dilution. This process can be continued to produce a dose of virtually any potency though Hahnemann recommended an ultimate dilution of 30 centisimal solutions as the most effective. His belief was that reducing the medicine to a fine powder or shaking it in liquid form released the \"spirit-like medicinal power\" of the medicine. Homeopathic drugs are not only safe, they are also extremely cheap. In India their popularity can, in fact, be quite successfully intensified. India is the only country in the world with not only the largest number of practising homeopaths to boast of but also a Central Council of Homeopathy constituted under an Act of Parliament. There is a government Research Council for Homeopathy, national institute for post-graduate education and treatment in Calcutta and over a 100 government-run homeopathic medical colleges and hospitals. The government has increasingly begun to recognize the importance of the system of medicine and doctors have been posted at about 30 CGHS clinics in the capital. In fact the scales of medical systems tip in favour of homeopathy as a safer system when one considers surveys in the US which show that 18-30 per cent of hospitalized patients experience some adverse reactions with allopathic drugs; that one-seventh of all hospital days are devoted to caring for such toxic reactions; and that the yearly cost to the patients amounts to some three billion dollars. Other surveys have found that 0.5 to 1.5 per cent of hospitalized patients die of drug reactions. There are hardly any such cases in homeopathy. There have not been many cases of sub-standard or adulterated drugs being put on sale. The reason for this is that in homeopathic drugs the profit margin is very low (around 70 per cent), as compared with margins of over 1,000 per cent for some allopathic drugs. There has in fact been only one case of the licence of a Delhi practitioner being revoked. And he was known to be dispensing alcohol disguised as homeopathic medicine. "}
