This phenomenon is known as biophoton emission (BPE). The photons are quanta of electromagnetic energy and their absorption and emission obey the laws of quantum physics. The primary characteristic of BPE is its very low intensity of up to some hundred photons per second. In vitro measurements demonstrate that BPE is correlated with cell metabolism, phagocytosis, neural activity, and oxidative stress. All of these involve intense energetic reactions important to cell functioning. In vivo measurements are therefore suggested to be a global indicator of health or sickness and correlations between BPE and different pathologies including hemiparesis, multiple sclerosis, cancer, and hyperlipidemia have been described. The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 2004 Global Advances in Health and Medicine 2015 Biofield science is an emerging field of study that aims to provide a scientific foundation for understanding the complex homeodynamic regulation of living systems. By furthering our scientific knowledge of the biofield, we arrive at a better understanding of the foundations of biology as well as the phenomena that have been described as \"energy medicine.\" Energy medicine, the application of extremely low-level signals to the body, including energy healer interventions and bio-electromagnetic device-based therapies, is incomprehensible from the dominant biomedical paradigm of \"life as chemistry.\" The biofield or biological field, a complex organizing energy field engaged in the generation, maintenance, and regulation of biological homeodynamics, is a useful concept that provides the rudiments of a scientific foundation for energy medicine and thereby advances the research and practice of it. An overview on the biofield is presented in this paper, with a focus on the history of the c... The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 2012 Global Advances in Health and Medicine 2015 Alternative therapies in health and medicine 2008 The current status of energy medicine and its increasing challenge to the biochemical paradigm that has dominated conventional medicine are reviewed. Although energy medicine represents only a small fraction of 1% of the $2.2 trillion healthcare industry, 6 properties of energy medicine give it strengths that could augment conventional health care models. These include the ways energy medicine (1) can address biological processes at their energetic foundations (reach), (2) regulates biological processes with precision, speed, and flexibility (efficiency), (3) fosters health and prevents illness with interventions that can be readily, economically, and noninvasively applied (practicality), (4) includes methods that can be used on an at-home, self-help basis, fostering a stronger patient-practitioner partnership in the healing process (patient empowerment), (5) adopts non-linear concepts consistent with distant healing, the healing impact of prayer, and the role of intention in healin...
