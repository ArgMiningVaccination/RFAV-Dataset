YouTube has announced a new [vaccine misinformation policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/11161123) that goes beyond its [COVID-19 medical misinformation policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9891785). [YouTube Team. [Managing harmful vaccine content on YouTube](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/managing-harmful-vaccine-content-youtube/). YouTube Blog, Sept 29, 2021] The new policy states: YouTube doesn't allow content that poses a serious risk of egregious harm by spreading medical misinformation about currently administered vaccines that are approved and confirmed to be safe and effective by local health authorities and by the World Health Organization (WHO). This is limited to content that contradicts local health authorities or the WHO's guidance on vaccine safety, efficacy, and ingredients. . . . - - Don't post content on YouTube if it includes harmful misinformation about currently approved and administered vaccines on any of the following: - Vaccine safety: content alleging that vaccines cause chronic side effects, outside of rare side effects that are recognized by health authorities - Efficacy of vaccines: content claiming that vaccines do not reduce transmission or contraction of disease - Ingredients in vaccines: content misrepresenting the substances contained in vaccines The policy statement indicates that first-time violators will likely get a warning with no penalty to their channels. Repeat violators may be issued a strike against their channels while recipients of three strikes within 90 days will have their channels terminated. For years, YouTube has received criticism for allowing misleading, conspiratorial content to thrive on its site. [Jones J. [YouTube is purging all anti-vaccine misinformation.

The Washington Post, Sept 29, 2021] Stem cell treatment harms summarized. Paul Knoepfler, Ph.D., a professor in the Department of Cell Biology and Human Anatomy at UC Davis, has summarized reports about the harms from unproven stem-cell treatments. He notes: \"Many clinics have said over the years to potential customers that 'the worst that can happen is that the stem cells won't work.' We know this isn't true and it's irresponsible.\" [Knoepfler P. [Stem cell therapy side effects: infections, tumors, & more](https://ipscell.com/2021/09/stem-cell-therapy-side-effects-infections-tumors-more/). The Niche, Sept 29, 2021] The reported harms include: (a) complete blindness; (b) infection originating in the injected products or from unsafe injection practices; (c) tumors, lesions, or other growths; (d) paralysis; (e) blood clots in the lungs; (f) organ damage or failure; and (g) unusual immune reactions.

Clinics offering unproven stem-cell treatments have proliferated since 2017 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave clinics a three-year grace period to show that their treatments were safe and effective before there would be a regulatory crackdown. The grace period was extended six months due to the pandemic and ended in May 2021. [Perrone M. [US stem cell clinics boomed while FDA paused crackdown](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-science-health-california-106808694cb797a59db366df54e85692). Associated Press, Sept 30, 2021] Whether the FDA will take effective action remains to be seen. Most websites of French chiropractors offer to treat non-musculoskeletal conditions. French and Danish researchers have examined 287 websites of registered chiropractors in France to tabulate the chiropractors' (a) affiliation to the French Chiropractic Association, (b) educational backgrounds, (c) interest in specific patient populations, and (d) attention to non-musculoskeletal (non-MSK) conditions. [Concalves G. and others. [Chiropractic website claims related to non-musculoskeletal conditions: a cross-sectional study](https://chiromt.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12998-021-00397-y). Chiropractic & Manual Therapies, 29:39, Sept 22, 2021] The websites were randomly selected for each of 13 regions. Key findings included: - One or more non-MSK claims were identified on nearly 8 out of 10 websites. - 42 out of 44 non-MSK diagnoses or symptoms on the researchers' predefined list were mentioned on at least one of the websites. - Non-MSK conditions most often mentioned on the websites were sleep problems among adults (68% of websites), constipation/digestive problems (66%), insomnia/unease/discontent (in children) (59%), and menstrual cramps/pains (43%). - The special interest groups most often mentioned on the websites were children (87% of websites), pregnant women (85%), athletes (85%), seniors (84%), and infants (83%). 75% of the websites mentioned all five of these groups, while 12 websites mentioned animals as chiropractic patients. - 84% of websites claiming a special clinical focus on infants or children but only 40% without that focus were found to advertise treatment for non-MSK disorders. - No difference was observed in region, country of educational background, or years since graduation between those chiropractors who advertised treatment for non-MSK disorders and those who did not. - 84% of members of the French Chiropractic Association were advertising treatment for non-MSK disorders compared with 69% who were not members. Noting that other studies have documented the promotion of non-MSK conditions by chiropractors in the English-speaking world and Denmark, the researchers concluded: Non-MSK conditions are not a predominant reason for patients seeking care, and treatment of non-MSK conditions is not in accordance with the latest scientific consensus as per a recent systematic review which did not find evidence of an effect of [spinal manipulative therapy] on the management of several non-MSK disorders (e.g., childhood asthma, hypertension, primary dysmenorrhea). Mentioning non-MSK conditions on professional chiropractic websites can mislead patients toward non-useful treatments or even delay relevant "}
