Ndiaye, PhD, David P. Hopkins, MD, MPH, Abigail M. Shefer, MD, Alan R. Hinman, MD, MPH, Peter A. Briss, MD, MPH, Lance Rodewald, MD, Bayo Willis, MPH, Task Force on Community PreventiveServices Overview Influenza, pneumococcal infections, and hepatitis B, three vaccine-preventable diseases, cause signif-icant morbidity and mortality in the United States. Rates of morbidity and mortality are higher amongadults with certain medical conditions, occupationalexposures, or risk behaviors. Vaccination coverage ratesin these target populations remain low and belownational health objectives. Using methods previously developed for the Guide to Community Preventive Services for reviews of universally recommended vaccines (those that should be adminis-tered to all people in a given age group), we conductedsystematic reviews to evaluate the evidence on effective-ness of 11 interventions to improve vaccination cover-age in targeted populations (those with risk factors thatmake them particularly susceptible to a disease). Elec-tronic databases and reference lists of retrieved paperswere searched for all relevant citations in the period1980 to August 2000. More than 2450 citations werescreened; of these 35 studies met the quality criteriaand became part of the review. Determinations ofintervention effectiveness were based primarily on mea-surements of change in vaccination coverage rates forinfluenza, pneumococcal polysaccharide, and hepatitisB vaccination. Reviews identied strong evidence of effectiveness of provider reminder systems, when implemented alone,in increasing targeted vaccination coverage. We foundinsufcient evidence, however, to determine the effec-tiveness of all other interventions when implementedalone. Of the 35 qualifying studies, 23 studies evaluated interventions implemented in combination. We foundstrong evidence of effectiveness in increasing targetedvaccination coverage when interventions to enhanceaccess to vaccination services were combined with pro-vider- or system-based interventions and/or interven-tions to increase client or community demand forvaccinations. These reviews form the basis of the recommenda- tions by the Task Force on Community PreventiveServices presented elsewhere in this supplement.

Despitethe availability of effective vaccines, vaccination cover-age rates remain low among adults at high risk forinfection or complications of infection. Indications forvaccination are provided in Table 1 . 1-7 Influenza Each year in the United States, influenza causes an estimated 114,000 excess hospitalizations8and 36,000 deaths.9Morbidity and mortality rates are high among adults aged /H1135065, and among younger people who have medical conditions, such as diabetes or lung or heartdisease, that place them at risk for complications fromthe disease. 10-12In one study, case fatality rates among adults aged 44 to 64 years with two or more riskconditions were estimated at 377/100,000. 13,14In com- parison, case fatality rates for adults /H1135065 without otherFrom the National Immunization Program (Ndiaye, Shefer, Rode- wald, Willis), and Division of Prevention Research and AnalyticMethods, Epidemiology Program Ofce (Hopkins, Briss), Centers forDisease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia; and Task Force forChild Survival and Development (Hinman), Atlanta, Georgia The names and afliations of the Task Force members are listed at the front of this supplement and at www.thecommunityguide.org.

Indications for influenza, pneumococcal polysaccharide, and hepatitis B vaccines1-7 Universal recommendationsaTargeted indicationsb Influenza Adults aged /H1135050 years Medical indications: People with heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, renal dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, immunosuppression, and/or people living in nursing homes and other chronic care facilities. Children aged 6 to 23 months Children and adolescents (aged 6 months to 18 years) who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy and, therefore, might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza infection. Occupational indications: Healthcare workers and those who provide key community services.Other indications: People working or living with at-risk people. Household contacts and out-of-home caregivers of children aged 0 to 23 months. Students and other people in institutional settings. Women who will be pregnantduring the influenza season. Travelers to areas where influenza activity exists or when traveling among peoplefrom areas of the world with current influenza activity. Anyone who wishes to reduce the likelihood ofbecoming ill with influenza. Pneumococcal polysaccharide Adults aged /H1135065 The heptavalentpneumococcal conjugate vaccineis recommended for all childrenaged 2 to 23 months (and forcertain children aged 24 to 59months)Medical indications: People who have chronic illness including cardiac or pulmonary diseases, chronic liver disease, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, or cerebrospinal fluid leaks. People who have other medical risk factorssuch as anatomic or functional asplenia, or sickle cell disease. People who are immunocompromised includingthose with HIV infection, leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, generalized malignancy,chronic renal failure, or nephritic syndrome. People receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy (includingcorticosteroids). Organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Candidates for or recipients of cochlear implants.Pregnant women with high-risk conditions should be vaccinated if not done previously. Other indications: People living in special environments or social settings (including Alaska Natives and certain American Indian populations). Hepatitis B Children and adolescents Medical indications: Hemodialysis patients, patients who receive clotting-factor concentrates. Occupational indications: Healthcare workers and public safety workers who have exposure to blood in the workplace, people training in schools of medicine, dentistry, nursing, laboratory technology, and other alliedhealth professions. Behavioral indications: Injecting drug users, people with more than one sex partner in the previous 6 months, people with recently acquired STDs, all clients in STD clinics, and men who have sex with men. Other indications: Household contacts and sex partners of people with chronic HBV infection, clients and staff of institutions for the developmentally disabled, international travelers who will be in countries with high orintermediate prevalence of chronic HBV infection for /H110226 months, inmates of correctional facilities. aUniversally recommended vaccination means that all people in a given age group should receive the vaccine. bTargeted indications include medical, occupational, behavioral, or other risk factors that increase susceptibility to the disease and identify pe ople who should receive the appropriate vaccine. Am J Prev Med 2005;28(5S) 249risk conditions were estimated at 9/100,000.14,15The number of people aged /H1102165 years with at-risk medical conditions for influenza-related complications was re-cently estimated to be 12 million adults aged 50 to 64,18 million adults aged 18 to 49, and 8 millionchildren. 16 Annual vaccination is recommended for people who are at risk ( Table 1 ), especially during the winter months from October through March. Influenza vacci-nation is effective in preventing hospitalization anddeath in people with high-risk medical conditions. 17 The vaccine is effective in people infected with HIV.18 Among elderly people not in nursing homes, the effectiveness of the vaccine varies between 30% and70% in preventing hospitalization from pneumoniaand influenza. 19-21 Influenza coverage rates among adults aged /H1102165 years with risk conditions remain low, as noted by theInstitute of Medicine in its 2002 report. 22In 2000, vaccination coverage for adults aged 18 to 64 withhigh-risk conditions was 33%, well below the Healthy People 2010 goal of 60%. 23Among high-risk adults aged 50 to 64, coverage rates were only 44%.8 Pneumococcal Disease In the United States, about 3500 people aged /H1134965 die every year as a result of pneumococcal disease.24Pneu- mococcal infections cause an estimated 3000 cases ofmeningitis, 50,000 cases of bacteremia, and 500,000cases of pneumonia annually. 2Risk conditions for invasive pneumococcal disease include chronic illnessand cardiac and pulmonary diseases. 10,11,25In one report, case fatality rates among adults aged 18 to 64with risk conditions was 12.1% compared with a case-fatality rate of 5.4% for adults without risk conditions. 24 Recommendations for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination are provided in Table 1 . Efcacy rates for the current 23-valent vaccine in studies of immunocom-petent adults range from 65% 75% in bacteremia and spite the efcacy of the vaccine, vaccination coverageremains low for younger adults (aged 18 to 64) with riskconditions. National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)data from 2002 indicate that only 19.1% of high-riskadults aged 18 to 64 have ever received the pneumo-coccal polysaccharide vaccine (NHIS, 2002, unpub-lished data). Universal and targeted indications for influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination are similar,and combined or coordinated efforts to improve vacci-nation coverage rates for both are possible. In onestudy, receipt of both vaccines was associated with a72% reduction in hospitalization and an 82% reductionin mortality among people with chronic lung disease. 28Hepatitis B An estimated 1.25 million people in the United States are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV),29 of whom 5000 die of HBV-related cirrhosis or livercancer annually. 30-32Risk conditions for hepatitis B include occupational exposures and risk behaviors suchas injection drug use and multiple sex partners. Al-though reported cases of HBV declined by 76% with 73,000 cases estimated in2003. 32 Indications and recommendations for hepatitis B vaccination are shown in Table 1 . Despite the availabil- ity of an effective vaccine, vaccination coverage ratesremain low in most populations with targeted indica-tions. In one study, for example, only 9% of men whohave sex with men (MSM) had serologic evidence ofhepatitis B vaccination in 1998. 34Among injection drug users attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic inSan Diego from 1998 to 2001, vaccination coveragewith hepatitis B was only 6%. 35HBV infection is also an occupational exposure associated with both routineand emergency care delivered by health, rescue, andlaw enforcement personnel. With the initiation ofroutine vaccination, the annual number of HBV infec-tions among healthcare workers declined dramatically,from 17,000 in 1983 to 400 in 1995. 36 Over the last decade, improvements in adult vaccina- tion coverage have been unevenly distributed. Al-though coverage rates for influenza and pneumococcalpolysaccharide vaccines have steadily improved amongadults aged /H1135065 years, improvements in vaccination coverage in younger adults with risk conditions havebeen less dramatic and coverage rates remain low. 22 Similarly, signicant increases in vaccination coveragefor HBV among healthcare workers have not beenmatched in harder to reach populations that engage inhigh-risk behaviors. To remedy these gaps, communi-ties, healthcare systems, and providers may considerimplementing or adding one or more interventions toimprove vaccination coverage among adults at highrisk. As part of the Guide to Community Preventive Services (The Community Guide ), this report provides a systematic review of the evidence on effectiveness of interventions implemented to increase coverage rates for vaccinesindicated for adult populations (aged 18 to 64 years)with risk conditions, occupational exposures, or riskbehaviors. As a group, we will refer to these as targetedvaccines and to efforts to improve coverage as targetedvaccination interventions. (These same vaccines\u2014influ-enza, pneumococcal polysaccharide, and hepatitisB\u2014are appropriate for use in the general population.The difference between universally recommended andtargeted vaccines is the indicated use, not the vaccines.)Although other vaccines have targeted indications 250 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 28, Number 5S(e.g., the hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for people with chronic liver disease), this review focusedon the evidence on effectiveness of interventions toincrease targeted vaccination coverage for influenza,pneumococcal polysaccharide, and hepatitis B. Thisreport is designed to complement the initial set ofsystematic reviews of interventions to improve vaccina-tion coverage for universally recommended vaccina-tions in children, adolescents, and adults. 37,38 Conceptual Approach We adopted the conceptual approach developed fortheCommunity Guide reviews of evidence on interven- tions to improve vaccination coverage for universallyrecommended vaccines. 37The logic framework shown inFigure 1 provides a concise depiction of the strategy and intervention options for increasing vaccinationcoverage in populations at high risk. The conceptual(strategic) categories for interventions directly relevantto the conduct and conclusions of this review are: Interventions to increase client or community de- mand for vaccines and vaccination services. Theseefforts provide or disseminate information, advice,or both to clients, to increase and improve theirefforts to seek appropriate vaccination.Interventions to enhance access to vaccination ser- vices. These efforts reduce the barriers clients mayencounter in attempting to receive vaccinations. Provider- or system-based interventions. These inter- ventions provide information or deliver timely re-minders or periodic feedback to healthcare provid-ers with the intent of increasing provider counselingabout, and administration of, appropriate vaccina-tions to clients. Methods The general methods for conducting systematic reviewsfor the Community Guide have been described in detail elsewhere. 39The specic methods used to conduct these systematic reviews, and to organize the evidenceon effectiveness into a menu format recommendationfrom the Task Force, are presented elsewhere in thisvolume. 40This section briefly describes pertinent gen- eral and specic methods employed in this systematicreview. A systematic review development team (made up of Community Guide researchers and methodologists, Task Force members, and other subject matter specialists)was recruited to provide oversight and subject matterexpertise. As noted above, the conceptual approach Figure 1. Logic framework depicting the conceptual approach used in these reviews. Adapted from: Briss PA, et al.37 Am J Prev Med 2005;28(5S) 251and the interventions selected for review were adopted from the preceding systematic review of interventionsto increase coverage for universally recommended vac-cines. 37The team searched for published studies in 12 electronic databases and in reference lists from re-trieved papers. Studies were included if (1) they werepublished between 1980 and August 2001 as a journalarticle in English; (2) they evaluated an intervention todeliver influenza, pneumococcal polysaccharide, orhepatitis B vaccinations in a population at risk, orincluded information on risk populations (subsets) aspart of a larger vaccination effort; and (3) outcomemeasurements included changes in vaccinationcoverage. Two reviewers abstracted identied studies, 41and differences in assessment of study design and quality ofexecution were resolved by consensus of the team. Theprimary outcome measures used to evaluate interven-tion effectiveness were changes in vaccination coveragein the at-risk study population (or subset). Resultsincluding a median effect measurement and the rangeare summarized in the text of the review (below) andare displayed graphically where appropriate. Evidence on effectiveness is presented below in two sections. In the rst section, we review the evidence oneffectiveness for each intervention when implementedalone. In the second section, we review the evidence oneffectiveness for interventions when implemented incombination. For our review of multicomponent inter-ventions, we developed additional methods for organiz-ing, evaluating, and displaying the evidence on effec-tiveness. These methods are described in detail in theaccompanying article. 40In short, studies of multicom- ponent interventions were reorganized into combina-tions across categories of vaccination demand anddelivery. Results were summarized and evaluated ac-cording to the evidence on effectiveness within eachcategory combination. Category combinations with ev-idence of effectiveness were then presented in a menuformat identifying effective combinations and specicinterventions within each category. The menu formatprovides a new option for presenting conclusions oneffectiveness regarding evidence from multicomponentstudies. Results Part 1: Reviews of Evidence for Interventions to Increase Targeted Vaccine Coverage WhenImplemented AloneInterventions to Increase Community or ClientDemand for Vaccinations Interventions to increase demand for vaccination ser- vices provide information, advice, or both to individualclients or to at-risk community members. Informationand advice delivered to individuals at risk may increaseor improve their demand for and receipt of vaccina- tions. In this category, we reviewed the following single-component interventions: clinic-based client educa-tion, client reminder systems, community-wideeducation, client or family incentives, and vaccinationrequirements. We found insufcient evidence to deter-mine whether any of these interventions alone in-creases targeted vaccine coverage. Clinic-based client education when implemented alone. Clinic-based education interventions provide information to clients served in specic medical orpublic health clinic settings. Information can helpclients identify their risk status, indications for spe-cic vaccines, and the potential benets of vaccina-tion. Education can also reduce or remove barriersby changing negative attitudes and beliefs aboutvaccination. Education efforts used a variety of for-mats, including letters, newsletters, brochures, andposters. Effectiveness. We identied two studies evaluating the effectiveness of client education when implementedalone. 42,43Details of the two qualifying studies are provided in the Appendix and at www.thecommuni- tyguide.org/vaccine . Both studies evaluated the im- plementation of brochures. One study42evaluated two versions of health information given to health-care providers and observed increases of 2 and 10percentage points, respectively, in the proportionscreened or vaccinated for hepatitis B. The secondstudy evaluated the impact on subsequent receipt ofpneumococcal vaccination of an educational hand-out given to patients at triage. 43Vaccination rates among patients with at-risk medical conditions im-proved by 16.1 percentage points compared withpatients who were not provided the information attriage. Conclusion. According to Community Guide rules, 39avail- able studies provided insufcient evidence to deter-mine the effectiveness of clinic-based client educationwhen implemented alone in increasing targeted vacci-nation coverage in adult populations at high risk.Evidence was insufcient because we found only twostudies, with fair quality of execution, that evaluatedthis intervention when implemented alone. The evi-dence on effectiveness of clinic-based client educationwhen combined with additional interventions is re-viewed below (see Results Part 2). Client reminder systems when implemented alone. Client reminder systems provide information or advice di-rectly to individual clients to inform or encourage themto obtain an appropriate vaccination. Examples ofclient reminders include letters or postcards sent froma provider ofce, healthcare system, or insurance car-rier. Frequently, the content of client reminders over- 252 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 28, Number 5Slaps with client education interventions. In this review, we categorized interventions as client reminders if theintervention (1) identied and notied individual cli-ents at high risk and (2) included an individual recom-mendation about vaccination from the client's health-care provider or system. Effectiveness. We identied one study evaluating the effectiveness of client reminder systems when imple-mented alone. 44Details of the qualifying study are provided in the Appendix and at www.thecommuni- tyguide.org/vaccine . In this study, patients identied at high risk for influenza received a postcard with apersonal message signed by their physician. At follow-up, self-reported vaccination for influenza improved by3.7 percentage points compared with patients who didnot receive a postcard reminder. Conclusion. According to Community Guide rules, 39the evidence was insufcient to determine the effectivenessof client reminder systems when implemented alone inincreasing targeted vaccination coverage of high-riskadults because only one study, with fair quality ofexecution, was identied. The evidence on effective-ness of client reminder systems when combined withadditional interventions is reviewed below (see ResultsPart 2). Community-wide education when implemented alone. Community-wide education interventions provide in-formation to most or all of a target population in ageographic area, sometimes including vaccination pro-viders. Educational messages can be delivered by vari-ous methods (e.g., mail, radio, newspapers, television,or posters). Community-wide education is intended toincrease or improve the availability of informationabout vaccinations and increase knowledge, therebychanging behavior. It can result in increasing vaccina-tion coverage by increasing acceptance and demand forvaccination among clients. 37 Effectiveness. Our search identied no studies of com- munity-wide education when implemented alone. Conclusion. According to Community Guide rules,39evi- dence was insufcient to determine the effectiveness ofcommunity-wide education when implemented alonein increasing targeted vaccination coverage of high-riskadults, because we identied no studies of this inter-vention. In addition, we identied no studies of com-munity-wide education when combined with additionalinterventions. Client or family incentives when implemented alone. Client or family incentives seek to motivate people toaccept vaccinations by providing either rewards orpenalties. These interventions are based on the assump-tion that clients will be motivated to seek vaccinations ifthey receive rewards (e.g., money or discount couponsfor retailers) or to avoid penalties (e.g., being excluded from participating in a program). 45 Effectiveness. We identied one study evaluating the effectiveness of client incentives when implementedalone. 45Details of the qualifying study are provided in the Appendix and at www.thecommunityguide.org/ vaccine . This study evaluated the implementation of monetary incentives ($10.00) to increase hepatitis Bvaccination coverage among recruited injection drugusers and observed an improvement over baseline of 35percentage points. Conclusion. According to Community Guide rules, 39evi- dence was insufcient to determine the effectiveness ofclient incentives when implemented alone in increas-ing targeted vaccination coverage among adults at highrisk because only one study, with fair quality of execu-tion, qualied for this review. In addition, we identiedno studies that evaluated client or family incentiveswhen combined with additional interventions. Vaccination requirements when implemented alone. Vaccination requirements are laws or policies requiringvaccinations, other documentation of immunity, ordocumentation of declining to receive a vaccination asa condition of attendance, participation, or employ-ment. Although some hospitals may have policies re-quiring their staff to be vaccinated against influenza, nostate or federal laws in the United States requirevaccination of high-risk adults with influenza, pneumo-coccal polysaccharide, or hepatitis B vaccines. CurrentOccupational Safety and Health Administration stan-dards mandate that employers offer the hepatitis Bvaccination series, at no cost, to any employee whosework is reasonably anticipated to include exposure toblood or other potentially infectious materials. 46Em- ployees can opt to sign a form declining thevaccination. Effectiveness. Our search identied one study evaluat- ing vaccination requirements for high-risk people, in-cluding healthcare workers and drug users, in theCzech Republic. 47The study did not qualify for our review due to limited quality of execution. Conclusion. According to Community Guide rules,39evi- dence was insufcient to determine the effectiveness ofvaccination requirements alone in increasing vaccina-tion coverage among high-risk adults because the singleidentied study did not qualify for review. Interventions to Enhance Access to Vaccination Services Interventions that enhance access to vaccination ser- vices are designed to reduce the cost or to increase theconvenience of obtaining vaccinations. The two inter-ventions we reviewed were reducing out-of-pocket costs Am J Prev Med 2005;28(5S) 253to the client and expanding access in healthcare set- tings. We found insufcient evidence to determinewhether either intervention, by itself, is effective inincreasing targeted vaccination coverage. Reducing client out-of-pocket costs when implemented alone. Reducing out-of-pocket costs to individuals for vaccines or their administration can be implemented bypaying for the vaccine or its administration, providinginsurance coverage, or reducing co-payments for vacci-nations at the point of services. 37Reducing client out-of-pocket costs can result in increases in vaccinationcoverage either by improving availability of vaccinationsor increasing demand for vaccinations. Effectiveness. Our search identied no studies evaluat- ing the effectiveness of reducing client out-of-pocketcosts when implemented alone. Conclusion. According to Community Guide rules, 39evi- dence was insufcient to determine the effectiveness ofreducing client out-of-pocket costs alone in increasingtargeted vaccination coverage of high-risk adults be-cause no studies were identied in this review. Theevidence on reducing client out-of-pocket costs whencombined with additional interventions is reviewedbelow (see Results Part 2). Expanding access in health care settings when imple- mented alone. Expanding access increases the avail- ability of vaccines in medical or public health clinicsettings in which vaccinations are offered by (1) reduc-ing the distance from the setting to the population;(2) increasing or changing hours during which vacci-nation services are provided; (3) delivering vaccina-tions in clinical settings where they were previously notprovided (e.g., emergency departments, inpatientunits, or subspecialty clinics); or (4) reducing adminis-trative barriers to obtaining vaccination services withinclinics (e.g., developing a \"drop-in\" clinic or an \"ex-press lane\" vaccination service). 37 Inconvenient hours and locations, as well as burden- some administrative requirements, are important bar-riers to obtaining vaccinations. These barriers are par-ticularly signicant among patients who do not haveregular clinic visits, have transportation problems, orhave difculties making clinical appointments duringthe months when the vaccine is available. Effectiveness. We found no studies evaluating the effec- tiveness of expanding access in healthcare settingswhen implemented alone. Conclusion. According to Community Guide rules, 39evi- dence was insufcient to determine the effectiveness ofexpanding access in healthcare settings when imple-mented alone in increasing targeted vaccination cover-age of high-risk adults because we identied no studiesin this review. The evidence on expanded access inhealthcare settings when combined with additional interventions is reviewed below (see Results Part 2). Provider- or System-Based Interventions Provider- or system-based interventions are imple-mented primarily through healthcare systems with thegoal of reducing missed opportunities for vaccination.We reviewed provider reminder systems, provider edu-cation, provider assessment and feedback, and standingorders. Provider reminder systems when implemented alone. Provider reminder interventions inform vaccine providers that individual clients are due for specicvaccinations. Techniques by which reminders are deliv-ered vary, and include the use of notations in clients'charts, attached chart prompts or stickers, or standard-ized checklists generated by the clinical staff or drawnfrom computer databases and registries. Reminders canbe directed at the primary healthcare provider or toone or more members of the clinic staff. Provider reminder systems make information about the client's immunization status available to providerseither manually or through a computerized system. Allthe reminder systems described in the studies identiedin this review delivered information to the provider atthe time of the scheduled appointment. Effectiveness. Our search identied seven studies of the effectiveness of provider reminder systems in increasingtargeted vaccination coverage. 48-54These studies focused on influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines.Details of the seven qualifying studies are provided in theAppendix and at www.thecommunityguide.org/vaccine. The provider reminder systems evaluated in the qualify-ing studies included attachments to the patient chartgenerated by computer programs 48,49,51,52or by clinic staff.50,53One study evaluated a reminder questionnaire designed as a letter from a colleague.51Two studies reported measurements of changes in influenza vaccinecoverage. 49,50One study reported measurements of changes in pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine cover-age. 53Four studies provided measurements of changes in coverage for both influenza and pneumococcal polysac-charide vaccinations. 48,51,52,54Figure 2 shows the results of studies reporting changes in vaccination coverage. Thenine study arms in the seven qualifying studies showed amedian improvement in vaccination coverage of 17.9percentage points (range, /H110021 to 72). Overall, the data provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of providerreminder systems when implemented alone. Applicability. The seven qualifying studies evaluated the effectiveness of provider reminder systems on residentand faculty physicians 48,49,51-53and on nurses.50,52The client populations in the qualifying studies were patientswith chronic illnesses. All studies were implemented andevaluated in academic healthcare settings, including hos- 254 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 28, Number 5Spitals and clinics. None of the studies identied in this review evaluated outcomes of hepatitis B vaccinationcoverage in high-risk populations or settings. Other positive or negative effects. Three studies evaluated provider reminder systems that included prompts for thedelivery of additional preventive services or clinical carepractices, including fecal occult blood exam, Pap smear,mammography, dental exam, tetanus vaccine, cancerscreening, or measurements of serum cholesterol. 48,50,52 No harms of provider reminder systems were reported inthe identied studies. Economic efciency. No studies were identied that met the requirements for inclusion in a Community Guide review. 55,56 Barriers to intervention implementation. Potential barriers to the implementation of provider reminder systemsinclude concerns among some providers about the ef-cacy 52,53and safety51of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination. Clients may also refuse to be vaccinated.49,51 Cost is another potential burden in implementing re-minder systems. 49 Conclusion. According to Community Guide rules,39strong evidence shows that provider reminder systems, whenused alone, are effective in improving targeted vaccina-tion coverage among high-risk adults. The evidence onprovider reminders when combined with additional inter-ventions is reviewed below (see Results Part 2). Provider education when implemented alone. Provider education involves giving providers information aboutvaccinations to increase their knowledge or changetheir attitudes. Receipt of such information mightresult in fewer missed vaccination opportunities, and,consequently, a greater proportion of eligible patientsreceiving indicated vaccinations. Techniques by whichinformation is delivered can include written materials,videos, lectures, continuing medical education pro-grams, or computerized software.Effectiveness. Our review identied no studies of pro- vider education interventions when implementedalone. Conclusion. According to Community Guide rules, 39evi- dence was insufcient to determine the effectiveness ofprovider education when implemented alone in in-creasing targeted vaccination coverage of high-riskadults because no studies were identied in this review.The evidence on provider education when combinedwith additional interventions is reviewed below (seeResults Part 2). Standing orders when implemented alone. Require- ments for physical examinations prior to vaccination andlack of personnel to administer vaccines are two administra-tive barriers that may contribute to missed opportunities tovaccinate. Standing orders authorize healthcare personnel(e.g., nurses or pharmacists) to prescribe or deliver vaccina-tions to clients by protocol without direct physician involve-ment at the time of the interaction. Empowering nonphysi-cian personnel to deliver vaccinations might reduce barriersto vaccination and missed opportunities, resulting in im-proved vaccination delivery. 37 Effectiveness. Our search identied no studies providing measurements of the effectiveness of standing orderswhen implemented alone. Conclusion. According to Community Guide rules, 39evi- dence was insufcient to determine the effectiveness ofstanding orders when implemented alone in increasingtargeted vaccination coverage of high-risk adults be-cause no studies were identied in this review. Theevidence on standing orders when combined withadditional interventions is reviewed below (see ResultsPart 2). Provider assessment and feedback when implemented alone. Provider assessment and feedback involve both retrospective evaluation of provider performance indelivering one or more vaccinations to client popula-tions and giving this information to providers. Assess-ment and feedback can result in improvements invaccination coverage either by changing providerknowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, or by stimulatinguse of additional changes in the vaccination deliverysystem (e.g., reminders or standing orders). 37 Effectiveness. We identied one study that evaluated the effectiveness of provider assessment and feedback whenimplemented alone. 57Details of this qualifying study are provided in the Appendix and at www.thecommu- nityguide.org/vaccine. The study examined the impactof annual chart reviews and feedback to resident phy-sicians on coverage for influenza and pneumococcalpolysaccharide vaccines and found that vaccinationcoverage among at-risk patients improved by 32 per-centage points for influenza vaccine and 18 percentagepoints for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.Figure 2. Percentage point change in vaccination coverage attributable to provider reminders when implemented alone,from the studies included in this review. Number in paren-theses is baseline coverage. Am J Prev Med 2005;28(5S) 255Conclusion. According to Community Guide rules,39evi- dence was insufcient to determine the effectiveness ofprovider assessment and feedback interventions whenimplemented alone in increasing targeted vaccinationcoverage among high-risk patients because only onestudy, with fair quality of execution, qualied for re-view. The evidence on effectiveness of provider assess-ment and feedback when combined with additionalinterventions is reviewed below (see Results Part 2). Results Part 2. Reviews of Evidence for Interventions to Increase Vaccine Coverage When Implemented inCombination Most of the available evidence on effectiveness identi- ed in this review of interventions to increase targetedvaccines coverage comes from studies that evaluatedinterventions implemented in combination (multicom-ponent interventions). The paucity of evidence on theeffectiveness of interventions when implemented alone(see Results Part 1) and the variety of interventioncombinations evaluated complicate assessment of theeffectiveness of this multicomponent body of evidence.A full description of the methods used in the following evaluation of effectiveness, and in constructing a menuformat as part of the Task Force recommendation, isprovided elsewhere in this supplement, 40and a brief description is included at the end of the Methodssection of this article. Effectiveness Our systematic review identied a total of 47 studiesevaluating interventions to increase vaccination cover-age among at-risk populations when implementedin combination (multicomponent). 44,47,48,58-101Two papers provided additional information on studies al- ready included in the review.102,103Twenty-four studies were excluded due to limited quality of execu-tion 60,63,66,74,77,81,82,88,89,96or least suitable study de- sign.47,64,67,69-72,79,86,91,92,94,99,100Details of the 23 qualifying studies44,48,58,59,61,62,65,68,73,75,76,78, 80,83-85,87, 90,93,95,97,98,101 are provided in the Appendix a n da tw w w . thecommunityguide.org/vaccine.

Sevenstudy arms in seven studies 48,58,62,73,83,97,101evaluated one of three specic intervention combinations: twostudies evaluated a combination of client remindersand provider reminders 48,97; two studies implemented a combination of client education, client reminders,and expanded access in a healthcare setting 58,62; and three studies implemented a combination of clienteducation, client reminders, expanded access, and re-duced client out-of-pocket costs. 73,83,101The remaining 19 study arms evaluated unique combinations ofinterventions. We conducted additional analyses to examine the combinations of interventions described in the qualify-ing studies. We consolidated individual interventionsinto categories of vaccination delivery (e.g., interven-tions to increase client demand) and performed strat- ied analyses on these categories. In Table 3 , categories subsume the specic interventions, and the qualifyingstudies are reorganized into similar combinationsacross categories. Of the qualifying studies, 21 of 23 (24of 26 study arms) evaluated the effectiveness of inter-ventions combined across two or three conceptualcategories. Figure 3 presents the results from the 26 multicom- ponent study arms organized into combinationswithin a category (two categories: increasing commu-nity or client demand; provider- or system-basedinterventions) or across categories (four combina-tions: increased community or client demand plusprovider- or system-based interventions; increaseddemand plus interventions plus enhanced access; increasedTable 3.

Only two qualifying studies evaluated interventions combined within a single conceptual category.44,76One study44evaluated the combination of client education and client reminders to increase client demand forinfluenza vaccination. At follow-up, vaccination cover-age had improved by 13.6 percentage points. Thesecond study 76evaluated two provider- or system-based interventions: provider education and provider assess-ment and feedback. At follow-up, influenza vaccinationcoverage had improved by 11 percentage points. An intervention to increase client demand was com- bined with one or two provider- or system-based inter-ventions in ve studies. 48,59,65,97,98These ve studies provided seven measurements of changes in vaccina-tion. The median change in vaccination coverage re-ported in these studies was an increase of 3.7 percent- age points (range, /H110022t o/H1100128.9 percentage points). Nine studies evaluated one or two interventions to increase client demand when combined with one ortwo interventions to enhance access to vaccinationservices, 58,61,62,73,83,90,93,95,101providing nine measure- ments of changes in vaccination coverage. The medianchange was an improvement of 14 percentage points(range, 3.1 to 46 percentage points). Three studies evaluated one or two provider- or system-based interventions when combined with one ortwo interventions to enhance access to vaccinationservices. 68,80,87Two studies observed improvements in vaccination coverage of 31 and 27.8 percentagepoints. 68,80The remaining study observed a minimal change in coverage ( /H110020.5 percentage points) for the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.87 Finally, four studies evaluated combinations of inter- ventions to increase vaccination coverage drawn fromall three categories. 75,78,84,85These four studies pro- vided six measurements of changes in vaccinationcoverage. The median change was an improvement of22.8 percentage points (range, /H110025.9 to/H1100167). The effectiveness of combinations that included one or more interventions to enhance access to vaccinationservices with one or more interventions from one orboth of the other two categories was evaluated in a totalof 19 study arms from 16 qualifying stud-ies. 58,61,62,68,73,75,78,80,83-85,87,90,93,95,101Within this sub- set of combined interventions, vaccination coverageimproved by a median of 16.5 percentage points(range, /H110025.9 to /H1100167). Overall, we found strong evi- dence of the effectiveness of the combination of inter-ventions shown in Table 4 in increasing targeted vac- cine coverage. Applicability These ndings should be applicable to a range ofclients, providers, and healthcare settings. Studies ex-amined client populations including outpatients, 58,83 inpatients,78,80,87and healthcare workers.73,95,101The evaluated provider populations included nurses84,85,101Figure 3.

Positive ornegative effects of single-component interventions mayremain relevant when the interventions are imple-mented in combination. Economic Efciency No studies were found that met the requirements forinclusion in a Community Guide review. 55,56 Barriers to Intervention Implementation Barriers to the implementation of single-component interventions are likely to remain relevant to combinedefforts. Additional barriers, such as lack of infrastruc-ture, may be encountered in efforts to coordinate theseinterventions. Conclusions According to Community Guide rules,39the available qualifying studies provide evidence that interven-tions combined across categories are effective inincreasing vaccination coverage in adult populationsat high risk. We found strong evidence of effective-ness in studies evaluating interventions to enhanceaccess to vaccination services (expanding access inhealthcare settings, reducing client out-of-pocketcosts) combined with provider- or system-based inter-ventions (provider reminders, provider assessmentand feedback, standing orders) and/or interventionsto increase client demand for vaccination services(client education, client reminders) ( Table 4 ). Available studies provided insufcient evidence to determine the effectiveness of combinations that didnot include one or more interventions to enhanceaccess to vaccination services (specically, combina-tions across the two categories of interventions toincrease client demand and provider- or system-based interventions). Evidence was considered insuf-cient because the small number of qualifying stud-ies reported inconsistent effects on vaccinationcoverage in populations at high risk. The available studies also provided insufcient evi- dence to determine the effectiveness of either clientincentives or community-wide education as options forinterventions to increase demand for vaccination. Evi-dence was considered insufcient because of the smallnumber of qualifying studies. These single-component interventions, therefore, do not appear among thechoices in the menu format (see Table 4 ). Finally, the available studies provided insufcient evidence to determine the effectiveness of providereducation as an option for combinations of provider- orsystem-based interventions. Evidence was consideredinsufcient because the small number of qualifyingstudies reported results that were inconsistent andsmall in magnitude when compared with other inter-vention combinations. Results Part 3. Research Issues Effectiveness The qualifying studies identied in this review provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of provider re-minder systems when implemented alone in improvingtargeted vaccination coverage among adults at highrisk. Strong evidence of effectiveness was also identiedin multicomponent programs directed at clients andproviders, when these programs included one or moreinterventions to enhance access to vaccination com-bined with one or more interventions to increasedemand, one or more provider- or system-based inter-ventions, or both. However, signicant gaps remain inour evaluation of intervention effectiveness. Further consideration and research into the effec- tiveness of single-component interventions should ad-dress the questions of whether these interventions(other than provider reminder systems, for which ef-fectiveness was established) are consistently effective inimproving targeted vaccine coverage. The conclusions about effectiveness of interventions when implemented in combination represent an initial effort to evaluate a complicated body of evidence.Although this summary conrms one aspect of theevidence on effectiveness (interventions combinedacross conceptual approaches to vaccination delivery),important research questions remain about the effec-tiveness of specic intervention combinations. Are combinations of interventions to increase client and community demand for vaccination effective? Are combinations of provider- or system-based interven- tions to increase targeted vaccination coverageeffective? Are combinations of interventions to enhance access to vaccination services effective? Are interventions combined across strategic categories of vaccination effective because they are synergistic? What specic combinations of interventions are most effective in improving targeted vaccination coverage?Do effective combinations differ by target populationor setting? Do effective combinations differ byvaccine? Am J Prev Med 2005;28(5S) 259Designated staff empowered by standing orders were used in three of the qualifying studies68,78,80to direct vaccination efforts for healthcare workers or hospitalinpatients. The available evidence suggests that desig-nated staff may be an effective intervention in these andother settings (e.g., long-term care facilities). Addi-tional research would expand the body of evidence oneffectiveness. Eight study arms from seven studies evaluated the effectiveness of the same intervention(s) (ve single-component arms and three combination arms) in improv-ing coverage rates for both influenza and pneumococcalpolysaccharide vaccines. 48,51,52,54,57,85,97With similar indi- cations and populations at risk, these vaccines offer thepotential for coordinated, targeted efforts within a com-munity or healthcare system. Although the evidence isalready sufcient to conclude on the effectiveness ofprovider reminder systems, research questions remainabout the effectiveness of other interventions or combi-nations of interventions in improving vaccination cover-age for both vaccines in the same population. Applicability Overwhelmingly, the evidence identied in this reviewis derived from interventions implemented and evalu-ated in healthcare systems. The evidence on effective-ness should be applicable in most healthcare settingsand adult patient populations. A number of importantresearch questions about specic high-risk populationsand settings should still be addressed. Can these intervention combinations be imple- mented as effectively in smaller healthcare settings,such as clinics and private practices? What interventions and combinations of interven- tions are effective in increasing hepatitis B coverageamong people at high risk because of behaviors (e.g.,injection drug users, multiple sex partners)? This re-view identied only two qualifying studies of interven-tions directed at populations with risk behaviors 45,90 that provided insufcient evidence to determine theeffectiveness of interventions or intervention combina-tions in improving hepatitis B vaccination coverage inthese populations. Evaluations of the effectiveness ofexpanded access in non-healthcare settings, reducedclient out-of-pocket costs, standing orders (designatedvaccination staff), client education, and client incen-tives are areas for further research. Are interventions to increase hepatitis B vaccination coverage among healthcare workers equally effective inother populations who are at risk of hepatitis B infec-tion? Evidence from studies conducted in healthcaresettings may not translate to the community-basedrequirements of a vaccination effort directed at peoplewith risk behaviors. Challenges, including low percep-tions of risk, limited access to health care, and pooradherence to follow-up, may be signicant.Other Positive or Negative Effects The studies identied in this review provided littleinformation about other positive or negative effects oftargeted vaccination efforts. No signicant researchissues were identied. Economic Efciency We did not identify any studies providing economicinformation or evaluations of targeted vaccination in-terventions. Basic economic research needs to be con-ducted to investigate the following questions: What is the cost of implementing a single-component intervention? What is the cost of implementing multicomponent interventions? Are multicomponent interventions more cost-effective than single-component interventions? What are the costs per additional person vaccinated, in single- or multi-component interventions? What is the cost-benet or cost-utility of these interventions? Barriers to Implementation Several studies identied in this review discussed barri-ers to vaccination. These included refusals to be vacci-nated 78as well as fear of side effects73and needles.95 Although these represent obstacles to the vaccinationof individual clients, and are not specic to interven-tions, vaccination coverage rates may respond to effortsthat address client concerns. Are client education efforts effective in increasing client requests for vaccination (or reducing clientrefusals to be vaccinated)? Barriers specic to the implementation of interventions include the administrative burdens and infrastruc-ture requirements of targeted vaccination efforts. Doregistries facilitate the adoption of interventions andintervention combinations focused on high-risk adultpopulations? What impact would providing insurance coverage have on the administration and receipt of hepatitis Bvaccine among people with risk behaviors? How frequent are missed opportunities to administer each of these vaccines, and what factors contribute tothese missed opportunities? Discussion This report introduces a new qualitative technique forthe organization and assessment of evidence on effec-tiveness of interventions. These methods provide auseful framework for evaluating a complicated body ofevidence, and attempt to incorporate evidence oneffectiveness both for specic interventions and for less 260 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 28, Number 5Sspecic combinations across conceptual categories (strategies). The qualitative techniques developed andimplemented here are potentially adaptable to othersystematic reviews conducted for the Guide to Community Preventive Services . The information and conclusions about targeted vaccine strategies complement and expand the initialCommunity Guide review of interventions to increase vaccine coverage for universally recommended vac-cines. 37,38Taken together, the initial and current re- ports provide an increasingly complete assessment ofintervention options available to programs and plan-ners seeking to improve vaccination coverage rates incommunities and healthcare systems. In 2000, concerned about the low influenza vaccina- tion rates among people aged 50 to 64 with riskconditions, the Advisory Committee on ImmunizationPractices expanded their universal recommendationfor annual influenza vaccination to include all adults inthis age group. 104Program planners dedicated to in- creasing influenza vaccination coverage within this\"new\" population should consider recommendationsfrom either or both applicable Task Force reviews. Forinitial efforts, program planners may nd that therecommendations in the original, universal review 37,38 provide a number of effective and flexible interventionoptions. Planners attempting to enhance initial pro-gram efforts may nd the information on interventioncombinations recommended in this targeted reviewhelpful. Several limitations should be noted about the con- clusions of this review. (1) The available evidence on effectiveness was not stratied by targeted vaccine or by targeted indica-tions (e.g., medical, occupational, behavioral, other).As noted below, few studies evaluated the effective-ness of interventions to increase targeted hepatitis Bvaccine coverage, especially among people with high-risk behaviors. In our review, we opted to organizethe available information according to the interven-tion or combinations of interventions implementedand evaluated. Within this format, further stratica-tion by vaccine or by targeted indication resulted ininsufcient evidence to support more specic con-clusions on effectiveness. We recognize the value ofthese stratied evaluations, however, and expect thatadditional studies will enable future reviews to illu-minate any differences. (2) The conceptual categories adopted for this review consolidate the evidence on effectiveness (or ineffec-tiveness) of the specic interventions within thatcategory. This method for organizing the evidenceobscures some information about the contribution ofany specic intervention to a combined effort. (3) The category-based conclusions on effectiveness support a signicantly greater number of specicintervention combinations than were demonstrated in the qualifying studies. Signicant gaps in the available evidence on effec- tiveness remain, and provide an important agenda forfurther research. One critical gap is the paucity ofeconomic evaluations of population-based interven-tions to improve vaccination coverage. We did notidentify any economic evaluations of the targeted vac-cination interventions in this review. In contrast to the evidence on effectiveness of uni- versally recommended vaccines, the published evi-dence about efforts to increase targeted vaccine cover-age includes few studies of interventions whenimplemented alone. The available studies of interven-tions combined across conceptual categories broadlysupport the current conclusions, but provide limitedinformation to compare and contrast potential combi-nations of interventions. The evidence on effectiveness identied in this re- view is divided among three vaccines, a number oftargeted populations with different indications for vac-cination, and a variety of community and healthcaresettings. The evidence is limited for many of thesecombinations (vaccine /H11001target group /H11001setting) when considered individually. Nevertheless, the review con-clusions presented here should be considered asbroadly applicable, except as noted below. Much of theevidence identied in this review evaluated interven-tion efforts implemented within a healthcare system,either to improve coverage among healthcare workersor among patients with medical indications. The resultssummarized in this review suggest that vaccinationcoverage can be improved in both populations with theapplication of provider reminder systems alone or withthe appropriate combination of interventions. For ex-ample, combinations of interventions were effective inincreasing coverage for influenza among healthcareworkers, and similar combinations of interventionswere also effective in increasing coverage for influenzaor pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines among pa-tients with medical indications. Differences in the vac-cines, in the target groups (such as baseline knowledgeand motivations to be vaccinated), and in the settings(hospitals, outpatient clinics, and practictioners' of-ces) remain important factors that may require tailor-ing of the content and conduct of the interventionsselected to address specic gaps in vaccinationcoverage. Few studies identied in this review evaluated the effectiveness of interventions to increase coverage forhepatitis B vaccine, and most of these studies evaluatedinterventions to increase coverage rates among health-care workers. Signicant gaps remain in the evidenceon the implementation, evaluation, and effectiveness ofcommunity-based efforts to increase coverage amongpeople at high risk for hepatitis B infection. A number Am J Prev Med 2005;28(5S) 261of community-based hepatitis B vaccination programs are currently under way, and may provide additionalevidence on the effectiveness of this approach. 105 The evidence reviewed here, along with the accom- panying evidence-based recommendations from theTask Force on Community Preventive Services, 106pro- vide a point-in-time assessment of effectiveness of inter-ventions and strategies to improve targeted vaccinescoverage rates in at-risk populations. These reportsprovide evidence to help decision makers and programplanners select and implement interventions to reducemorbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventablediseases.
