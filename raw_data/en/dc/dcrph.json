Traditional Medicine in the Americas Antroposophic Medicine Definitions from the main international associations International Coordination of Anthroposophic Medicine - Medical Section at the Goetheanum https://medsektion-goetheanum.org/en/anthroposophic-medicine/ Anthroposophic Medicine is an integrative medicine. It is rooted in the science-based medicine of the present but takes into account the whole human being in its method, diagnosis, and therapy. It pays equal attention to the body, soul, and spirit of the patient, recognizing the person's unique biography. Anthroposophic Medicine was established by Dr. Phil. Rudolf Steiner and Dr. med. Ita Wegman in 1920. Since then it has been continuously developed further in hospitals and by independent doctors. It is now practiced in over 60 countries. The therapeutic system is a multi-professional one, with shared concepts for diagnosis and therapy. IVAA - International Federation of Anthroposophic Medical Associations https://www.ivaa.info/ Anthroposophic medicine is an integrative system that improves health outcomes through a holistic approach to treatment that includes physical, psychological and social health. Anthroposophic medicine is an integrative approach to treatment that extends and enhances health outcomes by looking outside of isolated symptoms towards a more holistic conception of health. This conception includes physical, psychological and spiritual health, as well as the impact of a person's environment and social context. Anthroposophic medicine focuses on how to keep people healthy rather than on why they fall ill; this is called the \"salutogenic\" approach. The anthroposophic medical approach is designed to complement conventional medicine. Anthroposophic medical doctors are qualified physicians who have received additional training to integrate anthroposophic medicine into their conventional practices. CIMA - Coordinaci\u00f3n Iberoamericana para la Medicina Antroposofica http://medicinaantroposofica.org/ Anthroposophic medicine is a system that integrates conventional medicine with the anthroposophical perception of the human being. Conventional diagnosis includes both the body imbalances and the psychological, mental and spiritual dimensions of the patient. It employs a holistic approach to health and offers specific therapies expanded according to anthroposophic principles. It uses conventional medicinal products as well as anthroposophic products. Both the approach to treatment and the use and selection of medicinal products and other therapies are highly personalized, and try to induce a process of development in the patient, reinforcing their natural capacity for self-healing. ABMA - Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Medicina Antropos\u00f3fica http://abmanacional.com.br Anthroposophic Medicine consists of an integrative and complementary therapeutic medical system that expands academic medicine with the knowledge of Anthroposophy. It is currently practiced in more than 60 countries both in outpatient clinics, individual doctor's offices and in small, medium and large hospitals. It is officially present in the health system of some countries and is contemplated in academic chairs and in the research of some universities. One of its main characteristics is the patient-centered approach based on a health concept that takes in consideration the individuality and considers that the emotional, mental and spiritual dimensions are as relevant as the body dimension in the processes of illness. Special emphasis is put on the search for patient involvement directly and actively in their process of prevention, treatment, and recovery of well-being through educational activities and self-education for care. In Brazil and in the world, physicians who include Anthroposophic Medicine in their clinical practice may be generalists or specialists. Acting in an interdisciplinary way with other areas of health and therapies extended by Anthroposophy, the patient's approach can be carried out jointly by professionals who perform Dentistry Expanded by Anthroposophy, Anthroposophical Psychology, Therapeutic Eurythmy, Rhythmic Massage, Anthroposophical Artistic Therapy, Biographical Counseling, among others.

Thai Traditional Medicine Nuad Thai Unani Medicine Manual Therapeutic Methods Naturopathy Osteopathy According to WHO Osteopathy (also called osteopathic medicine) relies on manual contact for diagnosis and treatment. It respects the relationship of body, mind, and spirit in health and disease; it lays emphasis on the structural and functional integrity of the body and the body's intrinsic tendency for self-healing. Osteopathic practitioners use a wide variety of therapeutic manual techniques to improve physiological function and/or support homeostasis that has been altered by somatic (body framework) dysfunction, i.e. impaired or altered function of related components of the somatic system; skeletal, arthrodial International Alliance- OIA All osteopathy and osteopathic medicine incorporate current medical and scientific knowledge in applying osteopathic principles to patient care. Scientific review and evidence-informed outcomes have a high priority in patient's treatment and case management. Osteopathic care also incorporates a broad range of approaches to the maintenance of health and the management of the disease. It embraces the concept of the unity of the individual's structure (anatomy) and function (physiology); recognizes that each patient's clinical signs and symptoms are the consequences of the interaction of multiple physical and non-physical factors; and emphasizes the importance of the patient-practitioner relationship in the therapeutic process. Osteopathy and osteopathic medicine are person-centered approaches (rather than disease-centered) to healthcare. The Osteopathic International Alliance was admitted into official relations with the World Health Organization (WHO) as a non-governmental organization in February 2018. Since our establishment in 2003, we have maintained an active program of work with WHO, including the Benchmarks for Training in Osteopathy, supporting WHO policies and programs, advising on matters relative to the osteopathic profession, and attendance at annual and other meetings.To see more: [https://oialliance.org/about-us/osteopathic-medicine-and-osteopathy/](https://oialliance.org/about-us/osteopathic-medicine-and-osteopathy/)American Osteopathic Association- AOA Osteopathic medicine is a distinct branch of medicine in the U.S., osteopathic medicine emphasizes the interrelated unity of all systems in the body, each working with the other to heal in times of illness Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine, or DOs, are fully licensed physicians who practice their unique whole-person approach in every medical specialty. DOs look beyond your symptoms to understand how lifestyle and environmental factors impact your wellbeing. DOs practice medicine according to the latest science and technology, but also consider options to complement pharmaceuticals and surgery. They complete additional training in Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment, a hands-on tool used to help diagnose, treat and prevent injury and illness. Osteopathic medicine is one of the fastest-growing healthcare professions in the country, with one out of every four medical students enrolled in an osteopathic medical school. Over the past decade, the profession has experienced a 68% increase in the total number of DOs. If this trend continues, DOs are projected to represent more than 20% of all practicing physicians by the year 2030.To see more: [https://osteopathic.org/what-is-osteopathic-medicine/](https://osteopathic.org/what-is-osteopathic-medicine/)Institute of Osteopathy- IO Osteopathy is a gentle and effective hands-on approach to healthcare, based on the principle that the way your body moves influences how it functions. Osteopaths are highly competent healthcare professionals, recognized by the NHS National Health Service in the United Kingdom as fully qualified to diagnose and treat independently. Osteopathic practice is a safe and effective form of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for a wide range of health issues. Osteopaths are highly trained healthcare professionals who are experts in the musculoskeletal system (joints, muscles and associated tissues) and its relationship to other systems of the body, to keep you as healthy as you can be.

Chiropractors commonly use such procedures to influence joint and neurophysiological function. Biomechanics The study of structural, functional and mechanical aspects of human motion. It is concerned mainly with external forces of either a static or dynamic nature, dealing with human movement. Chiropractic A health care profession concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disorders of the neuromusculoskeletal system and the effects of these disorders on general health. There is an emphasis on manual techniques, including joint adjustment and/or manipulation, with a particular focus on subluxations. Fixation The state whereby an articulation has become fully or partially immobilized in a certain position, restricting physiological movement. Joint manipulation A manual procedure involving directed thrust to move a joint past the physiological range of motion, without exceeding the anatomical limit. Joint mobilization A manual procedure without thrust, during which a joint normally remains within its physiological range of motion. Neuromusculoskeletal Pertaining to the musculoskeletal and nervous systems in relation to disorders that manifest themselves in both the musculoskeletal and nervous systems, including disorders of a biomechanical or functional nature. Palpation (1) The act of feeling with the hands. (2) The application of variable manual pressure through the surface of the body for the purpose of determining the shape, size, consistency, position, inherent motility and health of the tissues beneath. Posture (1) The attitude of the body. (2) The relative arrangement of the parts of the body. Good posture is that state of muscular and skeletal balance that protects the supporting structures of the body against injury or progressive deformity irrespective of the attitude (erect, lying, squatting, stooping) in which the structures are working or resting. Spinal manipulative therapy Includes all procedures where the hands or mechanical devices are used to mobilize, adjust, manipulate, apply traction, massage, stimulate or otherwise influence the spine and paraspinal tissues with the aim of influencing the patient's health. Subluxation A lesion or dysfunction in a joint or motion segment in which alignment, movement integrity and/or physiological function are altered, although contact between joint surfaces remains intact. It is essentially a functional entity, which may influence biomechanical and neural integrity. Subluxation complex (vertebral)A theoretical model and description of the motion segment dysfunction, which incorporates the interaction of pathological changes in nerve, muscle, ligamentous, vascular and connective tissue. Thrust The sudden manual application of a controlled directional force upon a suitable part of the patient, the delivery of which effects an adjustment.
