At this time, there is insufficient high quality evidence to demonstrate the clinical and cost effectiveness of CAM (group 1b, 2 and 3 above) due to the methodological difficulties in studies of CAM therapies and placebo effects. The list of CAM therapies reviewed by the Cochrane Collaboration and NICE stated in Appendix 1 is not exhaustive. There is a lack of evidence for CAM therapies not yet reviewed by these organisations such as crystal therapy and faith healing, this policy applies to all CAM therapies and not just those stated in Appendix 1. CAM therapies are therefore low priority and not normally funded unless there are exceptional circumstances or where they are commissioned as part of wider treatment provided within an integrated package of care. Any new CAM therapies would need to demonstrate evidence of clinical and cost effectiveness to be funded. Introduction Complementary and alternative therapies comprise a wide range of disciplines which are not considered to be part of mainstream medical care. The therapies can be provided by complementary and alternative medicine practitioners either as an addition to conventional medicine or may be viewed as a substitute for it. There is no national policy on the use of these therapies. The House of Lords Select Committeeidivides these therapies into three groups: Group 1 - those which are regarded as the principle disciplines: 1a - with statutory regulatory control - osteopathy, chiropractic (these are excluded from this guidance, except cranial osteopathy) 1b - acupuncture, herbal medicine and homeopathy. Group 2 - therapies used to complement conventional medicine without embracing diagnostic skills, e.g. massage, aromatherapy, hypnotherapy, reflexology and the Alexander Technique. Group 3 - those which offer diagnostic information as well as treatment: 3a - therapies which are long established and traditional in certain cultures (e.g. Ayurvedic medicine and Traditional Chinese medicine)2 3b - others with no credible evidence such as crystal therapy and dowsing. In the UK, osteopaths and chiropractors are currently the only CAM practitioners regulated by specific legislation: the Osteopaths Act 1993 and the Chiropractors Act 1994. In 2011, statutory regulation was agreed for herbal medicine practitioners and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners but not for acupuncture practitioners due to the robust voluntary regulation measures already in place. Acupuncturists, however, are required to register with their local authority who have powers to regulate the hygiene of the practice of acupuncture. If defined as a medicine under the Medicines Act 1968, CAM products also require a marketing authorisation (or 'product licence') before entering the market. Herbal remedies are exempt from licensing requirements if they meet certain conditions set out in Section 12 of the Act. Need and Demand There is limited data available on CAM usage, however, studies have estimated that around 10 per cent of adults in Great Britain use these therapies each yearii, and in England spend around \u00a3450 million on these therapies each yeariii. It has also been estimated that up to one third of patients with cancer use CAM at some point in time. Some NHS professionals use a selection of these therapies in their practice, e.g. physiotherapists using manipulation or acupuncture, or GPs using homeopathy with effective regulatory mechanisms in place for individual professionals and under NHS clinical governance arrangements. Despite this, the demand is mainly public driven and not on evidence based practice. Evidence of clinical effectiveness: The evidence base for complementary and alternative medicine is generally perceived to be poor. Despite numerous reviews there is still a shortage of strong evidence on the safety and efficacy of many CAM treatments. The reason for this lack of high-quality evidence is mainly the difficulties of applying standard medical research methods to some forms of CAM treatments. While some complementary treatments may give health benefits it has been difficult to quantify these benefits. A placebo effect can lead people (both patients and therapists) to conclude that a treatment is effective when it is not. There is some evidence of effectiveness for therapies in Group 1 but still the clinical and cost effectiveness of the majority of these therapies have not been proved with strong evidence. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviewsivcontains over 500 systematic reviews on CAM and the conclusions of many of these have been either insufficient or inconclusive evidence or further research required. A list of Cochrane Systematic Reviews of CAM therapies is included in Appendix 1. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) 'do not do' recommendations database contains a list of clinical practices that NICE recommends should be discontinued completely or should not be used routinely. A table of CAM therapies included in this database are also included in Appendix 1. The House of Commons Select Committee published a report on the evidence for homeopathy in February 2010v. The report included a thorough review of the evidence base for homeopathy and concluded that homeopathic products perform no better than placebos and that the NHS should not fund homeopathy. NICE clinical guideline 88 (May 2009)vion the early management of persistent non-specific low back pain (lasting for more than 6 weeks, but less than 12 months) recommends offering the following as treatment options:3 A course of acupuncture needling comprising up to a maximum of 10 sessions over a period of up to 12 weeks. A course of manual therapy (spinal manipulation, spinal mobilisation and massage) comprising up to a maximum of nine sessions over a period of up to 12 weeks. Nice clinical guideline 150 (September 2012)viion diagnosis and management of headaches in young people and adults recommended that acupuncture could be considered as prophylactic treatment with a course of up to 10 sessions over 5-8 weeks for: Chronic tension-type headache Migraine with or without aura, acupuncture if both topiramate and propanolol are unsuitable or ineffective. Risks In general the reported risks for most of the CAM treatments are low. However, one of the main risks is that patients miss out on conventional diagnosis and treatment due to consulting a CAM practitioner. Another risk is that patients do not inform their GP when they are receiving CAM treatment and there may be a risk of drug interactions.4 Appendix 1 Table 1: Systematic reviews by Cochrane Collaboration on CAMiv Therapy/Condition Date AssessedEffectiveness Acupuncture: Epilepsy Jul-11 No evidence Acute stroke ADHD Assisted conception Autism spectrum disorders Bell's palsy Cancer pain in adults Chronic asthma Cocaine dependence (auricular acupuncture) Depression Dysphagia in acute stroke Glaucoma Induction of labour Insomnia Irritable bowel syndrome Lateral elbow pain Mumps in children Pain in endometriosis Polycystic ovarian syndrome Restless legs syndrome Rheumatoid injury Uterine fibroids prophylaxis Neck disorders Pain management in labour Peripheral joint osteoarthritis Post operative nausea and vomiting Primary dysmenorrhea to other therapies for chronic low back pain.
