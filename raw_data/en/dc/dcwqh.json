[What Are Star Ratings?](#HwStarRatingExplanationWrapper) Our proprietary \"Star-Rating\" system was developed to help you easily understand the amount of scientific support behind each supplement in relation to a specific health condition. While there is no way to predict whether a vitamin, mineral, or herb will successfully treat or prevent associated health conditions, our unique ratings tell you how well these supplements are understood by the medical community, and whether studies have found them to be effective for other people. For over a decade, our team has combed through thousands of research articles published in reputable journals. To help you make educated decisions, and to better understand controversial or confusing supplements, our medical experts have digested the science into these three easy-to-follow ratings. We hope this provides you with a helpful resource to make informed decisions towards your health and well-being. 3 Stars Reliable and relatively consistent scientific data showing a substantial health benefit. 2 Stars Contradictory, insufficient, or preliminary studies suggesting a health benefit or minimal health benefit. 1 Star For an herb, supported by traditional use but minimal or no scientific evidence.

Sprigs of rosemary were considered a love charm, a sign of remembrance, and a way to ward off the plague. Rosemary was used by herbalists as a tonic for the elderly and to help with [indigestion](/medical-topics/id/hn-1037005#hn-1037005-need-to-know).2 In ancient China, rosemary was used for headaches and topically for baldness.3 [] How It Works How It Works A number of constituents have shown activity in the test tube. The volatile oil, including eucalyptol (cineole), is considered to have potent antibacterial effects4 and to relax smooth muscles in the lungs.5 Rosmarinic acid has [antioxidant](/medical-topics/id/hn-2802005#hn-2802005-uses) activity6 and another ingredient of rosemary, known as carnosol, inhibits cancer formation in animal studies.7 No human studies have confirmed rosemary's use for these conditions. How to Use It The German Commission E monograph suggests 3/4 to 1-1/4 tsp (4 to 6 grams) of rosemary leaf per day.8 A tea can be prepared by adding 2 teaspoons (10 grams) of herb to 1 cup (250 ml) boiling water and allowing it to steep in a covered container for 10 to 15 minutes. This tea can be taken several times per day. Rosemary tincture, 1/2 to 1 teaspoon (2 to 5 ml) three times per day, may also be used. The concentrated volatile oil should not be taken internally. [] Interactions Interactions with Supplements, Foods, & Other Compounds Interactions with Medicines [] Side Effects Side Effects There is no evidence to indicate that intermittent intake of moderate amounts of rosemary poses any threat during breast-feeding. However, internal intake of the herb and oil should be avoided during [pregnancy](/medical-topics/id/hn-1251000#hn-1251000-need-to-know) because the oil may act as an abortifacient (an agent that may induce an abortion).9 An extract of rosemary taken with a meal by healthy women inhibited the absorption of non-heme iron (e.g., the form of iron in plant foods) by 15%.10 Frequent use of rosemary could, in theory, promote the development of iron deficiency in susceptible individuals.
