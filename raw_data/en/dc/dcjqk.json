Anticoagulant Therapy Overview Anticoagulants are key medications in limit ing morbidity and improving survival for patients with potentially lethal thromboembolic events such as myocardial ischemia (PE). Anticoagulant therapy is also a key preventative measure in patients who have artificial heart valves and on a short-term basis to patients who have had surgeries, such as knee replacements. The anticoagulants must be carefully monitored to maintain a balance between preventing thrombi and causing excessive bleeding. Anticoagulant therapy is t he administration of medicati ons to stop thrombosis and achieve the following result: Disrupt the blood's natural clotting mechanism when there is a risk of clotting. Prevent formation of a thrombus in immobile and/or postoperative patients. Intercept the extension of a thrombus once it has formed. For at least fifty years, salicylic acid acetate (Aspirin) has been recognized as an anticoagulant that can signific antly reduce platelet count. It is the most common and often used blood thinner, usually taken in doses of 81 mg per day (essentially one baby aspirin). The mechanism of action is platelet aggregation inhibition. Additional types of anticoagulants include coum as warfarin (Coumadin) 60 years ago, warfarin sodi um is by far the or al anticoagulant of choice. This is quickly changing as new, impr oved anticoagulants undergo clinical trials and enter the market. The oral anticoagulants are a class of pharmaceuticals that act by antagonizing the effects of vitamin K. It is impo rtant to note that they take at least 48 to 72 hours for the anticoagulant effect to fully develop. In cases when an immediate effect is required, heparin must be given concomitant ly. Generally, warfarin is used to treat patients with deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), pul monary embolism, atri al fibrillation, and mechanical prosthetic heart valves. Oral anticoagulants can only be used to prevent clots, not to assist in eliminating them. Revised: October 2010 Description Warfarin sodium is an antic oagulant that blocks of thus inhibiti ng synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Those factors include 2, 7, 9 and 10, and the ant icoagulant proteins C and S. Indications: Atrial Fibrillation CCoolloorrss Contraindications Pregnancy Hemorrhagic tendencies dyscrasias or contemplated surgery of: (1) centra l nervous system; (2) eye; (3) traumatic surgery resulti ng in large open surfaces. Bleeding tendencies associated with acti ve ulceration or overt bleeding. Inadequate laboratory facilities. Unsupervised patients with senility, alc oholism, or psychosis or other lack of patient cooperation and compliance. Spinal puncture and other diagnostic or therapeutic procedures with potential for uncontrollable bleeding. Major regional, lumbar block anesthes ia, malignant hypertension and known hypersensitivity to warfarin or to any other components of this product. Revised: October 2010 Potential Side Effects Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur during the starting period and with a higher dos e (resulting in a higher INR), or in patients with the risk factor s listed above. The most serious risks associated with warfarin sodium treatment are hemorrhage in any tissue or organ and, less frequently, the destruction of skin tissue cells (nec rosis) or gangrene. T he risk of hemorrhage usually depends on the dosage and length of treatment. Other side effects of Coumadin include: Easy bruising Blood in stool Tarry stools Blood urine Blood in vomit Jaundice Abdominal cramps/pain Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea Overdose Signs and Symptoms Suspected or overt abnormal bleeding (e.g ., appearance of blood in stools or urine, hematuria, excessive menstrual bleeding, melena, petechiae, excessive bruising or persistent oozing from superficial injuries) are early manifestatio ns of anticoagulation beyond a safe and satisfactory level. Oral route for vitamin K is preferred due to superior efficacy compared to subcutaneous route. Oral vitamin K is available in tablet and solution formulations[2]. Revised: October 2010 Treatment Excessive anticoagulation, with or without bleeding, may be c ontrolled by discontinuing warfarin therapy and if necessary, by adminis tration of oral or parenteral vitamin K 1. Nursing Alert: Importance of Follow-Up Monitoring Prothrombin Time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) are the coagulation tests used to monitor the antic oagulation effects of warfarin on all treated patients. You must obtain a baseline INR pr ior to initiation of therapy , and a current INR must be available and used to monitor and adjust Coumadin therapy. Patients should have an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 fo r basic \"blood-thinning\" needs. For some patients who have a high risk of clot formati on, the INR needs to be higher - about 2.5 to 3.5 times the control. Other laboratory studies to monitor as ordered or if bleeding is suspected: 1. Platelet count 2. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels Be aware of drug-drug (including ove r-the-counter food and her bal supplements) and food-drug interactions that may alter the effects of warfarin. Revised: October 2010 Patient Education Dietary Restrictions & Potential for Drug Interactions Warfarin sodium can interact with a very wide variety of drugs, both prescription and overthecounter. Patients must check with their physician befo re taking ANY other medication, herbal product, or v itamin/mineral supplement. They must be extremely cautious with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) prod ucts, including herbal remedies and supplements because many of these are known to int eract with Warfarin sodium or otherwise affect coagulation. These Wort, coenzyme Q10, bromelains, galric, ginkgo bilob a, fish oils, and many more. Di et substances for weight loss (such as pills) should also be cautioned as some ma y contain substances that are contraindicated. Some substances, such as alcohol, can affe ct the PT/INR test. Antibiotics, aspirin, and cimetidine can increase the PT/INR. B arbituates, oral contraceptives or hormonereplacement therapy (HRT), and vitami n K - either in a multivitamin or liquid nutrition supplement (such as Boost) - c an decrease PT. Consumption of vitamin K rich fo ods in excess of a patient's us ual intake can alter PT What Is PT/INR? Prothrombin Time The prothrombin time is the time it takes plasma to clot after addition of tissue factor (obtained from animals). This measures the quality of the extrinsic pathway (as well as the common pathway) of coagulation. International Normalized Ratio Because of differences between batches from the various manufacturers of tissue factor (it is a biologically obtained product), the INR was devised to standardize the results. Each manufacturer gives an ISI (International Sensitivity Index) for any tissue factor they make. The ISI value indicates how the particular batch of tissue factor compares to an internationally standardized sample. The ISI is usually between 1.0 and 1.4. The INR is the ratio of a patient's prothrombin time to a normal (control) sample, raised to the power of the ISI value for the control sample used. Revised: October 2010 results. Vitamin K rich foods are usually frozen/cooked dark gr een vegetables. Other foods that contribute due to the additi ve effect of eating too much o f them include energy/supplement bars and soybe an/canola oil (usually in proce ssed and fast foods). The main dietary concern of taking w arfarin has to do with keeping a consistent amount of vitamin K in the diet from week to week. Coenzyme St John's Wort Excessive intake of Vitamin Krich foods Grapefruit juice Revised: October 2010 Quinidine Tamoxifen Safety Precautions Patients should be instructed about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report immediately to physician si gns and symptoms of bleeding. Health conditions must also be reported, including: 1. Bleeding problems. 2. Frequent falls. 3. Liver or kidney problems. 4. High blood pressure. 5. Congestive heart failure. 6. Onset of diabetes. 7. Herbal /CAM and/or vitamin/ mineral supplement consumption 8. Alcohol consumption and/or problems with alcohol abuse. 9. Pregnancy or planning to become pregnant. 10. Upcoming surgery, including dental work. Heparin and Derivatives In the 1930's, Heparin was hailed as a \"mi racle blood lubricant \" and used widely to decrease the morbidity and mortality of acut e care patients. Usually made from pig intestines, it works by activating antithrombin III, which blocks thrombin from clotting blood. Heparin (also described as unfractionated heparin) usually requires hospitalization for careful monitoring of the activated PTT and monitoring for potential side effects. The anticoagulant action and side effects of heparin are dose dependent . The two major side effects are bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). WWhhaatt iiss hheeppaarriinn--iinndduucceedd tthhrroommbbooccyyttooppeenniiaa development of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), due to the administration of various forms of heparin , an anticoagulant .

Alternative for HIT: LEPIRUDIN ARGATROBAN BIVALIRUDIN Revised: October 2010 Heparin can be used to treat or prevent a deep vein thrombosis. When used for treatment, heparin prevents new thrombus fo rmation and prevents existing thrombi from getting larger or becoming a pulmonary embol us. This allows t he normal body systems to dissolve the clots that are already formed. NNUURRSSIINNGG AALLEERRTT 1. Obtain baseline coagulation and hem atologic studies before initiating anticoagulation therapy to ens ure that the pat ient does not have an underlying bleeding or clotting disorder. Indication: Prevention and treatment of Venous thromboembolism (VTE) units SC thromboplastin time (PTT). Ther apeutic is 2 to times the control. Platelet count Hemoglobin and hematocrit Fibrinogen Low Molecular Weight Heparins Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is a more highly proc essed product that has the advantage of not requiring PTT monitoring be cause it has more predictable plasma levels and has fewer side effects. The benef its over heparin include a longer half-life, less platelet inhibition than unfractionated he parin, and more mobility for the patient (it may be given at home). The advent of the highly processed low mo lecular weight heparins such as dalteperin, enoxaparin (Lovenox), nadroperin tinzaperin comprised a major step forward in anticoagulation therapy. They can be injected subquetaneously once or twice daily to outpatients, and are as effectiv e as unfractionated heparin fo r prophylaxis and treatment of DVT/PE and are increasingly administ ered to patients with acute coronary syndromes. LMWHs have a lower incidence of HIT because they do not interfere as readily with platelet factor 4.

Anticoagulant Therapy in Surgical Patients Prevention of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) DVT occurs in pelvic veins or in the deep vein s of the lower extremities in postoperative patients. The incidence of DVT vari es between 10% and 40% depending on the complexity of the surgery or the severity of the underlyi ng illness. DVT is most common after hip surgery, follow ed by retropubic prostatectomy, and general thoracic or abdominal surgery. Venous thrombi located above the knee are considered the major source of pulmonary emboli. Those at high risk are patients with obesity, prolonged immobility, cancer, smoking, estrogen use, advancing age, varicose veins, dehydration, splenectomy, and orthopedic procedures. One way to prevent the formation of DVTs is to use prophylactic strategies such as anticoagulant therapy. Medicati ons such as aspirin, warfarin, enoxaparin, and several types of heparin are often used, along with many others. These medications can be given before, during, or after surgery. Bleeding can be a complication of anticoagulant prophylaxis, however, so it is not always the optimal treatm ent for surgical patients. Because of this, nurses also must become well versed in using mechanical prophylaxis and ensuring early ambulation to reduce the risk of DVT. Perioperative nurses can make a difference by educating themselves and their patients about DVTs and how to prevent them. Drug Alert Oral anticoagulants should generally be di scontinued preoperatively to reduce the risk of hemorrhage in the intraoperative phase. Unfractionated heparin I.V. may be prescribed preoperatively as it s half-life is short; thus, th e anticoagulant effects are reversed within 30 minutes to 1 hour after discontinuation. Be aware that heparin may be continued for 4 to 5 days a fter oral anticoagulant is initia ted due to the delayed onset of therapeutic effectivene ss with oral anticoagulants. Nursing Alert 1. Follow precautions to prevent bleeding: Handle patient carefully while turning and positioning. Maintain pressure on I.V. and venipunc ture sites for at least 5 minutes. Assist with ambulation and keep walk ways/hallways free from clutter to prevent falls. 2. Observe carefully for any possible signs of bleeding and report immediately Hematuria \u2014 frank blood in urine or microhematuria as detected by lab Melena -assess for dark tarry stools, occult blood positive detected by lab. Revised: October 2010 Hemoptysis_ assess for frank blood in the sputum , occult blood positive detected by lab Bleeding gums \u2014 note any pink saliva or frank bleeding with dental hygiene. Epistaxis \u2014 frequent/persistent nosebleeds. Inspect skin carefully for any bruising/hematomas. Fondaparinux (Arixtra) Arixtra is a synthetic selective indirect inhibi tor of factor Xa. It is more selective than heparin (including both unfractionated hepari n and low molecular weight heparins), which inhibits other clotting factors as well. It is the only selective inhibitor of factor Xa which has been approved for use in the tr eatment and prevention of thrombosis. Fondaparinux is given subcut aneously daily for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis in patients who have had orthopedic surgery as well as for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. One potential advantage of fondaparinux over LMWH or unfractionated heparin is that the risk for hepar in-induced thrombocytopenia is substantially lower. Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Hip fracture surgery, in cluding extended prophylaxis; Hip replacement surgery; Knee replacement surgery; Abdominal surgery for patient at risk for thro mboembolic complications. Treatment Acute Deep Vein Thrombosis Treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis when administered in conjunction with warfarin sodium. Treatment of Acute Pulmonary Embolism Treatment of acute pulm onary embolism when administered in conjunction with warfarin sodium when in itial therapy is administered in the hospital. Revised: October 2010 Dosage Prophylaxis DVT Hip Fracture Hip Replacement Knee Replacement Surgery Abdominal Surgery 2.5 mg subcutaneously once daily after hemostasis has been established. The initial dose should be given no earlier than 6 to 8 hours after surgery and continued for 5 to 9 days. For patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, extended prophylaxis up to 24 additional days is recommended Treatment DVT/PE 5 mg (body weight <50 kg), 7.5 mg (50 to 100 kg), or 10 mg (>100 kg) subcutaneously once daily. Treatment should continue for at least 5 days until INR 2 to 3 achieved with warfarin sodium. Contraindications Severe renal impairment (creatinine clear in prophylaxis or thromboembolism. Active major bleeding. Bacterial endocarditis. Thrombocytopenia associated with a positive in vitro test for anti-platelet antibody in the presence of fondaparinux sodium. Body weight <50 kg (venous thro mboembolism prophyla xis only). Warning and Precautions Use with caution in patients who have condi tions or who are taking concomitant medications that increa se risk of hemorrhage. Bleeding risk is increased in renal im pairment and in patients with low body weight <50 kg. Thrombocytopenia can occur with administration of Arixtra.

The potential risk of epidural or spinal hematomas Signs and symptoms of possible bleeding Revised: October 2010 Patient Education and Health Maintenance Instruct patient to: Follow instructions carefully and take medications exactly as prescribed; if a dose is missed, do NOT double up dose. Notify all health care providers, including dentist, that you are taking anticoagulants. Be consistent with your intake of vitamin K rich foods. Vitamin K rich foods such as greens, leafy vegetables, fish, liver, green tea, and tomatoes should be used in the same quantity every day. Take medications at the same time each day and do not stop taking them even if symptoms of thrombus/embolus are not present. Wear a medical identification bracelet or carry a card indicating that you are taking anticoagulants; include name, address, and te lephone number of health care provider. Use soft tooth brush to avoid potential bleeding. Advise the patient to notify the health care provider of the following: Accidents, infections, excessive diarrhea, and other significant illnesses Scheduled invasive procedures by other health care providers, including routine dental examinations and other dental procedures, cardiac catheterizations. If surgical care by another health care provider or dentist is needed, inform other provider that anticoagulants are being taken. Missed doses \u2014 follow instructions of health care provider in case of missed dose. Advise the patient to avoid taking any other medications without first checking with health care provider, particularly: Vitamins, especially if they contain vitamin K Herbal supplements Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (including aspirin and acetominophen) Mineral oil Cold medicines Antibiotics Phenylbutazone (Butazolidin) Caution patients about: Excessive use of alcohol and on acceptable limits for social drinking. Participation in activities in which there is high risk of injury. Foods that may cause diarrhea or upset stomach, rapid changes in diet. Shaving with a sharp razor ( alternative : electric shaver). Avoid flossing ( alternative : waxed dental floss) Be very careful using knives and scissors. Be careful when you trim your toenails. Use of herbal and vitamin supplements that may increase or decrease INR. Revised: October 2010 Instruct the patient to be alert for these warning signs: Excessive bleeding that does not stop quickly (such as following shaving, a small cut, tooth brushing with gum injury, nosebleed) Excessive menstrual bleeding Skin discoloration or bruises that appear suddenly \u2014 particularly on the fingers and toes or deep purple spots anywhere on the body (\"blue toe syndrome\") Black or bloody stools; for questionable stool discoloration, test for occult blood Blood in urine Faintness, dizziness, or unusual weakness Stress the importance of close follow-up and compliance with periodic laboratory work for blood clotting profiles. Notify health care provider if you are unable to keep scheduled appointments. If the provider has not called with instructions about dosage, call the provider themselves.
