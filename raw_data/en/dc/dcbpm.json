The University's affirmative-action policy is to provide equal access to admissions, educational programs and activities, financial aid, student services, and employment. In compliance with Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a grievance procedure has been established to process student complaints alleging violation of these regulations or of the University's policy of nondiscrimination based on gender or disability. Inquiries concerning Title IX may be directed to the affirmative-action officer. Employment-related discrimination complaints, including those filed by student employees, are processed in conformity with the provisions outlined in existing staff personnel policies. Complaints related to discrimination in academic areas are reviewed in conformity with the procedures established by the academic administration. INTRODUCTION 21 Nondiscri minatio n Policy Loma Linda University was established by the Seventh-day Adventist Church as an integral part of its teaching ministry. The University affirms that Christian principles are incompatible with various forms of discrimination that have divided societies, and that all persons are of equal worth in the sight of God and should be so regarded by all His people. Therefore, the University is committed to equal education and employment opportunities for men and women of all races and does not discriminate on the basis of handicap, gender, race, color, or national origin in its educational or admissions policies, financial affairs, employment programs, student life and services, or any University-administered program. To this end, the University is in compliance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended and is in substantial compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (34 CFR 106 et seq.), Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veterans Adjustment Act of 1974; and does not discriminate against any employees or applicants for employment on the basis of age or because they are disabled veterans or veterans of the Vietnam era. In addition, the University administers student programs without discrimination on the basis of age\u2014except in those programs where age is a bona fide academic qualification for admission\u2014in accordance with the provisions of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. The University reserves constitutional and statutory rights as a religious institution and employer to give preference to Seventh-day Adventists in admissions and employment, including but not limited to 42 U.S.C. Secs. 2000e-1, 2000e-2; Sec. 6-15 of Code Sec. 12926(d)(1); Title II, Division 4, Chapter 2, Sec. 7286.5 of the California Code of Regulations; the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; and Article I, Sec. 4, of the California Constitution. The University believes that Title IX regulations are subject to constitutional guarantees against unreasonable entanglement with or infringements on the religious teachings and practices of the Seventh-day Adventist church. The University expects students and employees to uphold biblical principles of morality and deportment as interpreted by the Seventh-day Adventist church. The University claims exemptions from the provisions of Title IX set forth in CATALOG Accommodation for Disability Loma Linda University is in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Sec. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, as well as with local and state requirements. The University is committed to providing education\u2014including support services and reasonable accommodations for disabilities\u2014to qualified applicants for whom such accommodation does not fundamentally alter the chosen program or create an undue burden. For information regarding accommodation for disability, the student should consult the office of the dean of the school to which application for admission is being made. Following acceptance, the student may be asked if he or she has a disability requiring accommodation. A student who desires accommodation for a disability (e.g., physical, learning, or psychological) identified after acceptance should consult the office of the dean regarding a request for accommodation. The accommodation request must be submitted in writing on the designated form. The completed form and the required supporting documentation will be evaluated by appropriate University entities to determine whether or not the applicant can be expected to perform the essential functions of the program. All discussions will remain confidential.

A Seventh-day Adventist Health Sciences Institution UNIVERSITY MACE, COAT OF ARMS, AND SEAL 31 University Mace, Coat of Arms, and Seal Traditionally the ceremonial mace represents the authority vested in the highest officer of a governing body. In an educational institution, the authority symbolized by the mace derives from respect for the authority of knowledge and for the rights and value of the individual. Thus the leader of an academic community assumes the obligation and challenge to ensure for its members a climate conducive to growth in knowledge and grace. The construction of the ceremonial mace of Loma Linda University evokes further ideas. Its two metals bronze and aluminum, suggest the value of lessons both ancient and contemporary. Rather than lying prone, an instrument to be wielded, this mace stands upright in celebration of the human spirit. Its open construction implies free exposure to questions, ideas, and conflict. The eight vertical supporting elements (at three points bound together as for strength and stability in unity) uphold a graceful oval that points outward to the universe, the province of inquiry. Within the oval, the University seal appears to float unfettered. The basic design of the coat of arms and the seal of Loma Linda University\u2014established in 1905 as the College of Medical Evangelists\u2014is a contemporary modification of the shield, a heraldic device. Within the seal, the broken sword suggests the compassion and mercy of those who serve others with love, selflessness, and restraint from attitudes of self-aggrandizement and acts of destructiveness. The lighted torch symbolizes the learner's zeal to advance truth. It also suggests the illuminating power of knowledge and the University's central purpose of forwarding and perpetuating good through the enlightened, searching, caring mind and conscience of the individual. The ancient staff of Aesculapius, long associated with medicine, represents in the modern and broad sense the combined services of all the healing arts and sciences. Across the base of the shield the open book symbolizes the Word of God\u2014the foundation of all truth, the source of the Christ-centered commission, the inspiration for all endeavor of humanity for humanity. Framing the shield are, at the left, the wreath of oak leaves and acorns, presented in ancient times to honor the civic contribution of one who had saved his brother-citizen's life; and, at the right, the wreath of laurel, presented to honor personal achievement. The emblems of the seal imply that one who has the privilege of learning also has the obligation of valor and honor. On the scroll below the shield is the motto\u2014adopted in 1955 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this institution\u2014To Make Man Whole. 32 UNIVERSITY CATALOG University Foundations HISTORY Loma Linda University is part of the Seventh-day Adventist system of higher education. In 1905 the University (formerly College of Medical Evangelists) was founded\u2014through a series of divine providences\u2014at Loma Linda, California, by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The School of Nursing began in 1905. In 1909, the College of Medical Evangelists received its charter as a medical school with the express purpose of preparing physicians who could meet the needs of the whole person. Both Schools emphasized the need for healthful living as a part of medical care, a revolutionary concept in 1905. The University was designated by the church as a center for educating health professionals. The original schools\u2014Nursing and Medicine\u2014have been joined by Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Public Health, Science and Technology, the Graduate School, and the Faculty of Religion. The curricula of the University are approved by their respective professional organizations. From its small beginnings, the University has achieved widespread recognition, having sent more of its graduates into international service than has any other university. It remains committed to the vision of its founders and is sustained by its close association with the church. From 1918 to 1962, the University operated within health facilities in two cities: Loma Linda and Los Angeles. In September 1962 all health-professional education was consolidated at Loma Linda. In 1967 Loma Linda University Medical Center opened in its new three-tower facility, a landmark cloverleaf structure. The Medical Center continues on the cutting edge of health care, providing excellent service for patients and expanding educational opportunities for students. In 1990 the Board of Trustees designated Loma Linda University a health-sciences university\u2014part of a complex comprised of Loma Linda University Medical Center, faculty practice plans, and affiliated institutions. The University is a leader in the field of health-sciences education, research, and service. The most current campus census figures (January 1, 2006) indicate that the core of the combined faculties consists of 1,179 full-time teachers. Part-time and voluntary teachers (1,345\u2014largely clinicians curricula) bring UNIVERSITYFOUNDATIONS33 thetotalto2524.AsofAutumnQuarter2005,655studentsfrom92countries outsidetheUnitedStatesarerepresentedintheenrollmentof3939.

Mankind's fullest development entails a growing understanding of the individual in relation to both God and society. The quest for truth and professional expertise, in an environment permeated by religious values, benefits the individual and society and advances the ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. 36 UNIVERSITY CATALOG FUNDAMENTAL VALUES COMPASSION\u2014The sympathetic willingness to be engaged with the needs and suffering of others. Among the most memorable depictions of compassion in Scripture is the story of the Good Samaritan, which LLU has taken as a central symbol for our work. INTEGRITY\u2014The quality of living a unified life in which one's convictions are well considered and match one's actions. Integrity encompasses honesty, authenticity, and trustworthiness. EXCELLENCE\u2014The commitment to exceed minimum standards and expectations. FREEDOM\u2014The competency and privilege to make informed and accountable choices and to respect the freedom of others. God has called us not to slavery, but to freedom. JUSTICE\u2014The commitment to equality and to treat others fairly, renouncing all forms of unfair discrimination. The God of the Bible is One who calls people continually to justice. According to the prophets, religious faith can be genuine only when it leads the believers to \"seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphans, [and] plead for the widow.\" PURITY/SELF-CONTROL\u2014The commitment to be morally upright and moderate in all things, with complete control over one's emotions, desires, and actions. HUMILITY\u2014The willingness to serve others in a sacrificial manner; the self-respect that renounces haughtiness or arrogance. A UNIQUE UNIVERSITY 37 A Unique University Loma Linda University has always combined a devotion to academic excellence with a concern for spiritual values and a high sense of mission. The motto of the University, \"to make man whole,\" illustrates the sense of destiny felt in the University community to act its part in God's ongoing plan for healing and restoring human beings to live with Him in wholeness, both now and in eternity. While Loma Linda University has changed in many ways since its beginning in 1905, the Biblical principles which provide its foundation have remained unchanged. SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST HERITAGE Loma Linda University is owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and has a deep commitment to respecting the rich diversity of its student body. It views respect and sensitivity for all people, regardless of their culture and ethnicity, as a part of true Christianity. We recognize that students come from many different faiths. This University has a tradition of religious liberty, and it highly respects students' religious values that differ from ours. We look upon the various perspectives of each spiritually committed student as enriching to our campus and educational environment. 38 UNIVERSITY CATALOG OUR UNIQUE FEATURES Two distinctive features of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which are part of the Loma Linda experience, become evident to first-time students. The first is the concept of Sabbath rest, which reminds us of God as Creator. Adventists realize this in part by celebrating Saturday as the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. During these hours University offices, laboratories, libraries, study halls, and recreation facilities are closed to give time for physical and spiritual renewal and worship. A second distinctive feature worth noting is the emphasis on health and wholeness. Students will be able to exercise in our recreation and wellness center, a health-and-fitness complex that received a national award for excellence in utility and design. The cafeterias on campus feature well-prepared vegetarian meals. Note also that the University holds that a drug-, alcohol-, and tobacco-free lifestyle is essential for achieving the goal of \"wholeness.\" This means that all students agree to refrain from the use of tobacco, alcohol, and other \"recreational\" drugs while enrolled at the University. SPIRITUAL LIFE Worship experiences represent a critical dimension of the educational experience at Loma Linda University and are available to the student many times throughout the week. In addition to regular Friday evening and Saturday services, many class, school, club, and University activities include a component of worship and praise to God. A UNIQUE UNIVERSITY 39 CHAPEL SERVICES In keeping with the commitment of our mission, Loma Linda University students have special requirements, such as chapel service attendance each Wednesday morning in the University Church. The chapel programs provide a variety of opportunities to integrate faith and learning. Undergraduates who stay in the residence halls are also expected to attend worships in the residence halls each week. RELIGION CLASSES Classes in religion are part of the core curriculum in each of the University's schools and programs. These classes deal with the study of the Bible, ethics, clinical ministry (which concentrates on ways to understand and meet the spiritual needs of patients in a manner that is noninvasive and individually appropriate), and a variety of other issues related to the student's field of study and personal spiritual journey. All students who choose Loma Linda as their university make a commitment to conduct their lives in a manner that reflects their sense of responsibility for the honor and integrity of the University and themselves as members of its community. 40 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Learning Environment The total resources of the University offer a wealth of opportunity to the student with initiative and willingness to develop individual capacity to the fullest extent. The academic resources, affiliated clinical facilities, and community agencies constitute a rich educational environment both in classroom instruction and in guided experience. Major facilities utilized for clinical affiliations and internships include the University Medical Center; the Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans Medical Center; and numerous other hospitals and agencies located in the Redlands, San Bernardino, Riverside, and Los Angeles areas, as well as throughout the United States and abroad. In addition, students find varied opportunities for service and learning in the immediate University community, in clinical and research electives, and in diverse volunteer programs. UNIVERSITY STUDENT SERVICE-LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES Students for International Mission Service (SIMS) Students for International Mission Service (SIMS) is a University-wide student organization that plans projects targeting underserved populations; monthly medical/dental trips to Baja, California; and one-to-three-month medical-mission experiences around the world.

LEARNING ENVIRONMENT 41 Mission Institute The schools provide assistance to the annual world mission institutes\u2014organized by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and conducted at Loma Linda University and at Andrews University in Michigan. LEARNING RESOURCES: UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES Major library resources Four major library resources on campus support the University's academic programs. These are: the Del E. Webb Memorial Library the Jesse Medical Library and Information Center (JMLIC), the Rehabilitation Library (East Campus), and the Veterans Administration Library Services In addition to these facilities, specialized libraries are located in various medical and school departments and other entities on campus. The central library The historical roots of the Del E. Webb Memorial Library\u2014the central library of Loma Linda University\u2014go back to 1907, when a small library collection was started in a room of the old Loma Linda Sanitarium. In 1953 the growing collection was moved to its own building on the Loma Linda campus. In 1981 a new library was built, funded by a Del E. Webb Foundation grant, giving the library a total floor space of 87,670 square feet. This structure now houses the main library; while the old structure is now shared between the Department of Archives and Special Collections and the bound retrospective journals. As of June 2003, the library had a total collection of 353,019 books and bound journals; 165,856 print and electronic books; 8,211 current print and electronic journal titles; and 6,060 media items. For more information consult <http://www.llu.edu/llu/library/about/libstats.htm>. Library mission The mission of the Library is to stimulate and support the information needs of the University's instructional, research, and service programs. To this end, the Library provides a full range of information-support services\u2014including, but not limited to, reference, circulation, reserve, and access to the Internet. The Library also provides hundreds of online databases, including full text; end-user training programs; laboratory; class-integrated, library-instruction programs; and services that support distance education and University outreach programs. Access to resources The Del E. Webb Memorial Library's Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) provides integrated access to all campus library collections. In addition to the collections of the Del E. Webb Memorial Library and of the JMLIC, there are Nursing Skills Lab, Bioethics, East Campus, Nutrition, Occupational Therapy, and Geoscience Research Center collections.

ADVISEMENT Upon admission into a degree program, each student is assigned an academic adviser\u2014a faculty member in the student's ADMISSION POLICIES AND INFORMATION 47 major department who serves as the student's first line of communication in addressing professional and personal successes and potential challenges. Faculty advisers are prepared to discuss career opportunities, academic policies, academic problems, curriculum, and personal circumstances. It is the student's responsibility to consult with his/her adviser in planning the program of study. Thereafter, advisees should schedule counseling sessions with their advisers to monitor progress and assure completion of degree requirements. When questions arise relating to curriculum or policy requirements, students should always refer first to the CATALOG and their own program curriculum outline. Next, they may seek counsel from their academic adviser. Questions arising after discussion with the adviser should be referred to the department chair or the academic dean. Orientation and advisement sessions are scheduled for all new students. These sessions provide general guidance regarding student services, health care, library resources, safety and security, registration procedures, and academic policy. INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS International applicants (non-U.S. citizens and non-U.S. permanent residents) must meet all admissions requirements for the chosen program, provide suitable recommendations, meet minimum pre-entrance examination requirements, furnish English evaluations of all official international transcripts and credentials, and give evidence of their ability to meet estimated living expenses and all financial obligations to the University during their program. English proficiency Regardless of nationality or citizenship, an applicant whose native language is not English and whose secondary education has been outside the United States is required to pass the Michigan Test of English Language Proficiency (MTELP) or the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), or their equivalents. It is recommended that prior to admission, all professional programs require the Test of Spoken English (TSE) of all applicants whose native language is not English. The minimum total score requirements are as follows for TOEFL, unless adjustments are made at the discretion of the individual school: undergraduate, 173 (paper based = 500) required of applicants to programs that do not include a clinical component and/or do not lead to licensure in the United States, with a goal of 200 (paper based = 533) upon graduation from a baccalaureate degree program; undergraduate, 213 (paper based = 550) required of applicants to programs with a clinical component and/or programs leading to licensure in the United States; graduate, 213 (paper based = 550). For the Michigan test, requirements are as follows: undergraduate, a minimum score of 90th percentile; graduate (humanities and social sciences), 90th percentile and above; graduate (science), 85th percentile and above. Test of Written English (TWE): a minimum score of 5; Test of Spoken English (TSE): a minimum score of 50. Pre-entrance examination results Official pre-entrance examination results, as required by each program (e.g., TOEFL), should be sent directly to the Office of University Admissions. Foreign transcripts and credentials Official international degrees, professional credentials, and educational transcripts (or grade sheets or mark sheets) must be sent to an evaluation center approved by Loma Linda University Office of University Admissions. The center reports the evaluation results directly to the Office of University Admissions. Finances and employment Loma Linda University requires accepted international applicants to pay an advance international student deposit. This deposit is refundable, less any courier/mailing fees, under the following circumstances: 1) during the student's last quarter of enrollment at Loma Linda University, 2) when a visa is denied by a U.S. embassy or consulate, or 3) when a student terminates his/her program. United States immigration regulations require a prospective student to document his/her financial resources for tuition, fees, and living expenses. For international students, on-campus employment is allowed but limited by visa regulations (e.g., for F-1 and J-1 students, employment is limited to a maximum of twenty hours per week while school is in session). Scholarships, assistantships, and living stipends are rarely available at Loma Linda University because it is a small, private university (i.e., not supported by the U.S. or California state government but rather is church sponsored). Employment plans require approval by a 48 UNIVERSITY CATALOG designated school official (DSO) in International Student and Scholar Services. VISAS F-1 student visas Loma Linda University is authorized by the United States Department of Homeland Security to issue F-visa applications (i.e., I-20 forms). The F-1 student visa is the visa of choice for most international students coming to Loma Linda University. This visa allows some nondegree study (e.g., certificates, preceptorships, and English-as-a-second-language studies). Degree-earning students are subject to study-load requirements and are allowed limited on-campus employment. The I-20 is issued after a student 1) has been accepted into a program and official transcripts (mark sheets) have been received by the University, 2) has paid the advance deposit, and 3) has documented his/her financial plan for the chosen program. International Student and Scholar Services can be contacted at 909/558-4955 for further information regarding F-1 student visas and the regulations governing these visas. J exchange-visitor's visas Loma Linda University has an Exchange Visitor Program that is approved by the U.S. Department of State. This J-visa exchange program is authorized to sponsor/host degree-earning students, nondegree (continuing education) students, short-term scholars, visiting professors, and research scholars. The J-visa form, DS-2019, is issued after an exchange visitor has been accepted into a program, scholar position, or professor position; and has documented his/her financial plan (including health insurance for J-1 and J-2 dependents). Loma Linda University also hosts exchange visitors who are sponsored by other organizations (e.g., Fulbright scholars). As a hosting institution, Loma Linda University has limited authority over an exchange visitor since the authority resides in the sponsoring organization. Under current exchange-visitor regulations, J-2 dependents are allowed to enroll part or full time at Loma Linda University. Also, their credits earned can be either degree or nondegree applicable. J-1 exchange visitors are allowed to work; but employment guidelines differ, depending on the exchange category. Contact International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955 for further information and regulations governing the Exchange Visitor Program. Other visas Internationals may enter the U.S. on a wide variety of visas. However, a visa may have to be changed before a student can commence academic studies at this University. For further information regarding regulations and study options for specific visa types, contact International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. Transfer students International students currently attending other schools in the United States who have either an I-20 or a DS-2019 and who wish to attend Loma Linda University must do a school-to-school transfer. The timing of a transfer is critical in order to maintain visa status; therefore, it is important to consult with an international adviser as soon as the acceptance letter is received. Study load Both the F- and J-student-visa regulations require the successful completion of a full study load during each quarter of each academic year (as defined by each program). A minimum of 12 units per quarter is usually considered full time for an undergraduate program; 8 units per quarter is considered full time for a graduate program. In any quarter in which there will be a reduced study load, prior approval is needed from an international student adviser in International Student and Scholar Services. DIVISION OF GENERAL STUDIES 49 Division of General Studies GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS The Division of General Studies offers general education courses that contribute to the fulfillment of requirements that apply to the Bachelor of Science degree programs in the Schools of Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing, and Public Health. In addition, these schools offer a variety of general education courses that are open to students across all schools. The Division of General Studies also provides oversight for courses that may be selected to enrich a student's academic experience, but which do not fulfill Loma Linda University general education requirements. LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY PHILOSOPHY OF GENERAL EDUCATION As a Seventh-day Adventist health-sciences institution, Loma Linda University seeks to exemplify a life of service and sensitivity beyond the requirements of academic excellence within a professional discipline. With its rich spiritual heritage, the University places special emphasis on educating its students for a life of service in a global community. General education at Loma Linda University consists of courses, lectures, programs, and activities coordinated with the intent to integrate faith and learning. In addition to the basics of cultural heritage and diversity, scientific inquiry and analysis, communication, and wellness, the curriculum emphasizes the University's spiritual heritage; as well as moral and ethical decision making that is grounded in Christian principles. Thus, a general education is considered to be the cornerstone upon which students begin cultivating their abilities to: 1. Understand the fundamental Christian principles and Adventist heritage that undergird Loma Linda University. 2. Make informed moral and ethical decisions. 3. Incorporate critical-thinking skills into personal and professional experience. 4. Value individuals with diverse capabilities and ideological, ethnic, gender, and generational perspectives. 5. Communicate effectively. 50 UNIVERSITY CATALOG 6. Undertake scientific inquiry and analysis. 7. Appreciate the contributions of the arts and humanities to society. 8. Examine the historical basis of the health sciences professions. 9. Develop self-awareness through balance of mental, physical, social, and spiritual aspects of daily living. 10. Model servant-leadership in health care as exemplified by Jesus of Nazareth. The Loma Linda University philosophy of general education creates a unique learning environment committed to the concept of human wholeness. Faculty are selected who embrace the spirit as well as the specifics of general education and who purpose to extend its goals into all aspects of university life\u2014from the residence hall programs to the core of professional studies\u2014thus adding an invisible curriculum to the required course offerings. It is this spirit in tandem with the specifics of a liberal arts education that inspires students to achieve academic excellence, value diversity, pursue lifelong learning, and live to bless others. LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY CRITERIA FOR GENERAL EDUCATION COURSES 1. The course assists the health-sciences student in cultivating abilities in one or more of the ten aspects described in the Loma Linda University philosophy of general education for baccalaureate degrees. 2.

SCHOOL AND PROGRAM-SPECIFIC GE REQUIREMENTS For additional information about specific general education requirements, see the desired schools and programs\u2014Sections III and IV of this CATALOG. 64 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Student Life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The most current Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies, and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook. Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. FROM UNIVERSITY TO STUDENT Loma Linda University was established to provide education in a distinctively Christian environment. Students are expected to respect the standards and ideals of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Prospective students have the freedom to choose or reject University or school standards, but the decision must be made before enrollment. Application to and enrollment in Loma Linda University constitute the student's commitment to honor and abide by the academic and social practices and regulations stated in announcements, bulletins, handbooks, and other published materials; and to maintain a manner that is mature and compatible with the University's function as an institution of higher learning. It is inevitable that the student will come under question if academic performance is below standard; student duties are neglected; social conduct is unbecoming; or attitudes demonstrate deficiencies such as poor judgment, moral inadequacy, or other forms of immaturity. Procedures for evaluation of academic and nonacademic performance\u2014as well as for the student to exercise his/her right of appeal\u2014are described in the current CATALOG and in each school's section of the Student Handbook. Grievances regarding both academic and nonacademic matters must be processed according to these published grievance procedures. After a student files an appeal or grievance, the faculty assesses the student's fitness for a career in the chosen profession and recommends to the dean appropriate action regarding the student's continuance or discontinuance. STUDENT LIFE 65 Prospective students who have questions concerning the University's expectations should seek specific information prior to enrollment. WHOLE-PERSON HEALTH The University regards the student from a cosmopolitan and comprehensive point of view. It is cosmopolitan in that historically the University's global mission has promoted bonds and opportunities in education and service without regard to gender, or to national, racial, or geographical origin. It is comprehensive in that the University's concern for the welfare of the student traditionally has been an integrated concern for assisting the student toward whole-person health\u2014balanced development of spiritual, social, physical, and mental health. Cultivating the health of any one part enhances the health of all parts. Neglecting or abusing the health of one harms the health of all. Before one can experience whole-person health, there must be a practical appreciation of the interdependent interaction of each part of the whole. Students from all schools of Loma Linda University may congregate and participate in the multifaceted programs offered that involve the wholistic concept of social, intellectual, physical, emotional, and spiritual wellness. These programs support Loma Linda University's motto, \"To make man whole.\" Spiritual health In addition to personal quiet times, opportunities for the student to further develop rich, personal spiritual resources are provided in scheduled religious exercises and activities and in informal association with others who cherish spiritual values. Religion classes as well as weekly chapel services are part of the required curriculum. Social health Situated within easy access of the ocean, mountains, and desert, the University provides numerous opportunities for students to complement their formal learning through participation in a wide variety of recreational, cultural, and other activities. A variety of University-, school-, and group-sponsored events encourages students to relax and become better acquainted with one another. Through these activities and events, students can enrich their group interaction and leadership experiences, increase their enjoyment of and interest in fields outside their profession, develop their talents, enhance wholesome and 66 UNIVERSITY CATALOG memorable association with others, and cultivate supportive and lifelong social relationships. Physical health The University promotes physical fitness by encouraging recreational interests and by providing courses in field exercises, bodybuilding, and health instruction. An effort is exerted to interest each student in some recreational and health-building activity that may be carried over to enhance future life. Mental health The University promotes mental health by encouraging students to study and practice principles of sound psychological health and to access state-of-the-art counseling and mental health services, as needed. RECREATION/WELLNESS: THE DRAYSON CENTER The Drayson Center, Loma Linda University's recreation and wellness center, provides state-of-the-art fitness facilities. The center includes a 21,000-square-foot multipurpose gymnasium, which may accommodate three full-sized basketball courts, five volleyball courts, or nine badminton courts. Circling the gymnasium's inside perimeter is an elevated, rubberized, three-lane running track. The facility also includes five racquetball courts with viewing areas, and fully equipped men's and women's locker rooms. Aerobics studios and cardiovascular and fitness areas are equipped for strength training, sports conditioning, body building, and power lifting. A 22-foot-high, 150-foot water slide ends in the nearby recreational pool. This shallow pool is wheelchair accessible. An outdoor Jacuzzi is also available, as well as indoor saunas in the men's and women's locker rooms. Included in the complex are a lighted, six-court tennis facility; a 400,000-square-foot multiuse recreational area with four softball fields; a half-mile-long track; and picnic and game areas. The Drayson Center offers lifetime leisure classes (noncredit), such as low- and high-impact aerobics, ballet, karate, and judo. The Wellness Office offers personal training, massage therapy, and individual nutrition counseling and group nutrition classes with a registered dietitian. THE STUDENT HEALTH PLAN Because the health, vitality, and welfare of its students and their dependents are of major concern to the University, Loma Linda University sponsors and funds the Student Health Plan, a health care plan that provides health service and medical coverage to all eligible students. Student Health Service provides free service to students who are enrolled in the Student Health Plan. Full-time students are enrolled automatically. Part-time students must buy in. The plan includes the following benefits: Student Health Service, 24-hour coverage, and generous coverage through preferred providers. The Student Health Plan provides a broad range of medical coverage but does not provide dental or vision coverage. Student Health Service Professional services are rendered by the Student Health Service, which provides basic care to students. The Student Health Service is located in the Center for Health Promotion in Evans Hall, corner of Stewart and Anderson streets. The hours are Monday through Thursday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.; Friday, 8 a.m.-2 p.m. Services are free to students. Supplementary medical-coverage policy The Student Health Plan is an \"excess\" policy and only supplements other medical plans that provide benefits to the student. The student first obtains direct-provider payment, or reimbursement for out-of-pocket payments, from all other medical plans that provide benefits for the student; only then does the student submit bills to the Student Health Plan for any remaining balance not covered by the other plans. The student must, therefore, follow all rules of his/her primary insurance in obtaining medical treatment. The student should contact the primary carrier to determine what procedure to follow. Eligibility The Student Health Plan automatically covers all full-time students at Loma Linda STUDENT LIFE 67 University in any clinical or academic program. Students are covered when enrolled for 7 units or more per quarter (or clock-hour equivalent, as defined by each school) for which Loma Linda University is receiving tuition and applicable fees (excluding load validation, \"in progress\" [IP] units, \"employee tuition benefit\" units, and \"audit\" units). Students enrolled for field practicum are eligible for coverage if registered for at least 240 hours per quarter. Coverage during clinicals/rotations Students who are accidentally injured while performing their clinical rotation duties do not have to pay their co-payment. If a covered student is doing a school-sponsored clinical or rotation out of the area and becomes ill or injured, any health service and medical care received that is covered by the Student Health Plan will still be covered as if the student were in the Loma Linda area. Effective coverage date An eligible student's coverage becomes effective on the day of orientation or the first day of class. Any purchased benefits will become effective on the day the Department of Office of Risk Management receives the health plan application and payment within the open enrollment period, which is only the first two weeks of each calendar quarter. Buy-in rules and deadlines Eligible students are themselves automatically covered by the plan; however, noneligible students-those on summer break and part-time students (e.g., in a clinical program but enrolled for fewer than 7 paid units)-may, if they wish, purchase coverage at the Department of Office of Risk Management. Those wishing to buy in may enroll in the Student Health Plan only during the first two weeks of each new calendar quarter, that is, during the first two weeks of January, April, July, and October. For further information about eligibility, the student may refer to the Student Health Plan booklet or call Department of Office of Risk Management. Buy-in rates per quarter For current quarterly buy-in rules, please contact the Department of Office of Risk Management. Student responsibility for payment Neither the Office of Student Finance nor the Department of Office of Risk Management bills the student's account or sends out reminders. Funds received for buy-in coverage must be in the form of a check or money order (payable to the Department of Office of Risk Management). Coverage exclusion for \"pre-existing\" condition If a student or patient has not maintained a continuous \"creditable coverage\" under another health plan during the twelve months prior to the coverage-effective date, the pre-existing-condition exclusion that follows will apply. This plan will not cover any medical condition, illness, or injury for which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received by the student or patient during the six months prior to the effective date of health plan coverage. This exclusion will apply for twelve months from the student's coverage-effective date, unless such an individual remains treatment free during the six-month term beginning with the effective date of coverage. If the individual remains treatment free during the six-month term, the pre-existing-condition exclusion will apply only during that six-month period. This exclusion will not apply to pregnancy-related medical expenses or to medical treatment for a newborn or adopted child. For additional information, the student may contact the Department of Office of Risk Management. Preferred-provider plan, prescriptions, annual term, benefit limits The Student Health Plan is a PPO preferred-provider plan. A list of preferred physicians and preferred medical facilities is available from the Department of Office of Risk Management. The Student Health Plan covers prescriptions when the Advance PCS prescription-benefit services card is used. At Loma Linda University (LLU) network pharmacies, the student co-pay for a 30-day supply per prescription is $15 for generic or $30 for brand name. At non-LLU Advance PCS pharmacies, the student co-pay for a 30-day supply per prescription is $25 for generic and $40 for brand name. The Student Health Plan prescription benefit is limited to $2,500 per plan year. Benefits are limited by the terms and conditions set forth in the Student Health Plan booklet. The booklet is available from the Loma Linda University Department of Office of Risk Management. For additional health plan information, phone the Department of Office of Risk Management at 909/558-4386. MALPRACTICE COVERAGE Students are covered by malpractice insurance while acting within the course and scope of any approved clinical assignment. DISABILITY INSURANCE All students in the School of Medicine and the School of Dentistry are automatically enrolled in a disability insurance program while enrolled in this University. This program provides limited disability insurance for students while in the program and also allows for conversion to an individual disability insurance policy at the time of graduation. Details of this program 68 UNIVERSITY CATALOG are available from the School of Medicine or the School of Dentistry. COUNSELING AND HEALTH SERVICES Loma Linda University (LLU) Health Care Student/Family Counseling The LLU Counseling Center offers a variety of private, confidential services to students and their families-including individual, premarital, marital, family, and group counseling.

Student Assistance Program The Loma Linda Student Assistance Program (LLSAP) provides professional and caring assessment and treatment for a variety of personal, family, work, and school-related issues. The LLSAP clinicians will develop a treatment plan that may include free short-term counseling. All LLSAP services are free of charge. If more extensive treatment is appropriate, the client is referred to a community therapist who specializes in the student's area of concern and who is covered by the student's health plan. All information is confidential. Community therapists and LLSAP clinicians will not release information without the written consent of the student, with the exception of matters that fall under mandatory reporting laws. The LLSAP, the only nationally accredited student assistance program in California, has provided state-of-the-art services to students since it was established in 1990. Appointments may be scheduled during office hours-on-campus extension, 66050; off-campus telephone, 909/558-6050: Monday through Wednesday, p.m.; Thursday, 8 a.m.-7 p.m.; Friday 8 a.m.-1 p.m. Additional appointment times may be available upon request.

GOVERNING PRACTICES At Loma Linda University, nonacademic policies have been established that help foster a fulfilling University experience. Students are expected to uphold these policies, which govern nonacademic student life on and off campus. Information in this section of the CATALOG, as well as in Section III and in the Student Handbook pertains to requirements governing all students. The student is reminded of individual responsibility to be fully informed of the general and specific requirements of his/her school and program. Identification number and card All accepted students will be assigned a unique University identification number. This seven-digit number will be used on all correspondence and noted on all payments to the University. A University identification card using this identification number and a bar code will be issued to each student after completion of their initial registration and financial clearance. The identification card allows access to various student services, including the libraries, Student Health, recreation facilities (i.e., the Drayson Center), parking, etc. Also, the bar code on the card allows currently enrolled and financially cleared students to charge against their accounts at the Campus Bookstore and campus cafeterias, and for ticket sales available through the Student Services office. In subsequent quarters, the card's bar code is automatically reactivated at each registration with financial clearance. In some cases, a second identification card is necessary for students on clinical rotation in the Loma Linda University medical centers. This card is issued by Loma Linda University's Human Resource Management office and is valid only for medical center-related activities and does not replace the student identification card. For further information regarding these identification cards, please contact Student Services. STUDENT LIFE 69 Residence hall The University is coeducational and accepts both single and married students. Any single student who prefers to live on campus may do so. Students are expected to live on campus unless they are: married, twenty-one years of age or older, in a graduate program, or living with their parents. Students who wish to live off campus but who do not meet one of the foregoing requirements may petition the associate vice chancellor for student services for an exception. This should be done well in advance of registration to allow the student adequate time to plan. Additional information about campus housing can be obtained from the housing Web site: www.llu.edu/llu/housing. The student must keep the Office of the Dean of the school informed of his or her current address and telephone number and other contact numbers. Marriage A student who marries or changes marital status during the academic year must provide the school with advance written notification of the change in status in order to keep school records correct and up to date. Students should make every effort to schedule their wedding ceremonies during academic recesses. Name change Currently enrolled students may change their names on University records when they provide evidence (e.g., certified copy of a marriage certificate) that the name change is official. In addition to filing a Request for Change of Name on University Records form with the Office of University Records, the student must present a current ID card or other form of picture ID with his or her name as it appears on University records, along with official documentation of the name change. Name changes must be processed no later than six months prior to graduation if the new name is to appear on the diploma Professional apparel Clinic and laboratory apparel are distinctive articles of dress specified by the department or school and are to be worn only in the manner prescribed and under the conditions specified in the school or department dress code. Student uniforms are to be maintained in clean, presentable condition. Information on the required professional dress is provided in section III of this CATALOG and in the University Student Handbook. Personal appearance Students in the classroom or clinical environment must exhibit personal grooming consistent with expectations of the health care institution, the profession, the school, and the University. Specific guidelines regarding grooming and attire are provided in Section III of this CATALOG and in the University Student Handbook. Personal property The School assumes no responsibility for the loss of the student's personal property, instruments, or other items by theft, fire, or unknown causes. The student is expected to assume responsibility for the safekeeping of personal belongings. Cars and transportation Because the student is responsible for transportation arrangements and costs for special projects and off-campus clinics, it is advantageous for the student to have access to a car. All vehicles used to transport fellow students to University- or school-sponsored off-campus assignments or activities must be registered with the Loma Linda University Department of Security and must have adequate public liability insurance\u2014a minimum of $100,000 bodily injury and property damage liability. The University enforces traffic rules and regulations as provided for by the State of California Vehicle Code. It is the sole responsibility of the driver of any vehicle on University property to become familiar with these regulations. Drivers are held responsible for any infraction of the regulations. Copies of the brochure entitled \"Loma Linda University Traffic and Parking Regulations\" are available at the Department of Security. Vehicles used by students on campus must be registered with the Department of Security. Returning students must go to the Department of Security annually in September to renew registration. Confidentiality The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 requires that all health care professionals maintain the highest level of confidentiality in matters pertaining to clients. Discussions or written assignments relating to client information, either health related or personal, may not include identifying data. Clients' privacy and rights are to be protected. Failure to maintain confidentiality could result in legal action. For additional information, see \"What is HIPAA\" at <http://wisdom.mc.llumc.edu/hipaa/education/ whatishipaa.htm>. Substance abuse As a practical application of its motto, \"To make man whole,\" Loma Linda University is committed to providing a learning environment conducive to the fullest possible human development. Because the University holds that a lifestyle free of alcohol, tobacco, and recreational/illegal drugs is essential for 70 UNIVERSITY CATALOG achieving this goal, it maintains policies that foster a campus environment free of these substances. All students are expected to refrain from substance abuse while enrolled at the University. Substance abuse is considered to be any use of tobacco, alcohol, and/or other recreational or illegal drugs; any use of a nonprescription mood-altering substance that impairs the appropriate functioning of the student; or any misuse of a prescription or nonprescription drug. Also, possession of an illegal drug may be cause for dismissal. The University offers counseling and other redemptive programs to assist in the recovery from substance abuse. Continuation as a student with the University will be dependent upon the abuser appropriately utilizing these programs. Failure to comply with these policies will result in discipline up to and including expulsion and, if appropriate, notification of law-enforcement agencies for prosecution. For details regarding the University's drug-free environment--as well as information regarding prevention, detection, assessment, treatment, relapse prevention, confidentiality, and discipline\u2014see the Loma Linda University Student Handbook, Section V, University Policies: Alcohol, controlled substances, and tobacco policy. Sexual harassment Sexual harassment is reprehensible and will not be tolerated by the University. It subverts the mission of the University and threatens the well-being, educational experience, and careers of students, faculty, employees, and patients. Because of the sensitive nature of situations involving sexual harassment and to assure speedy and confidential resolution of these issues, students should contact one of the school's designated, trained sexual harassment ombudspersons. A more comprehensive statement of the policy regarding \"Sexual harassment\" and \"Sexual standards policy\" can be found in the Loma Linda University Student Handbook, Section V, University Policies. Employment It is recommended that students limit work obligations (outside employment for income) that divert time, attention, and strength from the arduous tasks of class preparation, clinical practice, and/or training in their chosen career. A student wishing to work during the school year should consult the Office of the Dean regarding employment restrictions or prohibitions. Employment for international students International students must obtain written authorization from International Student and Scholar Services before accepting any on-campus employment. Off-campus employment requires prior issue of a work permit by the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. F- and J-visa students must limit their employment to twenty hours or less per week while registered for courses and while classes are in session during three of four quarters in an academic year. Regulations allow full-time work (forty hours or less per week) during school breaks and summer vacations (if students' programs allow summer quarters off). For questions, please telephone International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. ACADEMIC AUTHORITY The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all academic matters, with the exception of General Education requirements, and is charged with the interpretation and enforcement of academic requirements. Any exceptions or changes in academic requirements, graduation requirements, or grades are not valid unless approved by the dean. Any actions taken by individual faculty members with regard to these matters are advisory only and are not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY The academically dishonest act considers that academic dishonesty intentionally violates the community of trust upon which all learning is based, intentionally compromises the orderly transfer of knowledge from teacher to student, and is inconsistent with good professional and moral behavior. Accordingly, the penalty for academic dishonesty is severe. Acts of dishonesty include but are not limited to: theft; falsifying or changing grades or other academic records; plagiarism or excessive paraphrasing of someone else's work; knowingly giving, obtaining, or falsifying information during examinations or other academic or professional practice assignments; using unauthorized aids during examinations; loud and disruptive behavior during lectures, demonstrations, or examinations; excessive unexcused absences from classes or from clinical assignments \"Examinations\" are defined as regularly scheduled tests, quizzes (scheduled or unscheduled), final examinations, comprehensive assessments, take-home tests, open-book tests, and any other assignment given by an instructor or preceptor whether for STUDENT LIFE 71 a grade, points toward a grade, or for zero points (e.g., a learning exercise). Instructors and students are responsible for reporting instances of academic dishonesty for investigation. An instructor may take immediate action during an examination or other point-generating activity in order to maintain the integrity of the academic process. Substantiated violations are to be brought before the desig-nated disciplinary body for action. Disciplinary action may include receiving a failing grade on the examination or assignment, receiving a failing grade in the course, suspension, or permanent dismissal from the program. CONDUCT Students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner during didactic and clinical training. Professional conduct includes (but is not limited to) punctuality; and respect for other people, their property, and their right to learn. It also includes an appropriate respect for those in authority. Students of Loma Linda University are expected to behave in a manner that will not bring criticism upon themselves, the program, the school, or the University. Because students may be exposed to patients' relatives and friends in any public place, and because their conversations and their attitudes have an effect on those around them, students are asked to observe the following: Any information given to the student by a patient or contained in a medical record must be held in strict confidence. Therefore, the discussion of a patient's diagnosis and treatment and other clinically related topics should be extremely guarded. A patient's family and community people may be listening and may incorrectly interpret the things discussed. Careless talk may lead to malpractice litigation. A joking or casual attitude toward illness and medical treatment should not be displayed since it may seem uncaring and be disturbing to those who are ill and suffering, as well as to the family members. Student and staff behavior in professional situations may be the deciding influence for or against Christian beliefs, values, and a health-enhancing lifestyle. An in-depth description of the professional conduct expected of students is contained in the Loma Linda University Student Handbook. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE Grievances related to sexual harassment, racial harassment, or discrimination against the disabled shall be pursued in accordance with University policies specifically relating to these items. Grievances related to academic matters or other issues covered by specific policies shall be made pursuant to the policies of the school in which the student is enrolled. A student who questions whether the process provided by the school has followed the policy of the school in regard to his/her grievance may request the office of the chancellor to conduct a review of the process used by the school in responding to his/her academic grievance. Students who believe that an error has been made or that he/she has been dealt with in an inappropriate manner by an office or non-academic department of the University such as records, student finance, student affairs, health services, Drayson Center, etc., may seek correction by the following steps: 1. The student may put his/her complaint in writing and provide it to the head of the department or office involved. The student may request an appointment and discuss this matter with the department head. The department head will make a decision and provide a written answer to the student within 14 days of receiving the student's written complaint or meeting with the student, whichever is later. If the answer is not satisfactory to the student, he/she may: 2. Put the complaint in writing and send it to the dean of student affairs for review. The matter will be considered at the next meeting of the dean's council and the student will be informed in writing of the council's response within seven days of the council's consideration of the complaint.

In this section (Section II) are the University regulations. See Section III for regulations that pertain to each school. REGISTRATION Registration Registration dates are published on the Web at www.llu.edu/registration. Posted deadlines for registration and change of registration are in effect and binding. The school will not intercede to obtain a variance. After consultation with their academic adviser, students register online. Registration procedure includes entering classes online, clearing financial arrangements with the Office of Student Finance, and having a student identification picture taken for the ID card first-quarter registration only). Students are advised to print the Request for Clearance Submitted Web page to retain written documentation that they have requested financial clearance. A late-registration period of at least a week prior to the beginning of the quarter and extending to five days after the quarter begins is provided, during which a late-registration fee of $50 will be charged. (Always check the Web for specific dates of registration, since they vary during some quarters due to holiday schedules.) Students may not attend class without being registered, and in no case may registration take place later than the seventh calendar day of a term unless the course is offered as an intensive that requires registration before the end of the first day of class. No credit is granted for academic work performed during any quarter without registration. Change in registration A change in registration requires filing a Registration Change Request (Add/Drop) form with the Office of University Records. Students receive written verification each time a change of program is officially approved. Students are advised to retain this written verification as documentation of their registration. Changes in registration after the second week affect the student's grade record. Course changes A student may add courses that follow the general University calendar during the first seven calendar days of the quarter. Courses that follow the general University calendar may be dropped during the first fourteen days of the quarter without academic or financial penalty. Course changes after the fourteenth day of the quarter affect the permanent grade record. A Change of Program form must be filed. Students may withdraw from a course prior to the fourteen calendar days before the final examination week, after which time withdrawals are no longer permitted. Study load Usually an academic study load is defined in terms of credit units. A full undergraduate load is considered to be 12 or more units per quarter; a full graduate load is considered to be 8 units per quarter. Professional programs, however, require considerable clinical experience, for which only partial academic credit is given at times. Consequently, a full study load often is not reflected by the number of academic credit units carried. To be considered a full-time student, an undergraduate student must be registered for at least 12 units of course work per quarter; and a graduate student must be registered for at least 8 units. A registration of 400 clock hours per quarter is also considered to be full time for any student. This is based on forty hours per week for a ten-week quarter. The normal course load, including all course work for which a student may be registered at this or another institution, is 16 quarter units for an undergraduate student and 12 quarter units for a graduate student. Full-time study loads are those specified by the departments for each program. Students of exceptional ability may register for additional course work upon recommendation of the department and consent of the dean. Non-LLU courses as part of total load for financial aid Regular courses for which a student is registered at another financial-aid eligible institution constitute part of the student's study load. Courses must be transferable and required for completion of the student's Loma Linda University degree program. Correspondence and independent study courses are excluded, per federal-aid regulations. Only when the student enrolls in such courses using the Consortium Agreement form (from the Office of Financial Aid) will the course(s) count on the student's total load as ACADEMIC POLICIES AND INFORMATION 73 eligible for financial-aid and loan-deferment purposes. A person who is not enrolled in regular classes but who is occupied in research, dissertation, or thesis, is classified as a student. By filing an Academic Load Validation form every quarter at registration, the academic load may be validated for loan-deferment. BACKGROUND CHECKS Some clinical affiliation sites require background checks for all incoming students; these checks must be completed no later than two weeks prior to clinical placement. The student will be responsible for obtaining the background checks, including the cost. The following elements must be covered by the check, at a minimum: past 7 years, 3 counties, Office of Inspector General (OIG), Social Security number, other names (maiden, married, etc.), addresses, and sex offender database. STUDENT LEVEL Students enrolled in a professional program in which they are classified as freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior will be classified according to the level of the course work they are taking (e.g., a student with a previous baccalaureate degree pursuing another baccalaureate degree would be classified as a sophomore while taking sophomore-level courses, etc.). Students enrolled in block programs are classified according to the level of the block in which they are enrolled (e.g., master's-1st, 2nd, or 3rd year; or freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, as is appropriate for the degree program; or PY1 [professional year 1]). clinical; 901-999, continuing education \u0000 without academic credit. 500-level course work may not apply toward a baccalaureate degree unless the instructor approves it, and both deans (dean of the school offering the course and dean of the school in which the student is enrolled) give permission; and provided the credit does not apply toward both an undergraduate and a graduate degree. Approval is not needed if the course is part of a coordinated program. No courses numbered in the 700s, 800s, or 900s may apply toward a baccalaureate degree. UNIT OF CREDIT Credit is recorded in quarter units. One unit represents 10-11 class hours in lecture or 30-40 hours in laboratory practice. ATTENDANCE Regular attendance at all appointments (class, clinic, laboratory, chapel) is required beginning with the first day of each term. A pattern of absence, excused and unexcused, will be referred to the school's designated academic authority for consideration and action. Excused absences are defined as follows: Illness, verified by a physician's statement or official statement from Student Health Service submitted to the school's designated academic authority; Participation in an institution-sponsored activity (verified by a written statement from a faculty sponsor); Recognizable emergency approved by the school's designated academic authority. Tardiness is disruptive, distracting, and inconsistent with professional behavior. Students who arrive after the beginning of class may be counted absent. Information regarding the school's designated academic authority can be obtained from the Office of the Dean. CLEP The College Level Examination Program (CLEP), a national program of credit by examination, offers persons of all ages and backgrounds new opportunities to obtain recognition for college-level achievement, no matter how acquired. As of July 2001, general examinations are no longer offered; however, the policy remains in effect for students who took general examinations prior to that date. No credit is granted for the CLEP general examinations in English composition, mathematics, or science courses requiring a laboratory. As of July 1, 2004, in order to receive Loma Linda University credit, students must complete all examinations for CLEP credit within six months after having received their initial degree-compliance report. A student will be allowed to challenge a given course by examination only once. CLEP scores will be accepted at C or better until percentiles are available from CLEP. Credit is granted for scores at or above the 50th percentile for the subject examinations, and at the 65th 74 UNIVERSITY CATALOG percentile for general examinations in the humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences/history. CREDIT BY EXAMINATION For certain courses offered by the University, a student in an undergraduate degree program may earn credit by passing an equivalency examination administered by the appropriate school and department. Such an examination is at least equal in scope and difficulty to a final examination in the course and may include materials supplied by CLEP or other agencies. A graduate program should be used to acquire new knowledge. Since the purpose of credit by examination is to validate prior knowledge, graduate credit may not be earned by examination. If a required course in the degree program is a repeat of prior learning, the student may request a waiver, thus making it possible to take elective courses that would increase knowledge. A student currently enrolled in a degree program at this University who desires credit by equivalency examination petitions the dean of the school offering the course, and, upon approval, pays a testing fee. See Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section for examination fee. Equivalency examinations may not duplicate credit already earned through course work, including courses taken for audit. A grade of CR (Credit) is given only after the student has completed one quarter, or the equivalent, at this University; and has earned 12 units of credit with a grade-point average of at least 2.0 in undergraduate courses. Units earned by equivalency may not be used as part of the enrolled load. Equivalency examinations must be taken before the final quarter of residency. The maximum amount of credit that may be earned by equivalency examination is determined by each school but may not exceed a maximum of 20 percent of the units required for the degree or certificate. COURSE WAIVER Certain course requirements in a program may be waived on the basis of previously completed course work, experience, or licensure. An examination for waiver credit, if required, may be taken only once and must be taken before the last quarter of the program of study. Waiver of a specific course requirement does not reduce the number of units required for a program or residency requirements. A waiver examination does not carry academic credit and cannot be used to make up for a course in which an unsatisfactory grade was received. For examination fee, see Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section. Permission to waive a course requirement in the School of Pharmacy requires prior approval of the department chair and consent of the dean. INDEPENDENT STUDY Independent study may be undertaken subject to the consent of the department chair and/or the Office of the Dean. The student is responsible for completion of the Directed/Independent Study Title Request form in addition to the regular registration. University policy limits directed study to 12 quarter units of undergraduate credit and 8 units of graduate credit in a degree program. Individual programs may further limit these units. The Office of the Dean should be consulted regarding limits on credit earned through independent study. Independent study is to be completed in adequate time before graduation to allow recording in the Office of University Records. CORRESPONDENCE COURSE As a general rule, the student may not register for a correspondence course that duplicates a course offered at this University. (The School of Nursing makes exceptions when a religion or cognate course conflicts with a clinical course; or when scheduling prevents a student from completing a religion or cognate course during the summer in order to reduce the course load during the regular school year.) If the student is a candidate for graduation, the course must be completed no later than one month before graduation. Information and application for Griggs University Home Study International (the Seventh-day Adventist correspondence school) in Washington, DC, may be obtained from the Web at <www.griggs.edu>. In the School of Pharmacy, permission to take a correspondence course for credit requires both prior approval of the department chair and consent of the dean. EXTENSION STUDY To be acceptable for credit, an extension course must be evaluated as to its equivalence to an accepted course. To assure that the course will transfer to Loma Linda University, the student should contact the Office of University Records prior to taking the course. Registration for extension study requires prior approval of the department chair and consent of the dean. SCHOLASTIC STANDING Grades and grade points The following grades and grade points are used in this University. Each course taught in ACADEMIC POLICIES AND INFORMATION 75 the schools has been approved for either a letter grade and/or an S/U grade. A 4.0 Outstanding performance. A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 Very good performance for undergraduate credit; Satisfactory performance for graduate credit. B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C 2.0 Satisfactory performance For undergraduate credit. Minimum performance for which credit is granted toward a degree in the School of Public Health, the School of Nursing, or the School of Allied Health Professions. C- 1.7 Minimum performance for which credit is granted toward a degree in the School of Dentistry, School of Pharmacy, or School of Health. D+ 1.3 D 1.0 Minimum performance for which undergraduate credit is granted except as indicated above. F 0.0 Failure\u2014given for not meeting minimum Performance. S none Satisfactory performance counted toward graduation. Equivalent to a C grade or better in undergraduate courses, or a B grade or better in graduate courses. An S grade is not computed in the grade-point average. A student may request a grade of S in only a limited amount of course work as determined by the school. This is done by the student's filing with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to fourteen calendar days before the final examination week. Once filed, the grade is not subject to change. U none Unsatisfactory performance\u2014given only when performance for an S-specified course falls below a C grade level in an undergraduate course or a B grade level in a graduate course. Similar filing procedures as given for S grade above are required. The U grade is not computed in the grade-point average. S/N none Satisfactory performance in a clock-hour course. Not included in total units. Same grading criteria as the S grade given for a credit-hour course. U/N none Unsatisfactory performance in a clock-hour course. Not included in total units. Same grading criteria as the U grade given for a credit-hour course. CR none Credit for Credit by Examination. Counted toward graduation/units earned but not units attempted. Such credit cannot be counted for financial aid purposes. NC none No credit for Credit by Examination. Does not count for any purpose. Notations W Withdrawal\u2014given for withdrawal from a course prior to fourteen calendar days before the final examination week. Withdrawals during the first fourteen calendar days of a quarter or the first seven calendar days of a five-week summer session are not recorded if the student files with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to the cut-off date. Withdrawals outside this time frame, upon recommendation of the dean, may be removed at the discretion of the vice-chancellor for academic affairs. In the case of nontraditionally scheduled courses, W will be given for withdrawal from a course prior to completion of 80 percent of the course, excluding the final examination period. Withdrawals during the first 20 percent of a course, excluding the final examination period, are not recorded if the student files with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to the date when this 20 percent of the course is completed. A student may withdraw only once from a named cognate course that (s)he is failing at the time of withdrawal. UW Unofficial Withdrawal\u2014indicates that the student discontinued class attendance after the close of registration but failed to withdraw officially. I Incomplete\u2014given when the majority of the course work has been completed and circumstances beyond a student's control result in the student being unable to complete the quarter. An I notation may be changed to a grade 76 UNIVERSITY CATALOG only by the instructor before the end of the following term (excluding the summer sessions for those not in attendance during that term). Incomplete units are not calculated in the grade-point average. By use of the petition form\u2014available online at <www.llu.edu/ssweb/registration> \u2014the student requests an I notation from the instructor, stating the reason for the request and obtaining the signatures of the instructor, the department chair, and the associate dean. The form is left with the instructor. The instructor reports the I notation on the grade-report form, as well as the grade the student will receive if the deficiency is not removed within the time limit. The petition form is then filed with the Office of University Records along with the grade-report form. The notation I is not granted as a remedy for overload, failure on final examination, absence from final examination for other than an emergency situation, or a low grade to be raised with extra work. IP In Progress\u2014indicates that the course has a duration of more than a single term and will be completed by the student no later than the final term of the course, not to exceed five quarters for independent study and research courses (original quarter of registration plus four additional quarters). The student's final grade will be reported on the instructor's grade report at the end of the term in which the course is completed. If the course work is not completed within the five-quarter time limit, a grade of U will be given. AU Audit\u2014indicates registration for attendance only, with 80 percent class attendance considered a requirement. A request to change a credit course to audit or an audit course to credit may be made no later than the fourteenth calendar day after the beginning of a quarter, or the seventh calendar day after the beginning of the five-week summer session. (This does not apply to short summer courses lasting only a week or two.) AUW Audit Withdrawal\u2014given for withdrawing from a course, or to indicate that the 80 percent class attendance requirement was not observed. ACADEMIC STANDING The following classifications are based on scholastic performance, as defined by each school within the University: regular standing or academic probation. VETERANS BENEFITS Under Title 38 of the U. S. Code, Loma Linda University is approved for the training of veterans and other eligible persons. Information regarding eligibility for these programs may be obtained by calling 888/GIBILL1 or 888/442-4551. Application for benefits must be made directly to the Veterans Administration (VA) and may be done via the Web. The Office of University Records serves as the certifying official for Loma Linda University. Students should contact the certifying official prior to their first enrollment certification. Students receiving veteran's benefits who fail for three consecutive quarters to maintain the cumulative grade-point average (G.P.A.) required for graduation will have their benefits interrupted, and the VA office will be notified. School of Medicine students must maintain satisfactory grades for all required courses for the year in which they are currently enrolled. If a grade in a required course reflects unsatisfactory progress, the School of Medicine student will not be certified until his/her probationary status (usually one year) has been removed. For more information, open links to the VA Web site (\"Students\" or \"Prospective Students\") on the University home Web page at <http://www.llu.edu>. PRIVACY RIGHTS OF STUDENTS IN ACADEMIC RECORDS Under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), students have full rights of privacy with regard to their academic records, including their grade reports. Grades are available to the student online at www.llu.edu/ssweb. The Office of University Records sends one copy of the student grade report to the school. The campus is authorized under FERPA to release \"directory information\" concerning students. Such information may include a student's picture, name, telephone listing, month and day of birth, and major field of study. This information is subject to release at any time unless the campus has received prior written request from the student that such information not be released. GRADE CHANGE Faculty members are responsible for evaluating and assigning grades. A grade may not be changed except when an error has been made in arriving at or recording a grade. Such ACADEMIC POLICIES AND INFORMATION 77 changes are permissible up to the end of the succeeding term. The faculty member must obtain the dean's signature on the Change of Grade form after the initial grade has been entered. REPEATING A COURSE A student wishing to improve his/her grade once grades have been posted for a course must repeat the course. When repeating a course, the student must attend class and laboratory sessions as ordinarily required and take all regularly scheduled examinations. The amount of tuition paid for repeated courses is determined by the school. Both the original and the repeat grades will appear on the student's permanent record, but only the repeat grade is computed in the G.P.A. and included in the total units earned. A student may repeat a course only once, and no more than two courses may be repeated in a student's degree program. PERSONAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE A leave of absence, which may be as short as one day but no longer than one year, is defined as being away from school for obligations other than personal health, which may or may not be school sponsored. The appropriate personal-leave-of-absence form must be obtained from the University Web site and approved by the dean or his/her designee prior to the student's departure. Stipulations for re-entry are given to the student in writing. The student should consult the Office of the Dean regarding the possibility of maintaining health coverage and continuous registration during the leave period. WITHDRAWAL To withdraw from a course(s), the student must complete a Change of Program form. If a student finds it necessary to withdraw from a degree or certificate program, the dean (or his/her designee) must be notified in writing. The student then arranges for formal withdrawal from the program by filing a Program Withdrawal form in the Office of University Records. The Change of Program form or the Program Withdrawal form should be completed and submitted on the last day of class attendance. Courses dropped during the first two weeks of the term are not included in the student's permanent record. If a student is discontinuing the entire program, the date the Program Withdrawal form is properly submitted to the Office of University Records will be the date of withdrawal used to calculate tuition refunds. Tuition is refunded according to the practice outlined in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG. Failure to file the Program Withdrawal form may result in avoidable charges to the student's account. The tuition-refund policy for off-campus students is listed under the applicable school in Section III of this CATALOG. ADMINISTRATIVE WITHDRAWAL Students who fail to make arrangements for a leave of absence and continuing registration may be administratively withdrawn from school. Information regarding the period of inactivity allowed prior to administrative withdrawal can be obtained from the Office of the Dean. FACILITATING THE TRANSFER OF CURRENTLY REGISTERED LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY STUDENTS The following steps apply to processing an application for a registered student: 1. The student submits application (online or paper) to a new program that is not part of a joint/combined-degree arrangement. 2. The Office of University Records prominently flags the transcript as being from a currently registered student. 3. The flagged University transcript is forwarded to new program for evaluation. 4. The new program contacts a designated person in the home school/program to obtain relevant information about the student without revealing that an application is under consideration. 5. If the new program decides to accept the student, the acceptance letter instructs the student to take one of the following actions- Send a letter/deposit accepting the offer of admission and process a Total Withdrawal form or a Leave of Absence form for the program (s)he is leaving, or Decline the offer of admission. 6. The home program has an opportunity to speak with the student when (s)he attempts to get an adviser's signature on the Total Withdrawal form. 7. The Office of University Records updates the student's program in Banner upon the Total Withdrawal and acceptance into the new program. ACADEMIC RESIDENCE A student must meet the residence requirements indicated for a particular degree or certificate. 78 UNIVERSITY CATALOG CATALOG IN EFFECT FOR DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Subject to department approval, students may complete degree requirements outlined in any CATALOG in effect during the time they are enrolled as accepted students in a school. However, students who have been on leave of absence for more than one year, or who failed to register without leave of absence (consult Office of the Dean regarding number of quarters) may be required to re-enter the program under the CATALOG in effect at the time of re-entry, with the exception of students who are on leave from a school to pursue a medical or dental degree at this University. Such students may complete their program under their original CATALOG. GRADUATION The responsibility for meeting graduation requirements rests primarily upon the student. Therefore, students should read and understand the requirements as set forth in this CATALOG and consult carefully with their adviser to plan a sequence of courses each term that fulfills these requirements. A student's program of study is governed by the requirements listed in the University CATALOG at the time of admission; however, when circumstances demand, the University reserves the right to make changes with reference to admission, registration, tuition and fees, attendance, curriculum requirements, conduct, academic standing, candidacy, and graduation. The undergraduate who plans to graduate must submit an \"Undergraduate Intent to Graduate\" form two quarters prior to graduation. The form is available online at <www.llu.edu/ssweb/forms/intgrad.pdf>. COMMENCEMENT EXERCISES The candidate completing requirements in the Spring Quarter is expected to be present at the commencement exercises and receive the diploma in person. Permission for the degree to be conferred in absentia is contingent upon the recommendation of the dean to the chancellor and can be granted only by the chancellor. If a candidate has not satisfactorily fulfilled all requirements, the University reserves the right to prohibit participation in commencement exercises. DIPLOMAS All diplomas issued to graduates list the degree only. No official diploma is awarded that identifies a specific area of specialization. FINANCIAL POLICIES AND INFORMATION 79 Financial Policies and Information The student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year. Accounts with other schools or with this University must have been settled. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees for each term are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration periods for each academic year. Tuition and fees may vary from amounts shown. STUDENT FEES Beginning Summer Quarter of 2005, students attending this University will be charged an enrollment fee, based on the criteria indicated below. In the past this fee was included in the total tuition charge. Neither the fee in total nor any portion of the fee will be waived under any circumstances. Other school-specific charges\u2014such as technology fees, laboratory fees, etc.\u2014may also appear on the student account. The following criteria govern the enrollment fee: 1. Students who are accepted into a degree program and registered for more than 0 units will be charged the enrollment fee, regardless of the number of units for which they are registered. 2. Students who are not accepted into a degree program but who are registered as nondegree students for more than 4 units will be charged the enrollment fee. 3. Students who are working on \"In Progress\" courses and who are not registered for any other units will be charged the enrollment fee. 4. A student who is charged the enrollment fee but who drops all units before the deadline for a full refund (generally one week after the first day of classes), will receive a full refund of the enrollment fee and will have no access to any University benefits. Please refer to the Student Finance 100 percent refund policy. 5. LLUAHSC employees who are \"full time benefit eligible\" will not be charged the enrollment fee, whether they are using their education benefit or not. Spouses of employees who are using the employee benefit will be charged the enrollment fee. 6. Students participating in an off-campus or online program will not be charged the enrollment fee unless the program specifically requires this fee. 7. Other school-specific fees will be charged independent of the enrollment fee. Note: The student enrollment fee includes health coverage. GENERAL PRACTICES Advance payments/refunds For students whose student loans are pending at the time of registration-loans were not applied for at least 30 days prior to registration-a $50.00 late-payment fee will be charged. Tuition and fees are due and payable in full before or at registration each term. If a student withdraws from a per-unit course or all courses in a block or nonblock registration up to 60 percent into a term, tuition will be refunded on a pro-rata basis. Students who drop a course from a block program of courses receive no refund. Monthly statement The amount of the monthly statement is due and payable in full within thirty days after presentation of the statement. A student unable to meet this requirement must make proper arrangements with the director of student finance. An account that is more than thirty days past due is subject to a finance charge of .833 percent per month (10 percent per year). Failure to pay scheduled charges or to make proper arrangements will be reported to the respective school and may cause the student to be considered absent, discontinued, or ineligible to take final examinations. 80 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Financial clearance The student is expected to keep a clear financial status at all times. Financial clearance must be obtained\u2014 each term in order to complete registration; before receiving a certificate or diploma; before requesting a transcript, statement of completion, or other certification to be issued to any person, organization, or professional board. To obtain financial clearance from the Student Loan Collections Office, the student must be current on all scheduled loan-account payments and must have fully completed a loan exit interview, after ceasing to be enrolled for at least half time at this University. If the student's loan accounts are not current, or an exit interview has not been fully completed, a hold will be placed by the Student Loan Collection Office on transcript, diploma, or degree verification; and P1E requests and other services may be denied. Please note that all student loans are reported to a credit bureau organization on a monthly basis. If a student fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the promissory note, the Student Loan Collection Office will accelerate the loan(s) and will place the student loan(s) in collection with an outside agency and will demand immediate payment of the entire unpaid balance\u2014including principal, interest, late fees, other fees, collection costs, attorney costs, and legal costs. Checks Checks should be made payable to Loma Linda University and should indicate the student's ID number to ensure that the correct account is credited. In case a check is returned, there will be a $25.00 returned-check fee assessed. DEPOSITS Acceptance deposit Upon notification of acceptance, the student makes the required deposit (see school or program for specific deposit amount). This amount is deducted from the tuition and fees due at registration Room and key Residence hall room and key deposits for Daniells Complex and for Lindsay Hall are forfeited after August 15 if occupancy does not follow for the Autumn Quarter. At the close of the term of residence, both the room deposit and the key deposit are refunded after the dean's inspection and clearance and the student's return of the key. HOUSING If a student is interested in on-campus/ residential housing, application may be made online at www.llu.edu/llu/housing. INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS International students must be prepared to provide an advance deposit, as required by the University; and must provide documentation that additional funds will be forthcoming to meet school expenses. The deposit will be held by the University during the program of study and will be applied to the last quarter's tuition charge. Alternatively, the deposit may be refunded, less any outstanding balance on the account, if the student is denied a visa or chooses to drop the program. Scholarships and assistantships for international students are scarce, and employment is limited for F- and J-visa students to no more than twenty hours per week. Unless special permission is given by immigration authorities, international students are restricted to employment on campus. HEALTH SERVICE A student registered for more than 4 units per quarter or enrolled in a certificate or degree program is automatically covered by the Student Health Plan provisions. A student enrolled for fewer than 4 units may request and pay for health-plan coverage. For further information, see the Student Health Plan in the Student Life section of this CATALOG. STUDENT AID The University participates in grant, scholarship, and loan programs. Financial assistance is available to students from University and government loan funds and other special trust funds. A needs-analysis system approved by the federal government is used to evaluate the need for financial aid. A parental contribution factor is considered for dependent students. It is necessary for students who are seeking financial assistance to file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as soon as possible for the current academic year. Loans Loans are available both to undergraduate and graduate students who are eligible to participate in government loan programs. Loans are restricted to citizens of the United States and certain eligible non-citizens. Certain funds are interest free while a student is enrolled at least half time. Inquiries about loans should be made to the Office of Financial Aid.

EVALUATION OF MISSION AND GOALS \u2014PORTFOLIO-DEVELOPMENT PRACTICUM Portfolio is a tool by which students develop and personally achieve goals established by the School of Allied Health Professions. The School of Allied Health Professions conducts an evaluation program that includes courses, validation of writing, and standardized measures related to wholeness. The evaluation courses\u2014Portfolio Practicums I and II and Graduate Portfolio\u2014are intended to be a means of integrating the wholeness concept into the lives of the students and of assessing the outcome of their educational process. The portfolio faculty and staff assist students in understanding and modeling the mission of Loma Linda University and the School of Allied Health Professions. Each portfolio practicum is in progress for three-to-four quarters, during which time the student is developing a portfolio based on the fifteen goals of the school (see above, Mission and Goals). The final portfolio provides the student with an organized, goal-driven documentation of growth and achieved competence of abilities in a personal and professional realm of skills. An Associate in Science degree program student completes the one-year Portfolio Practicum; all other undergraduate students complete Portfolio Practicums I and II over a two-year period; each graduate student completes a graduate portfolio. General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school. The subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs are outlined in Section IV. It is important to review specific program requirements (Section IV) in the context of the general requirements (Section III) applicable to all programs. ADMISSIONS POLICIES AND INFORMATION The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committees of the school accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant qualities of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. In selecting students, the Admissions Committee of the School of Allied Health Professions looks for evidence of self-discipline, personal integrity, and intellectual vigor. The committee also looks for evidence that students possess the capabilities required to complete the full curriculum in the allotted time and to achieve the levels of competence required. Acceptance of the applicant into any program is contingent on the recommendation of the department conducting the program. An interview with faculty is required by most programs. Loma Linda University was established to provide education in a distinctively Christian environment, and its students are expected to adopt Christian ethical and moral standards as a basis for their conduct. It must be understood further that, in harmony with the University's emphasis on health and the health professions and the practices of the supporting church, applicants who use tobacco, alcoholic beverages, or narcotics should not expect to be admitted. Loma Linda University is committed to equal opportunity and does not discriminate against qualified persons on the basis of handicap, gender, race, color, or national or ethnic origin in its educational and admissions policies, financial affairs, employment programs, student life and services, or any University-administered program. It does, however, retain the right to give preference in student admissions to qualified Seventh-day Adventist applicants. While this right is retained, it should be emphasized that admissions are not limited exclusively to Seventh-day Adventist applicants. 90 UNIVERSITY CATALOG APPLICATION AND ACCEPTANCE Where to write Correspondence about admission to all programs and requests for application information should be addressed to: Office of Admissions and Records School of Allied Health Professions Loma Linda University Loma Linda, CA 92350 Applications are available on line at <http://www.llu.edu>.

Exceptions are noted in the respective programs of this CATALOG in Section IV. Late applications are considered as long as space is available. Notifications generally are sent between January 1 and May 15, depending on the completeness of information provided and the date of application. Applicants should inquire at the Office of Admissions and Records if notice of action is not received by April 15 for occupational therapy and physical therapy, and by May 15 for other programs. Application review process All completed applications are first reviewed by the department chair and faculty. A recommenda-tion on each application is then submitted to the School's Admissions Committee, which makes the final decision regarding acceptance. Procedure The procedure for application and acceptance is given below. All correspondence and documents are to be sent to the Office of Admissions and Records, School of Allied Health Professions, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA 92350. 1. File the complete application form (including recommendations, if received), accompanied by the $60 application fee. 2. Request that transcripts of all college course work be sent to the School. High school transcripts are required of all applicants in order to verify graduation and completion of high school mathematics. 3. Upon receipt of the notice of acceptance, return the required deposit and the card provided to confirm acceptance. 4. Provide health records or certificates, as required. Applicant's records The application and all records submitted in support of the application become the property of the University. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Subject/diploma requirements High school and college subject requirements for each program are outlined in the respective programs of this CATALOG Section IV. Students are required to furnish evidence of completion (official transcript) of high school in order to be granted admission to undergraduate programs in schools of the University. A high school diploma or its equivalent, the GED, is required. Grade requirement Eligibility for consideration by the Admissions Committee is based on a grade-point average of at least 2.0 (on a 4.0 scale) for all course work (science and nonscience subjects computed separately) presented in fulfillment of entrance requirements for all programs in the school. A grade-point average considerably higher than the minimum is expected because of the nature of the studies in many professional programs and the competition for the limited number of openings. In general, grade-point averages between 2.5 and 3.0 are considered minimal, depending on the program. A minimum grade of C (2.0) is required for all college transfer courses. Transcripts Transcripts (the documents by which institutions officially convey the grades and credits earned in specific subjects and the stage of completion of curriculum requirements) are accepted only when sent directly to the University by the issuing institution. Transcripts received by the University become the property of the University and will not be released to the student or forwarded to any other institution upon request of the student. Academic probation Students whose cumulative G.P.A. at the end of any quarter is less than than the minimum required by the school or program will be placed on academic probation, and the number of units for subsequent registrations will be restricted to a maximum determined by the school of program. A student on academic probation jeopardizes his or her standing in a degree or certificate program. Student Life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The most current Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook. Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS Personal grooming Good taste indicates that haircuts, hairstyling, and personal grooming be neat, and conservative rather than ostentatious. Grooming and style should also be practical, so that the student can perform assigned duties without embarrassment or inconvenience. Specifically: Men's hair must be neatly trimmed and not fall below the collar. Ponytails, spikes, and dreadlocks are not acceptable. SCHOOL OF ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS 91 Mustaches and beards, if worn, must be neat and closely trimmed. Women's hair, if long, may be required to be tied back. Spikes and dreadlocks are not acceptable. The wearing of hats indoors is not acceptable.

Rings or ornaments in other anatomical sites are not acceptable. Fingernails should be maintained in a professional manner, closely trimmed, and should not interfere with patient safety and comfort during treatments. Nail polish, if worn, should be of a subdued color. Academic Policies and Information Students are responsible for informing themselves of the policies and regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation; and for satisfactorily meeting these requirements. ACADEMIC RESIDENCE In order to graduate from Loma Linda University with a bachelor's degree, a student must complete at least 32 of the last 48 units, or a minimum of 45 total units of course work, at this University. A minimum grade of C (2.0) or better is required for all B.S. and postbaccalaureate degrees. SCHOLASTIC STANDING Repeating a course A student who receives an unsatisfactory grade in a required course and is required by the faculty to do additional work may request permission of the faculty to pursue one of the following plans. In either plan the student must register and pay the applicable tuition. 1. Review the course work under supervision and take a make-up examination (usually not given before a minimum of two weeks of study). A passing grade resulting from a repeat examination will be limited to a C (2.0). (See the Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG for the tuition rate for tutorial course work.) 2. Repeat the course, attend class and/or laboratory, and take the final course examination. Full tuition will be charged whether regular or occasional attendance is required. (See the Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG for the tuition rate.) A student who receives an unsatisfactory grade in a required clinical-experience course and is required by the faculty to do additional work must reregister and pay the applicable fee. (See the Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG for the fee for repeat of clinical experience.) Both the original and repeat grades are entered in the student's permanent academic record, but only the repeat grade is computed in the grade-point average. A course may be repeated only one time. Promotion and probation Each student's record is reviewed quarterly by the faculty. Promotion is contingent on satisfactory academic and professional performance and on factors related to aptitude, proficiency, and responsiveness to the established aims of the school and of the profession. As an indication of satisfactory academic performance, the student is expected to maintain the following grade-point average: 2.0 Associate and baccalaureate degree programs 2.5 Master's degree program 3.0 Doctoral degree program A student whose grade-point average in any term falls below the minimum required for the degree, or who receives in any professional or required course a grade less than a C (2.0), or whose clinical performance is unsatisfactory is automatically placed on academic probation. Continued enrollment is subject to the recommendation of the department. If continued enrollment is not recommended, the case is referred to the Administrative Council of the school for final action. If continued enrollment is recommended, the student will be required to institute a learning assistance plan within the first two weeks of the following quarter and meet regularly scheduled appointments with the academic adviser. The learning assistance plan should: identify the problem, identify and list the goals, state the time frame, and include student and adviser signatures and date. A student who is on academic probation and fails to make the minimum required grade-point average the following quarter or fails to have an overall minimum grade-point average after two quarters will have disqualified him-/herself from the program. Standard of student progress (time framework) After initial enrollment in a program, students must complete program requirements within the following time frames: A.S. degree 3 years B.S. degree 5 years Master's degree 5 years Doctoral degree 7 years 92 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Allied Health Studies The Department of Allied Health Studies provides a variety of administrative and support services to the school's academic departments, including: development, marketing, admissions, computer support and training, portfolio, and financial services.

School Foundations HISTORY A small but determined group of dentists met during the summer of 1943 in Grand Ledge, Michigan. Their purpose was to form an organization that would serve as a catalyst, urging the Seventh-day Adventist Church to sponsor a dental school where young adults could learn the dental profession in an environment consistent with their religious beliefs. These men were the founders of the National Association of Seventh-day Adventist Dentists (NASDAD). Under the leadership of Dr. J. Russell Mitchell, the organization's first president, the goal of a Christian dental school began taking conceptual form. NASDAD expanded in membership and objectives through men such as Dr. C. C. Ray, who toured the country on his own time in search of fellow Seventh-day Adventist dentists who were willing to pursue NASDAD's goals. Dr. M. Webster Prince served as president of NASDAD in 1948 and 1949. At a meeting in San Francisco in 1949, NASDAD members voted unanimously to support the dental school project. Later that year at a NASDAD session in Hinsdale, Illinois, the members pledged a strong financial base in support of their goals. The momentum of the effort became evident in the early 1950s. The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, under the guidance of President W. H. Branson, asked Dr. Prince to conduct a feasibility study. Official action was taken in 1951 to authorize establishment of the School of Dentistry as a unit of Loma Linda University's School of Medicine. Dr. Prince was selected as the first dean of the School of Dentistry. His leadership in organizing and eventually administering the new School of Dentistry was facilitated by his prior experience as president of the Michigan Dental Association and as chair of the American Dental Association Council on Dental Education. Forty-two students comprised the inaugural class in the late fall of 1953. A dental hygiene curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science degree was developed in 1959 under the direction of Dr. Gerald A. Mitchell, chair of the Department of Periodontics. Violet Bates became chair of the new department, and the first class of ten dental hygienists graduated in 1961. In 1960 Dr. Charles T. Smith became dean. During this period the school experienced positive growth in many areas. A dental assisting curriculum was developed in 1968 under the leadership of Betty Zendner. The first class graduated in 1969, receiving the Associate in Science degree. A dental auxiliary utilization (DAU) program was initiated to provide enhanced learning for dental students. The Monument Valley Dental Clinic for Navajo Indians was started in 1966, and Dean Smith succeeded in finding from public sources fiscal support for the clinic building and for faculty housing. New advanced-education (postdoctoral) programs were initiated in five clinical disciplines: orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics, and oral pathology. SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY 105 During the 1970s the School of Dentistry continued its evolution into one of the premier clinical programs in the United States. Dr. Judson Klooster became dean in 1971. One of his major contributions was the expansion of Prince Hall, which was completed in May 1976. The new building more than doubled the number of clinical units; provided facilities for specialized areas of clinical instruction; and included eight new research laboratories, new classrooms, seminar rooms, amphitheaters, urgently needed teacher office space, and a commensurate expansion of support facilities and services. The Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic was remodeled, and an outpatient surgicenter was developed to meet the needs of those patients requiring general anesthesia for dental treatment. The School of Dentistry became an important regional resource for providing dental care for developmentally disabled children and adults, many of whom require such a treatment setting. The Biomaterials Research Laboratory was constructed; and new advanced-education programs were initiated in pediatric dentistry, implant dentistry, dental anesthesiology, and prosthodontics. A new program was established in 1985 to provide a U.S. dental education for foreign-trained dentists. An increasing number of dental professionals from other countries were seeking an American education and the opportunity to practice dentistry in the United States or to gain advanced knowledge to share in their own countries. The International Dentist Program continues to offer an intensive, twenty-one-month course of study leading to a D.D.S. degree. The program has added a six-month certificate program limited to dental missionaries from other countries who sense the need for updated continuing education. In 2000, the first major expansion of the School of Dentistry in more than twenty years added 15,000 square feet to Prince Hall on the east side and provided two new patient entrances. The expanded Surgery Center for Dentistry and the enlarged Pediatric Dentistry Clinic were relocated to the ground floor. An additional student laboratory was also included on that level. On the second floor, the new space allowed for expansion of the predoctoral clinic, with thirty-six additional operatories. OUR MISSION Loma Linda University School of Dentistry seeks to further the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ by providing an environment in which: Students learn to provide high-quality oral health care based on sound scientific principles. Patients receive competent care that is preventive in purpose and comprehensive in scope, and that is provided with compassion and respect. Faculty, students, and staff value the patient relationship, respect diversity, and share responsibility by working together toward academic, professional, spiritual, and personal growth. Scholarly activity and research provide a foundation for evidence-based learning and enhance whole-person care. The workplace environment attracts and retains a superior and diverse faculty and staff who motivate, educate, and serve. Our communities (local, global, and professional) benefit from our service, stewardship, and commitment to lifelong learning. VISION Loma Linda University School of Dentistry is a preeminent health care organization seeking to represent God in all we do. We are enthusiastically committed to excellent, innovative, comprehensive education of our students and whole person care of our patients. Our students, staff, and faculty are empowered through an enabling environment that honors the dignity, diversity, and worth of everyone.

Application and Admissions The programs admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committees of the school accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant qualities of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. The Admissions Committee looks for evidence of personal integrity, intellectual vigor, good health, self-discipline, and motivation. In broad terms, the following are standards required for admission: 1. Intellectual capacity to complete the curriculum. 2. Emotional adaptability and stability. 3. Social and perceptual skills. 4. Physical ability to carry out observation and communication activities, and the possession of sufficient motor and sensory abilities to practice general dentistry. All materials submitted for admission should be sent to: Office of Admissions School of Dentistry Loma Linda University Loma Linda, CA 92350 Predoctoral D.D.S. program PRE-ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Although the predentistry curriculum in an accredited college can be completed in three years, a baccalaureate degree or equivalent is strongly recommended. The following complete college courses are required for entrance into the D.D.S. degree program: HUMANITIES Freshman English (complete sequence) to include composition and literature NATURAL SCIENCES (complete course, one full year or equivalent) General biology or zoology with laboratory General chemistry with laboratory General physics with laboratory Organic chemistry with laboratory ELECTIVES (strongly recommended) Ceramics Principles of management Basic accounting Mathematics Basic human nutrition Anatomy Histology Biochemistry Psychology Required Students preparing for the predoctoral program are required to complete a minimum of three academic years with no fewer than 96 semester or 144 quarter units in a college or university accredited by a regional accrediting association. Preference is given to applicants who have completed or will complete the requirements for a baccalaureate degree prior to admission. A maximum of 64 semester or 96 quarter 108 UNIVERSITY CATALOG units of credit may be accepted from an accredited junior or community college. A complete academic year of class work (8 semester or 12 quarter units) in general biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, general physics, and English composition must be completed within five years prior to admission, with a grade of C or above in each course. A minimum grade-point average of 2.7 in science subjects and in nonscience subjects, averaged separately, is required. The average grade-point average for accepted students is substantially higher. For admission, the applicant must meet specific criteria related to past academic performance (G.P.A.), performance on the Dental Admission Test (DAT), and a personal interview. The weight given to these admission factors is approximately equal. Students who are enrolled in a graduate program in the University are not considered for admission until they have completed or have been released from the program. Prior to consideration for admission, the applicant is required to have taken the Dental Admissions Test (DAT). The student entering the first year is expected to have taken the DAT within the previous two years, preferably not later than October of the year preceding admission. At the applicant's request, test results are sent to the school by the testing service. Information may be obtained directly from the American Dental Education Association, 211 East Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL 60611. Or an application form and descriptive material may be obtained from the school. In order to be better prepared with specific vocabulary and understanding, the applicant should include science courses with content similar to courses offered during the first year of the professional curriculum. The applicant's purpose should be the pursuit of diverse knowledge, the cultivation of an inquiring mind, the practice of efficient methods of study, and the habit of thinking and reasoning independently. These are of paramount importance to the applicant's development as a unique and responsible human being. The choice of electives can broaden the applicant's view of the scope of knowledge. Being well-read will give a perspective on the sweep of human thought throughout the ages, and often this will be of assistance in written and verbal communication and will improve the ability to think and express oneself well. Psychological, social, philosophical, and religious insights will help to develop basic resources for the solution of personal problems and the growth of self-understanding the student must first have in order to understand and help associates. Transfer, course waiver Transfer from another school of dentistry in the United States is not recommended and is considered only in unusual circumstances. Credits from professional schools (business, medical technology, nursing, pharmacy, or medicine) do not fulfill admission requirements. Credit for studies taken at a military service school is granted to veterans according to recommendations in the Guide of the American Council on Education and/or the California Committee for the Study of Education. The University reserves the right to require satisfactory completion of written or practical examinations in any course for which transfer credit is requested. An applicant from a college or university outside the United States or Canada or from a nonaccredited college or university in the United States must complete a minimum of one full academic year (24 semester or 36 quarter credits) in competition with other preprofessional students in an accredited college or university in the United States. A grade of C or above in each course completed is required. (A grade of C- will not be accepted.) A course requirement may be waived if the applicant has previously taken the course and earned a grade of B or above, but no credit results. Evaluation for waiver of courses will be completed only after an applicant has been accepted to the program, and must be approved by the course director at this University and the school's associate dean for academic affairs. Tuition is not reduced if courses are waived or if a student takes less than a full load. A transfer applicant should expect to begin at the first-year level and will be considered only if there is space available at the appropriate level or in the dental class desired. An application for transfer will be considered when the following information is received in the school's Office of Academic Affairs: letter from applicant, stating reason for requesting transfer; letter of recommendation from the dean of the dental school where the applicant is enrolled; official transcripts sent directly to the Office of Academic Affairs for both predental and dental school courses completed; Dental Admission Test results. Application procedure The school participates in the American Association of Dental Schools Application Service (AADSAS). Cards requesting an AADSAS application are available at most colleges and universities and also on the Internet at <www.adea.org>; or e-mail at <aadsas@adea.org>. The application should to be completed and returned to the Washington address indicated on the application. AADSAS processes this application and sends copies to the schools of the applicant's choice. The School of Dentistry at Loma Linda University recommends that applicants file their AADSAS application before August 1 in order to be competitive. To be given consideration for the next entering class, the student's application deadline is December 1. The following is a step-by-step process for completing an application to Loma Linda University. 1. Supplementary application. When an AADSAS application arrives at Loma Linda University, it is screened; and qualified applicants are sent a supplementary application for the School of Dentistry. 2. Supplementary written materials. The applicant must return the completed supplementary application and materials within 30 days. This includes: an essay specific to Loma Linda University, a wallet-sized photograph, and the application fee of $75. SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY 109 3. Transcripts. Official transcripts may be sent to AADSAS and then released by AADSAS to the School of Dentistry. When an applicant becomes an accepted student, official transcripts, mailed directly from all colleges/universities, are required in order for the student to be registered for the first quarter of classes. 4. References. The applicant is asked to supply a minimum of three personal references. It is recommended that these include an academic reference from a science instructor; a reference from an employer; a character or religious reference such as from a minister; and a reference from a friend in the dental profession. If the applicant has attended a college or university that has a preprofessional committee that prepares a preprofessional evaluation, it is required that Loma Linda University be sent a copy of this evaluation from the committee. Members of the applicant's family are excluded from writing the required letters of reference, although letters will be accepted for the file in addition to those required. Recommendation letters may be sent to AADSAS and then released by AADSAS to Loma Linda University School of Dentistry. 5. Dental Admission Test. The applicant is required to complete\u2014and must meet specific criteria related to performance on\u2014the Dental Admission Test (DAT). Preference is given to applicants who have taken the test no later than October of the academic year preceding that for which admission is desired. The student entering the first year is expected to have taken the test within the past two years. If the test has been taken more than one time, the most recent scores are used for admission criteria. The committee reviews all scores on the test. The DAT scores must be on file at Loma Linda University before an acceptance to the School will be issued. Test results should be sent to Loma Linda University, School of Dentistry, Office of Admissions. 6. Interview. The applicant's records will be screened when the supplementary application, recommendations, and transcripts are on file. The applicant may then be invited to the School for a personal interview. An interview is required for admission. The interview provides an opportunity for evaluation of noncognitive factors, including communication skills, personal values, motivation, and commitment to goals of the profession; as well as genuine concern for others in the service of dentistry. At the time of the interview, a tour of the School will be given by a current student in the program. 7. Observation. It is important that preprofessional students seek experience observing and assisting in a dental office to become familiar with the work of a dentist or a dental hygienist. Prior to interviewing, applicants are expected to complete a minimum twenty hours of observation/work experience in a dental facility, ten of which must be done in a general practitioner's office. 8. Acceptance. The accepted student receives an acceptance letter and a follow-up letter with information relative to required forms and deposit deadlines. 9. Pre-entrance health requirements/Immunizations It is expected that necessary routine dental and medical care will have been attended to before the student registers. New students are required to have certain immunizations and tests before registration. Forms to document the required immunizations are provided for the physician in the acceptance packet sent to the student by the school. In order to avoid having a hold placed on the registration packet, the student is encouraged to return the documentation forms in the provided envelope to Student Health Service no later than six weeks prior to the beginning of classes. Students enrolling in the School of Dentistry must provide documentation of having had the following immunizations and tests: MMRs\u2014measles (rubeola), mumps, rubella of two previous MMRs) PPD (TB) skin test (current skin test result or x-ray report) Tetanus/Diphtheria booster Chicken pox blood test and/or immunization If no known history of chicken pox, then student may choose blood test (which may reveal pre-existing immunity) and/or immunization (if no prior immunity). Hepatitis-B vaccination series Students who know themselves to have had hepatitis-B in the past should employ extra protection when involved in direct patient care and may request a modified curriculum, if necessary. This series of three vaccinations may be completed at this University (even if it was begun elsewhere) through the Student Health Service. (The student will be charged a fee.) A recent eye examination performed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. For further information, consult the Student Handbook 2002, Section V\u2014University Policies: Communicable disease transmission prevention policy; and the Student Health Service office, extension 88770. If a returning student is assigned to a clinical facility that requires a tuberculosis skin test, the student is required to have the test within the six months before the assignment begins. 10. Deposits. The student accepted into dentistry must submit a deposit of $1000 and the required forms to the Admissions Office. All deposits become part of the first quarter's tuition. Failure to submit this deposit will result in the loss of the applicant's position in the class. The remaining balance of the first quarter's tuition and fees is due no later than the day of matriculation in late September. If the applicant has submitted a completed application for financial aid by 110 UNIVERSITY CATALOG March 2, and if the Stafford application has been submitted by June 15, the final installment can be paid utilizing University-assisted sources.

TECHNICAL STANDARDS In harmony with its own education, research, and service objectives, and using the American Dental Education Association suggested guidelines, Loma Linda University School of Dentistry has identified technical standards for its programs. The qualified applicant will meet, or will have the potential to meet, the following technical standards\u2014standards that every student in the dentistry programs is expected to reach. Cognitive abilities School of Dentistry students must have abilities that allow them to accurately and effectively measure, verify, calculate, reason, analyze, and synthesize. Students must be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures in order to fully and completely solve dental problems. In addition, students must be able to visualize and comprehend physical demonstrations in the classroom, laboratory, and clinic. Effective problem solving requires students to gather, organize, and assess relevant information in order to arrive at an integrated solution. Observation For learning to occur, students will be required to observe and interpret demonstrations and experiences. Such observation requires the functional use of vision, touch, hearing, and somatic sensation. Observation is further enhanced by the sense of smell. Students must be able to acquire information from written documents; and to visualize information presented in images from papers, films, slides, or videos. They must be able to interpret radiographic and other graphic images, with or without the use of assistive devices. Students must be able to observe 112 UNIVERSITY CATALOG patients accurately, at a distance and close at hand. They must be able to observe and appreciate verbal and nonverbal communications when performing dental operations or administering medications. All students in the School of Dentistry must possess adequate visual and tactile skills to perform dental examinations and provide treatment. Visual acuity, accommodation, and color vision are necessary to discern differences and variations in color, shape, and general appearance between normal and abnormal hard and soft tissues. Touch and somatic sensation are required for effective learning, as well as for effective evaluation and treatment of patients. A student must also possess sufficient visual acuity to read charts, records, small print, and handwritten notations. Communication Students in the School of Dentistry must be fluent in the use of standard written and spoken English. Thus students' communication with patients, faculty, and staff will be facilitated when eliciting or providing information; or when documenting changes in patients' mood, activity, and/or posture. Students must also be skilled in observing and understanding nonverbal communication. In addition, they must develop the professional judgment that will enable them to discern when and how to maintain patient confidentiality. Motor skills School of Dentistry students should have sufficient motor and sensory capability in both hands to be able to provide general dental care. They must possess the motor and sensory capabilities to perform diagnostic procedures\u2014including such diagnostic maneuvers as palpation, percussion, and auscultation; and to perform basic laboratory tests. Exercising these capabilities requires coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional tactile and visual senses. Students must be able to operate foot controls, utilizing fine movements; and to operate high- or low-speed dental instruments, accurately performing movements of less than one-half millimeter. They must also demonstrate well-developed tactile sense and precise control while using dental hand instruments. Behavioral and social attributes Students must be able to perform basic life-support (e.g., CPR), transfer and position disabled patients, and physically restrain patients who lack motor control. Additionally, they must be able to position or reposition themselves around the patient and dental chair while sitting or standing. Students must possess the emotional stability and resilience required for full utilization of their abilities in the context of a full and challenging education program. Success in the educational program requires use of good judgment; prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients; and development of mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients. It is also imperative that students be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. Students must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, honesty, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest, cultural sensitivity, and motivation are all personal qualities that will be assessed during the admissions and education process. Disabled applicants and students It is Loma Linda University's policy to comply fully with the provisions of The Americans with Disabilities Act [42 U.S.C., Sec. 12131 (2) (1990)]. The school is committed to providing dental education\u2014including support services and reasonable accommodations for disabilities\u2014to qualified applicants who will be able to perform all technical standards with or without accommodations; and for whom such accommodation does not fundamentally alter the School of Dentistry courses or create an undue burden. During the application process, the school requests that an applicant disclose any disability for which an accommodation may be needed. The Admissions Committee requires written domentation of the disability, which they will review prior to making an assessment as to whether or not the applicant can be expected to perform the essential functions of the program. A student who desires accommodation for any disability identified after admission must complete a request form available in the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs for evaluation with appropriate University entities. Appropriate and reasonable accommodation will be provided, as necessary. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR ADVANCED DENTAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS/ POSTDOCTORAL PROGRAMS An appropriate degree from an accredited college or university is required for admission into the Advanced Dental Education Programs and postgraduate programs. A doctoral degree in dentistry (Doctor of Dental Surgery or Doctor of Dental Medicine) or the equivalent is required for admission to all programs. The applicant should have achieved a general grade-point average on a 4-point scale of not less than 3.0, with no grade below 2.0. In addition to acceptable scholastic perfor-mance, the applicant must give evidence of personal and professional fitness for growth in the science and art of the intended dental discipline. For application deadlines, see section on each individual program. After applicants are accepted into the advanced dental education programs in endodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, pediatric dentistry, periodontics, prosthodontics, or the postdoctoral program in implant dentistry, they may apply for admission to the Faculty of Graduate Studies for the purpose of earning an M.S. degree (in addition to the advanced program certificate).

Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook. Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. CODE OF ETHICS A school of dentistry is a place where the professionals of tomorrow are selected and trained in the development of professional and ethical attitudes that are consistent with the highest goals of the profession. It is for this purpose that the School of Dentistry has a code of ethics. This code is a means of educating and training the future dentist in areas of professional ethical activity, and is a means of developing an ethical and moral awareness that will help the individual serve the public andthe profession in an enlightened manner. The Code of Ethics of the School of Dentistry as found in its entirety in the Student Handbook 2002 shall apply to all students in the school\u2014including dental hygiene, dentistry, international, graduate, and certificate students. In addition, residents, fellows, preceptors, research scholars, and exchange students involved in school advanced-education programs shall also be subject to all school policies. STUDENT ASSOCIATION Membership in the Dental Students Association is open to all students. The objectives of the organization include creating a common bond among students\u2014orienting them to organized dentistry, encouraging and fostering missionary activities, stimulating interest in current scientific development, providing programs of broad academic scope, promoting students' various interests, and providing social activities for students. SPECIAL OPPORTUNITIES Conventions The annual Alumni-Student Convention, sponsored since 1960 by the Alumni Association, gives opportunity for students to meet alumni and hear presentations by prominent guest lecturers in dentistry. Students have the opportunity to make research presentations in the form of table clinics. The winners are then invited to present their table clinics at state and national dental conventions. A dedication service is held during the convention, giving students an opportunity to dedicate their professional life to Christ. First-year students (D1) are presented with personalized Bibles; graduating students (D4) are given personalized lab coats. 114 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Academic Information Registration The student must register on or before the dates designated by the Office of University Records. Early registration is encouraged. Registration procedures include recording information on forms furnished by the Office of University Records, clearing financial arrangements with Student Finance, completing requirements of the Student Health Service, and having student identification pictures taken. Late registration is permissible only in case of a compelling reason; a charge is made if registration is not completed by the designated dates. The student may not attend class without being registered, and in no case may registration take place later than the first week of the term. A change in registration after the second week affects the grade record. A student may not concurrently register for courses in another school of the University without permission of the associate dean for academic affairs. Attendance Regular attendance at lectures, clinics, and other assemblies is required of all students. All lectures and laboratories provide information essential for successful completion of the program. Each student is responsible for all material covered and assignments made. Absences in excess of 15 percent may be sufficient cause for a failing or unsatisfactory grade to be recorded. Clinics and individual courses/instructors may have more stringent requirements. Length of academic residence To fulfill the requirement pertaining to length of academic residence, the student must be registered for a full course load at the University for the entire senior year for the Bachelor of Science degree; and the entire D3 and D4 years for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. DEAN'S LIST Outstanding academic performance will be rewarded by publication of the Dean's List each quarter. The eligibility requirements are: complete at least 12 units of graded course work during the quarter; achieve a term grade-point average of at least 3.5 with no grade lower than a B-; receive no Incomplete grades on the grade report. SPECIAL EXAMINATION It is the policy of the school that all students are expected to take examinations at the scheduled time. The only acceptable excuse for not taking an examination on time is major illness (documented by the student health service and conveyed to the course director prior to the examination). The consequences of missing an examination under the circumstances of documented illness are determined by the course director. If a student appears late for an examination, s/he may be denied admission to the examination site. If a student arrives late for an examination and is allowed to take the examination, s/he will be required to finish the examination at the same time as students who arrive on time. REPEATING / REMEDIATING A COURSE If a student receives an unsatisfactory or failing grade in a required course, it will be necessary for him/her to do additional work. Based on the original grade earned by the student, and upon the recommendation of the Academic Review Committee, one of the following plans will be pursued: 1. -For courses with unsatisfactory performance (D+/D/U grades) the student must reregister for the course, review the course work independently, repeat required assignments or quizzes, and take any or all course examinations as required by the course director. The highest grade allowed for a remediated course is C. At the discretion of the Academic Review Committee and course director, the student may be required to repeat the course at the next course offering. 2. -For courses with failing performance (F grades), the student must reregister for the course, attend the class and/or laboratory, and take all course examinations at the next regular course offering. Both the original and repeat grades are entered into the student's permanent academic record, but only the repeat grade units are computed in the grade-point average.

The associate dean for clinic administration and primary attending faculty are members of the D3/D4 Academic Review Committee. In addition, each committee has two student members appointed by the dean in consultation with the DSA officers. Student committee members will be in the class one year ahead of the class being reviewed. The Academic Review Committees meet once per quarter to evaluate student academic and clinical performance and progress records. Students whose performance does not meet the stated academic standards and students who are being considered for discontinuation may be scheduled for a hearing with the committee. The committee also recommends to the dean all appropriate candidates for promotion, academic probation, repeat, or other appropriate actions; as well as students who should receive special recognition for academic excellence. The process for evaluation of academic performance is as follows: 1. The Academic Review Committee\u2014by reviewing grades, reports, and other pertinent information\u2014identifies students whose academic and/or clinical performance is below acceptable levels. 2. The associate dean for student affairs notifies a student facing possible academic sanctions regarding the time and place for a meeting called for the purpose of allowing the student to appear before the committee to present reasons why action should not be taken. The Academic Review Committee considers the student's presentation and all available information before making a recommendation. 3. The dean may enforce one or more of four academic sanction options: Academic probation Remedial action Academic leave of absence Academic discontinuation Please refer to Academic Disciplinary Policy for more specific descriptions regarding each academic sanction. 4. A student may appeal the decision of the Academic Review Committee to the dean. Such appeals are not expected to be routine and should be considered only in circumstances where new and relevant information exists that was not available for consideration by the Academic Review Committee. The dean will review the matter and either render a decision or appoint a three-member ad hoc committee. Members of this committee will not have been involved in the Academic Review Committee decision process. The ad hoc committee will determine whether the SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY 117 process was appropriately followed, review new information, and judge whether the record supports the decision. They will report their findings and recommendation to the dean, who will decide if the appealing student will be permitted to continue participating in classes and/or clinical assignments during the appeal proceedings. ACADEMIC DISCIPLINARY POLICY Academic probation Academic probation is a specified period of time during which the student is given an opportunity to comply with specific academic standards. Such action must be confirmed by letter to the student. Criteria for placement on academic probation A student will be placed on academic probation if s/he meets one or more of the following conditions: 1. Term or cumulative grade-point average G.P.A.) below 2.0. 2. Failing (F/U) or unsatisfactory (D+/D) grades in any course required for the degree. 3. Clinical performance below minimum expected for current academic level. 4. Social/behavioral/ethical problems that significantly impact academic and/or clinical performance. Level of academic probation The level of academic probation indicates the seriousness of the cumulative academic deficiency. However, depending on the seriousness or nature of the academic deficiency, a student may be considered for academic leave of absence or discontinuation at any level of probation. Level 1 First term on academic probation. Level 2 Second term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term. Level 3 Third term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. If a student is unable to remove academic probationary status within the following term, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. Level 3 EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term. Level 4 If a student meets criteria for academic probation for a fourth term, consecutive or nonconsecutive, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. Conditions for a student on academic probation A student on academic probation: 1.May not serve as an officer for any class, school, or extracurricular organization. 2. May not take any elective courses. 3. May not participate in any elective off-campus service learning or mission activities. 4. Remains on academic probation until all the terms of the probation sanctions have been fulfilled, unless the student is discontinued. Remedial action As a condition for continued enrollment, remedial action may consist of: 1. counseling, tutoring; and/or repeating assignments, or course work, or completing additional assignments or course work, possibly including repeating an academic year or portion thereof. 2. other specified requirements. Academic leave of absence Academic leave of absence is a specified period of time during which the student is withdrawn from the academic program. Upon request to and approval by the Academic Review Committee, the student may return to the program at a year/term level specified by the committee. The student may be requested to fulfill specific requirements prior to reentering the academic program. The following are guidelines for when an academic leave of absence may be considered for a student who is in one or more of the following situations: Student has a serious academic deficit that cannot be removed while continuing with current course work. At the end of the academic year, student does not meet the criteria for promotion to the next academic year. Student has three consecutive quarters on academic probation. Student has not passed the National Board Examination on schedule after two attempts and requires full study time to prepare for the National Board Examination. Student fulfills criteria for academic discontinuation yet shows promise for future success despite current deficiencies. Return from an academic leave of absence requires that the student reapply for admission by written request to the associate dean for academic affairs. The student must meet the requirements for readmission specified by the Academic Review Committee at the time the leave of absence was granted. The requirements for readmission may also be reviewed by the Academic Review Committee. Academic discontinuation Guidelines for academic discontinuation are as follows: D1 Year Any term with one or more failing grades, regardless of term or cumulative G.P.A. Three or more unsatisfactory or failing grades within the academic year, regardless of term or cumulative G.P.A. Three consecutive quarters on academic probation. 118 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Failure to fulfill terms of academic probation within the specified time period. Failure to meet criteria for promotion to D2 year by the end of the D1 year. D2 Year Any term with one or more failing grades, regardless of term or cumulative G.P.A. Four or more unsatisfactory or failing grades since enrollment in the program, regardless of term or cumulative G.P.A. Failure to fulfill terms of academic probation within the specified time period.

Dental hygiene seniors Failure to pass the National Board Examination within three attempts Failure to achieve eligibility for graduation within three full academic years of enrollment in the dental hygiene program. In some situations the Academic Review Committee may recommend that a student repeat an academic year (or portion thereof) as an alternative to discontinuation. STUDENT-INITIATED ACADEMIC GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE If a student wishes to contest a grade, s/he should discuss the grade first with the instructor, where appropriate; then with the course director, if applicable; and finally with the department chair. If the student is not satisfied, s/he may then appeal to the associate dean for academic affairs (for further discussion of the academic grievance process, see Loma Linda University Student Handbook). SERVICE LEARNING The Service Learning Program at Loma Linda University School of Dentistry continues the original purpose of the school\u2014to train dental health professionals to provide service to underserved populations, both locally and abroad. Field experience for students of dentistry and dental hygiene includes extramural opportunities within the U.S. and in foreign countries. In addition to providing clinical treatment, service-learning experiences include local health fairs and elementary school dental health presentations. Service experiences may last from one day to several weeks. All dental and dental hygiene students are required to complete assigned service-learning rotations and minimum clock hours as described in each program. Students are also required to be in good and regular standing to be eligible to participate in elective international service-learning experiences. LEARNING ENVIRONMENT Because the study of dental sciences and arts is based on a foundation in essentially the same science subjects as are studied in medicine and allied health curricula, the School of Dentistry shares with the School of Medicine the facilities for teaching basic sciences, the Alumni Hall for Basic Sciences. Classrooms, laboratories, student lounges, teachers' offices, and clinical facilities related solely to dentistry occupy the School of Dentistry building, named in honor of M. Webster Prince, the first dean. Prince Hall is on the University mall, facing the University Church and adjacent to the Medical Center. The facilities effectively accommodate collaboration with the Medical Center in ongoing research and service programs. The total resources of the University constitute a wealth of opportunity for the student with initiative and willingness to develop individual capacity to the fullest extent. Students find varied opportunities for serving and learning in the immediate University community, in school-sponsored service-learning clinics, in clinical and research electives, and in diverse volunteer programs. SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY 119 BASIC SCIENCES DEPARTMENTS SERVING THE SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY The Loma Linda University departments of basic sciences include anatomy, biochemistry and microbiology, and physiology and pharmacology. The basic sciences serve as the foundation for the dental sciences by leading toward an understanding of normal structure and function, as well as introducing the basis for pathology in the practice of dentistry. Subjects are taught in the first year of the dental hygiene and the first two years of the general dentistry curricula as parts of three conceptually integrated sequences of courses\u2014sequences in physiology, in anatomy, and in applied science. Throughout the basic sciences, an appreciation of God's creation and His wisdom is reinforced through the study of human biology. Students are encouraged to extend their knowledge and apply it for their own well-being and for the well-being of their patients. The Department of Anatomy provides students with the opportunity to learn the fundamental morphology of the human body, including gross anatomy, histology, neuroanatomy, and embryology. The Department of Biochemistry enables students to learn the fundamentals of biochemistry as they apply to the practice of dentistry. The Department of Physiology and Pharmacology enables the student to describe the normal physiological functions of the major body systems as they relate to the mastery of dentistry; and to apply the principles and basic concepts of drug action, safety, and disposition. This basic science focus provides a basic fund of knowledge that is essential for the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene. The faculty are dedicated to providing students with tools that expand their thinking and challenge them to ask probing questions and to earnestly search for answers. Their aim is to prepare students to excel scientifically. The higher aim is, through the Christian atmosphere of this University, to prepare students to become truly compassionate dentists. Financial Information FINANCIAL POLICIES The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies. Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by the dean. Any statement by individual faculty members, program directors, or department chairs in regard to these matters is not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installment are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic conditions warrant. GENERAL FINANCIAL PRACTICES The student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year. Previous accounts with other schools or this University must have been settled. Student financial aid Loans are available only to United States citizens, green-card holders, or those with permanent-resident status. Qualified students can obtain loans for approximately 75 percent of tuition costs.

Roger Hadley, M.D. Dean, School of Medicine School Foundations HISTORY The professional curriculum in medicine, usually requiring four academic years of study and experience in a university and hospital setting, was first offered at Loma Linda University in 1909. More than nine decades later, the events since 1909 seem blurred by the rapid changes that institutions of higher learning experience in an effort to keep pace with the growth of knowledge. SINCE 1909 The first two years of medicine were always taught on the Loma Linda campus. From 1913 to the mid-1960s, the third and fourth years were taught in Los Angeles at what is now White Memorial Medical Center (the first part of which was built in 1918) and at nearby Los Angeles County Hospital (now Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center). Construction of Loma Linda University Medical Center (inclusive of clinical, teaching, and research facilities) allowed the entire four-year curriculum to be offered on and near the Loma Linda campus, beginning with school year 1966-67. The medical center was occupied in July 1967. OUR MISSION The mission of the School of Medicine is to continue the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ, \"To make man whole\" (Luke 9:6). PREPARING THE PHYSICIAN Our overriding purpose is to foster the formation of Christian physicians, providing whole-person care to individuals, families, and communities. Fulfilling this responsibility requires: Education Creating an environment in which medical students, graduate students, and residents will acquire the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes appropriate to Christian health professionals and scholars. Research Cultivating a creative environment for inquiry and discovery of new routes to wholeness through basic and clinical research. Service Providing timely access to cost-effective, comprehensive, whole-person care for all patients, regardless of their circumstances or status. Developing the whole person Affirming the Christian view of wholeness\u2014which recognizes that the needs of patients go beyond the healing of the body, and that the development of students involves more than the training of the mind; promoting physical, intellectual, social, and spiritual growth in our faculty and our students; and transforming our daily activities into personal ministries. Reaching the world Providing whole-person care wherever the opportunity arises; participating with the world community in the provision of local medical education; providing international physicians and scientists the opportunities for professional interaction and enrichment; sharing the good news of a loving God as demonstrated by the life and teachings of Jesus Christ\u2014these are the goals of the students, faculty, and graduates of the School of Medicine. SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 127 General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school. The subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs are outlined in Section IV. It is important to review specific program requirements (Section IV) in the context of the general requirements (Section III) applicable to all programs. Application and Admissions The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committees of the school accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant qualities of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. THE STUDY OF MEDICINE Preparation for the practice of medicine begins early in life and early in the student's schooling. The greater the aptitudes for and interests in learning widely and appreciatively in the major areas of knowledge--the natural sciences, the humanities, the behavioral sciences\u2014the more able and versatile the student is likely to become. In selecting students, the Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine looks for applicants who are best suited to fulfill the mission of the school and to successfully practice medicine. The school desires students who demonstrate ability to learn independently, to think critically, and to articulate clearly\u2014both orally and in written form\u2014their ideas and opinions. It is important that students in the School of Medicine demonstrate excellent interpersonal skills and show evidence of sensitivity to the needs of humanity. The Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine puts forth considerable effort to ensure that an applicant is qualified for medical school. The applicant's credentials are reviewed to assess scholastic performance. The committee also looks for prerequisite qualities of character and personality, potential for self-direction and the use of discriminating judgment, and dedication to the ideal of service to society. GENERAL ENTRANCE INFORMATION A total of 85 semester (128 quarter) units of credit from an accredited college is required for acceptance by the School of Medicine. Preference is given, however, to college graduates. Credit must be presented for the following subjects: SEM./QTR. HRS. General biology or zoology, with laboratory 8/12 General or inorganic chemistry, with laboratory 8/12 Organic chemistry, with laboratory 8/12 Physics, with laboratory 8/12 English, equivalent to satisfy baccalaureate degree requirement Religion, as required by the college attended Required: Keyboard and computer skills Recommended: Introductory course in basic statistics Biochemistry, strongly recommended Science credits earned in professional schools (e.g., allied health professions, business, dentistry, nursing, or pharmacy) do not fulfill requirements for admission to medicine. CLEP and Pass/Fail performances are not acceptable for the required courses. The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) is required. Scores older than three years will not be considered. APPLICATION PROCEDURE AND ACCEPTANCE It is important to know the specifics of the application process and to begin the application process well in advance of the date of anticipated (or desired) entrance to medical school. Where to write The School of Medicine is a member of the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS). Applications must be submitted through AMCAS. Their application is available on the web at <www.aamc.org/students/amcas/application. htm>. Deadline Application should be made directly to AMCAS between June 1 and November 1 for entry in August of the following year. Fees The AMCAS fee is required each time an application is submitted. An additional fee to the School of Medicine is required with each supplementary application. 128 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Procedure The application procedure is as follows: l. The applicant submits a formal application to AMCAS, with fee and requested transcripts. The applicant's evaluated data are forwarded to the School of Medicine by AMCAS. 2. When the application is received from AMCAS, Loma Linda University School of Medicine requests completion of a supplementary application and reference forms. The prospective student should provide evidence of exposure to health care through personal involvement, or in other ways confirming the applicant's decision to become a physician. 3. After the supplementary application and letters of reference have been submitted and reviewed, the applicant may be invited for an interview. 4. The information submitted by the applicant through AMCAS, the supplementary application, the letters of reference, and the interview reports are then evaluated by the Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine. This committee determines whether an applicant is accepted or rejected. All applicants are notified of the final decision of the Admissions Committee regarding their application. Acceptance notices are sent to regular applicants beginning December of the year preceding admission to the School of Medicine, continuing until the class is filled. 5. The accepted applicant sends a written acceptance of his/her offer of admission as a student, together with a $100 acceptance deposit, by the announced date (about thirty days after the notification of acceptance). This deposit is refundable until May 15 of the year in which the student has been accepted for entry. In summary, the Admissions Office requests the following: Loma Linda University School of Medicine secondary application and $75.00 application fee. Appraisal of the applicant's character, ability, and suitability for a medical career by persons knowledgeable about the applicant's past performance. A preprofessional recommendation packet, if available, from the applicant's undergraduate college/university. Applicant's availability for interviews. Pre-entrance health requirement and health insurance Students must meet the immunization requirements as stated. In addition, students are expected to have routine dental and medical care and elective surgery attended to before registering for medical school. All School of Medicine students are provided with a health insurance policy through the University's Department of Risk Management. This policy remains in effect for students who are regularly enrolled, provided they register and pay tuition and fees on time each quarter. Since the maximum benefit of the policy (as of the time this CATALOG went to press) is $100,000 and does not cover preexisting illnesses or dental or optical care, students are encouraged to maintain a personal, current policy that covers preexisting illnesses and/or has a higher benefit. A student who does not have health insurance coverage for his/her spouse/children will need to purchase it through the University's Department of Risk Management at the time of registration. Government regulations prohibit the use of student loan funds to provide medical insurance or services for a student's spouse or children. Students who wish to review a copy of the current student health plan or have further questions about the plan should call Risk Management (909/558-4386). Annual tuition also covers the cost of disability insurance. Details will be presented during orientation or upon request. EARLY-DECISION PROGRAM A highly qualified applicant to medical school may apply between June 1 and August 1 and be guaranteed a decision by October 1. During that period of time, the applicant may not apply to any other medical school; and if the applicant is accepted at Loma Linda University, (s)he is committed to that decision. If the applicant is not accepted by October 1, (s)he may apply to any school desired. An applicant not accepted by October 1 will be considered in the regular applicant pool. On the AMCAS application the applicant indicates that (s)he is an early-decision applicant and agrees to comply with the constraints of that program. DEADLINES June 1 to November 1 (of the year preceding the year of admission to the School of Medicine) is the period for submission of applications for the first-year class. August 1 (of the year preceding the year of admission) is the deadline for submission of application under the Early-Decision Program. September 1 (of the year preceding the year of admission) is the deadline for the submission of credentials for the Early-Decision Program. November 15 (of the year preceding the year of admission) is the deadline for receipt of all supporting credentials for the regular applicant pool. May 15 (of the year of admission) is the date beyond which the deposit of $100 is not refundable. TRANSFER Under exceptional circumstances, the school accepts applicants into the junior year who are transferring from other U.S. medical schools. Such transfers must be for compelling circumstances and are subject to availability of space and approval of the Loma Linda University School of Medicine Dean's Administrative Committee. The University reserves the right to require of an applicant satisfactory completion of written or practical examinations in any course for which transfer credit is requested. Successful completion of USMLE Step I is required. SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 129 MEDICAL SCIENTIST PROGRAM Students interested in the Medical Scientist Training Program should consult the School of Medicine. (See Medical Scientist Program in Section IV.)

Students are expected to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook and to abide by its policies. Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. Student organizations The purpose of Loma Linda University School of Medicine student organizations is to: encourage high Christian ideals among medical students. involve medical students in developing and furthering their education. enhance involvement in and loyalty to Loma Linda University. unite medical students to seek constructive solutions to problems. foster leadership among medical students. At registration into the School of Medicine, students automatically become members of the School of Medicine Student Association. Other student organizations that operate within the School of Medicine and that are represented on the School of Medicine Senate include the following: The American Medical Association-Medical Student Section (AMA-MSS), Loma Linda University Chapter The American Medical Student Association (AMSA), Loma Linda University Chapter The Christian Medical and Dental Association (CMDA) The Organization of Student Representatives (OSR) to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMS) Student National Medical Association (SNMA) LLU Chapter Curriculum WHOLE-PERSON FORMATION Personal and professional growth for the student in medicine is the focus of the disciplines in the school, the faculty in the School of Medicine, and the Faculty of Religion. Courses and content are offered to emphasize biblical, ethical, and relational aspects of the physician's personal and professional development. The core for Whole-Person Formation\u2014fourteen quarter hours of religion and ethics--is provided during the first three years of the medicine curriculum. Academic Information The academic progress of each student is monitored by the Academic Review Committee. Specific policies for handling misconduct (academic or nonacademic) are published in the Student Handbook 2002. COMMUNICATIONS Communications to the medical student regarding academic and clinical assignments, scholarship opportunities, and other important information are routed through the Office of the Dean. The student mailboxes and bulletin board are in the school's administrative area, located in the Medical Center. It is the responsibility of students to check their e-mail and mailboxes and the bulletin board daily. REQUIRED SUPPLIES Microscope The student is expected to have access to a satisfactory compound microscope (usually one rented from the school) that meets the following requirements: The microscope shall be no older than fifteen years. The lenses shall be in good condition and shall include scanning and oil-immersion objectives. The equipment shall include an Abbe condenser with rack and pinion adjustment, an iris diaphragm, and a mechanical stage. Textbooks Students are required to purchase the textbooks adopted by the School of Medicine Curriculum Committee. Instruments Students are required to purchase the instruments adopted by the physical diagnosis course. PRACTICES AND REGULATIONS Length of academic residence To fulfill the degree requirement pertaining to length of academic residence, it is the usual policy that the student must be registered for full-time course 130 UNIVERSITY CATALOG work during the entire junior and senior academic years for the Doctor of Medicine degree. Course exemptions Students who seek exemption from registering for courses that they took prior to entering the School of Medicine must qualify for the exemption by passing a comprehensive examination covering the course material in question. Should the student qualify, in lieu of the regular course the student will be required to participate in an advanced program that may include additional studies, research activities, and/or teaching. A written paper will be required from all students completing the advanced program. The course director, the associate dean of educational affairs, and the student will work together to determine the content of the advanced program. Full tuition, equivalent to that of the regular program, will be charged. Examinations Students must take examinations at the scheduled time. Students who arrive more than 15 minutes late to an examination\u2014or after another student has left during the examination for any reason\u2014will be denied the opportunity to take the examination. Should a student miss an examination because of an excused absence, the examination cannot be made up at a later time. Instead, the comprehensive final examination in the course for which the missed examination occurred will be weighted an amount extra, proportional to the weighting of the missed examination(s). In addition, course directors may require other remediation at their discretion. In order to have an excused absence, the student must obtain a written excuse from the Office of the Dean prior to the administration of the test in question. This written excuse must then be provided to the course director. Students missing examinations for health reasons must provide documentation from Student Health that they were indeed ill. Whether or not this documentation is an adequate excuse for missing an examination will be left to the discretion of the Office of the Dean. Students who miss examinations without prior approval from the Office of the Dean have an unexcused absence. As a result, the student will receive a zero for the missed examination(s). In the event of a bona fide emergency, where prior approval is not feasible, the Office of the Dean must be contacted as soon as possible. Failure to do so will result in an unexcused absence. Grading policy Course directors submit grades at the end of the course, indicating the overall evaluation of the student's performance in the course. The grade reflects the success or failure of the student in meeting the objectives of the course in terms of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values. The grade will be recorded as SATISFACTORY if the student exceeded the minimum requirements for overall performance. The grade assigned will be UNSATISFACTORY if the student did not meet the minimum requirements for overall performance. The grade assigned will be MARGINAL PASS if the student met but did not exceed the minimum requirements for overall performance. Complete promotion and retention policies are distributed to each class at orientation. Class standing Class standing is determined by the Office of the Associate Dean for Educational Affairs and is based on student performance on in-house, faculty-generated examinations and on NBME subject examinations. Promotion Promotion is contingent on satisfactory academic performance. Both cognitive and noncognitive evaluations of academic performance\u2014as well as assessment of personal suitability to assume the responsibilities of the medical profession\u2014are utilized in making promotion decisions. The Academic Review Committee of the School of Medicine periodically reviews student performance and progress and recommends promotion, retention, or dismissal on the basis of the overall academic record. The Student Handbook contains additional details regarding the criteria used by the Academic Review Committee for promotion decisions. Academic probation Students whose cumulative academic record at the end of any academic year is less than satisfactory are placed on academic probation. Withdrawal To withdraw from a course(s), the student must file a Change of Program form; to completely withdraw from school, a Total Withdrawal form must be completed. These forms should be completed and submitted on the last day of class attendance. The date of withdrawal used in calculating tuition refunds will be the date on which the properly completed form is submitted to the Office of University Records. USMLE Steps I and II policy States vary in the number of times a student can attempt USMLE examinations and still be eligible for licensure. A significant number of states allow no more than three attempts. The school has defined its own limits for number of attempts allowed. Our policy requires students enrolled in the Loma Linda University School of Medicine to pass Step I in no more than three tries. Students must complete the clinical course work required for graduation within three years of starting the clinical curriculum; they are permitted a maximum of four sequential attempts to pass Step II of the USMLE. The student's first attempt at passing Step II of the USMLE must take place only after s/he has satisfactorily passed all junior clerkships and prior to his/her completion of all required senior clinical course work. A student who has failed Step II but who has completed all course curriculum requirements must remain enrolled in the School of Medicine as a directed-study student until s/he either has passed Step II of the USMLE or failed Step II of the USMLE for the fourth time. During this directed study, the student will be charged tuition. SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 131 DOCTOR OF MEDICINE DEGREE The School of Medicine requires that acandidate must have met the following requirements for the Doctor of Medicine degree: Completed all requirements for admission. Attended an accredited medical school for four academic years, the last two of which must have been spent at this school. Completed honorably all requirements of the curriculum, including specified attendance, level of scholarship, length of academic residence, and credit units. Completed additional special examinations covering any or all subjects of the medical curriculum as may be required. Successfully completed USMLE examinations (Steps I and II), as specified\u2014of both clinical skills and knowledge components. Given evidence of moral character, of due regard for Christian citizenship, and of consistent responsiveness to the established aims of the University and of the school. Discharged financial obligations to the University. The candidate is required to participate in graduation exercises upon completion of the academic program. If the candidate is out of sequence with his/her current class but would like to participate in the commencement exercises, s/he must have completed a minimum of three months of the required senior clerkships, i.e., medicine, surgery, family medicine, neurology, ambulatory care, and intensive care/emergency medicine by April 1 of the year of graduation. Consent for the student to be absent, granted by the chancellor of the University, is contingent on the recommendation of the dean to the chancellor. The families and friends of graduates are invited to be present at the official Conferring of Degrees service. COMBINED GRADUATE DEGREES PROGRAMS Loma Linda University is committed to fostering the investigative skills of its medical students. Students interested in pursuing careers in academic medicine and medical research may wish to enroll in one of the combined-degrees programs: MEDICAL SCIENTIST PROGRAM (M.D./PH.D.)\u2014SM/GS The Medical Scientist Program is designed to develop a student's independence and competence as an investigative scientist and clinician. It provides students with a broad educational base for the practice of medicine and medically related research. The program is administered jointly by the School of Medicine and the Faculty of Graduate Studies. During the first three years of the program, students follow an integrated curriculum that includes medical courses, graduate education, and research training. In the first year the curriculum includes a course sequence\u2014taught by an interdisciplinary faculty\u2014that integrates aspects of biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, cell physiology, and cell and molecular ultrastructure into a rigorous survey of cellular biology. In addition to this foundation, students learn of new developments in the basic sciences and biomedical sciences through weekly seminars and monthly correlative sessions. During subsequent years, formal courses continue to broaden and integrate into a meaningful whole an understanding of the clinical consequences of cellular events. Beginning in the fourth year and continuing for two or more years, students pursue full-time research on a project of their own design within the graduate programs of human anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology and molecular genetics, physiology, or pharmacology. Research training within these programs is available in nationally recognized research laboratories in the School of Medicine. After completing the Ph.D. degree, students return to the medical curriculum for the two years of clinical training required to obtain the Doctor of Medicine degree. For acceptance into the Medical Scientist Program, graduation from an accredited college is required. Students must simultaneously submit applications to the School of Medicine and the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Scores on the general test of the Graduate Record Examination are required. The Department of Biochemistry requires and the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology recommends a basic course in calculus and two quarters of physical chemistry. Students who have completed at least 8 units in biochemistry may qualify for reduced biochemistry course work in the Medical Scientist Program. For information regarding tuition waivers and scholarships, contact the director of the Medical Scientist Program. COMBINED DEGREES (M.D./M.S. or M.D./PH.D.)\u2014SM/GS The M.D./Ph.D. Combined-Degrees Program may be obtained through the School of Medicine. It includes many of the features of the Medical Scientist Program. Students in the combined-degrees program complete the first two years of the standard medical curriculum. This is followed by three or more years of graduate course work and research to qualify for a Ph.D. degree, or at least one year for an M.S. degree, before commencing the last two years of the medical school curriculum\u2014the clinical training\u2014for the Doctor of Medicine degree. Majors are offered in anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology and molecular genetics, physiology, or pharmacology. For the M.D./M.S. and M.D./Ph.D. Combined-Degrees Programs, the prerequisites and Graduate Record Examination requirements are similar to those described for the Medical Scientist Program, except that biochemistry is not required. 132 UNIVERSITY CATALOG LICENSING EXAMINATIONS National The graduate who holds credentials from the USMLE may be granted a license by endorsement of the examining board of most states. Additional requirements made by some states are given in a pamphlet that may be obtained from the Office of the Dean or from the Federation of State Medical Boards, 400 Fuller Wiser Road, Suite 300, Euless, TX 76039-3855.

Graduate physicians wishing to apply for entrance into these programs should apply to the director of the specialty program. Graduate dentists who seek residencies in dental anesthesia, endodontics, oral implantology, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry, periodontics, and prosthodontics should apply directly to the School of Dentistry. POSTGRADUATE TRAINING In harmony with the needs of medicine today, the curriculum leading to the Doctor of Medicine degree is planned with the assumption that all students will take standard postgraduate training in one of the fields of medicine. This means serving as a resident for a minimum of three years in a hospital approved for this training by the Council of Medical Education and Hospitals of the American Medical Association. The Office of the Associate Dean for Educational Affairs supplies information and assistance for the arrangement of residencies. Since the school participates in the National Residency Matching Program, selection through this means constitutes approval by the School of Medicine. CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION Recognizing the imperative of lifelong learning for professionals, the School of Medicine supports a program of continuing medical education for physicians beyond their formal postgraduate years. The Office of Continuing Medical Education is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide Category I continuing medical-education credit for physicians.

In 1907 the first class to graduate included seven students\u2014five women and two men. In 1949 the School of Nursing became a college-based program granting the baccalaureate degree. The first master's degrees in nursing were granted in 1957. The Associate in Science degree program was begun as an integral part of the school in 1970. The School of Nursing received its first accreditation by the National League for Nursing (NLN) (61 Broadway, New York, NY 10006) in 1951. The most recent accreditations were by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (One Dupont Circle NW, Suite 530, Washington, DC 20036-1120) in 1999; and the California Board of Registered Nursing (1170 Durfee Avenue, Suite G, South El Monte, CA 91733) in 2003. Our Mission The mission of the School of Nursing, in accord with the comprehensive mission of Loma Linda University, is the education of professional nurses who are dedicated to excellence in nursing science. Individuals from diverse ethnic, cultural, and racial backgrounds are encouraged to embrace opportunities for lifelong growth and satisfaction from a career committed to health care. Baccalaureate and graduate nursing programs contribute to the development of expert clinicians, educators, administrators, and researchers who benefit society by providing and improving delivery of whole-person care to clients\u2014individuals, families, groups, and communities. Committed to Christian service and distinctive Seventh-day Adventist ideals, the school seeks to reflect God's love through its teaching and healing ministry.

To prepare nursing scholars for leadership in education, health care administration, clinical practice, and research within a global community. 2. To prepare nurse scientists who are committed to the generation an dissemination of knowledge relevant to the development of nursing science and practice. 3. To prepare individuals whose wholistic perspective encompasses social, cultural, political, ethical, and spiritual dimensions in their scholarship practice. 4. To prepare individuals to engage in interdisciplinary discourse and scholarship. Philosophy In harmony with Loma Linda University and the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the School of Nursing believes that the aim of education and health care is the development of wholeness in those served. Individuals, created to reflect the wholeness of God's character, have been impaired by the entrance of sin, disease, and death. God's purpose is the restoration of each person to the original state at Creation. God works through human agencies to facilitate individual wholeness. Nursing functions to assist individuals and societal groups to attain their highest potential of wholeness. Through a variety of roles, nurses put into practice a body of knowledge and a repertoire of skills to assist the human system with health problems. The School of Nursing provides an environment in which students and faculty can grow in professional competence and Christian grace. PHILOSOPHY OF NURSING EDUCATION In support of the philosophy, mission, and values of Loma Linda University and the philosophy, mission, and values of the School of Nursing, the faculty affirms the following beliefs: Learning is an interactive process that involves all of the learner's faculties. A learning environment nurtures the development of potential, promotes maturation of values, cultivates the ability to think critically and independently, and encourages a spirit of inquiry. Clinical experiences are essential to the development of professional and technical nursing competence. Students\u2014influenced by the effect of physiological, psychological, sociocultural, developmental, and spiritual variables on their lives\u2014learn in different ways and bring different meanings to the learning experience. Students participate in development of the science and practice of nursing. AGENCY MEMBERSHIP The School of Nursing holds agency membership and actively participates in the following major professional organizations: American Association of Colleges of Nursing, National League for Nursing, and Western Institute for Nursing. 142 UNIVERSITY CATALOG General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation.

The Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook. Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. PROGRAMS OF STUDY The School of Nursing offers a baccalaureate degree program that is designed to prepare competent, beginning-level professional nurses who are committed to excellence in practice and to Christian principles. For those desiring it, an Associate in Science degree is available at the end of five-to-six quarters when the student meets the requirements of the California Board of Registered Nursing. Continuing education programs are approved by the California Board of Registered Nursing for continuing education requirements. The master's degree program in nursing, offered by the School of Nursing and the Faculty of Graduate Studies, is designed to prepare nurses for Christian leadership in clinical practice, teaching, administration, or research. STUDENT INVOLVEMENT The school administration encourages the student to become actively involved in the Associated Students of Nursing. Student representatives are members of the Undergraduate Faculty Council and may contribute to the administrative decision-making process formally or informally. STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS The following student organizations enable the student to participate in cultural, social, professional, and citizenship aspects of university life. Associated Students of Nursing (ASN) The ASN is a student organization that is sanctioned by the School of Nursing. This association is comprised of all the students of nursing and is administered by elected students and two faculty sponsors. The objectives of this organization are to serve as a channel for communication between students and faculty and to facilitate personal and professional growth by meaningful participation in all aspects of student life. Loma Linda University Student Association (LLUSA) The LLUSA has three purposes: to promote communication among students, to present students' views to the administration, and to assist in the programming of social and religious activities. The LLUSA provides opportunities to develop and refine a wide range of professional leadership and fellowship skills. The office is located in the Drayson Center. For more information, call 909/558-4978. Class organizations The members of each class level organize, elect officers, and promote such projects and activities as constitute their major interests and concerns. HONOR SOCIETY Through the Nursing Honor Society, which was established in 1973, the School of Nursing further fosters academic excellence and the pursuit of Christian graces. In 1975, in recognition of the school's aim of excellence, this honor society, by vote of the national society, became an official chapter of Sigma Theta Tau, International\u2014 the international honor society for nursing. Installation of the Loma Linda University School of Nursing's Gamma Alpha Chapter occurred on April 11, 1976. Students and faculty of the School of Nursing, and other nurses of excellence, upon meeting the established criteria and eligibility requirements may, by invitation, become members of the Gamma Alpha Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau, Incorporated. Academic Policies and Practices ACADEMIC RESIDENCE To qualify for an Associate in Science degree from Loma Linda University, the student must take a minimum of 24 units while in residence at the University; to qualify for a Bachelor of Science degree from Loma Linda University, the student must take a minimum of 32 of the last 48 units\u2014or a minimum of 45 total units\u2014while in residence. A minimum of three clinical nursing courses is required as part of these units. Percentage breakdown for grading The undergraduate division of the School of Nursing uses the following percentages for computing grades: 95 - 100% A 92 - 94% A- 88 - 91% B+ 85 - 87% B 82 - 84% B- 79 - 81% C+ 76 - 78% C 71 - 75% C- 68 - 70% D+ 63 - 67% D Below 62% F NURSING COURSES Nursing course grades Most nursing courses in the undergraduate curriculum are divided into approximately equal components of theory and clinical laboratory practice. A grade for a nursing course represents a combination of the theory and the clinical laboratory grades. In order to pass a nursing course, a student must receive a grade equivalent to a C or above in both the theory and clinical laboratory sections of the course. A grade of C- or below places the student on SCHOOL OF NURSING 145 provisional status and the course must be repeated. Clinical laboratory Laboratory assignment is under the direction of the instructor. In this assignment the student has supervised experience in the care of patients. Tardiness or unexcused absences from clinical laboratory is cause for failure. Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., personal illness or death in the family) must be made up. When a clinical laboratory is made up during nonclinical time, there is a $50 make-up fee. Clinical practice Nursing students are required to practice in client-care settings under the supervision of a registered nurse. Each student will be expected to be able to apply basic theoretical concepts to clinical practice by assessing; planning; implementing nursing procedures; and evaluating the care of individuals, families, and communities. In the performance of routine nursing care, all students will function within the policies of the clinical agency and demonstrate the professional behavior outlined in the University CATALOG and University Student Handbook. Students are expected to be knowledgeable about clients and their problems and about the plans for care prior to actually giving care. They must come prepared for the clinical experience and must adequately assess a client using the Neuman-Systems Model. Students are expected to perform skills safely. Students whose performance is deemed unsafe may be dropped from the clinical course. Repeating a course Any nursing course or named cognate course taken while a student at Loma Linda University School of Nursing in which the earned grade is C- or lower must be repeated before the student can progress to another course. When a student repeats a course, both the original and repeat grades are entered on the student's permanent record; but only the repeat grade and credit are computed in the grade-point average and included in the total units earned. Named cognates are: biochemistry, developmental psychology, epidemiology, ethics, nutrition, sociology, and statistics. Withdrawing from a course A nursing student may withdraw only once from a nursing or named cognate course. A student may withdraw (W), failing, from no more than two quarters. CREDIT BY EXAMINATION Challenge / Equivalency examinations An undergraduate student may meet academic requirements by passing an examination at least equal in scope and difficulty to examinations in the course. Undergraduate students with prior education in nursing or in another health care profession are eligible to challenge nursing courses required for California state licensure. The applicant's background in health care theory and clinical experience must be commensurate with the theory and skills required for the course. To be eligible to write the NCLEX-RN examination, the student must have completed all required nursing course work listed in this CATALOG. Further, the student needs to be aware that, under the laws of California, a candidate for the examination is required to report all misdemeanor and felony convictions. If a candidate has a criminal history, the California Board of Registered Nursing will determine the eligibility of that individual to write the licensing examination. Challenge examinations in nursing courses include both a written examination covering theory and an examination of clinical competence. Progression to the next level in the program is permissible only after successful completion of the challenge examination. A grade of S is recorded for challenge credit earned by examination only after the student has successfully completed a minimum of 12 units of credit at this University with a G.P.A. of 2.0 or above. A fee is charged for a challenge examination. For further information, see the \"Schedule of Charges.\" Advanced Placement Program Credit toward graduation may be accepted by the school for an entering student who has passed one or more examinations of the Advanced Placement (AP) Program with a score of 3, 4, or 5. ACADEMIC PROGRESSION Progression is contingent on satisfactory scholastic and clinical performance and the student's responsiveness to the established aims of the school and the nursing profession. Students are considered to be making satisfactory progress as long as they maintain a C average (2.0 G.P.A.) and complete the total number of units required per year: YEAR CUMULATIVE TOTAL 1st 29 2nd 48 3rd 96 4th 144 5th 193 Probation status and dismissal Students whose cumulative G.P.A. at the end of any quarter is less than 2.0 for undergraduate students and 3.0 for graduate students are placed on academic probation, and the number of units for subsequent registrations is restricted to a maximum of 12 units per quarter. Students with 2 quarters of unsatisfactory performance jeopardize their standing in a degree or certificate program. For undergraduate students, a grade of C (2.0) is the minimum passing grade for nursing and required cognate courses. Required cognates include: biochemistry, developmental psychology, epidemiology, ethics, nutrition, sociology, and statistics. Each nursing course and/or required cognate taken while enrolled at Loma Linda University in which a student receives a C- or below must be repeated. A nursing course or required cognate may be repeated only once. A student with a C- or below in a nursing or required cognate is placed on probation. 146 UNIVERSITY CATALOG A student on probation status will be required to take NRSG 244 under the supervision of the Learning Assistance Program (LAP) and to communicate regularly with the academic adviser. Students on probation status may take only one clinical nursing course at a time. When the course work has been repeated successfully, the probation status is removed and the student is returned to regular status. Enrollment in the School of Nursing will be terminated if a student receives two provisional grades in nursing or required cognates. GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS A candidate for a degree shall have: 1. Completed all requirements for admission to the respective curriculum. 2. Completed honorably all requirements of the curriculum, including specified attendance, level of scholarship, and length of residence. 3.

Discharged financial obligations to the University. It is the responsibility of the student to see that all requirements have been met. A student who completes the requirements for a degree at the end of the Spring Quarter is expected to be present at the University's ceremony for conferring of degrees and the presenting of diplomas. Permission for the conferral of a degree in absentia is granted by the University upon recommendation of the dean of the school. A student who completes the requirements for a degree at the end of the Summer, Autumn, or Winter Quarter is invited, but not required, to participate in the subsequent conferring of degrees. Degrees are conferred at graduations only. The University reserves the right to prohibit participation in commencement exercises by a candidate who has not satisfactorily complied with all requirements. LICENSING The National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurse (NCLEX-RN), which must be passed successfully to practice, is conducted throughout the year by the California Board of Registered Nursing. Application forms may be obtained from the Office of the Associate Dean of the Undergraduate Program; or from the state office at 1170 Durfee Avenue, Suite G, El Monte, CA 91733. The nurse registered in the state of California may be granted licensure through endorsement by other states. GRADUATE PROGRAM Policies and General Regulations Students are responsible for informing themselves of the policies and regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation; and for satisfactorily meeting these requirements. Academic residence To qualify for a degree from the graduate program in nursing at Loma Linda University, the student must take a minimum of 80 percent of the academic program while in residence at the University. For the master's degree, this would be 42-58 units, depending on the selected concentration area. For the Doctor of Philosophy degree, this would be 66 units. NON-DEGREE STUDENT CREDIT A maximum of 12 units may be taken by permission of the instructors prior to acceptance into the program. If these courses are part of the curricular plan for the selected concentration area, and if the grade earned is B or higher, the credits may be applied toward that degree. Extramural study When a student begins a degree program, it is understood that courses taken must be conducted on a campus of the University unless, upon petition for extramural study, the student obtains consent from the program coordinator and the dean. In such instances, the student must arrange with the program coordinator for evaluation of the study and, at its completion, recommendation as to credit and grade. Leave of absence A student who wishes to withdraw for a quarter or longer submits a written request for leave of absence, indicating the reason and the length of time needed to be out of the program. One year is the maximum leave time granted. This request requires the approval of the student's department and the dean. Stipulations for reentry are given the student in writing. During the period of leave, students maintain continuous registration by payment of a quarterly fee, currently $60. Administrative withdrawal Students who fail to make arrangements for a leave of absence and continuing registration may be administratively withdrawn after two quarters of inactivity. Readmission A student who has been administratively withdrawn will be required to reapply for SCHOOL OF NURSING 147 admission and is subject to the requirements in effect at the time of readmission. Continuous registration A student is required to maintain continuous registration from advancement to candidacy to the awarding of the degree. For quarters during which the student is not registered for new units or load validated as a full-time student, a fee of $60 is charged. Withdrawal Formal withdrawal must be arranged at the School of Nursing and at the Office of University Records. Transfer credits A transfer student who has done acceptable graduate study in an approved institution may transfer credits up to one-fifth of the units required by the chosen program, to be applied to the degree at Loma Linda University. Such transfer credits will not be used to offset work at this University that is less than a B average. This transfer is limited to credits that have not already been applied to a degree and for which a grade of B (3.0) or better has been recorded. A maximum of 9 quarter units that have been previously applied to another degree may be accepted as transfer credits upon petition. Chapel Weekly devotional services are held as part of the regular program of the University; and full-time students enrolled in classes that meet on Wednesday morning are expected to attend. Academic standing The expected earned grade for graduate studies is B or higher, and a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or higher. Students must have at least a B (85%) in all the clinical focus courses. If less than a B is the earned grade, the course must be repeated. Degree students whose overall or clinical nursing major grade-point average falls below a 3.0 will be placed on academic probation. Students who are on academic probation and fail to make a 3.0 for the next quarter, or who fail to have a 3.0 grade-point average overall after two quarters, may be dismissed from school. Students who have a grade-point average of less than 3.0 (cumulative or in the nursing major) may not take the clinical focus courses or the comprehensive examination. Clinical probation Clinical work must be evaluated as satisfactory. Faculty may recommend that the student be placed on clinical probation. While on probation, the student must demonstrate satisfactory clinical work as stipulated by the faculty; or she/he will be dismissed from the school. Application for candidacy A student in the Master's degree program will apply for candidacy on Form A after completing at least 25 units of required graduate course work. A doctoral student will follow the policies of the Faculty of Graduate Studies in applying for candidacy. Time limits Any credit transferred to the school or taken in residence and submitted toward a master's degree is nullified seven years from the date when the course was completed. Similarly, credit submitted toward a doctor's degree is nullified eight years from the date when the course was completed. The time lapse from first enrollment in a graduate curriculum to the conferring of the master's degree may not exceed five years. For the doctor's degree, seven years are allowed after the date of admission; however, students enrolled in an approved combined-degrees program may be permitted nine years. A student desiring reinstatement must reapply to the dean. This procedure implies a re-evaluation of the student's total program. Statistics and research consultation Statistics is required as a prerequisite to entry. The courses STAT 414, 415, and 509\u2014 described in the University CATALOG\u2014 fulfill the prerequisite requirement. SCHOLASTIC STANDING The following values are assigned for calculation of the grade-point average per unit of enrollment: A 4.0 B- 2.7 D+ 1.3 A- 3.7 C+ 2.3 D 1.0 B+ 3.3 C 2.0 F 0.0 B 3.0 C- 1.7 The following designations are used to make clear the student's status but not to indicate credit: AU Audit I Incomplete (given for circumstances beyond a student's control\u2014an emergency situation only) IP In progress (for courses that cross term boundaries) S Satisfactory (used in pass-fail courses; does not affect G.P.A.) U Unsatisfactory (does not affect G.P.A.) W Withdraw (given from two weeks after registraion until two weeks before final examinations begin) The graduate student is expected to maintain a consistently high level of performance. The dean receives reports on the quality of work done in order to determine the eligibility of the student for advancement. 148 UNIVERSITY CATALOG PRACTICUM EXPERIENCES Practicum experiences shall be individually structured to meet students' needs and program requirements. Practicum experiences are arranged by practicum faculty after consultation with advisers and appropriate agency personnel. Off-campus placement is formalized through written contract or letter of agreement. This process may take as long as six months. Students requesting practicum experiences at sites that will require additional costs\u2014 such as faculty travel, phone calls, or legal advice\u2014are responsible for this expense. THESIS AND DISSERTATION The student's research and thesis or dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as is feasible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. Handbook Instructions for the preparation and format of the publishable paper, thesis, or dissertation are in the \"Thesis and Dissertation Format Guide,\" availableat the Faculty of Graduate Studies Admissions Office. Consultation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies office can help the student avoid formatting errors that would require him/her to edit large sections of manuscript. The last day for submitting copies to the Faculty of Graduate Studies office in final approved form is published in the events calendar (available from the academic dean's office). Binding A fee will be assessed to cover the cost of binding copies of thesis or dissertation to be deposited in the University library and the appropriate department or school collection. This same fee will also apply to personal copies bound at the student's request. BULLETIN When this CATALOG and any other School of Nursing publication or the publication of any other school or any other School of Nursing program conflict, this CATALOG prevails. The School of Nursing reserves the right to make changes in the course schedule and/or program curriculum as they become necessary. Financial Information The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies. Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by the dean. Any statement by individual faculty members, program directors, or department chairs in regard to these matters is not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean.

I am so pleased to see the Class of 2010 become reality and to welcome such a well-prepared, motivated, and diverse group of individuals into the fourth class. The Classes of 2007, 2008, and 2009 look forward to \"showing you the ropes\" and serving as friends and mentors during your time at Loma Linda University. The 2004-2005 year was an exciting time of phenomenal program growth, expansion of faculty and staff, personal and professional achievements by the members of the school, and continuation of our Candidate status through the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE)\u2014and full membership in the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP). We thoroughly expect 2006-2007 to be equally busy and gratifying as student numbers grow, as new faculty continue to come to LLU, and as each new course is added and taught within our curriculum. The program of study leading to the Pharm.D. degree is the first to be offered by this newly created LLU school, and it is the only such program within the world-wide network of Seventh-day Adventist higher education institutions. This pioneering effort is the result of years of planning, preparation, hard work, and prayer. Our efforts have been truly blessed with an abundance of resources in the form of high-quality physical facilities, along with knowledgeable, diverse, and dedicated personnel. The four years of your studies will be filled with introductions to the various pharmacy disciplines of biomedical sciences, pharmaceutical sciences, social and administrative sciences, as well as the pharmacy practice areas of therapeutics, drug information, pharmaceutical care, and experiential education. In addition, courses from the University's Faculty of Religion serve to enhance the spiritual growth of students. Classroom studies are only a part of what it takes to mold a future pharmacist. Ample opportunities will be in place for students to experience the real world of pharmacy and to hone their sense of professionalism and service. I encourage you to take full advantage of all that comes your way. \"By giving more to your profession, you reap far more in return.\" On a global scale\u2014as well as on campus\u2014there will be opportunities for students and faculty to participate in outreach and service programs with populations underserved by the health care system. This ability to perform meaningful service is a gift which enhances the lives of both those being served and of those serving. As the newest school at LLU, we join with the Faculty of Religion and the Schools of Nursing, Medicine, Dentistry, Allied Health, Public Health, Science and Technology, and the Faculty of Graduate Studies in sharing the proud heritage of a century of health professions education. The University motto\u2014\"To make man whole\"\u2014combined with the mission of continuing the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ is the foundation of all its programs. The school's faculty and staff and I are fully dedicated to excellence in pharmaceutical education and service. During your four years of study, I invite you to learn more about the profession of pharmacy and the special things that make Loma Linda University unique. I am glad that you have chosen to join our program and to begin the journey towards a rewarding and fulfilling professional career. Avis J. Ericson, Pharm.D. Administrative Dean School of Pharmacy Loma Linda University School Foundations HISTORY In 1994 a school of pharmacy was proposed to the Loma Linda University Board of Trustees\u2014a program that had been included in earlier University strategic planning initiatives. The board voted in 1995 \"to continue to approve in principle the establishment of a School of Pharmacy at Loma Linda University and to authorize administration to continue with plans for such a school.\" The first dean was appointed in 1996, and a pharmacy advisory committee began reviewing SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 153 curriculum proposals and drafting a mission statement for the new school. In 2001 an executive associate dean was added to the administrative roster. The primary work of 2001-2002 centered on formulation of program plans, curriculum development, and preparation of documentation for the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE). In addition, recruitment began for faculty and administrative and staff positions, as well as for students who would enter the inaugural class. On September 19, 2002, orientation began for the first class of the School of Pharmacy. These thirty-four students, \"the pioneering class of 2006,\" adopted as their theme \"working to be patient advocates.\" June 27, 2003, marked a milestone in the history of the school. The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education awarded Candidate status to the program, with a school goal of full accreditation status by 2006. Candidate status allowed the School of Pharmacy full membership in the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP). The school's first administrative and faculty delegates were welcomed and seated in the 2003 House of Delegates session. The 34 students of the class of 2006 were joined by 42 students in the class of 2007 and 55 in the class of 2008. The Class of 2009 adds 65 students, which is the intended size of each subsequent class. As of the 2005-2006 school year, the school's three departments\u2014the Departments of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Social and Administrative Sciences, and Pharmacy Practice\u2014were served by twenty-five full-time faculty members, twelve staff, and numerous contract and voluntary educators. Mission, Goals, and Values OUR MISSION The mission of the Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy is to continue the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus by: Educating competent, caring pharmacists who will serve as integral members of the health care team; Expanding through research the development of therapeutic regimens that will advance the knowledge and technology available for the treatment of disease; and Providing high-quality pharmaceutical care to all those within the global sphere of influence of Loma Linda University. The School of Pharmacy is committed to the education of pharmacists of the highest ethical and professional standards to deliver competent and compassionate pharmaceutical care. A diverse and dynamic educational environment produces students who are practitioners, health professionals, and providers of humanitarian service to a global community. Graduates will be dedicated to lifelong learning; developing new knowledge; advancing standards of practice; and integrating physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions of health. OUR GOALS The goals of the Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy are to: Provide pharmaceutical care in a global community.

OUR VALUES The School of Pharmacy centers its academic and co-curricular activities around nine values. These are: Competence Scholarship Integrity Global outreach Service Leadership Lifelong learning Wholeness Spirituality General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school. The subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs are outlined in Section IV. It is important to review specific program requirements (Section IV) in the context of the general requirements (Section III) applicable to all programs. 154 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Admissions Information The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committees of the school accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant qualities of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. Prerequisites for admission Applicants given preference will have successfully completed a baccalaureate degree in chemistry, biology, physics, or a related scientific field. The minimum requirement for acceptance without the B.S. or B.A. degree is completion of the 60 semester- or 105 quarter-credit prepharmacy program (see Prerequisite course requirements). This usually requires two-to-three years of college-level study. Students who already have a bachelor's degree must insure that all of the prepharmacy requirements in the sciences, mathematics, and general education (communication, humanities/fine arts, and social sciences/behavioral studies) have been completed. In order for a course to fulfill the biology and chemistry prerequisites, it must be at the level of those required for a major in the field; introductory courses are not acceptable. PREREQUISITE COURSE REQUIREMENTS Semester/Quarter hours General biology, with laboratory 8/12 General chemistry, with laboratory 8/12 Organic chemistry, with laboratory 8/12 General physics, with laboratory 8/12 Calculus (integral and differential) 4/ 8 English composition 6/ 9 Speech communication 3/ 4 Humanities/Fine arts* 12/18 Social 4 Psychology 3/ 4 Electives 6/10 Computer competency examination Students must demonstrate computer proficiency prior to enrollment by passing a computer competency examination given by the School of Pharmacy, which includes use of an e-mail system (including attaching a document); and basic skills using a word processing program (Word, WordPerfect), a presentation program (PowerPoint), and a spreadsheet program (Excel).

Student Life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The University Student Handbook 2002 more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook. Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. The School of Pharmacy prepares a school-specific Student Handbook, which is provided to all pharmacy students. Regulations, policies, procedures, and other program requirements are contained in this handbook. Academic Policies and General Regulations EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION The School of Pharmacy participates in the California Board of Pharmacy's approved 1,500- hour Supervised Experiential Program. This program helps to fulfill part of the requirements that students must meet in order to take the California Pharmacist Licensure Examination or the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX). Successfully completing the School of Pharmacy's didactic and experiential programs, and successfully passing the California and/or NAPLEX examination, allows a student to become a registered pharmacist (RPh). The experiential program consists of a variety of early, intermediate, and advanced experiences designed to provide the student with professional experience through the use of a structured and supervised program of study. Students participating in the experiential program will receive a Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy Experiential Program Manual. Guidelines and policies are listed in this manual and must The majority of the student's time during experiential courses is out-of-the-classroom activity and under the direct supervision of a School of Pharmacy preceptor. Although the student generally will be off campus, Loma Linda University's code of conduct and the guidelines found in this University CATALOG remain in effect throughout the pharmacy program. In addition, the following guidelines apply to all professional pharmacy students assigned to experiential sites or rotations. Attendance is mandatory. Punctuality is expected, and excessive tardiness will not be tolerated. Students must have a working e-mail account (that is on record with the Office of Experiential Education and the Office of Student and Professional Affairs) and are required to check the account at least daily to keep informed of important information or announcements. All experiential-education assignments are made through the Office of Experiential Education and are the responsibility of the director of experiential education. No student is allowed to change rotation sites without the express written consent of the director. Switching sites without such consent may result in a student failing the rotation. Students are not to function as an agent or employee of the site. The student must identify him-/herself as a pharmacy student from the Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy. While participating in this graded experience, students shall not, under any circumstances, receive financial remuneration from the experiential site. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in suspension and removal from the rotation as well as receipt of a failing grade in the course. All financial obligations associated with the student's pharmacy education are the responsibility of the student. These responsibilities include transportation, food, lodging, and any other incidental costs related to off-site assignments. Concurrent employment during the experiential experience is not encouraged and does not exclude or excuse students from any responsibilities associated with course requirements. PORTFOLIO DEVELOPMENT Documentation of a personal philosophy, along with goals, methods for improvement, accomplishments, self-evaluation, and reflection are useful tools in long-term professional development. Over the four years of the pharmacy program, students will be required to develop and keep updated a professional portfolio. Although portfolio content may be highly individualized and reflect personal aspirations and experiences, the School of Pharmacy will stipulate certain inclusions. The portfolio may be built to emphasize some areas (e.g., professional service) and place little or no emphasis on others. Ideally, it is a tool that is utilized in a periodic evaluation process. The portfolio should be considered a work in progress. There are no absolute right or wrong things to include. The portfolio is always a reflection of the student and those activities that are building his/her professional history. As such, it provides valuable insights into a student's thinking, planning, self-evaluation, and goal-setting activities at multiple steps along the journey. A variety of seminars and working groups will be used over the four-year program to help students begin and refine their portfolios. This work will occur with assistance from the student's faculty adviser and other mentor/role-model professionals. It is important to update portfolios with recent activities added on a regular basis. Some students find that daily or at least weekly updating is advisable in order to capture the most complete information. It is difficult to maintain an accurate and detailed portfolio if revising is done at longer intervals. When possible, information from previous educa-tional, personal, and work experiences should be added to the developing portfolio to set a baseline of comparison to current goals and accomplishments. The following information is often included as a part of individual portfolio sections: Philosophy statement related to area Goals for activities Performance on key assignments Methods to improve and expand Special recognitions/evaluations Self-evaluation/reflection PORTFOLIO CONTENT Listed below are major portfolio sections that students should consider using. The emphasis may change over time to reflect current activities. Some sections may include additional information (as shown) to supplement the general areas: Classroom learning activities Internship / Experiential activities Professional Professional organizations: member/officer/ committees Conventions/meetings attended (as a delegate/ officer/attendee/presenter) Projects ongoing (CPE) attended presentations/projects for the general public Service/Outreach Community service/Mission efforts activities Personal development Growing spirituality\u2014in classroom/clinical/ research/patient care settings Research Research/projectscurrent/planned/completed: Clinical research Basic/bench research Resident projects Special projects SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 157 Other activities of note In addition, students will be asked to include sections in their portfolio that focus on the values, mission, and goals of the School of Pharmacy. Such reflections may include the following areas: Reflections on School of Pharmacy values, mission, and goals Teaching and learning Health care team Competence Pharmaceutical care Ethics and integrity Compassion and empathy Humanitarian efforts Service and outreach Professional standards Leadership Diversity Global community Lifelong learning Spirituality Wholeness/Wellness Research Integration of physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions of health Sharing knowledge with patients and health care professionals Responsible management of health care resources and the environment At the time of application to the program, students are required to prepare a personal statement, which includes comments on three of the nine values important to Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy. These values are: Competence Scholarship Integrity Global outreach Service Leadership Lifelong learning Wholeness Spirituality It is expected that the final program course\u2014Reconnections\u2014will encourage students to share the evolution of their growth in a number of these areas. PHARMACY SEMINARS It is required that each Doctor of Pharmacy student satisfy the seminar requirement before being cleared for graduation. This activity is considered to be an enrichment that will orient the student to a broad range of current professional issues and concerns, as well as demonstrate the need for and foster a love for lifelong learning. Over the duration of the four-year program the following policies apply to pharmacy seminars: Each student must attend a minimum of twelve ACPE-approved continuing pharma-ceutical education programs or other pharmacy seminar. At least two must be attended during each academic year of enrollment. A maximum of two seminars per meeting or conference may be attended to meet this requirement. Attendance at the opening general session of a conference cannot be used to meet this requirement. A Pharmacy Seminar Attendance Documentation Form must be completed for each program attended. This form must be turned in to the Office of Student and Professional Affairs within fourteen days of the seminar attended. The student should also keep a copy for his/her files. This seminar requirement must be met during the student's enrollment in the School of Pharmacy and is separate from course registrations. Attendance at medical grand rounds outside the requirements of an experiential education course can be counted as part of this requirement. Seminar activities that qualify to meet this requirement are those that have received prior approval from the Office of Student and Professional Affairs. Students should check with the office before attending programs. In general: Local pharmacy association meetings are approved. State pharmacy association meetings are approved. National pharmacy association meetings are approved. LICENSURE, INTERNSHIP, AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY General information In order to participate in introductory and advanced pharmacy-practice experiences (IPPE and APPE), the student must hold a current California Pharmacist Intern License. It is the responsibility of the Office of Student and Professional Affairs to notify the California Board of Pharmacy of any student who discontinues the pursuit of his or her degree, withdraws from courses, or is dismissed from the program. Such students are also required to return their Intern License to the board within the timeframe required by law. The required forms, examination dates, and licensure requirements are available at the California State Board of Pharmacy Web site, www.pharmacy.ca.gov. Students are strongly encouraged to visit this site on a regular basis to monitor changes. Pharmacist intern hours The California State Board of Pharmacy requires 1,500 hours of acceptable intern experience. Other states have different requirements (see specific criteria for each state in which licensure is desired). The School of Pharmacy's introductory and advanced 158 UNIVERSITY CATALOG pharmacy-practice experiences will fulfill 600 of these hours. The remaining 900 hours must be completed outside the School of Pharmacy curriculum and consist of employment in a pharmacy under the immediate, direct and personal supervision of a pharmacist. This experience must be predominately related to selling drugs, compounding prescriptions, preparing pharmaceutical preparations, keeping records, and making reports required by California and federal regulations. The student is eligible to take the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) after completing 1,000 internship hours; but the 1,500-hour requirement must be completed before the student may become licensed. The summer after the first professional year (PY1) is ideal for students who are licensed pharmacist interns to begin to earn required intern hours. It is the individual student's responsibility to ensure that all requirements for licensure are met, and also that all forms are properly completed and promptly sent to the California Board of Pharmacy within the specified timelines. Beginning with the second professional year of study (PY2), internship hours may be earned during quarter breaks and the summer. They may also be earned after graduation. The following recommended schedule for completing intern experiences will allow the student to obtain sufficient hours to sit for NAPLEX. It is the student's responsibility to complete the appropriate number of hours for licensure. Recommended Timetable for Earning Intern Hours (maximum) Time Possible Countable Cumulative hours in California TOTAL (maximum) Summer after PY1 year 400 400 400 PY2 Christmas break 80 80 480 Summer after PY2 year 400 400 880 PY3 Christmas break 80 80 960 Summer after PY3 year 80 80 1040 PY4 Christmas break 80 80 1120 Curricular practice experiences 1,720 600 1,720 After graduation As needed to reach 1500 *Currently, there is approximately a two-month period between taking the examination and receiving test results. During this time, graduate interns can complete additional hours. INTERN PHARMACIST LICENSE Each first-year professional student (PY1) must submit a completed California State Board of Pharmacy Application for Registration as an Intern Pharmacist and a $65 check (made payable to the California Board of Pharmacy) to the Office of Student and Professional Affairs\u2014see Web page: <http://www.pharmacy.ca.gov/pdfs2/intern_app1ication_pkt.pdf>. This document and payment are due during student orientation. Students are responsible for keeping their pharmacist intern license current and valid. The Board of Pharmacy must be notified of any change in address, student status, or name change. A photocopy of a valid intern pharmacist license must be on file in the school's Office of Experiential Education. LICENSURE EXAMINATION IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES To become licensed as a pharmacist in California, the student must: Be a graduate of a school of pharmacy that is accredited by the Accreditation Council on Pharmaceutical Education and that is recognized by the California State Board of Pharmacy (such as Loma Linda University). Complete a total of 1,500 hours of acceptable intern experience (a minimum of 1,000 of these hours must be completed in order to take the examination). Submit proof of completion of the 1,500 hours (completed documents), along with completed Institutional and Community Experience Affidavits (see www.pharmacy.ca.gov). Pass both multiple-choice and essay sections of the NAPLEX. Submit the required licensure fee. Licensure in other states is granted after the student passes the NAPLEX. Requirements for eligibility vary from state to state and may be verified by checking the NABP Web site, <www.nabp.org>. Generally, Loma Linda University's experiential requirements, coupled with following the school's recommendations for obtaining intern experience, will meet the hours needed to sit for the NAPLEX in most states. CONTINUING PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION Successful completion of the School of Pharmacy program and passing of the licensure examination are only the first steps in becoming a professional pharmacist. Each state requires adherence to some method of validation for continuing pharmaceutical education (CPE) in order to maintain an active license to practice. Practitioners licensed in more than one state must be sure to comply with each state's requirements. In recognition of the importance of lifelong learning, Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy has a seminar attendance requirement SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 159 for graduation. Attending and reflecting upon professional programs is part of continuing professional development (CPD). Most states define their requirements in terms of continuing education units (CEUs). In general, one hour of programming is counted as 1 hour of CPE and 0.1 CEUs. In addition to attending conferences or seminars, other methods can be used to obtain needed credits, such as completion of self-study sections from professional journals or on-line sources. Programs that offer CPE hours must qualify and be accredited by the Accreditation Council on Pharmaceutical Education (ACPE) or their respective state board of pharmacy. The ACPE adheres to strict standards on the types of programming acceptable for credit and ensures that providers comply with proper record keeping and documentation requirements. In California, registered pharmacists are required to earn 30 hours (3.0 CEUs) of continuing pharmaceutical education every two years and pay a fee to the California State Board of Pharmacy to keep their license current. Other states may require more or fewer hours of CPE, require validation on a yearly basis, and/or stipulate specific topics in which to get credits. The School of Pharmacy recommends that students develop the habit of regularly attending programs that offer CPE, and that they become diligent in keeping track of CPE statements of credit. Such statements may be required by the state board of pharmacy, along with the periodic relicensure application and fee. E-MAIL ACCOUNTS / MESSAGES All pharmacy students are provided with a Loma Linda University e-mail account. The address will be assigned during registration. A substantial portion of the School of Pharmacy's communication will be via e-mail, and failure to receive a message because of an inactive or unchecked e-mail account is not a valid excuse. Problems that may occur with students having the same last name and first initial will be handled through the Media Services Department. Students are responsible for keeping their e-mail accounts open and accessible. A current e-mail address must be on file with the Office of Student and Professional Affairs. Students should monitor, at least daily, their account for important messages or notices sent by the School of Pharmacy. An important notification could be sent with less than 24 hours notice. COMPUTERS As part of its educational mission, the School of Pharmacy requires the utilization of computers, computer systems, and networks. On-campus computing resources are intended for University-related purposes, including: direct and indirect support of instruction, research and service missions, university administrative functions, student and campus-life activities, and the free exchange of ideas within the University community and among the University and the wider local, national and global communities. The School of Pharmacy is also bound by the Appropriate Use of Technology Policy, as described below. Students are also referred to the Loma Linda University Student Handbook for a more detailed explanation of the University's policy on computer use. TECHNOLOGY POLICY The following is intended to ensure that all members of the University computing community shall be given privacy in their work; that no one shall be subjected to abusive behavior by others using the system; that the resources available to the community shall not be consumed by only a few individuals; and that computer resources shall not be destroyed by electronic vandalism. It should be clearly understood that the following points are illustrative and not all-inclusive: Only authorized persons\u2014defined as students, faculty, staff, and members of Loma Linda University-sanctioned programs\u2014may use Loma Linda University's computing facillities and equipment (computers, printers, networks, software, etc.); and these may be used only for legitimate purposes relating to teaching, course work, research, and administration at Loma Linda University. Members of an academic community are entitled to privacy in their work. It is a violation of University policy to obtain a password that belongs to someone else or to access another user's files or e-mail account on the network. These violations are forms of theft and will not be tolerated. Accessing any file other than one's own is prohibited, unless that file has been made publicly accessible. Reading, writing, and editing directories and/or passwords belonging to others is prohibited. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, files left on a floppy or hard disk, misplaced or discarded listings on storage media, etc. Posting a message under someone else's name is prohibited. Taking advantage of another person who inadvertently leaves a computer without logging out is no different than entering an unlocked room and stealing or reading a personal letter, or destroying property. Using LLUNet to annoy or harass is prohibited. This applies to the use of phone mail, electronic mail, conferencing, news group bulletin boards, and message facilities. This includes, but is not limited to, flooding individuals or news groups with large volumes of electronic mail designed to disrupt and/or annoy. 160 UNIVERSITY CATALOG State law sets forth the definition of obscene material. The code also states that the distribution, production, or sale of obscene items is illegal, and punishable by law. Federal law also criminalizes the transportation of such materials in interstate commerce. Loma Linda University must comply with these laws and will enforce them among all students, faculty, staff, and visitors. Furthermore, the placement of pornographic and obscene material on a Loma Linda University computer or server is a violation of Loma Linda University policy. Violators will be subject to the disciplinary action of expulsion and/or termination. CHAPEL, PHARMACY FORUM, AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ATTENDANCE Chapel, pharmacy forum, and professional development are required activities for the School of Pharmacy. These weekly (or more frequent) events are important to the professional and spiritual growth of students. Both aspects of growth are key objectives of the Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy program. For the purposes of record keeping, being marked tardy twice will be counted as one absence. Honors, awards, and scholarships presented by the School of Pharmacy will use the attendance record of those under consideration as one of the criteria for awards. Students who miss an excessive number of chapels, pharmacy forums, or professional development meetings will be ineligible to be considered for the Dean's List, honor roll, honor society memberships, and other awards and honors. Students who have perfect attendance at chapel, pharmacy forum, and professional development will have their names entered into an \"incentive\" drawing at the end of each quarter. CHAPEL Attendance will be taken by University officials at all chapel sessions and daily during Week of Devotion. Students marked absent from a third chapel during a quarter must go to the Del Webb Library and review the tapes of all missed chapels and submit a written synopsis of each to the Office of Student and Professional Affairs within the prescribed timeframe. Throughout the academic year, this make-up requirement will also be triggered once a student has been recorded as absent from five chapels. Each additional chapel missed over the limits established above will require five hours of University-chapel service activities to be completed by the student. The Office of Student and Professional Affairs, together with the dean and the University chaplain, will determine when, where, and how this service will be performed. PHARMACY FORUM Attendance will also be taken at all pharmacy forum meetings. A second absence during any quarter may lead to a grade of U (unsatisfactory). Each additional pharmacy forum missed over the limits established above will require five hours of School of Pharmacy service activities to be completed by the student. The Office of Student and Professional Affairs, together with the dean, will determine when, where, and how this service will be performed. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT Attendance will be taken at the professional development meetings. A second absence during any quarter may lead to a grade of U (unsatisfactory). Each additional professional development meeting missed over the limits estabished above will require five hours of School of Pharmacy service activities to be completed by the student. The Office of Student and Professional Affairs, together with the dean, will determine when, where, and how this service will be performed. BULLETIN BOARDS Students are responsible for monitoring on a regular basis all notices placed on School of Pharmacy bulletin boards. Additionally, notices may be handed out in class or placed in the student's mailbox.

Violations of appearance standards Violations of appearance standards will be reported by faculty members. These violations are referred to the Office of Student and Professional Affairs or the assistant dean for academic affairs. Following an investigation, the faculty member and/or administrative personnel will meet with the student in an attempt to arrive at a resolution/correction of the matter. Failure to arrive at a mutually agreeable resolution/correction will result in a referral to the Academic and Professional Standing Committee, which will follow the committee's normal due-process procedures. HONOR ROLL AND DEAN'S LIST The Office of Student and Professional Affairs compiles a list of students who have demonstrated their academic excellence by achieving an outstanding grade point average each quarter. A student who earns a 3.30-3.69 grade point average, with no incomplete grades, during a term is given honor roll standing. A student who earns a 3.7 or better grade point average, with no incomplete grades, is given Deans' List standing. PERFORMANCE LEVEL In order to remain at regular academic status, pharmacy students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 2.3. Failure to maintain good academic performance will result in action by the Academic Standing Committee. In addition, a grade of at least a \"C-\"must be earned in any course for which credit is to be applied towards the Doctor of Pharmacy degree. In order to have any grade changed, the student must repeat the course. This includes attending lecture and/or laboratory sessions as required, completing assigned work, and taking any required examinations. Courses being repeated by a student will have tuition charged on a per credit-unit basis, using the current fee schedule established by the school. Both the original and repeat grades are entered in the permanent records, but only the second grade is computed in the grade-point average. A course may be repeated only once. Continuation in the pharmacy program is seriously jeopardized for the student who consistently earns grades below C+. Students who receive less than a C- grade in a course will be monitored closely for academic progression. ACADEMIC PROBATION Students will be placed on academic probation if they have a cumulative grade-point average less than 2.3 at the end of any quarter. Students on academic probation for two consecutive quarters jeopardize their standing in a degree program. SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 163 Students on academic probation will be required to meet with their adviser to determine what steps are needed to increase academic performance. The number of units for subsequent registrations may be restricted. The student will be expected to adhere to the plan worked out with the adviser. The adviser will inform the Academic Standing Committee of the student's compliance and progress. Academic probation will be lifted when the cumulative G.P.A. rises above 2.3. ACADEMIC DISMISSAL A student will be dismissed from the School of Pharmacy if the cumulative G.P.A. remains less than 2.3 for three consecutive quarters. A dismissed student may reapply and be considered for readmission. The Admissions Committee will review each case separately and reserves the right to determine the provisions for each individual situation. The committee will define the readmission conditions for each student. A student is eligible to reapply and be considered for readmission the next academic year after studies in the School of Pharmacy have been discontinued. GRADE APPEALS A student has the right to file an appeal if there is disagreement over the score received on an individual test, final examination, or assignment. The appeal must be in writing, using the procedures outlined in the section on Grievance Procedures (in this CATALOG). Appeals must be filed within seven business days following the return of the examination or assignment in question. For final examination-grade appeals, the appeal must be filed within seven days after the end of finals week. For appeals of final course grades, the appeal must be filed within twenty-one days after the published date that grades are due at the end of an academic term and shall also follow the procedures outlined in the Student Grievance Procedures section. Any examination or assignment returned to the instructor for specific question(s) review or for an appeal is also subject to further review of other questions. REVIEW OF EXAMINATIONS Students shall have ample opportunity to review their examinations within a reasonable time frame after the test has been given. Instructors must either return the graded examination for the student to keep or permit the student to review his or her examination in class or other set time during recitation periods. For examinations not returned, an additional test review may be requested by the student. This should be done in a prescheduled, arranged format agreed upon between the student and instructor and set at a time convenient to both. An instructor may prohibit the taking of notes during an examination-review session in order to maintain question security. Any examination given back to the instructor for specific question(s) review is also subject to further review of other questions. MAKE-UP EXAMINATIONS Instructors must implement a make-up examination policy in their course. This procedure must be clearly stated in the course syllabus and be discussed with students on the first day of class. It must prescribe exactly what will happen if a student misses an examination, quiz, final, or other point-generating activity. If rescheduling is an option that the instructor chooses, the test should be given as soon as is convenient for the instructor. In the absence of a specific course policy set by the instructor, the contingency School of Pharmacy policy shall apply. An instructor's policy may be more stringent or less strict than these back-up guidelines. For unexcused absences, a zero score shall be entered as the grade for.the missed examination, quiz, assignment, final, or other point-generating activity. For excused absences of an examination or quiz, the instructor may either reschedule a make-up test or have the point value of the missed assessment activity added to the final examination. The instructor is permitted to offer less credit for a make-up activity than the original activity was worth. For excused absences of a presentation, activity as a team member, or other point-generating activity, the student shall receive a zero grade entered for the activity unless the instructor is willing and able to reschedule the activity. EXAMINATION TARDINESS Students arriving late for an examination, quiz, final, or other point-generating activity may be denied admission to class, at the instructor's option, until the activity is over. Once a student who has been taking the examination or quiz has left the room (either after completing the test or for another reason) no one shall be allowed to enter the room for the purpose of starting the examination or quiz. In general, an instructor should not let the first student leave the room until: After 1 minute for an unannounced quiz of less than 10 minutes duration; After 5 minutes for a scheduled quiz of 10-to-20 minutes duration; After 15 minutes for a scheduled examination of 50-to-90 minutes in duration; or After 20 minutes for a scheduled final examination of 100-to-120 minutes in duration. EXAMINATIONS Students who have completed an examination (or quiz) must turn in the examination or quiz to 164 UNIVERSITY CATALOG the proctor and leave the room and general vicinity immediately. Please refer to the examination-tardiness policy for exceptions to this rule. PROFESSIONAL INTEGRITY In addition to emphasizing academic excellence and integrity, Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy also stresses professional growth, development, excellence, and integrity. Chronic tardiness to or numerous absences from courses and/or other required activities are considered inappropriate professional behavior and show a lack of commitment to professional growth. Students exhibiting such behaviors may be placed on professional probation until such time as the behavior has been modified. Students who have been placed on professional probation are not eligible to hold ASP/SNPhA or class offices, or to receive any honors or awards. A student may also be dismissed from the program, after due process, as a result of conduct unbecoming to a pharmacist. STUDENT PROGRESSION The curriculum is designed to be followed in a stepwise, block manner. All prerequisites must be completed before a student can enroll in a course. Students must pass all the professional courses in each year before enrolling in courses in the next year (i.e., PY1 courses must be completed before entering PY2 courses, etc.). In addition, each student must pass the end-of-year comprehensive qualifying examination; failure to pass this examination may delay progression into the next year's course work. In addition to the Loma Linda University academic regulations, the rules outlined below will be used to provide for the immediate intervention of the Academic Standing Committee. If it is deemed necessary, the committee may intervene at times other than specifically stated below in order to ensure the academic integrity of the School of Pharmacy. The following rules apply to student performance in course work and progression through the curriculum toward graduation: Students are required to enroll in and complete courses in sequence, completing at each level all prerequisites. No student will be permitted to take courses out of sequence or enroll in a course without having satisfied the prerequisites. A minimum grade of C- is required to pass all pharmacy courses and electives. Students are required to keep abreast of school/class activities by checking e-mail, bulletin boards, student mailboxes, and postal mail at the address on record. Students are required to follow the dress code of the school as an integral part of their training and professionalization. Student attendance in classes is considered the cornerstone of professional behavior and is expected in all classes, especially during point-generating activities. Experiential education activities and other off-site activities have a mandatory attendance requirement. Experiential education program sites (introductory and advanced) are provided off campus. Some of these sites may be located a significant distance from Loma Linda University. Students are responsible for their transportation and possible relocation to their assigned site and for their own housing during this period. The faculty of the School of Pharmacy reserves the right to revise the curriculum at any time to assure that students acquire the most current and relevant training possible. If curricular changes become necessary, every effort will be made to apprise students of the change and how it impacts their course of study. However, assurance of well-prepared graduates will prevail as the dominant concern. One of the requirements for progressing from one professional year to the next is passing a comprehensive, qualifying examination covering the previous three quarters' course work. Failure to pass these examinations may delay progression into the next year's course work. The School of Pharmacy will graduate only those students it deems ready\u2014morally, ethically, and professionally\u2014to practice pharmacy; and consequently will reserve the right to withhold the recommendation for graduation of any student who does not conform to these standards. One of the requirements for graduation is passing a NAPLEX-style comprehensive examination. Each student must score 75 percent or better; failure to pass this examination may delay the graduation of the student. A student may be dismissed from the program, after due process, as a result of conduct unbecoming to a professional pharmacy student or a pharmacist. INFECTION CONTROL / BIOHAZARD- EXPOSURE REDUCTION At the first pharmacy forum of each new academic year, students must be certified or recertified in Loma Linda University's infection control and biohazards training. The primary purpose of this training is to: minimize the student's exposure to biohazardous materials; increase awareness of blood-borne pathogens (BBPs) that may result from contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues; and make students aware of the University's policies and procedures on exposure to blood-borne pathogens (see Student Handbook). A copy of Loma Linda University's Infection Control Manual is on file in the Office of Student SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 165 and Professional Affairs. The school emphasizes the importance of individuals taking personal responsibility for their own health and safety and asks that all students follow universal precautions and University policy and procedures as a means of safeguarding their own health. Observing standard precautions is the single best strategy to reduce the risk of blood-borne pathogens (BBP) exposure. This includes using adequate barrier protection (gloves, safety glasses, mask) when performing any activities in which the potential exists for BBP exposure. Familiarity with and use of safety devices on needles, syringes, and intravenous equipment can also reduce the risk of accidental BBP exposure but will vary among medical institutions. Completion of the hepatitis B immunization series with documented presence of antibody to hepatitis B should provide full protection from transmission of this virus. Loma Linda University students are to complete immunizations as part of their pre-entrance health requirements. The School of Pharmacy expects full compliance with these requirements and makes every effort to verify that a student's immunizations are complete. Students may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens (BBPs) in the course of their clinical, didactic, extracurricular, and/or research duties. Although a number of different pathogens (viruses, bacteria, etc.) may be transmitted from patients to health care workers, three organisms are of particular risk and concern: hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HVC), which can lead to liver disease; and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS. Although a vaccine is available to prevent HBV, there is no vaccine currently available for HVC or HIV. Following an exposure, the risk of contracting HIV may be reduced by taking medications as part of post-exposure prophylaxis; however there is no preventative treatment for hepatitis C. An exposure is generally defined as a percutaneous injury (a needle or sharp object puncture or cuts on the skin); or contact of mucous membrane(s) or nonintact skin with blood, tissue, or body fluids that are contaminated with visible blood. Current estimates of the average percutaneous exposure are: HIV = 3/1,000 (0.3%), hepatitis C = 1-3%, hepatitis B = 30% (in nonimmune). EXPOSURE TO BLOOD-BORNE PATHOGENS This section outlines the actions to be taken following blood-borne pathogen (BBP) exposure. When such an exposure (or \"needlestick\") occurs, the following steps must be followed exactly. 1. The exposure site should first be thoroughly washed and irrigated. 2. The student should promptly report the incident to the supervising faculty member or preceptor. 3. An incident report must be completed on site, giving details of what occurred. The contact information of all involved parties should be obtained as part of this document. 4. The student should seek immediate evaluation at Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC) Emergency Department and identify him-/herself to the triage nurse as a School of Pharmacy student who has just experienced an exposure to blood-borne pathogens. The student will be referred to a special team of professionals trained to handle this situation. If the exposure occurs in a facility that insists the student follow their procedures and seek treatment on site rather than at LLUMC Emergency Department, then the student should seek guidance from his or her supervising faculty member or preceptor as to what to do. 5. In incidents that involve a specific patient, that patient should be asked to accompany the student, or report on his or her own, to the LLUMC Emergency Department for evaluation as well (at no cost to the patient). 6. Within five days, in all exposure incidents involving another person, the supervising faculty member or preceptor must submit the incident report and the student's report\u2014detailing all subsequent actions taken\u2014to the Office of Student and Professional Affairs. 7. Students should cooperate with the evaluation, treatment, and follow-up recommendations made at the time of their exposure assessment. Expenses incurred for testing, counseling, and postexposure prophylaxis will be covered by Loma Linda University, provided: the BBP exposure was directly related to student activities, and the student followed the preceding outlined procedures. The National Clinicians' Prophylaxis Hot Line, 888/448-4911 (24 hour, toll-free) is available to help health care students exposed to blood-borne diseases on the job. Staffed by trained physicians, the toll-free number provides students and clinicians with advice on how to treat health care workers' accidental occupational exposure to BBP. The hotline operates out of San Francisco General Hospital and is run in collaboration with the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Questions about the BBP policy or procedures should be directed to school's Office of Student and Professional Affairs or the director of experiential education. CPR AND FIRST AID CERTIFICATION All students must be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and in first aid during their enrollment in the School of Pharmacy. The school will provide one training program for students during orientation week. If students fail to obtain the certification at that time, they are responsible for the additional costs required for certification. Participation in Operation Immunization and enrollment in the introductory or advanced pharmacy-practice 166 UNIVERSITY CATALOG experiences will not be allowed until both certifications are current. Financial Information The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies. Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by the dean. Any statement by individual faculty mem-bers, program directors, or department chairs in regard to these matters is not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installment are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic conditions warrant. GENERAL FINANCIAL PRACTICES The student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year. Previous accounts with other schools or this University must have been settled. DEPOSITS Upon notification of acceptance, the applicant must make a $500 deposit to hold a place in the class. This amount is deducted from the tuition and fees due at registration and is nonrefundable should an applicant decide not to register. SCHEDULE OF CHARGES 2006-2007 The charges that follow are subject to change without notice. CHARGES $30,600 Annual block tuition 10,200 Per quarter FEES $430 Per quarter, LLU enrollment fee: Health care insurance, Drayson Center membership, student activities, and publications MISCELLANEOUS $60 Application fee 500 Acceptance deposit: Nonrefundable, applicable to first quarter's tuition 500 Per quarter, estimated books and supplies 25 Returned-check processing fee 50 Late fee varies Applied music charges The School of Pharmacy's tuition does not include applied music charges. OTHER CHARGES $65 California Board of Pharmacy internship license (application, examination, fingerprinting, interim practice permit) ON- AND OFF-CAMPUS STUDENT HOUSING Students may go to <www.llu.edu/llu/housing> for housing information and a housing application form.

I am excited that you have demonstrated an interest in academic preparation for one of the world's most exciting careers. Our students and graduates are engaged in a worldwide struggle with problems that shorten life, reduce the quality of life, and consume valuable resources needed elsewhere. Air and water quality are poor in much of the world, famine still exists, and thousands\u2014many of them children\u2014die each year from rampaging diseases such as cholera, AIDS, dengue fever, and malnutrition. The sting of poverty still crushes three fifths of the world's population, who are forced to live on less than $2.00/day. Health disparities still plague our nation's minority populations, bringing significant and premature loss of life and burden of illness. Public health maintains a preventive and population-based approach to these problems. We view our constituency as whole communities. Loma Linda University's School of Public Health looks to prepare the next generation of Public Health leaders. We are looking for students who embrace critical thinking, who are not content with yesterday's explanations for today's questions, and who seek to make a difference in this world. We seek to understand the interplay between lifestyle and disease. We seek to make prevention of disease an art and a science. We strive to equip our students with the lifelong tools they will need to combat the insidious forces on this planet that tend to rob men and women of hope, dignity, and purposeful life. Our faculty will continue to refine our curriculum to keep it current with the needs of our profession. We will continue to expect more of every graduate, just as a suffering world expects more from us all. But at the end of your academic journey, you will know that you are more than prepared to meet this global challenge with skill, grace, and understanding. I invite you to examine our various programs and degree offerings. Find the program that best matches your interest and join us for the adventure of a lifetime. Our campus will offer the advantage of smaller class size, and thereby more opportunity to interact with faculty. We provide many avenues for our students to work in communities, both locally and internationally. This is your opportunity to equip yourself for a life of service and meaning. We welcome you to our family. x James Kyle, M.D., M.Div. Dean Mission, Goals, and Values Our Mission The mission of the School of Public Health reflects a distinctly Christian orientation and purpose in preparing students as public health professionals for local, national, and international service. The School integrates instruction, research, and service to achieve educational excellence. In keeping with its Seventh-day Adventist heritage, an integration of the physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions is encouraged. Our Goals The goals of the School of Public Health are to: 1. Educate public health professionals for service in local, national, and international settings. 2. Integrate public health practice with teaching and research in the careers of faculty and the education of students. 3. Expand and disseminate public health knowledge through research and scholarly activities. 4. Promote the development of positive personal-health habits in faculty, staff, and students as integral to spiritual values and Christian commitment. 5. Provide public health education through innovative programs to meet the needs of the sponsoring church and populations underserved by public health training and education. 6. Provide public health leadership within the University and the community. 7. Encourage responsible management of resources and the environment. 8. Provide appropriate consultation. 9. Encourage an educational environment supportive of diverse population groups. OUR VALUES The School of Public Health believes that the values held by the School and its faculty and staff\u2014and which it seeks to develop in its students\u2014are a consequence of a loving relationship between God and His created beings. This relationship is reflected in the following values: Compassion toward fellow human beings, creatures, and nature Acceptance of each individual as a priceless child of God Respect for the beliefs, ideas, opinions, and cultures of others Equity in interactions with all races, individuals, ethnicities, and cultures SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 171 Integrity by matching belief with action Faith in the outworking of God's ultimate purpose Wisdom in research, study, and service School Foundations History The School was begun in 1948 with the organization of the School of Tropical and Preventive Medicine, the purpose of which was to provide a base for research and teaching. After its reorganization in 1961, the Division of Public Health and Tropical Medicine began to offer master's degree programs through the Graduate School. Establishment of the School of Public Health was authorized in 1964, and plans were made for faculty and facilities to meet the requirements of the Committee on Professional Education of the American Public Health Association. In 1967 the School of Nutrition and Dietetics (which had been organized in 1922 as the School of Dietetics) became a department of the School of Public Health. The name of the School was changed to School of Health in October 1970. Because the meaning of the term \"public health\" has gradually broadened to emphasize lifestyle\u2014consistent with the goals of the School\u2014the original name, School of Public Health, was readopted in August 1987. The Center for Health Promotion, the Department of Preventive Medicine, and the Preventive Medicine Practice Group were merged into the School of Public Health in 1990. This resulted in expanded faculty and resources. Accreditation The School has maintained continuous accreditation since it was accredited at its inception in 1967 by the American Public Health Association. It is currently accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health, 800 Eye Street NW, Suite 202, Washington, D.C. 20001-1397. The School is also a member of the Association of Schools of Public Health. General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school. The subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs are outlined in Section IV. It is important to review specific program requirements (Section IV) in the context of the general requirements (Section III) applicable to all programs. Instructional Facilities Facilities for the School of Public Health\u2014offices, lecture and seminar rooms, teaching and research laboratories, work and storage areas\u2014are located mainly in and adjacent to Francis Nichol Hall. Additional offices and research facilities are located in Evans Hall and the Parkland Building. Departments and Centers The instructional, research, and service programs within the School are organized and administered by six academic departments and three centers. The departments are: environmental and occupational health, epidemiology and biostatistics, health administration, health promotion and education, global health, and nutrition. They are described in the appropriate section of this CATALOG. The three centers are: the Center for Health Promotion, the Center for Health Research, and the Center for Health and Development. In addition, the Office of Distance Learning offers degrees abroad and in an on-line modality. Center for Health Promotion (CHP) The center is a health-promotion-and-maintenance facility within the Adventist Health System/Loma Linda. It offers a wide spectrum of programs dealing with weight management, executive health, stress management, smoking cessation, nutrition, exercise, and alcohol and drug dependency. Group sessions, individual counseling, and health assessment are some of the aspects of the programs as they are conducted in the community or in a corporate setting. The CHP is a major training center for students. Center for Health Research (CHR) The center encourages involvement in research by identifying research opportunities and providing support in developing grant applications. It provides research and statistical services, monitors financial status of grants and research endowments, and provides focus for the research activities of the School by identifying research priorities. The research efforts of the School are consistent with its overall philosophy: protection, promotion, and preservation of human health through the harmonious development of one's mental, physical, and spiritual resources. It is the School's policy to encourage those research activities that are especially relevant to its mission and that utilize the natural abilities, special interests, and professional expertise of its faculty members. School of Public Health researchers concentrate on projects that examine the effects on health of various aspects of lifestyle\u2014including personal and cultural habits, as well as issues of health disparities. Of special importance is research directed toward those aspects of disease prevention in which health may be related to individual choices of life habits and lifestyle. The School makes special efforts to encourage research projects that are most likely to enrich the instructional program. In developing research projects, faculty members carefully consider how to encourage student involvement. The goal is to bring mutual benefit to the students' academic development and to the purposes of research. A wide variety of research methodologies are employed. These provide students with valuable experience through exposure to a broad spectrum 172 UNIVERSITY CATALOG of the techniques of scientific investigation. Substantive research findings are incorporated regularly into the teaching program. Center for Health And Development (CHD) The center facilitates the development of global and cross-cultural consultation and training activities for the School of Public Health, which has been designated a World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center for Primary Health Care and Human Resource Development. It assists the School in adapting its programs to the needs of international students, visiting scholars, and students who intend to pursue a global health career. Programs in global health draw upon the spectrum of expertise available in the University to produce services especially adapted to the needs of people in resource-scarce areas, including refugees, people in the inner cities, the rural poor, and people in the developing world. The School has been involved with many projects\u2014both service and training\u2014in Africa, Asia (including the People's Republic of China and the Indian subcontinent), Latin America, the Caribbean, eastern and southern Europe, and Oceania; as well as with underserved populations in the United States. Through a network of international schools of public health and medicine and through health care institutions, the School of Public Health also facilitates the exchange of curricular information, program planning, and faculty interaction to further enhance professional public health education globally. The CHD also serves the wider University community and the world as a primary resource center. Computer Center The School maintains two state-of-the-art computer laboratories. The Computer Center assists students in utilizing a variety of software programs and accessing on-line services relevant to students in all programs. Word processing, spreadsheet, graphics, statistical, nutritional, and other types of software are available for use.

According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 4.2 million deaths are attributable to tobacco use annually. In the U.S.A., more than 400,000 individuals (30 percent of cancer mortality) die from tobacco-related causes every year. Although a variety of strategies are being used to address the tobacco problem, there is a dearth of academic-based programs to educate health professionals who will function as effective practitioners and researchers in tobacco-use prevention and treatment. The purpose of this interdepartmental collaborative program is to train participants in tobacco research that effectively integrates theory and field-based experience. Upon completion of this certificate program, participants should be able to: Design a needs-assessment survey. Employ epidemiological and statistical research methods. Apply principles and methods in health education to foster behavior change. Plan, implement, and evaluate community-based programs. Advocate for policy change. Prepare a grant or contract proposal. Write publishable papers. Conduct strategic planning. Fitness instructor certification preparation For program details, see fitness instructor program in Section IV.

Carter Dean, School of Science and Technology SCHOOL FOUNDATIONS The School of Science and Technology (SST)\u2014one of Loma Linda University's newest schools\u2014includes the Departments of Earth and Biological Sciences, Counseling and Family Sciences, Psychology, and Social Work and Social Ecology. Many of the programs offered have matured on campus for a decade or more; one program was established half a century ago. The school offers degree programs through the doctoral level, postdegree certificates, and certificate programs in Chinese Studies and Spanish; as well as courses that meet the University's General Education requirements. Technology programs, such as instructional technology, are currently being developed by the school. PHILOSOPHY The School of Science and Technology is mission-driven and academically incorporates the University's commitment to the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ, which produces wholeness within transformed lives. Transformation is a lifelong faith and learning process\u2014a process committed to pursuit of the highest levels of scholarship, professionalism, and spiritual well-being. This pursuit seeks to understand and promote healthy minds, communities, social systems, families, and the environment. Wholeness for self and for others is central to a balance between mind, body and spirit. Such wholeness manifests itself in a life of service to humanity, to the environment, and to God. The School of Science and Technology values the time-honored and separate traditions in higher education for \"academic\" and \"professional\" programs and advocates the integration of knowledge bases and research focus between and among the \"pure\" and \"applied\" sciences. Philosophy In the School of Science and Technology of Loma Linda University, the essential concern of both faculty and students is the quest for meaning. Because this quest is served by knowledge, graduate students are obliged to achieve both broad and detailed mastery of their field of study. They also participate with the faculty in the process by which knowledge is augmented. Objectives The School of Science and Technology attempts to create an environment favorable to the pursuit of knowledge and meaning by: 1. Making available to graduate students who wish to study in a Seventh-day Adventist Christian setting the education necessary for scholarly careers in the sciences and the health professions. 2. Encouraging development of independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication. 3. Relating intellectual achievement to the service of mankind.

It is the applicant's responsibility to arrrange to have the transcripts\u2014including official English translations, if applicable\u2014sent directly to Admissions Processing. Transcripts that come via an intermediary are unacceptable. 3. A personal interview is often desirable and is required by some programs. The interview should be arranged with the coordinator of the program in which the student wishes to study. Acceptance procedure 1. When the program that the student wishes to enter has evaluated the applications and made its recommendation, the dean of the School of Science and Technology takes official action and notifies the applicant.The formal notice of admission is recorded and the student is then eligible to register in the School of Science and Technology. 2. As part of registration, accepted students will be asked to file with student health service a medical history with evidence of certain immunizations. 3. Transcripts of records and all other application documents are retained by the University and may not be withdrawn and used for any purpose. Records of students who do not enroll or who withdraw prior to completion are retained for two years from the date of original acceptance to the School of Science and Technology program. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS A four-year baccalaureate degree (or its equivalent) from an accredited college or university is a prerequisite for admission to the school of science and technology. Transcripts of the applicant's scholastic record should show appropriate preparation, in grades and content, for the curriculum chosen. Since there is some variation in the pattern of undergraduate courses prescribed by different programs, the student should note the specific requirements of the chosen program. Deficiencies may be fulfilled while enrolled; prerequisites must be completed prior to matriculation. Scholarship Applicants are expected to present an undergraduate record with a grade-point average of B (3.0) or better in the overall program and in the field of the major. Some students with an overall grade-point average between 2.5 and 3.0 may be admitted provisionally to graduate standing, provided the grades of the junior and senior years are superior or there is other evidence of capability. Graduate Record Examination Scores on the general test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) are required with applications for admission to many degree programs. New test scores are needed if it has been over five years since the last test was taken. New test scores are needed if it has been more than five years since the last test was taken. Applicants are advised to request information specific to their proposed program of study. For complete information about the GRE, please visit their website at <http://www.gre.org>; or write to Educational Testing Service, 1947 Center Street, Berkeley, CA 94701 (for the West); and P.O. Box 6000, Princeton, NJ 08541 (for the East). For GRE publications (including study materials) call 800/537-3160. When pressure of time makes it impossible to secure the results of the GRE or its alternatives, students seeking admission who have otherwise above-average achievement may be admitted provisionally, subject to review when the required test results are received. In such cases, test results are to be submitted within the first quarter of attendance. Certain programs with limited admissions may require the GRE results prior to acceptance, while some programs require the subject test. Please check student guides from individual programs for further information. Programs that do not require the GRE must submit one additional measure of a candidate's preparation for graduate study. This may be either an evaluation of critical essay writing skills, the Miller analogy test, or the results of a structured interview. Re-entrance Students who are currently enrolled in the School of Science and Technology may request transfer to a different program or a more advanced degree level by contacting the School of Science and Technology Admissions Office for information on an abbreviated application and instructions for submitting the appropriate supporting documents. Transcripts on file with the University are acceptable. English competence All international students are encouraged (particularly those who do not have an adequate score on TOEFL or MTELP or other evidence of English proficiency) to attend an intensive American Language Institute prior to entering their program because further study of English may be required to assure academic progress. FROM MASTER'S TO PH.D. DEGREE Bypassing master's degree A graduate student at this university may proceed first to a master's degree, If at the time of application the student wishes to qualify for the doctor of 190 UNIVERSITY CATALOG philosophy degree, this intention should be declared even if the first objective is a master's degree. If after admission to the master's degree program a student wishes to go on to the doctoral degree, an abbreviated application should be completed and submitted, along with appropriate supporting documents, to the School of Science and Technology Admissions Office. If the award of the master's degree is sought, the student will be expected to complete that degree before embarking on doctoral activity for credit. A student who bypasses the master's degree may be permitted, on the recommendation of the guidance committee and with the consent of the dean, to transfer courses and research that have been completed in the appropriate field and are of equivalent quality and scope to his/her doctoral program. Second master's degree A student who wishes to qualify for an additional master's degree in a different discipline may apply. The dean of the School of Science and Technology and the faculty of the program the student wishes to enter will consider such a request on its individual merits. Concurrent admission Students may not be admitted to a School of Science and Technology program while admitted to another program at this University or elsewhere. The exceptions to this are the combined-degrees programs, discussed in the following paragraph. Combined degrees The School of Science and Technology provides for concurrent registration for two degrees only in its combined ministry), and M.S./M.P.H. Concurrent application is required in some but not all of these: See Programs and Degrees in Section IV of this CATALOG. See Combined-Degrees Programs in Section IV. CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS The School of Science and Technology offers several postbaccalaureate certificate programs. Students accepted into such programs will be assigned to an adviser who will work with them as they fulfill the program requirements. Students will be required to maintain a B- (2.7) grade-point average, with no course grade below C (2.0). All certificate students are required to take at least one 3-unit religion course (numbered between 500 and 600). MASTER OF ARTS MASTER OF SCIENCE MASTER OF SOCIAL WORK Adviser and guidance committee Each student accepted into a degree program is assigned an adviser who helps to arrange the program of study to meet University requirements; subsequently (no later than when applying for candidacy), the student is put under the supervision of a guidance committee. This committee is responsible to and works with the coordinator of the student's program in arranging courses, screening thesis topics (where applicable), guiding research, administering final written and/or oral examinations, evaluating the thesis and other evidence of the candidate's fitness to receive the degree, and ultimately recommending the student for graduation. Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Gaps in an applicant's academic achievement will be identified by subject and classified either as prerequisites or as subject deficiencies. Applicants lacking certain subject or program prerequisites are not admitted to the master's degree program until the prerequisites are completed (at Loma Linda University or elsewhere) and acceptable grades are reported. However, subject deficiencies do not exclude an applicant from admission or enrollment; but they must be removed as specified by the adviser or dean, usually during the first full quarter of study at this University. Study plan The student's adviser should develop with the student a written outline of the complete graduate experience, with time and activity specified as fully as possible. This will serve as a guide to both the student and the adviser as well as to members of the guidance committee when it is selected. The study plan is changed only after careful consultation. The student is ultimately responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of all required courses. Time limit The time allowed from admission to the School of Science and Technology to conferring of the master's degree may not exceed five years. Some consideration may be given to a short extension of time if in the dean's opinion such is merited. Course credit allowed toward the master's degree is nullified seven years from the date of course completion. Nullified courses may be revalidated, upon successful petition, through reading, conferences, written reports, or examination to assure currency in the content. Residence Students must meet the residence requirements indicated for their particular program (never less than one academic quarter). The master's degree candidate must complete one quarter of full-time study at the University or perform the thesis research at the University. Although students may register for up to 12 units each quarter, a student is considered in full-time residence if registered for at least 8 units. Minimum required grade-point average The required minimum grade average is B (3.0) with no course grade below C (2.0) on all work for the master's degree. This average must be maintained in formal courses and in research, computed separately. A student submitting transfer credits must earn a B grade average on all work accepted for transfer and on all work taken at this University, computed separately. THE SCHOOL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 191 Research competence Student skills required in research- language, investigation, and computation are specified in each program description in this CATALOG. Comprehensive and final examinations The student must take the written, oral, and final examinations prescribed by the program on or before the published dates. If a candidate fails to pass the oral or written examination for a graduate degree, the committee files with the dean a written analysis of the candidates status, with recommendations reagaarding the student's future relation to the School. The student receives a copy of the committee's recommendation. Thesis Students writing a thesis must register for at least one unit of thesis credit. The research and thesis preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for candidacy. The student must register and pay tuition for thesis credit whether the work is done in residence or in absentia. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and thesis, continuous registration is to be maintained until the manuscript has been accepted. This involves a quarterly fee of $65 (2006-2007) paid at the beginning of each quarter. A similar continuing registration fee is assessed for each quarter the student fails to register for new units. Candidacy Admission to the School of Science and Technology or designation of regular graduate standing does not constitute admission of the student to candidacy for a graduate degree. After achieving regular status, admission to candidacy is initiated by a written petition (School of Science and Technology Form A) from the student to the dean, on recommendation of the student's adviser and the program coordinator or department chair. Students petitioning the School of Science and Technology for candidacy for the master's degree must present a satisfactory grade record, include a statement of the proposed thesis or dissertation topic (where applicable) that has been approved by the student's guidance committee, and note any other qualification prescribed by the program. Students are usually advanced to candidacy during the third quarter after entering their course of study toward a degree in the School of Science and Technology. Specific program requirements In addition to the foregoing, the student is subject to the requirements stated in the section of the CATALOG governing the specific program chosen. Religion requirement All master's degree students are required to take at least one 3-unit religion course. Courses (numbered between 500 and 600) in social ethics, bioethics, psychology of religion, and philosophy of religion meet this requirement. Combined-master's degrees programs A number of combined-degrees programs are offered, each intended to provide more comprehensive preparation in clinical applications and the biomedical sciences. Both require concurrent admission to two programs in the School of Science and Technology and/or a professional school in the University. These curricula are described in greater detail under the heading \"Combined-Degrees Programs\" in Section IV of the CATALOG. THESIS AND DISSERTATION The student's research and thesis or dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as is feasible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. Format guide Instructions for the preparation and format of the publishable paper, thesis, or dissertation are in the \"Thesis and Dissertation Format Guide,\" available through the Faculty of Graduate Studies dissertation editor. Consultation with the dissertation editor can help the student avoid formatting errors that would require him/her to retype large sections of manuscript. The last day for submitting copies to the school office in final approved form is published in the Events Calendar (available from the academic dean's office). Binding The cost of binding copies of the thesis or dissertation to be deposited in the University library and appropriate department or school collection will be paid for by the student's department. The student will be responsible for paying the cost of binding additional personal copies. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy degree is awarded for evidence of mature scholarship; productive promise; and active awareness of the history, resources, and demands of a specialized field. Adviser and guidance committee Each student, upon acceptance into a degree program, is assigned an adviser who helps arrange the study program. Subsequently (no later than when applying for candidacy), the student is put under the supervision of a guidance committee. The School of Science and Technology requires advisers for Doctor of Philosophy degree candidates to have demonstrated consistent research productivity in their chosen disciplines. Each program maintains a list of qualified doctoral degree mentors. The guidance committee, usually chaired by the adviser, is responsible to and works with the coordinator of the student's program in arranging course sequences, screening dissertation topics, recommending candidacy, guiding research, administering written and oral examinations, evaluating the dissertation/project and other evidence 192 UNIVERSITY CATALOG of the candidate's fitness to receive the degree, and recommending the student for graduation. Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Gaps in an applicant's academic achievement will be identified by subjects and classified as either prerequisites or as subject deficiencies. Applicants lacking subject or program prerequisites are not admitted to the Ph.D. degree program until the prerequisites are completed (at Loma Linda University or elsewhere) with acceptable grades. Subject deficiencies do not exclude an applicant from admission or enrollment; but they must be removed as specified by the adviser or dean, usually at the beginning of the graduate experience at this University. Study plan The student's adviser should develop with the student a written outline of the complete graduate experience, with time and activity specified as fully as possible. This serves as a guide to both the student and the adviser as well as to members of the guidance committee when it is selected. The study plan is changed only after careful consultation. The student is ultimately responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of required courses. Time limit Completion of the graduate experience signals currency and competence in the discipline. The dynamic nature of the biological sciences makes dilatory or even leisurely pursuit of the degree unacceptable. Seven years are allowed for completion after admission to the Ph.D. degree program. Extension of time may be granted on petition if recommended by the guidance committee to the dean of the School of Science and Technology. Course credit allowed toward the doctorate is nullified eight years from the date of course completion. Nullified courses may be revalidated, upon successful petition, through reading, conference, written reports, or examination to assure currency in the content. Residence The School of Science and Technology requires two years of residency for the doctoral degrees\u2014D.M.F.T, Psy.D., Ph.D.\u2014spent on the campus of the University after enrollment in a doctoral degree program. During residence, students devote full time to graduate activity in courses, research, or a combination of these. A full load of courses is 8 or more units each quarter; 36 or more clock hours per week is full time in research. Students may be advised to pursue studies for limited periods at special facilities not available at Loma Linda University. Such time may be considered residence if the arrangement is approved in advance by the dean of the School of Science and Technology. The spirit and demands of doctoral degree study require full-time devotion to courses, research, reading, and reflection. But neither the passage of time nor preoccupation with study assures success. Evidence of high scholarship and original contribution to the field or professional competence form the basis for determining the awarding of the degree. Minimum required grade-point average Students must maintain a grade-point average of at least a B (3.0) to continue in regular standing toward the doctorate. This average is to be computed separately for courses and research. Courses in which a student earns a grade between C (2.0) and B (3.0) may or may not apply toward the degree, at the discretion of the guidance committee. A student submitting transfer credits must earn a B average on all work accepted for transfer credit and on all work taken at this University, computed separately. Clinical probation Programs with a clinical component may recommend that the student be placed on clinical probation. Details are contained in the program guides for the programs concerned. Research competence Doctoral degree students demonstrate research competence by their investigative activities. Expectations and standards of achievement with the tools of investigation, natural and synthetic languages, and computers are specified for each program in Section IV of this CATALOG . Comprehensive examinations The doctoral degree candidate is required to take comprehensive written and oral examinations over the principal areas of study to ascertain capacity for independent, productive, scientific work; and to determine whether further courses are required before the final year of preparation for the doctorate is undertaken. The program coordinator is responsible for arranging preparation and administration of the examination, as well as its evaluation and subsequent reports of results. Success in the comprehensive examination is a prerequisite to candidacy (see below). Students cannot be admitted to the examination until the following requirements have been met: demonstrated reading knowledge of one foreign language, if applicable; completed the majority of units required beyond the master's degree or its equivalent. The final oral examination After completion of the dissertation and not later than a month before the date of graduation, the doctoral degree candidate is required to appear before an examining committee for the final oral examination. If a candidate fails to pass this final examination for a graduate degree, the examining committee files with the dean a written analysis of the candidate's status, with recommendations about the student's future relation to the School. The student receives a copy of the committee's recommendation. Project (required for the Doctor of Psychology degree) All Doctor of Psychology degree students must register for at least 1 unit of project credit. This should be done in the last quarter of registration prior to completion. The research and project preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such THE SCHOOL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 193 approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and project, continuous registration is maintained until the manuscript is accepted. This involves a quarterly fee of $65 (2005-2006) paid during registration each quarter. A similar continuing registration fee is assessed for each quarter the student fails to register for new units. Dissertation (required for the Doctor of Philosophy degree) All doctoral students must register for at least 1 unit of dissertation credit. This should be done in the last quarter of registration prior to completion. The research and dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. Consultation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies dissertation editor can prevent the student from committing formatting errors that would require retyping large sections of the manuscript. Students register and pay tuition for the dissertation whether the work is done in residence or in absentia. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and dissertation, continuous registration is maintained until the manuscript is accepted. This involves a quarterly fee of $65 (2005-2006), paid during registration each quarter. A similar continuing registration fee is assessed for each quarter the student fails to register for new units. Doctoral dissertations are reported to University Microfilms International and to the National Opinion Research Center. The Faculty of Graduate Studies office provides appropriate information and forms. Candidacy Admission to the School of Science and Technology does not constitute candidacy for a graduate degree. Admission to candidacy is initiated by a written petition (School of Science and Technology Form A) from the student to the dean, with support from the student's adviser and the program chair. The student's petition for candidacy for the Doctor of Philosophy degree will include, in addition, confirmation that comprehensive written and oral examinations have been passed. Students expecting the award of the doctorate at a June graduation should have achieved candidacy no later than the previous November 15. One full quarter must be allowed between the achievement of candidacy and the quarter of completion. Specific program requirements Doctoral programs differ from each other. The unique program requirements appear in the programs section of this CATALOG (Section IV) and in the program guides available from specific departments. Religion requirement All doctoral students take at least one 3-unit religion course. Courses (numbered between 500 and 600) in social ethics, bioethics, psychology of religion, and philosophy of religion meet this requirement. Combined-degrees programs A number of combined-degrees programs are offered, each intended to provide additional preparation in clinical, professional, or basic areas related to the student's field of interest. All require concurrent admission to the School of Science and Technology and a professional school in the University. These curricula are described in greater detail below under the heading Combined-Degrees Programs, Section IV. The combined-degrees programs provide opportunity for especially well-qualified and motivated students to pursue professional and graduate education; and to prepare for careers in clinical specialization, teaching, or investigation of problems of health and disease in man. For admission to a combined-degrees program, the student must have a baccalaureate degree; must qualify for admission to the School of Science and Technology; and must already be admitted to the School of Medicine, the School of Dentistry, Faculty of Religion, or the School of Public Health. Application may be made at any point in the student's progress in the professional school, though it is usually made during the sophomore year. Students in this curriculum study toward the M.A., M.S., M.S.W., Psy.D. or Ph.D. degree. Students may be required to interrupt their professional study for two or more years (as needed) for courses and research for the graduate degree sought. Elective time in the professional school may be spent in meeting School of Science and Technology requirements. The student's concurrent status is regarded as continuous until the program is completed or until discontinuance is recommended by the School of Science and Technology or the professional school. The usual degree requirements apply. Master of Science in marital and family therapy with Master of Public Health Master of Science in marital and family therapy with Master of Arts in clinical ministry These two combined-degrees programs allow the M.P.H. or M.A. degree student in clinical ministry to dual-count units with the master's degree in marital and family therapy. This enables the student to be awarded the combined-degrees in less time than would be required by the separate programs. Master of Social Work with Master of Public Health This combined-degrees program earns the student an M.S.W. in social work with an M.P.H. in maternal, and child health or global health. See Section IV. Master of Arts in biomedical and clinical ethics with Doctor of Psychology This combined-degrees program gives the psychology student the opportunity to be enriched through the study and understanding of ethical issues, 194 UNIVERSITY CATALOG as is recommended by the American Psychological Association. It also adds the psychological component often missing in the field of biomedical ethics. Doctor of Public Health with Doctor of Psychology The program enables a Dr.P.H. degree student to meet his/her elective and religion requirements with appropriate courses from the Psy.D. degree program, and allows work on the dissertation in an area that is acceptable for the Psy.D. project\u2014thus obtaining the combined-degrees in less time than is required by the separate programs. See Combined-Degrees Programs, Section IV. Student Life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief.

Anthony J. Zuccarelli Dean FOUNDATIONS OF GRADUATE STUDY Recognizing the need to provide advanced education, the College of Medical Evangelists (CME) organized its School of Graduate Studies in 1954. The new school conferred a Ph.D. degree in 1958, the first Ph.D. to be awarded by a Seventh-day institution of higher education. In 1961 when CME became Loma Linda University, the University assumed oversight of the graduate education conducted by La Sierra College in Riverside, California. By 1963 the School of Graduate Studies had been renamed the Graduate School, with a home in a new building, named Frederick Griggs Hall, in honor of a former department chair. The two campuses comprising Loma Linda University\u2014La Sierra and Loma Linda\u2014were separated in 1990. In 2005 the Graduate School was restructured as the Faculty of Graduate Studies. It continues to provide oversight of graduate programs, supported by other schools of the University; promotes and encourages independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication; and relates intellectual achievements to the service of mankind. PHILOSOPHY In the Faculty of Graduate Studies of Loma Linda University, the essential concern of both faculty and students is the quest for meaning. Because this quest is served by knowledge, graduate students are obliged to achieve both broad and detailed mastery of their field of study. They also participate with the faculty in the process by which knowledge is augmented. OBJECTIVES The Faculty of Graduate Studies attempts to create an environment favorable to the pursuit of knowledge and meaning by: 1. Making available to graduate students who wish to study in a Seventh-day Adventist Christian setting the education necessary for scholarly careers in the sciences and the health professions. 2. Encouraging development of independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication. 3. Relating intellectual achievement to the service of mankind. General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school. The subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs are outlined in Section IV. It is important to review specific program requirements (Section IV) in the context of the general requirements (Section III) applicable to all programs. FACULTY OF GRADUATE STUDIES 199 Application and Admissions The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committees of the schools accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant qualities of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. Scholarship Applicants are expected to present an undergraduate record with a grade-point average of B (3.0) or better in the overall program and in the field of the major. Some students with an overall grade-point average between 2.5 and 3.0 may be admitted provisionally to graduate standing, provided the grades of the junior and senior years are superior or there is other evidence of capability. FROM MASTER'S TO PH.D. DEGREE Bypassing master's degree A graduate student at this University may proceed first to a master's degree. If at the time of application the student wishes to qualify for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, this intention should be declared even if the first objective is a master's degree. If after admission to the master's degree program a student wishes to go on to the doctoral degree, an application form should be submitted, along with letters of reference, to the dean of the respective school(s). If the award of the master's degree is sought, the student will be expected to complete that degree before embarking on doctoral activity for credit. A student who bypasses the master's degree may be permitted, on the recommendation of the guidance committee and with the consent of the dean, to transfer courses and research that have been completed in the appropriate field and are of equivalent quality and scope to his/her doctoral program.

Yours in service, David L. Taylor, D.Min. Interim Dean Associate Dean To communicate with the Faculty of Religion\u2014 E-mail: dltaylor@llu.edu Web site: http://www.llu.edu/llu/fr/ HISTORY In the configuration of Loma Linda University as a health-sciences university, the role of religion as integrative in each of the programs of the University is mandated and continuously affirmed by the University administration and the Board of Trustees. In July of 1990, the Faculty of Religion (originally the School of Religion) was established to assist in this integration. PHILOSOPHY As implied by its motto, \"TO MAKE MAN WHOLE,\" the University affirms these tenets as central to its view of education: God is the creator and sustainer of the universe. Mankind's fullest development entails a growing understanding of the individual in relation to both God and society. The quest for truth and professional expertise, in an environment permeated by religious values, benefits the individual and society and advances the ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. MISSION STATEMENT The Faculty of Religion is committed to the following four tasks as informed by the teachings and practice of the Seventh-day Adventist heritage and mission: 1. To promote Christian wholeness for faculty and students in their personal and professional lives and witness. 2. To provide a religion curriculum with the following emphases: Theological studies (biblical, historical, doctrinal, mission, and philosophical). Ethical studies. Relational studies (applied theology, clinical ministry, and psychology of religion). 3. To foster and support research in theological, ethical, and relational disciplines. 4. To serve the University, the church, and the larger world community by personal involvement in fostering deeper spirituality, theological integrity, and social justice. General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school. The subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs are outlined in Section IV. It is important to review specific program requirements (Section IV) in the context of the general requirements (Section III) applicable to all programs. FACULTY OF RELIGION 203 Application and Admissions The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committees of the schools accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant qualities of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. APPLICATION AND ACCEPTANCE Where to write Inquiries regarding application and admission should be addressed to: Office of Admissions Faculty of Religion Loma Linda University Loma Linda, CA 92350 Application procedure 1. Two copies of the graduate application should be filled out and mailed, together with the application fee, to the above address.

Some programs require applications to be completed by a much earlier date. 2. Two complete official transcripts of all academic records from all colleges, universities, and professional or technical schools should be provided. It is the applicant's responsibility to arrange to have the transcripts, including official English translations if applicable, sent directly by the registrar of each school attended to the Faculty of Religion Office of Admissions. Transcripts that come via an intermediary are unacceptable. 3. A personal interview is often desirable and should be arranged with the coordinator of the program in which the student wishes to study. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS A four-year baccalaureate degree (or its equivalent) from an accredited college or university is a prerequisite for admission to the Faculty of Religion. Transcripts of the applicant's scholastic record should show appropriate preparation, in grades and content, for the curriculum chosen. Since there is some variation in the pattern of undergraduate courses prescribed by different programs, the student should note the specific requirements of the chosen program. Deficiencies may be removed while enrolled; prerequisites must be completed prior to acceptance into the program. Scholarship Applicants are expected to present an undergraduate record with a grade point average of B (3.00) or better in the overall program and in the field of the major. Some students with an overall grade point average between 2.50 and 3.00 may be admitted provisionally to graduate standing, provided the grades of the junior and senior years are superior, or there is other evidence of capability. Academic probation Degree students whose cumulative G.P.A. at the end of any quarter is less than 3.0 will be placed on academic probation. The number of units for subsequent registrations is restricted to a maximum of 12 per quarter. Students who are on academic probation and fail to make a 3.0 for the next quarter, or who fail to have a 3.0 G.P.A. overall after two quarters, jeopardize their standing in a degree or certificate program and may be dismissed from school. Concurrent admission Students may not be admitted to a Faculty of Religion program while admitted to another program at this University or elsewhere. The exception to this is the combined-degrees programs, discussed in Section IV of this CATALOG under Combined-Degrees Programs. Financial Information The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies. Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by the dean. Any statement by individual faculty members, program directors, or department chairs in regard to these matters is not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installment are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic conditions warrant. ON- AND OFF-CAMPUS STUDENT HOUSING Students may go to <www.llu.edu/llu/housing> for housing information and a housing application form.

WRIGHT, Program Coordinator The Biomedical Sciences Certificate Program provides an opportunity for qualified students to register for selected graduate and professional level courses in the biomedical sciences. These courses are identical to those taken by students in the professional degree programs. The program is intended to strengthen the student's preparation for professional training in medicine or dentistry. It is also a program that will provide postbaccalaureate experience in the rapidly changing area of biomedical sciences. As such, it will provide an avenue for the completion of postbaccalaureate certification in secondary education or health science-related disciplines. FACULTY Faculty for the program are drawn from programs associated with the basic science departments of the School of Medicine and the School of Dentistry, and with the Department of Natural Sciences in the School of Science and Technology. POSTBACCALAUREATE CERTIFICATE Admission Students entering the program will have completed a baccalaureate degree (or its equivalent) meeting the criteria outlined under the Admission Information section of this CATALOG. Completion of a postgraduate BIOSTATISTICS\u2014PH 219 standardized test, such as the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), or Dental Admission Test (DAT) is required. The particular examination required is dependent upon the track of study desired, i.e., the DAT if the interest is in dentistry. Students who have applied to a program in medicine or dentistry and have been denied acceptance are given priority. Acceptance to the program is highly competitive. Course of study Students will be required to complete at least 28 quarter units selected from courses in consultation with the program coordinator. At least 3 units of religion are required for the certificate program. The program commences in the Autumn Quarter and terminates at the end of Spring Quarter. The program may include 1 unit of appropriate seminar and up to 6 units of research. Since many of the courses require specific prerequisites, students are expected to have completed these prior to application. Most of the courses offered are sequenced\u2014therefore, effectively prohibiting entry once a track has begun. Courses completed for the certificate with a grade of B (3.0) or better can be applied to degree programs offered by the Faculty of Graduate Studies upon presentation of a petition for academic variance to the dean of the school. Although several of the courses may share lecture experience and examinations with programs of the Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, such courses cannot be transferred. A student subsequently admitted to an M.D. or a D.D.S. degree program must repeat and pay for these courses as part of the normal curriculum for these degree programs.

Chand Dorothy Clark-Brooks Gerald Corey Lolita Domingue Dinah Evans Carla Gober Suzanne Hanna Hattendorf Gayle Helenski Doris Hubbard Sandra May-Leggitt Michelle Minyard Mary Moline Hiram Rivera-Toro Randall Lee Roberts Claudia Ronaldson Lorraine Thompson Cheryl Simpson Joyce Volsch Randall Walker Colwick Wilson The Child Life Specialist prepares individuals to provide child life services in health care settings. Child life services strive to promote optimum development of children and their families, to maintain normal living patterns, and to minimize emotional trauma. As integral members of the health care team in both the ambulatory care and inpatient settings, child life staff provides children opportunities for gaining a sense of mastery, for play, for learning, for self-expression, for family involvement, and for peer interaction. CHILD LIFE SPECIALIST\u2014ST 225 Mission* The mission of a child life specialist is to meet the needs of infants, children, youth, and families in times of stressful or traumatic life events and situations. The philosophy and practice of child life will be applicable to any health care setting and transferable to other environments or situations in which the potential for infants, children, and youth to cope, learn, and master is placed at risk. The services provided by the child life profession will be wholistic and preventive and will utilize applied child-development and family-systems theory. The objectives of such services will be to minimize the negative impact of situational disruptions while maintaining normalcy in growth, development, and family-systems relationships. The child life profession has developed since the 1920s to improve health care experiences for children by providing play, preparation, and educational pro-grams. These child life services are necessary for pro-moting the emotional stability and healthy development of hospitalized children while mitigating the pain and fear associated with treatment. The child life specialist is an early and ardent advocate of frequent family visits and parental participation in the care of the child. Individuals who receive child life specialist certfication are qualified to apply for professional level certification from the Child Life Certifying Committee. The national child life certification fosters unform and improved standards of practice and ethical conduct while it enhances the status and credibility of the profession. *Adapted from the Child Life Council Web site (CLCC) The programs The Child Life Specialist Program leading to an M.S. degree or certificate is offered by the School of Science and Technology's Department of Counseling and Family Sciences through the Marital and Family Therapy Program.

Zappia A student who has an interest in science, an investigative mind that enjoys the challenge of solving problems quickly and accurately, and a desire to help others should consider a career as a clinical laboratory scientist. Clinical laboratory scientists examine and analyze body fluids, tissues, and cells. They look for bacteria, parasites, or other microorganisms; analyze the chemical content of fluids; match blood for transfusions; and test for drug levels in the blood to show how a patient is responding to treatment. Clinical laboratory scientists perform complex chemical, biological, hematological, immunologic, microsopic, and bacteriologic tests. They use, maintain, and troubleshoot sophisticated laboratory equipment that is used to perform diagnostic tests. The clinical laboratory scientist possesses the scientific and diagnostic skills required for DNA and biomolecular technology and genetic engineering applications, analyzes these test results, and discusses them with the medical staff. Opportunities Employment of clinical laboratory workers is expected to parallel the growth of other health care occupations through the year 2010, particularly as the volume of laboratory tests increases with population growth and with the development of new technology. Employment opportunities are excellent, with current vacany rates of 12 percent. The twenty-first century is offering clinical laboratory scientists new avenues for test development, experimental design, administration, and education. Clinical laboratory scientists work in hospitals or similar medical facilities, clinical and reference labora-tories, home-health diagnostics, transfusion services, physicians' offices, and private medical clinics. Employment is also available in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, health information systems, DNA-technology and genetic engineering corporations, research laboratories, federal government agencies, forensics and crime investigation, veterinary hospitals, U.S. Public Health Service facilities, areas of medical-product development, in customer and patient education. The program The Clinical Laboratory Science Program is a two-year professional program that culminates in a Bachelor of Science degree. Prerequisite courses may be taken at any accredited college or university, and are completed during the freshman and sophomore years. Accepted students transfer into the program at the junior-year level, which begins in August during the postsummer session. After satisfactory completion of the program, the student is awarded a Bachelor of Science degree and is eligible to take the state and national board examinations and to become a registered clinical laboratory scientist. The junior year is a ten-month program of lecture and laboratory. Emphasis is on the basic clinical science courses, including theory and correlations. The senior year is a ten-month clinical practicum that provides professional clinical experience in the hospital laboratory environ-ment. Emphasis is on technical proficiency, application of theory to patient care, laboratory organization, and managerial skills. Senior students must coordinate their time with the operation of Loma Linda University Medical Center's clinical laboratory and with supplemental affiliate training laboratories in the community. Clinical affiliations Multiple clinical affiliations enrich the student's clinical training by providing exposure to procedures in different types of medical facilities. During the forty-week clinical practicum, supplemental training may be scheduled at any of the following clinical sites: 228 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Primary Affiliation: Loma Linda University Medical Center Loma Linda, California Supplemental Affiliations: Blood Bank of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties San Bernardino, California Community Hospital of San Bernardino San Bernardino, California Hoag Memorial Hospital Newport Beach, California Jerry L.

CLINICAL MINISTRY\u2014M.A. The Clinical Ministry Program leading to a Master of Arts degree encourages students to explore the theological, biblical, and historical roots of ministry within the institutional setting; and to prepare for the practice of such ministry. The program is especially valuable as prepara-tion for careers in chaplaincy and other fields of ministry. It is specifically designed for three types of students: 1. Those at the beginning of their professional lives; 2. Those pursuing this degree in order to enhance or shift their existing careers; and 3. Those pursuing this degree as a steppingstone to further study. This degree furthers educationin caring for the whole person. The student will develop clinical skills applicable to contemporary ministry. The program includes education in two areas: academic and clinical. Academic preparation is provided by the Faculty of Religion and other cooperating departments within the University. Settings providing clinical opportunities for training in institutional ministry include: Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC), Loma Linda University Behavioral Medicine Center (BMC), and the Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans Medical Center. 232 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Loma Linda University Medical Center, under the auspices of the Department of Chaplain Services, is an accredited Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) Center. Students admitted to the Clinical Ministry Program may apply for this clinical placement. (Separate application procedures are required.) Program objectives The objectives of the Clinical Ministry Program are to: 1. Develop persons skilled in the practiceof ministry in both routine and critical settings. 2. Expose students to a wide range of biblical, theological, and practical material pertinent to the field. 3. Provide a broadly based education in ministry, with specific focus on the practice of ministry. 4. Prepare students for membership in various professional organizations, such as the American Association of Pastoral Counselors (AAPC), the Association for Clinical Pastoral Education (ACPE), the Association of Professional Chaplains (APC), etc. 5. Contribute positively to the formation of the student's pastoral skills. Admission In addition to meeting admission requirements for the Faculty of Religion, the applicant to the Clinical Ministry Program must: 1. Propose clear personal and professional goals and ways in which the program in clinical ministry may facilitate their realization; 2. Persuade the Admissions Committee, by previous accomplishments, that s/he is able and willing to reach these goals and to make a distinguished contribution to the field. Course requirements In order to receive the Master of Arts degree in clinical ministry from Loma Linda University, the student will complete a minimum of 48 units of course work as herein specified, with an overall grade-point average of B or better, with no grade lower than a C and with no grade in a core course lower than a B-.

Clinical internship Students must also satisfactorily complete an approved, 400-hour clinical internship (RELG 695). The program recommends that this requirement be met by the satisfactory completion of one quarter of clinical pastoral education (CPE) at an accredited CPE center. (Note: Acceptance into a quarter of CPE is at the discretion of the CPE supervisor and must be arranged individually and in advance.) The expectation of the program is that all students will complete all course work before entering the clinical internship. In certain cases, however, a student may petition the coordinator of the program to take the clinical internship out of sequence. Even in such cases, the recommen-dation is that RELR 565, RELR 567, and RELR 568 be completed before entering the clinical internship. Students who wish to receive academic credits for their clinical internship may register for RELR 524 Clinical Pastoral Education. If taken as a selective, this course may account for a maximum of 6 academic units. After the 400-hour segment, a clinical evaluation form must be submitted to the program coordinator. Comprehensive examination Each student must pass a comprehensive examination. This examination will test the student's ability to integrate and apply knowledge from the overall program. This examination must be successfully completed before the student defends a thesis, project, or papers. Thesis, project, or publishable papers Each student must either prepare a thesis while registered for RELR 698, or prepare a project while registered for RELR 696, or prepare two major papers of publishable quality. Independent research for either the thesis or the project is done while registered for RELR 697. The project option must be designed and implemented within the confines of the program and under the auspices and direction of the program coordinator. The student must provide an oral defense of the thesis, a project, or two major papers. By the time students complete 12 quarter units in the program, they must declare whether they intend to complete a thesis, a project, or two major papers.

Coding Specialist\u2014AH (certificate) DIANA S. MEDAL, Program Coordinator FACULTY Diana S. Medal Terri L. Rouse ADVISORY COMMITTEE Rita M. Stiffler, Chair Darlene Downs Carel Hanson Melissa Hingula Health care facilities need coders who accurately select ICD-9-CM codes, CPT codes, and DRG and APC assignments for diagnostic and surgical information recorded in health records. In most instances, financial reimbursement is directly tied to these numeric codes. The statistical information generated from these codes is also used in research, quality improve-ment in patient care, education, and adminstrative decision making. Opportunities Coding specialists are in demand in acute-care and ambulatory-care facilities, physician's office practices, and long-term care facilities. A variety of government agencies require coding expertise as well. The need for accurate, skilled coders is acute in California and throughout the nation. Information about job opportunities is made available to alumni as it becomes available. The program The Coding Specialist Certificate is a nine-quarter certificate program. Classes meet once a week on Tuesday evenings. The last two quarters of the program consist of an internship-like laboratory experience, HLCS 261, 262 Coding Practicum I, II. These practicums meet twice a week in the evenings. Prior to beginning coding courses, the student is introduced to health care records, confidentiality, ethics, and pharmacology. Professional certification Upon successful completion of the program, the student is eligible to take the national certification examination of the American Health Information Management Association; however, three years of coding experience is recommended before taking this certificate examination. The program objectives Upon completion of the program, the graduate should be qualified to: 1. Use with understanding the instructions in format, organization, and mechanics of the ICD-9-CM, CPT, and E & M coding systems. 2. Code with accuracy and consistency. 3. Analyze medical records to identify `significant medical conditions and surgical procedures; correctly select the principal diagnosis and procedure; and appropriately sequence other diagnoses, complications, and procedures. 4. Supervise health-data collection and processing through coding, indexing, and maintaining disease and operation statistics. 5. Develop policies and procedures for coding, including a plan for coding quality. 6. Follow federal, state, and professional association guidelines for coding in the health care environment. 7. Understand the concepts of the prospective payment system and perform diagnostic-related group and ambulatory-patient classification assignments using decision trees and computerized patient-data groupers. 8. Delineate the difference between optimization of coding in compliance with governmental regulations and fraudulent coding.

Counseling\u2014ST (M.S.) CHERYL SIMPSON, Program Coordinator for M.S. in counseling and school counseling certificate (PPS credential) FACULTY Jennifer Andrews Karen Carlson Ian P. Chand Dorothy Clark-Brooks Gerald Corey Lolita Domingue Dinah Evans Carla Gober Suzanne Hanna Hattendorf Gayle Helenski Doris Hubbard Sandra May-Leggitt Michelle Minyard Mary Moline Hiram Rivera-Toro Randall Lee Roberts Claudia Ronaldson Lorraine Thompson Cheryl Simpson Joyce Volsch Randall Walker Colwick Wilson The Master of Science degree in counseling is a 72-unit program designed to give graduate students a broad background in mental health counseling and to prepare them for the Cali-fornia pupil personnel services credential in school counseling. This degree is an integral part of Loma Linda University's mission, as illustrated by the Good Samaritan sculpture on the mall of the campus. The sculpture depicts the biblical parable told by Jesus in Luke 10:30-37, which contrasts indifference and ethnic pride with attitudes of empathy and compassion. The pupil personnel services credential in school counseling began as a profession in the early 1900s when vocational guidance emerged as a response to America's industrial revolution and to the advisement needs of veterans with educational benefits. Over the next century, school counselors became vital members of the mental-health community as more responsibility for at-risk children, adolescents, and young adults was shifted to education. The California pupil personnel services (PPS) credential in school counseling can be obtained by students pursuing the M.S. degree in counseling (72 units) or those wishing to add a 28 -unit certificate to their 78-unit M.S. degree in marital and family therapy. Mission and curriculum Guided by the University's mission of whole-person health care, California's new standards for school counseling, and the expanding nature of professional collaboration in mental health, the counseling curriculum is organized into the following three domains. I Educational foundations and beliefs II Theoretical and cognitive competence III Counseling competence and commitment to service Each candidate is expected to combine the knowledge and skills learned throughout these domains with an understanding of the University's mission to formulate a well-thought-out, clearly articulated personal belief system which is demonstrated in ethical values and behaviors. Development of this personal epistemology requires each candidate to examine lifelong-learning related to meaning, purpose, hope, and service. These issues include: Beliefs about the nature, origin, and future of humans Equality and inclusion Honoring personal and cultural values with sensitivity toward diversity Influence of religious traditions and communities of faith Integrity toward self and others Sources of strength and renewal Spirit of generosity Competence and conscientiousness CRIMINAL JUSTICE\u2014ST 235 ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS Entrance: Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer Quarters Minimum G.P.A. 3.0 (on 4.0 scale) in bachelor's degree or final 45 units of program Official transcripts of college work Prerequisite courses: statistics and abnormal psychology Three letters of reference Statement of purpose Interview with faculty PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS (72 units) DOMAIN I PREREQUISITE: GENERAL STATISTICS (3) Educational foundations and beliefs Foundational courses in learning theory, educational psychology, sociocultural competence, research, and statistics are considered foundational to building competence as a school counselor. These courses include the following: COUN 501 Research: Quantitative (3) COUN 502 Research: Qualitative (3) COUN 545 Gender Perspectives (2) COUN 547 Social Ecology in Development (3) COUN 574 Psychological Foundations of Education (4) MFAM 535 Case Presentation and ProfessionalStudies (4) RELR 564 Religion, Marriage, and Family (3) DOMAIN II PREREQUISITE: ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY(3) Theory and cognitive competence Candidates are challenged with a variety of theoretical constructs from which to develop an approach to counseling that is compatible with their own belief systems and personhood. They are expected to learn how to deconstruct theories, critically evaluate them, and create a foundation upon which to build their professional skills and relationships. Courses include: COUN 575 Counseling Theory and Applications (3) COUN 556 Psychopathology and Diagnosis Procedures (3) COUN 568 Groups: Process and Practice (3) COUN 576 Exceptional and Medically Challenged Children (3) COUN 577 Assessment in Counseling (3) COUN 584 Advanced Child and Adolescent Development (3) COUN 674 Human Sexual Behavior (3) DOMAIN III Counseling competence and commitment to service The counseling program is based on the assumption that counseling competence deve- lops from the foundational knowledge, personal epistemologies, and theoretical understanding learned in Domains I and II. Another assumption is that competence embraces the concept of service. Activities involving case study and field experience are designed to emphasize service and the development of altruism. By helping K-12 pupils sense the dimensions of personal need and worth in others, candidates grow in their ability to respond with compassion, empathy, and cultural competence. Working in education, school counselors help K-12 students in their personal development, career preparation, and academic achievement in order to become lifelong learners. Courses in this domain include: COUN 514 Cross-Cultural Counseling (2) COUN 515 Crisis Intervention Counseling (3) COUN 578 College and Career Counseling (3) COUN 678 Consultation and Leadership (3) COUN 679 School Counseling: History and Practice (3) COUN 614 Law and Ethics (3) COUN 624 Individual and Systems Assessment (3) COUN 638 Family Therapy and Chemical Abuse (3) COUN 644 Child Abuse and Family Violence (3) COUN 680A, B, Field Experience Supervision in Counseling: 600 hours (3) Criminal Justice\u2014ST (M.S.)\u2014ST EDWARD COCHRANE, Program Coordinator Crime disrupts personal and community relationships, endangers public health and safety, and threatens the moral contours of everyday social life. Loma Linda University's mission \"to make man whole\" provides a powerful and much-needed context in which criminal justice can be addressed on the basis of healing and restoration. The principles of restorative justice elevate the dimensions of justice that: promote the acceptance of responsibility, promote the fulfillment of obligations, embrace forgiveness and reconciliation, and culminate in the restoration of personal and social relationships. This multidisciplinary approach to deviance and the administration of justice takes into consideration the social, physical, and spiritual well-being of victims, 236 UNIVERSITY CATALOG offenders, and communities\u2014which provides a deeper understanding of crime and the struggle of the modern criminal justice system. Program objectives The purpose of the Criminal Justice Program is to prepare students to think critically, analytically, and creatively about the problems of crime and social control in the contemporary world. The program is designed to meet the diverse needs of criminal justice professionals. It will accomplish a number of objectives, including: To prepare students for careers in law enforcement, corrections, criminal justice administration, and planning. To provide students with a thorough knowledge of social science theory and of applying criminological theory and research to current problems in criminal justice. To provide students with a thorough knowledge of current issues in criminal justice; and of the impor-tance of the relationship of criminal justice to other disciplines and professions, such as social work, psychology, medicine, dentistry, nursing, and public health. To prepare students for the application of various computer technologies to decision-making in the criminal justice system. To prepare students to conduct social research on crime and the effect of policies and programs on crime outcomes. Program description All students must complete a two-year program consisting of 48 quarter units of course work. There are 26 units of foundation content required for all students, followed by one of the two concentrations: Administration or forensic mental health\u2014Stu-dents opting for the policy, planning, and administra-tion concentration will study public administration, the economic dimensions of social policy, organizational theory, program planning, and policy analysis as they relate to contemporary problems in criminal justice. The forensic mental health\u2014The forensic mental health concentration provides students with both global and domestic perspectives on violence, mental health, and drug and alcohol abuse issues. Both concentrations emphasize a thoughtful reflection about public philo-sophy and ethical issues in criminal justice that will provide students with a deeper understanding of the logic influencing policy, administration, and practice issues affecting the field. PREREQUISITE This master's degree builds on a broad liberal arts (general education) foundation. Consistent with this view, the program assesses the liberal arts foundation of students applying for the M.S. degree in criminal justice. The required prerequisite course work provides students with foundation concepts and/or skills in each of the following: Interviewing and counseling (3) Human growth and development (3) Cross-cultural issues (3) Introductory statistics (3) Unit values represent a quarter system of measurement.

TOTAL UNITS 48 PRACTICUM AND SEMINAR HOURS 480 + 60 Cytotechnology\u2014AH (B.S., certificate) MARLENE M. OTA, Program Director Cytotechnology is a specialty within the broad field of clinical laboratory science. The cytotechnologist, working under the direction of a pathologist, detects cell changes caused by different disease processes; and is able to differentiate between normal, atypical, and malignant cell changes. In recognizing microscopic abnormalities of cells and cellular patterns from various body sites, the cytotechnologist assists the pathologist in detecting cancer at its earliest and potentially most curable stage. As a result, physicians are able to diagnose and treat cancer long before discovering its existence by alternate methods. Opportunities Cytotechnologists work in hospitals, clinics, and independent pathology laboratories. The employment outlook for cytotechnologists is favorable, with the demand for trained workers exceeding the supply. Cytotechnologists can advance to supervisory positions, participate in research activities, or become teachers in the field. Advancement is based on experience, skill, and advanced education. The program The Cytotechnology Program, based on the completion of two years of study at an accredited college or university, leads either to a certificate or to a certificate and a Bachelor of Science degree. The program of study begins with the Autumn Quarter. A certificate is awarded at the completion of the fourth quarter of study, and those electing to continue are awarded the Bachelor of Science degree upon the completion of an additional two quarters of study. With the certificate in cytotechnology and the baccalaureate degree, the student is eligible to take a national examination and become a registered cytotechnologist. Registered cytotechnologists entering the program to receive the Bachelor of Science degree are considered to have completed, on the basis of registry, the equivalent course work listed in the first four quarters of the program. A total of 64 quarter units is applied toward the graduation requirements, provided the course work in pathology is equivalent to that offered in the certificate program at this University. Where credit in pathology is not equivalent, the requirement may be met by taking AHCJ 402, credit in pathology is not equivalent, the requirement may be met by taking AHCJ 402, 403 at this University; or by completing a minimum of 8 quarter units of upper-division course work in developmental biology or comparative animal physiology at an accredited college or university.

Dental Anesthesiology, Advanced\u2014SD (certificate) LARRY D. TRAPP, Director, Advanced Education Program FACULTY David L. Anderson Trisha Jen Barry Krall Larry D. Trapp The advanced education program in dental anesthesiology is offered to dentists who desire to pursue a career in anesthesiology for dentistry. The educational design of this twenty-four month program provides a strong clinical background in anesthesiology. The program is based in the Surgery Center for Dentistry, located in the School of Dentistry, where approximately 4,000 patients are treated on an annual basis. Additional training at area hospitals is received in structured rotations in cardiology, internal medicine, and anesthesiology. Didactic instruction is coordinated through the School of Dentistry's Department of Dental Anesthesiology. Students attend an anesthesiology lecture series and weekly grand rounds at Loma Linda University Medical Center. In addition, regular meetings of the dental anesthesiology students are held, during which a variety of contemporary topics are discussed\u2014including a review of the current literature. Students also participate in teaching pain control in the predoctoral curriculum. In an effort to develop dentist-educators, an optional third year of study leading to a master's degree in physiology or pharmacology is available. Upon successful completion of the program, the dental anesthesiologist will be eligible to take the diplo-mate examination of the American Dental Board of Anesthesiology and to apply for a general anesthesia permit in any state of the United States. Application deadline Application for admission should reach the program no later than October 1 of the year prior to the summer of intended enrollment.

WILKINS, Chair FACULTY Darlene Armstrong Kellie Bergendahl Sharon Boggs D. Darlene Cheek Janeen Duff Debra Friesen Jean Honny Michelle Hurlbutt Shirley Lee Joyce Sanders Karen Simpson Jonell Stephens Kristi Wilkins Shelly Withers Established in 1959, the Department of Dental Hygiene, the undergraduate program of the School of Dentistry, is largely focused on preventive oral health services and maintenance care. Dental science courses, preclinical lectures and seminars, laboratory exercises, and clinical assignments have been developed to provide training in the variety of procedures delegated to the dental hygienist within the dental practice setting. These experiences are sequenced in an organized manner that provides for continual growth and proficiency in performance of all traditional and expanded-function procedures. The purpose of the program is to develop professionals prepared for the current practice of dental hygiene, as well as graduates who are additionally prepared to deal with future changes in dentistry. Courses that encourage critical thinking and problem-solving techniques and that enhance the ability to evaluate the latest in research are important adjuncts to clinical training. Upon completion of this curriculum, graduates will be prepared to enter a variety of career options available to a dental hygienist. Curriculum Dental hygiene, a profession dating back to 1913, is largely concerned with preventive health services. The hygienist works in association with the dentist in private-practice offices, industrial organizations, schools, hospitals, state or federal public health services, and the armed forces. Salary ranges compare with those for registered nurses. The curriculum is organized as a four-year college program leading to the Bachelor of Science degree. The freshman and sophomore years of largely prescribed, preprofessional study may be taken at any accredited college. The professional program begins with the junior year in the School of Dentistry. The program is approved by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association. The first class at this University graduated in 1961. Philosophy A profession in the health arts and sciences calls increasingly for persons of intelligence, integrity, industry, responsibility, and depth of human understanding. Therefore, the program of instruction is planned on a strong liberal arts foundation. The student is encouraged to take electives that contribute to breadth of knowledge and quality of values. The choice of electives in early college work is important for many reasons. The School of Dentistry is interested in applicants with the potential to become hygienists who are well-read and gracious persons\u2014prepared to communicate effectively in professional and community relationships. They should be able to draw on knowledge of the structure and function of the human body in health and disease, applying resources based on Christian ideals and values to aid in the solution of personal problems. They should also be able to develop the attitudes and skills that will most effectively serve society. Goal The goal of the Dental Hygiene Program is to educate competent, concerned, and active members of the dental hygiene profession who possess the ability to effectively perform the expanding scope of practice of the dental hygienist. Loma Linda University emphasizes Christian values and beliefs and the concept of whole-person care. Opportunities for spiritual growth and fellowship among faculty and students are interwoven into daily academic pursuits, clinical practice, and social interactions. The advancement of dental hygiene depends on an ever-growing body of knowledge. Therefore, this program also places great importance on providing an atmosphere in which students can develop the skills necessary to objectively assess new theories and trends in dentistry, in light of scientific knowledge and principles. By combining Christian values with an appreciation for research and the scientific method, graduates will continually apply sound principles to patient care and exhibit God's love in the quality of service they render. 242 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Admission Information and procedures for applying to the Dental Hygiene Program may be found in Section III, School of Dentistry, Application and Admissions. Regulations The student is also subject to the conditions of registration, attendance, financial policy, governing practices, and graduation requirements outlined in other sections of this CATALOG. Employment Dental hygiene students may accept part-time employment during the school year after receiving approval from the department chair and the associate dean for academic affairs. Permission to work is granted on the basis of grades, class load, and health. Work hours may not interfere with class, laboratory, or clinic assignments. Supplies Dental hygiene students must have prescribed textbooks, supplies, instruments, and uniforms. The official instrument issued must be purchased from the School of Dentistry during registration. Unauthorized or incomplete equipment is not acceptable. Advance consent must be obtained for any exception. The student must buy the professional apparel (uniforms, glasses, and shoes) specified by the School of Dentistry. License To practice, the dental hygienist must pass state licensing examinations given by state and/or regional dental examining boards. The examinations are given several times each year. Credentials from the National Board of Dental Examiners are accepted in lieu of the written portion of a state examination in all states. Some states have additional written tests. Further information can be obtained from each state licensing board. DENTAL HYGIENE\u2014SD 243 DENTAL HYGIENE\u2014 DISTRIBUTION OF I NSTRUCTION Junior Year CLOCK HOURS UNITS Lec./Semr. Lab. Clin.

DENTISTRY, GENERAL\u2014SD 245 Dentistry, General\u2014SD (D.D.S.) CHARLES GOODACRE, Dean, School of Dentistry The goal of the General Dentistry Program is to train practitioners in the delivery of high-quality dental care that is preventive in purpose and comprehensive in scope, and that is based on sound biological principles. Curriculum Dentistry, like all health professions, exists to benefit society and, therefore, continually assesses its professional services to ascertain what measures, attitudes, and skills most effectively serve society. The School of Dentistry is committed to: Beginning the curriculum with a strong foundation in the sciences that are basic to knowledge of the structure and function of the human being in health and in sickness. Providing an educational environment that progressively leads a student to mastery and correlation of clinical sciences and skills. Developing a frame of reference from which to mobilize the resources of dentists and associated professional personnel in both delivery of health care and contribution to community well-being by education for the prevention of illness. These concepts include responsibility for contributing to the body of scientific knowledge by questioning, investigating, and teaching; for remaining sensitive and adaptive to the needs of humanity in ever-changing conditions; and for maintaining consciousness of the individual obligation to live, practice, and strive for the good of humanity. The curriculum in dentistry, organized to be completed in four academic years, fulfills requirements for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Objective The primary objective of the dental curriculum is to graduate men and women who attest to the purpose of the University and the goals of the School of Dentistry, which include advancing knowledge and understanding of health, disease, and ways to improve health and the dental health care-delivery system through basic and applied research. Admission Information and procedures for applying to the Dentistry Program may be found in Section III, School of Dentistry, Application and Admissions. Instruments, textbooks, additional materials The instruments, textbooks, and materials required for the study and practice of dentistry are prescribed by the School of Dentistry. The school issues dental instruments each quarter as needed in the program. Unauthorized or incomplete equipment is not acceptable. Advance administrative approval must be obtained for any exception. Employment Because the dental program is very rigorous, first-year students in dentistry may not accept part-time employment during the first term, and may accept such employment thereafter only upon receiving written permission from the Office of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. Academic Incentive Program Detailed information on the Academic Inventive Program may be found in Section III, School of Dentistry Awards. Licensing Eligibility to take examinations given by the state and regional boards of dental examiners is based on essentially the same requirements as are stipulated by the School of Dentistry for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Information about the examinations of the respective states is available from the associate dean for academic affairs. Credentials from the National Board of Dental Examiners are accepted in lieu of the written portion of a state examination in most states. Many states require the National Board Examination and provide no alternative. (The national board does not include a clinical examination.) D.D.S.

Leslie Arnett, Jr. Gary Bogle Fabrice Cherel Max Crigger Juliana deCarvalho Wolfram The department The Department of Periodontics provides education and training for predoctoral, dental hygiene, and post-graduate students in the art and science of periodontics. Periodontics encompasses the study of the supporting 256 UNIVERSITY CATALOG structures of the teeth; as well as the etiology, patho-genesis, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that affect the supporting structures of the teeth. The study of periodontics helps form basic concepts of health and disease. These concepts are applied in the treatment of periodontal diseases and in the maintenance of dental health over a patient's lifetime, providing compre-hensive dental therapy for the individual patient. In this way the Department of Periodontics contributes directly to the School of Dentistry's academic and service mission \"to make man whole.\" COURSES PERI 705 Introduction to Periodontics PERI 741 Essential Periodontal Therapy, Lecture (1) PERI 742 Essential Periodontal Therapy, Laboratory (1) PERI 765 Special Topics in Periodontal Therapy (2) PERI 805 Periodontal Surgical Therapy (1) PERI 875 Periodontics Clinic (7.5) RESTORATIVE DENTISTRY DOUGLASS B.

Rouse The diagnostic ultrasound profession is a multi-specialty field comprised of diagnostic medical sonography (DMS)\u2014with subspecialties and pediatric echocardiography; vascular technology (VT); and other emerging fields. These diverse specialties are distinguished by their use of diagnostic medical ultrasound as primary technology in their daily work. The diagnostic ultrasound profes-sional is an individual qualified by professional creden-tialing and academic clinical experience to provide diagnostic patient-care services using ultrasound and related diagnostic procedures. Diagnostic ultrasound professionals perform patient assessments, acquire and analyze data obtained using ultrasound-related diag-nostic technologies, provide a summary of findings to the physician to aid in patient diagnosis and manage-ment, and use independent judgment and systematic problem-solving methods to produce high- quality diagnostic information and optimize patient care. Track 1 (General RDMS and RVT) Track 1 is a twenty-four-month program leading to credentials in two areas. General RDMS sonographers perform examinations of the internal organs\u2014such as the liver, kidneys, uterus, and thyroid. They also assist in diagnosis of abnormal/normal conditions in children and pregnant women. Vascular sonographers perform a variety of noninvasive examinations of the arteries and veins\u2014assessing blood flow, valve competence, and presence of clots. Track 2 (Cardiac RDCS) Track 2 is a twelve-month program leading to proficiency in diagnostic imaging of cardiac function and disease processes. Track 3 (RVT) Track 3 is a twelve-month program leading to a career in noninvasive vascular imaging of arteries and veins; and assessment of blood flow, direction of flow, valve competency, and presence of clots. Track 3 requires that the applicant already hold certification as a registered diagnostic medical sonographer (RDMS).

Graduates are prepared to contribute to efforts that promote better management of human development activities that affect human-environment interaction as well as promote sustainable development and conservation science. This program will prepare students for entry-level employment or for advanced study in a variety of fields--including biology, geoscience, environmental science, natural resources, biotechnology, and diverse health sciences; as well as public policy, law, or planning careers. More detail is given in the career-options section. Part of this curriculum is designed to foster constructive and service-oriented attitudes toward environmental conservation, health, lifestyle, and health care. As described here, it will include courses, seminars, and a community-service requirement (local community environmental and/or health care service, or an environmental conservation or health-oriented mission trip). 270 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Objectives The objectives of the program are to: 1. Create awareness and understanding of how earth systems function and interact to create the conditions for life in the geosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. 2. Explore how human activities have interacted with natural systems through time, and how these activities respond to global changes in technology, consumption, and population. 3. Appreciate the enormity of global and regional environmental changes occurring on Earth, and the implications of these changes in our individual lives. 4. Challenge students to rethink their individual behaviors and attitudes about their \"inter-action\" with the natural world. 5. Learn to use the systems approach to learning and doing research in science and technology, and encourage capable students to pursue careers in science and technology. 6. Practice team and individual writing skills and oral communications, e.g., practicing traditional writing skills with new methods such as e-mail and Web publishing and communications. 7. Learn how to learn, using modern information-technology tools, such as the Internet; and modern systems modeling and visualization tools, such as STELLA, GIS/RS (remote sensing), and statistical/database packages to manage datasets that span social to medical and biophysical sciences. Apply these tools to \"real-world\" local and global environmental management problems. 8. Learn to understand what science is and how to apply scientific research concepts and tools to \"real-world\" problems, working together jointly with faculty. 9. Learn how to present scientific findings in a professional manner to peers and the public at-large in ways that contribute to finding \"doable solutions\" in the real policy-making world.

Salemi Pramil N. Singh Loretta J. Wilber Although the science of epidemiology began with the investigation of the infectious disease outbreaks, the modern plagues of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and injuries are also considered by the modern epidemiologist. Contemporary epidemiology builds upon the premise that disease or health is not randomly distributed within populations. Epidemiology comprises the research methods that identify and isolate the underlying causes of disease and injury as well as health. The diversity of this investigative science is illustrated by a number of research accomplishments ranging from identification of control and preventive measures for AIDS and diabetes mellitus; to etiologic processes important in the development of malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases, and infectious diseases. Other accomplishments of epidemiology include discovery of social and biological mechanisms involved in the spread of measles, AIDS, and pertussis through human populations; and preventive measures for surgical wound and other hospital-acquired infections. Contemporary epidemiologic inquiry ranges from investigation of the roles of prescription medicatons, nutrition, electromagnetic fields, and pesticides in human cancer; to identification of health benefits of cholesterol reduction, smoking cessation, and use of safety bindings on skis. The epidemiologist studies the distribution and determinants of health and disease in populations. The emphasis placed upon the investigative process has inspired some to describe the epidemiologist as a medical detective. Epidemiologic research incorporates use of statistical techniques and an understanding of environmental, genetic, and social characteristics important in disease development and spread. Although epidemiology is a relatively young discipline, this collection of investigative methods has become an integral part of public health; epidemiologic findings permeate all fields of human health. The efficacy and confirmed success of epidemiology guarantee an exciting future for those who meet the challenges of this advancing science. Program goals The Epidemiology Program: 1. Trains students to become professionals in epidemiology. 2. Fosters a spirit of collaboration among students and faculty by including students in research projects and as teaching assistants. 3.

EDWARD COCHRANE, Program Coordinator The aim of the Master of Science degree in gerontology is to prepare students to think critically, analytically, and creatively about the challenges of the aging population and older citizens in the contemporary world. The program is designed to meet the diverse needs of professionals in gerontology and will accomplish a number of objectives: To prepare students for positions in teaching, research, and aging administration at the local, state, and federal public levels; as well as in the private sector. To prepare students for careers in health and human services for older adults. To provide students with a thorough knowledge of social science theory and the application of theory and research to current problems in gerontology. To prepare students to conduct social research on aging and the effect of policies and programs on the lives of older adults. To provide students with a thorough knowledge of current issues in gerontology and the importance of the relationship of gerontology to other disciplines and professions\u2014such as social work, psychology, medicine, dentistry, nursing, and public health. Program description All students must complete a two-year program consisting of 48 quarter units of course work. Students opting for the policy, planning, and administration concentration will study the economic dimensions of social policy, organizational theory, public administra-tion, program planning, and policy analysis as they relate to geriatric population and services. The clinical services concentration provides students with both global and domestic perspectives on violence, mental health, and drug-and alcohol-abuse issues. Both concentrations emphasize a thoughtful reflection about public philosophy and ethical issues in gerontology that will provide students with a deeper understanding of the logic influencing policy, administration, and practice issues affecting the field. Prerequisite preparation This master's degree builds on a broad liberal arts (general education) foundation. The required prerequisite course work provides students with foundation concepts and/or skills in each of the following: Interviewing and counseling (3) Human growth and development (3) Cross-cultural issues (3) Introductory statistics (3) Unit values represent the quarter system of measurement.

The data provide a basis for patient care, quality assurance, legal defense, reimbursement, risk management, accreditation, planning, and decision making. The health information management department has assumed increased importance with the advent of prospective-payment, corporate compliance, and the electronic health record. A career in health information management is likely to appeal to a person who has organizational and leadership abilities and who is interested in and has aptitude for medical science, but whose talents are suited for participation other than physical involvement in human illness. The health information administrator (formerly known as medical record administrator) designs, develops, and maintains systems for storage, retrieval, and dissemination of information in accordance with federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. This person works with the medical staff and other health professionals in research, administrative studies, functions relative to health information, and patient-care evaluation. The health information administrator in a health care facility will provide management leadership in planning and organizing the department, motivating and evaluating employees, and providing in-service programs for departmental employees or other personnel in the facility. Opportunities While many health information administrators are employed in various areas of acute-care facilities, others work in alternative-delivery health care systems, research facilities, quality assurance, data companies, industrial establishments, governmental agencies, medical departments of insurance companies, accounting firms, or as consultants to skilled-nursing and other facilities. The multiplicity of new technologies, the advent of electronic health records, the demand for health information, the emphasis on evaluation of care, the surge in research, the emphasis on cost control, and other factors combine to require comprehensive knowledge and increased utilization of administrative talent and judgment.

The Canadian campus program is an innovative venture that combines the teaching expertise of the Loma Linda University California campus faculty, the Canadian campus program faculty, and adjunct instructors and guest lecturers from the local professional community. A clinically based program, courses are taught on campus utilizing two methods of instruction. Approximately half the courses are taught on an intensive basis. Typically, 2-unit intensives run for three days, Monday through Wednesday; and 3-unit intensives run for four days, Monday through Thursday. Generally, there is one intensive scheduled per month. The remainder of the courses meet once a week (except during intensive weeks) for the full quarter. Courses are taught three quarters per year, mid-September through mid-June. It should be noted that certain courses cannot be offered on an intensive basis and require weekly attendance. Loma Linda University is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) in the United States, and the Canadian campus program is recognized by Alberta Advanced Education (Private Institutions) as a graduate degree-granting program. The Canadian campus program is officially directed by the California campus and meets the WASC accreditation requirements. Depending on undergraduate preparation and the course work selected, students graduating from this program may be qualified to become provisionally chartered as psychologists in the province of Alberta, or registered social workers with the Alberta College of Social Workers. Marriage and family therapy is an unregulated profession in Alberta. However, we do encourage students to become concurrent members of the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. This organization has collegial benefits to the student, long-term legislative initiatives, as well as a local chapter, the Alberta Association for Marriage and Family Therapy.

The Ph.D. degree in marital and family therapy is a 108-unit program requiring three-to-four years for completion\u2014including two-to-three years of course work, a dissertation, and clinical internship. D.M.F.T. degree in marriage and family therapy The D.M.F.T. degree follows the practitioner-evaluator model and focuses on applied-skill development for use in clinical practice and administrative positions. The D.M.F.T. degree is a 101-unit program, requiring three to four years for completion\u2014including doctoral project and clinical internship. Interim master's degree The Ph.D. degree with interim master's degree or the D.M.F.T. degree with interim master's degree requires 168 and 160 units, respectively. These programs are for selected advanced students who have a bachelor's degree, or for students whose master's degree is not in marital and family therapy (or equivalent). They take approximately five years to complete. Concentrations All doctoral students must complete a 12-unit concentration in a special area of focus of their choice. Examples include, but are not limited to: Families, systems, and health Family studies Systems consultation and professional relations School consultation MFT licensure (for students who have not previously met academic requirements for MFT licensure) MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY\u2014ST 321 Marriage and family therapy is established in California by law as a profession requiring state licensure. Persons who desire to enter the profession must have the proper academic and clinical preparation and must pass two licensing examinations. The doctoral degree programs at Loma Linda University are designed to provide the academic requirements to meet the California licensing standards according to Business and Professions Code 4980.38. The Ph.D. degree in marital and family therapy and the D.M.F.T. degree offered by Loma Linda University are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE), the accrediting body associated with the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. Purpose and mission The purpose of the doctoral programs in marital and family therapy is to develop family therapy scholars who will advance theory, research, clinical practice, community involvement and teaching in the field of marital and family therapy. Students will be prepared for research, teaching, supervision, administration, and clinical training positions in health-care settings, in training institutes, and in institutions offering graduate degrees. The D.M.F.T. degree program offers the opportunity to expand clinical skills and prepares students with expertise in program-evaluation research methods. Ph.D. degree students develop expertise in conducting original research from both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Knowledge and skills promoted Students study the work of the original thinkers in marital and family therapy, as well as the most recent developments in the field\u2014such as social constructionism and evidence-based practice. They will develop a critical understanding of the theoretical and philosophical foundations of MFT; critically examine the interrelationships between sociohistorical factors, family structures and relationships and clinical approaches; be conversant in the current issues in the field; and contribute to the discourse regarding them. Personal development The program encourages students to develop a clear understanding of themselves and to consider reflectively the impact of their personal values, social positions, and contexts on their clinical and scholarly practices. Students are supported in the development of their strengths as they create an epistemological framework and ethical consciousness to guide their work. Practice and supervisory skills Students will apply a critical understanding of theory to the practice of marital and family therapy at the family, community, and societal levels, drawing on the core modalities of the field. They will develop sophistication in their personal clinical skills, supervisory skills, and skills for active multisystemic involvement. Research and evaluation skills Students will develop skills and a critical understanding of the process of research and evaluation related to families and marital and family therapy. This includes the ability to apply research findings to clinical practice and to utilize research findings in creative ways for the benefit of the general population. Students in the Ph.D. degree program will develop expertise in both qualitative and quantitative research methods, leading to publication in scholarly journals and presentations at professional conferences. D.M.F.T. degree students will focus on evaluation of program performance and outcomes in practice-based settings. Core ideas guiding the MFT doctoral programs Relational systems: People are best understood within the cultural, spiritual, and relational systems in which they are embedded. Change, therefore, occurs in the context of family, community, and interpersonal relationships. These programs focus on both the structured relational patterns of communication and interaction and on the systems of meaning that define and shape these patterns. Wholeness: These programs encourage wholeness by attending to the physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions of human experience. These dimensions reciprocally interact at every level. Social forces: The programs are guided by a belief that social contexts and processes influence meanings, values, and people's understandings of self, family, and others. Particular emphasis is placed on research focusing on social forces relevant to the distinctive multicultural mix of families in the southern California region, the interrelationship between faith and family relationships throughout the world, the effects of the changing health care system and of medical technology; and collaboration among education, family, work, and legal systems. Healing power of relationships: As people become more connected to each other and their communities, the potential for growth and healing are enhanced, and the opportunities for making positive contributions are maximized. Students are encouraged to develop their therapeutic relationship and community-involvement skills so that they can cocreate an environment of safety, respect, compassion, openness, and community participation. Diversity: An appreciation of the importance of social forces requires interest in and respect for the diverse experiences and perceptions of human beings. Different social contexts such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, and socioeconomic status result in a wide variety of meanings and behavior patterns in marriages, families, and intimate relationships. The programs seek to create a diverse mix of students and faculty, and to challenge all who are involved to learn from the richness of multiple perspectives. 322 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Empirical process: The programs encourage clinical work and theory development grounded in an empirical understanding of human experience. Students are offered the opportunity to develop their capacities to utilize inductive and deductive reasoning; as well as objectivity, subjectivity, and intersubjectivity in research and therapy. Education and prevention: Connections at family, school, and community levels are important components of resilience. The programs emphasize helping individuals and families access their relational competencies as an important part of prevention, as well as the resolution of their current difficulties. Spirituality: These programs view spirituality as central to wholeness and healing. Students are encouraged to integrate their practices of faith with their professional work. The programs place strong emphasis on active demonstration of moral and ethical principles as exemplified by, but not limited to, Judeo-Christian teachings. Worldwide focus: The missions of the programs reach beyond the local and national community to the international community. This includes our collaboration with people from other nations and cultures to promote mutual understanding, resolve problems, and strengthen families.

Medical Scientist\u2014SM (M.D. with Ph.D.) ANTHONY J. ZUCCARELLI, Program Director FACULTY The Faculty participation in this program come from the biomedical science programs of the School of Medicine, from the clinical departments of the School of Medicine at Loma Linda University, and from research laboratories outside of Loma Linda University. Loma Linda University is committed to fostering the investigative skills of its medical students. Students interested in pursuing careers in academic medicine and medical research may wish to enroll in one of the combined-degrees programs. The Medical Scientist Program is designed to develop a student's independence and competence as an investigative scientist and clinician. It provides students with a broad educational base for the practice of medicine and medically related research. The program is administered by the School of Medicine. During the first three years of the program, students follow an integrated curriculum that includes medical courses, graduate education, and research training. The Medical Scientist Program integrates the educational tracks leading to the Ph.D. and M.D. degrees. The first-year curriculum includes a course sequence, taught by interdisciplinary faculty, that integrates all the disciplines of the biomedical basic science areas\u2014moving from molecules, through cellular mechanisms to integrated systems. In addition, a supplemental course covers research-related topics\u2014such as scientific communication and integrity, information handling, and statistics; as well as successful grant writing. Students learn of new developments in the biomedical sciences through weekly seminars. Students gain presentation skills of their own in a weekly student presentation-seminar series. During the subsequent years, formal courses continue to broaden and integrate into a meaningful whole an understanding of the clinical consequences of cellular events. Beginning in the fourth year and continuing for two or more years, students pursue full-time research on a project of their own design within the graduate programs of human anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology and molecular genetics, physiology, or pharmacology. Subsequent courses in the curriculum include specialized areas of biomedical and clinical sciences. Research and dissertation are supervised by graduate faculty of the basic biomedical sciences. Research training within these programs is available in nationally recognized research laboratories in the School of Medicine. After the Ph.D. degree, students return to the medical curriculum for the two years of clinical training required to obtain the Doctor of Medicine degree. Admission to Ph.D./M.D. Medical Scientist Program An application to the School of Medicine, processed through the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS), should be completed by November prior to the year admission is desired. The Medical Scientist Program admissions committee bases its recommendations upon academic criteria; personal interviews; scores from the GRE General Test and MCAT; and other measures of analytical potential, creativity, compassion, and initiative. Accepted applicants are invited to participate in ongoing research in one of the biomedical science departments during the summer preceding their matriculation. Curriculum The curriculum is innovative in content and sequence. It includes courses that provide a pervasive research perspective, as well as those that provide basic instruction in clinical sciences. A three-quarter course sequence in biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, and immunology taken during the first year emphasizes analytical thinking and problem solving as a foundation for a research-oriented approach to biomedical science and clinical medicine. Seminar sessions merge research and clinical approaches to medical problems and expand the perspective of the program to include organ systems and disease processes. Curriculum sequence The typical sequence of courses in the curriculum is outlined below, though several variations are possible, with approval of the program director and curriculum committee. FIRST YEAR Biochemistry Molecular biology Cell biology Immunology Biomedical science seminar Introduction to research Research rotations FIRST SUMMER Research MEDICINE\u2014SM 329 SECOND YEAR School of Medicine freshman year Biomedical science seminar SECOND SUMMER Research THIRD YEAR School of Medicine sophomore year Biomedical science seminar National board examination (USMLE Step I) RESEARCH YEARS Two or more years to complete research, graduate course work, and dissertations for Ph.D. degree JUNIOR YEAR School of Medicine SENIOR YEAR School of Medicine Advisement Admitted students are advised by the Medical Scientist Program director. During the second year, students select a basic science program (anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology and molecular genetics, pharmacology, or physiology) in which they will pursue their subsequent research and graduate course work. After making that selection, they will be guided by the coordinator for that graduate program and by a research guidance committee. Time limits Limits apply to the time allotted for the completion of graduate degrees. Four years (between the sophomore and junior years of the School of Medicine curriculum) are allowed for the completion of a Ph.D. degree; two years are allowed for completion of the M.S. degree. Completion within these limits is required to retain eligibility for further tuition waivers for M.D. degree course work. Students are expected to complete their graduate degree prior to resuming the M.D. degree in the junior year. No additional financial aid will be provided for medical school tuition until the graduate degree is completed. Financial assistance Financial assistance to students in the Medical Scientist Program may provide: 1. Stipends during those periods in which students are most directly involved in graduate education the first year and the research years. The amount of the stipend is equivalent to that available to Ph.D. degree students in the basic science graduate programs. 2. Tuition waivers for all graduate program course work. 3. Tuition deferment for the freshman and sophomore years of the M.D. degree curriculum. When a student completes an M.S. or Ph.D. degree, tuition deferred from the freshman and sophomore years is canceled. 4. A tuition waiver for two quarters of tuition during the junior or senior years in the M.D. degree curriculum, upon completion of an M.S. degree. 5. Tuition waiver for both the junior and senior years of the M.D. curriculum, upon completion of a Ph.D. degree. Completion of the M.D. degree terminates the student's participation in the Medical Scientist Program and ends the availability of tuition waiver. Any tuition deferments then in force will convert to loan obligations at that time. Medicine\u2014SM (M.D.) H. ROGER HADLEY, Dean, School of Medicine CURRICULUM The curriculum in medicine consists of four academic years. Instruction is on the quarter system. The first eight quarters are oriented to the sciences basic to the practice of medicine; the remaining two academic years are made up of clinically oriented core instruction and up to eighteen weeks of clinical electives. THE FRESHMAN YEAR consists of the study of anatomy/embryology, biochemistry/molecular biology/genetics, cell structure and function, understanding your patient, fundamental principles of physical diagnosis, evidence-based medicine and information sciences, physiology, and neuroscience. THE SOPHOMORE YEAR includes microbiology, preventive medicine, pharmacology, and organ-systems pathology. Both pathophysiology and applied physical diagnosis provide the transition between the basic and clinical sciences. Course work in psychopathology builds upon the first-year content. THE JUNIOR YEAR is fifty weeks in length and focuses on internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology and obstetrics, family medicine or neurology, psychiatry, surgery, and medical ethics. Didactic work is integrated with ward and clinical assignments. THE SENIOR YEAR is forty weeks in length. Required clinical clerkships include subinternships in internal medicine or surgery or family medicine or pediatrics; intensive care/emergency medicine, ambulatory care, and neurology; and up to eighteen weeks of electives. WHOLE-PERSON FORMATION Personal and professional growth for the student in medicine is the focus of the disciplines in the school, the faculty in the School of Medicine, and the Faculty of Religion. Courses and content are offered to emphasize biblical, ethical, and relational aspects of the physician's personal and professional development. The core for whole-person formation--14 quarter units of religion and ethic\u2014is provided during the first three years of the medicine curriculum. 330 UNIVERSITY CATALOG CURRICULUM OUTLINE YEAR 1 FIRST QUARTER (SUMMER) Gross Anatomy Orientation to Medicine Medical Physiology Evidence-Based Medicine and Information Science Cell Structure and Function I Physical Diagnosis and Interviewing I Medical Biochemistry/Molecular Biology/Genetics I Religion SECOND QUARTER (FALL) Gross Anatomy Medical Physiology Medical Neuroscience I Physical Diagnosis and Interviewing Cell Structure and Function II Medical Biochemistry/Molecular Biology/Genetics II Religion II Evidence-Based Medicine: Information Science II THIRD QUARTER (WINTER) Evidence-Based Medicine: Information Science Gross Anatomy Physical Diagnosis and Interviewing Cell Structure and Function Medical Physiology Medical Biochemistry/Molecular Biology/Genetics III Religion Understanding Your Patient FOURTH QUARTER (SPRING) Orientation to Medicine Medical Biochemistry/Molecular Biology/Genetics IV Understanding Your Patient Cell Structure and Function Gross Anatomy Evidence-Based Medicine Medical Physiology Physical Diagnosis Medical Neuroscience Religion YEAR 2 FIRST QUARTER (SUMMER) Medical Microbiology Psychopathology Pathophysiology and Applied Physical Diagnosis I Pathology I SECOND QUARTER (FALL) Medical Microbiology Pathophysiology and Applied Physical Diagnosis II Psychopathology Pathology II Religion II Clinical Preventive Medicine THIRD QUARTER (WINTER) Pathophysiology and Applied Physical Diagnosis III Pharmacology I Pathology III Religion III Clinical Preventive Medicine FOURTH QUARTER (SPRING) Clinical Preventive Medicine Pathophysiology and Applied Physical Diagnosis IV Pathology IV Pharmacology II YEAR 3 Clinical clerkships (required) Surgery (12 weeks) Medicine (12 weeks) Pediatrics (8 weeks) Obstetrics/Gynecology (6 weeks) Family Medicine or Neurology (4 weeks) Psychiatry (6 weeks) Electives (2 weeks) YEAR 4 Clinical clerkships (required) Emergency Medicine (2 weeks) Ambulatory and Community Clerkship (4 weeks) Family Medicine or Neurology (4 weeks) Electives (18 weeks) Subinternships: (4 weeks) Internal Medicine or Surgery or Pediatrics or Family Medicine Intensive Care (2 weeks) Pediatrics Internal Medicine Surgery CONJOINT COURSES FOR THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE MDCJ 501 Introduction Orientation to Medicine SM (2) MDCJ 502 Introduction Orientation to Medicine II (2) MEDICINE\u2014SM 331 MDCJ MDCJ 553, 554, 555, 556 Cell Structure and Function (2.5) MDCJ 561, 562, 563, 564 Physical Diagnosis (1, 2, 3, 1) MDCJ 524, 525, 526 Pathophysiology and Applied Physical Diagnosis (4, 3, 2) MDCJ 515, 516, 517, 518 Medical Bio- chemistry, Molecular Biology, and Genetics (1, 2, 1, 2) MDCJ 543, 544 Medical Neuroscience SM (1, 4) MDCJ 566, 567, 568, 569 Evidence-Based Medicine and Information Sciences (1, 2, 1, 1) MDCJ 599 Medicine Conjoint Directed Study (arranged) MDCJ 821 Ambulatory Care Clerkship (6) MDCJ 891 Whole-Person Care (7.2) MDCJ 899 Practice of Medicine (1.8-3.6) Residency programs Loma Linda University Medical Center and other hospitals affiliated with Loma Linda University School of Medicine provide a variety of graduate medical-education programs.

Zumwalt UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Undergraduate curricula The sections that follow describe the undergraduate curricula offered by the School of Nursing (Bachelor of Science degree and the Associate in Science degree option) and list the courses each student must complete. Students are expected to operate under the general policies of the University and school and specific policies of the degree program in which they are enrolled. The school reserves the right to update and modify the curriculum to keep current with trends in health care. B.S. degree/A.S. degree option The primary aim of the School of Nursing undergraduate nursing program is to prepare competent practitioners who are committed to excellence in practice and to Christian principles. The faculty believe that baccalaureate education in nursing is the basis for professional practice. However, in response to both societal and students' needs, an Associate in Science (A.S.) degree option is provided for students after they have completed all nursing and general education content necessary to prepare for licensure as a registered nurse in California. The basic professional curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in nursing is consistent with the faculty belief that students should be broadly educated. The focus is on the synthesis of nursing knowledge and skills with knowledge and skills from the humanities and sciences. Preparation for practice includes experiences in primary, secondary, and tertiary health care with clients from various age and cultural groups and socioeconomic strata. The curriculum is based on the Neuman Systems Model, which addresses stressors to the client system. Undergraduate program sequence The undergraduate program begins with four quarters of preclinical work, which forms the general education and science base for nursing. These quarters may be completed at any accredited college or university. Following six quarters of clinical instruction, additional general education, and cognate courses at Loma Linda University School of Nursing, the student is eligible to receive the A.S. degree and is prepared to write the state board examination. After completion of another two quarters, the student is eligible to receive the B.S. degree and is prepared for professional nursing practice at the baccalaureate level. The clinical experience develops the student's technical and theoretical capabilities in a progressive manner and within the context of the nursing process: assessment, analysis, planning, implementing, evaluating. Most of the baccalaureate nursing major is in the upper division, where clinical experience is gained in a broad variety of settings. Integral components of upper-division courses are leadership concepts and skills, research, health promotion, and activities which foster collaboration in planning health care with the family and all members of the health care team.

A.S. DEGREE PROGRAM OPTION [FOR STUDENT WORKING TOWARD AN RN AND A B.S. DEGREE] For the student who wishes to work as a registered nurse during the last two quarters of the generic B.S. degree program, an A.S. degree option is available. (See Program outline.) ADDITIONAL PROGRAM OPTIONS ACCELERATED B.S. DEGREE PROGRAM [FOR GENERIC STUDENT WITH NO NURSING DEGREE OR LICENSE] A student who has completed all humanity, social science, and statistics courses with an overall G.P.A. of 3.0 and has received no provisional grades may accelerate by joining the B.S./B.A. degree track. Any student in this intensive bachelor's degree track whose G.P.A. falls below 3.0 or whose grade in any course falls below a B during any quarter will be returned to the regular schedule (the standard Bachelor of Science degree program) at the beginning of the next quarter. INTENSIVE B.S. DEGREE PROGRAM; or A.S. OR CERTIFICATE TO M.S. [FOR STUDENT WITH (NON-NURSING) BACHELOR'S DEGREE] For students who have completed a B.S. or B.A. degree in a field other than nursing, there are two options. One option leads to a baccalaureate degree in nursing; the other option permits the student to go directly to the M.S. degree upon completion of A.S. degree requirements and community/public health nursing. Applicants to either of these tracks should expect to carry very intensive academic loads. Because of this, students in these tracks must maintain a 3.0 G.P.A. each quarter. If a student's G.P.A. falls below 3.0, the student will be moved to the standard track. PREREQUISITE Bachelor's degree with a 3.0 G.P.A.

Use the research process to refine and expand nursing knowledge as a rationale for practice. 3. Collaborate with clients, health professionals, and organizations for the purpose of improving the delivery of health care and influencing health policy. 4. Demonstrate advanced knowledge and expertise in a selected clinical area and professional nursing role. 5. Improve nursing practice and health care by using effective leadership, management, and teaching skills. 6. Advance personally and professionally through continued inquiry and scholarly endeavor. 7. Demonstrate and promote high ethical and Christian values respecting the uniqueness of others. 8. Have a foundation for doctoral study. GENERAL POLICIES Grades A minimum G.P.A. of 3.00 must be maintained in all work taken for the degree and in the nursing major.

PREREQUISITES TO THE JUNIOR YEAR Progression to the bachelor's degree program to become a registered dietitian requires completion of all the prerequisites for the bachelor's degree. These include introductory chemistry with laboratory (full sequence), microbiology, general NUTRITION AND DIETETICS\u2014AH 373 psychology, and humanities\u2014including Anatomy and Physiology and Speech. The dietetic technician, registered, (DTR), should complete a year of practice before applying to the bachelor's degree program. NUTRITION AND DIETETICS\u2014B.S. Dietetics, a vital profession in the field of health promotion, focuses on the sciences of nutrition and management in feeding individuals and groups throughout the life cycle. The coordinated program in dietetics combines supervised professional practice with didactic curriculum to develop professional skills concurrently with cognitive and technical skills to enable the graduate to establish eligibility to become a registered dietitian. Admission to the program is based on a selective process. To be eligible for consideration, the applicant must meet the following criteria: completion of subject requirements, as indicated, at an accredited college or university; a 3.0 G.P.A. or above; an interview; a letter of application; and recommendations. Opportunities Dietetic practice is the application of principles derived from integrating knowledge of food, nutrition, biochemistry, physiology, business and management, journalism, behavioral and social sciences, and the arts to achieve and maintain health, prevent disease, and facilitate recovery from illness. Members of the dietetics profession practice in a variety of environments, including hospitals and other health care facilities, schools and universities, government and community agencies, business, and industry. A growing number of dietitians are employed in physicians' offices, clinics, home-health care agencies, mass communication, and many other entrepreneurial roles. By successfully passing the registration examination for dietitians, practice opportunities as a specialist in medical nutrition therapy, administrative dietetics, nutrition education, community nutrition, or research are available. There is increased recognition of the importance of nutrition in the fields of medicine, dentistry, and health promotion\u2014with emphasis on fitness and optimal well-being. This indicates that the dietitian's scope of practice is steadily widening. MEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY The registered dietitian in medical nutrition therapy applies the science of nutrition to the care of people through health promotion and disease prevention and uses medical-nutrition therapy in the treatment of disease. The effective dietitian must be aware of the cultural, social, economic, aesthetic, and psychological factors that affect eating patterns. As a member of the patient-care team, the registered dietitian (RD) is responsible for assessing, implementing, and monitoring the nutritional care of patients. In addition, the RD may serve professionally as a nutrition practitioner in health care; a teacher in an educational institution; a research dietitian; or a nutrition consultant-educator in municipal, state, or federal departments of health. Administrative dietetics The registered dietitian (RD) in management is accountable for the food-service systems. In a health care institution, the RD is responsible for the effective functioning of food service from the standpoint of patients, administration, medical staff, and personnel. The administrative RD may also teach; manage food systems in educational, public, or commercial facilities; serve as a consultant to health care or educational institutions; or enter the field of research. Community dietetitian Community registered dietitians practice in diverse settings, translating nutrition science into improved health status. Challenges may include forming partnerships with various organizations, mastering technology, enacting regulations and policies that protect and improve the public's health, and creatively managing scarce resources. Dietitians working in the community exhibit high-quality leadership and planning skills, and many create positions that are entrepreneurial as well as financially rewarding. THE PROGRAM The Nutrition and Dietetics Program is established to prepare entry-level dietitians to join the profession and contribute to the wholeness of mankind. The graduate is awarded the Bachelor of Science degree and is eligible to write the registration examination of the Commission on Dietetic Registration. The program is composed of didactic and supervised professional practice experiences in an environment of liberal arts education to prepare an educated graduate. Admission to the professional program at this University begins with the postsummer session of the sophomore year. The applicant will present at least two years of preprofessional education from an accredited college or university to meet the specific subject requirements for 2006-2007. The professional program of seven or eight quarters includes theory, laboratory, research, and clinical experiences. Ten weeks of clinical experience are scheduled at the end of the junior year and ten weeks during the Spring Quarter of the senior year. Students participate as active members of the nutrition-care team in multiple clinical settings. Administrative affiliation experiences involve decision-making assignments in volume-feeding operations. Accreditation The Coordinated Program in Dietetics is currently granted continuing accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics Education of the American Dietetic Association, 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2000, Chicago, IL 60606-6995, 312/899-5400. Professional registration Upon satisfactory completion of the program and upon recommendation of the faculty, the graduate will be eligible to take the registration examination for dietitians in order to become a registered dietitian.

COMMITTEE Paula Andre Carrington Mary Foto Liane H. Hewitt Esther Huecker Craig R. Jackson* John Kerr Rebecca Larson LeRoy Nattress Madge Oh Christine O'Hagan Annette Richardson Clarissa Saunders-Newton *ex officio The occupational therapist and occupational therapy assistant work with persons who find it difficult to cope with psychological or physiological dysfunction. The primary concern of both therapist and assistant is to stimulate those changes in behavior patterns that will increase the patient's personal independence and ability to work within his/her cultural and personal milieu. To accomplish this goal, the occupational therapist evaluates the patient; sets up treatment goals; and works together with the occupational therapy assistant in selecting tasks from the gamut of normal daily self-care activities, using them to assist the patient in gaining independent-living skills regardless of disability or handicap. Essential to the role of occupational therapy is an interest in the behavioral sciences and a concern for the individual's need to find proper adjustments to life's circumstances. A desire to teach and a background or interest in medical science are beneficial. Those inclined to mechanical or scientific techniques are suited to helping patients develop their capacities for employment. Others find that they can use their interests in creative arts, crafts, music, and teaching to work with disabled homemakers, children, and retired persons. Opportunities Occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants practice in general hospitals, rehabilitation centers, pediatric or psychiatric clinics, schools, skilled-nursing facilities, home care, and outpatient community-centered programs (including hand-rehabilitation, work-evaluation, and adult day-care facilities). Occupational therapy professionals have a wide choice of positions (using varied therapeutic skills with individuals of varying age and disability) and opportunities for advancement. Accreditation Both the Occupational Therapy Program and Occupational Therapy Assistant Program are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE), P. O. Box 31220, Bethesda, MD 20824-1220, 301/652-2682. Graduates of the programs will be able to take the national certification examination for occupational therapist and occupational therapy assistant, administered by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT). After successful completion of this examination, the individual will be an occupational therapist, registered (OTR), or a certified occupational therapy assistant (COTA). Professional registration Upon satisfactory completion of the occupational therapy A.A. or entry-level M.O.T. degree\u2014including completion of Level II fieldwork within twenty-four months following completion of academic preparation, and upon recommendation of the faculty\u2014the graduate is eligible to take the national certification examination administered by The National Board for Certification for Occupational Therapy (NBCOT).

The Peace Corps was established in 1961 to provide U.S. citizens an opportunity to serve their country in the cause of peace by living and working in developing countries. Over the years as the needs of host countries have evolved, the Peace Corps has continued striving to attract individuals whose education, experience, and cross-cultural sensitivity can address global needs as they arise; and who can facilitate sustainable, community-centered development. After identifying a number of areas in which there was a shortage of personnel with specialized expertise\u2014including the area of public health\u2014the Peace Corps established the Master's International Program in 1987. This program is designed not only to meet the increasing demand from Peace Corps host countries for volunteers with higher levels of education and technical expertise, but also to provide volunteers the opportunity to incorporate Peace Corps service into graduate-education pursuits. Loma Linda University is one of eighty-two universities currently participating in the Master's International Program. It is one of only eleven universities that offer this prestigious program in conjunction with the Master of Public Health degree, which includes one of the following emphases: environmental and occupational health, health promotion and education, and global health. Prospective students must be accepted both by Loma Linda University School of Public Health into the Master of Public Health degree program, and by the Peace Corps into the Master's International Program. To join the Peace Corps, the applicant must be a U.S. citizen, at least 18 years of age, and in good physical health. For information regarding additional eligibility criteria and the excellent benefits package (including language and cultural training, living/ housing expenses in the field, medical/dental coverage, deferment of student-loan repayment, transportation allowance to and from one's service assignment, vacation time and allowances, financial readjustment and allowance, and employment assistance post-service), contact the Peace Corps at 800/424-8580, ext. 1843; or Office of University Programs at www.peacecorps.gov. After acceptance into the program, the student completes the environmental health, health education, or global health course work on the Loma Linda campus. The student also completes three months of intensive language, technical, and cross-cultural training. When the academic course work and training have been completed, the student enters the Peace Corps in lieu of the field practicum otherwise required for the degree, and begins duty in the assigned country of service. For students with an academic emphasis in global health, six-to-twelve-month nongovernmental (NGO) internships are available with organizations in the U.S. or abroad that are under contractual agreement with the University's Department of Global Health.

Physical therapists evaluate and treat patients with disease, injury, or disabilities. In many states, registered physical therapists work as independent practitioners. The physical therapy techniques are applied to restore strength, flexibility, and coordination; to reduce pain; and generally to prepare the patient to function more effectively at work and in activities of daily living. Agents such as heat, light, electricity, water exercise, and massage are used. While working with patients, psychological and sociological principles are used to motivate and instruct. Within the profession there are many specialties, including orthopaedics, neurology, pediatrics, geriatrics, cardiopulmonary, hand rehabilitation, and sports physical therapy. Physical therapists work in acute-care and convalescent hospitals, rehabilitation centers, children's centers, private practice, athletic training and sports-medicine programs, research institutions, school systems, and home-care agencies. Professional association Students and graduates are eligible for membership in the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA). The objective of the association is to foster development and improvement of service and education. This organization grants student membership at a nominal cost to students of approved schools.

Vermeersch CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SAN BERNARDINO FACULTY As part of a consortial agreement between the Departments of Psychology at Loma Linda University (LLU) and California State University at San Bernardino (CSUSB), a select number of professors whose primary appointment is at CSUSB have adjunct appointments in psychology at Loma Linda University. These faculty members teach, mentor, and supervise students in research and clinical practice on a regular basis: David V. Chavez Gloria Cowan Charles D. Hoffman Michael Lewin Faith McClure Frederick Newton Edward Teyber The School of Science and Technology's Department of Psychology offers a combination of innovative training opportunities in clinical and experimental psychology. The Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) and the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees are offered in the area of clinical psychology and are APA accredited. The Ph.D. and M.A. degrees also are offered with emphases in a number of experimental areas. Combined-degrees Psy.D./Dr.P.H.\u2014are offered. Other combined-degrees programs\u2014Ph.D./M.A. or Psy.D./M.A. degrees in biomedical and clinical ethics\u2014are offered in coordination with the Faculty of Religion. PSYCHOLOGY\u2014ST 409 The Ph.D. degree in clinical psychology has been informed by the traditional scientist-practitioner model, which emphasizes training in research and clinical practice. The Psy.D. degree, influenced by the practitioner-scholar model, emphasizes training in clinical practice based on the understanding and application of scientific psychological principles and research. The Psy.D./Dr.P.H. combined-degrees program combines training in psychology and health sciences to prepare individuals who will be qualified in the application of psychology to health promotion, preventive medicine, and health care; as well as for clinical practice and research. The M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in experimental psychology are designed to train a select number of individuals for research and academic careers in basic as well as applied psychology. Applications for the experimental Ph.D. degree are currently accepted in general experimental psychology (e.g., psychophysiology, perception, cognition and performance, and development); and applied social psychology (e.g., cross-cultural and health psychology). Additional areas will become available with the planned expansion of the program in coming years. The specific objectives of the APA-accredited Ph.D. degree program in clinical psychology are to train its students to be scientist-practitioners which, according to the Loma Linda University Ph.D. clinical model, means that they will be given\u2014 a solid academic foundation, high-level training in the empirical methods of science so that they are capable of conducting independent and original research, and the skills to be highly competent clinicians from whom research and practice constantly inform each other. Among the outcome measures used to determine the clinical Ph.D. program's success in achieving the above-mentioned objectives are the following: 1. Academic foundations course evaluations and the comprehensive examination. 2. Training in empirical methods of science\u2014 second-year project or master's degree thesis; a doctoral degree dissertation; presentations, publications, and grants; research and teaching assistantships; teaching positions in area colleges; and membership in scientific/professional organizations. 3. Clinical skills\u2014ongoing clinical evaluations; the quality and type of internships obtained; and the final clinical proficiency examination. The specific objectives of the APA-accredited Psy.D. degree program are to train students to be practitioner-scholars which, according to the Loma Linda University model, means training them with: a solid academic foundation, the highest level of clinical skills, and the ability to apply research relevant to clinical issues and cases. Among the outcomes measures used to determine the Psy.D. degree program's success in achieving the above-mentioned objectives are the following: 1. Academic foundations course evaluations and the comprehensive examination. 2. Clinical skills ongoing clinical evaluations, the quality and type of internships obtained, and the final clinical proficiency examination. 3. Application of research design and methods appropriate to the doctoral project; involvement in community-based program development, evaluation, and consultation; and membership in professional organizations. The Psychology Program emphasizes research and practice based on the scientific principles and methods of psychology and related disciplines. This emphasis takes place within the context of an approach to human health and welfare, which is consistent with the institutional motto, \"To Make Man Whole.\" A systematic attempt is made, through the wholeness component of the curriculum, to promote an understanding of human behavior in relation to the psychological, physical, spiritual, and social/cultural aspects of being human. In this way the Psychology Program provides, in addition to the traditional training, a positive environment for the study of cultural, social, and spiritual issues relevant to psychological research and practice in contemporary American society and around the world.

Radiation Therapy Technology\u2014AH (B.S., certificate) CAROL DAVIS, Clinical Program Director, Certificate Radiation therapy is a multifaceted career that combines working in a highly technical environment with the opportunity to work closely with patients and members of many other professions to provide a high standard of clinical care. Radiation therapy is the therapeutic application of ionizing radiation to malignant and benign conditions. The therapist is responsible for delivering the treatment, which is prescribed by a radiation oncologist; maintaining accurate treatment records; and implementing quality-assurance plans. A radiation therapist must be detail oriented; able to work accurately under pressure; and, most important, able to interact empathically with patients. Individuals who show initiative and are capable of critical thinking and problem solving make good radiation therapists. The job demand in this well-paying field is currently high. RADIATION THERAPY TECHNOLOGY \u2014B.S. Program description This B.S. degree program is designed to accommodate both x-ray technologists and professionals who are currently licensed and working in the field of radiation therapy. Track A is for ARRT-registered radiologic technologists, registered nurses, or graduates from another accredited allied health program who have fulfilled the prerequisites and who wish to be educated as radiation therapists. It is designed as a full-time, twenty-four month degree course and will fully prepare students to pass the national board examinations at the end of the program. Track B is designed for radiation therapists who are ARRT registered in radiation therapy and who wish to obtain a baccalaureate degree. It is a twenty-four-month program that is didactic in nature and helps prepare the therapist for duties in the areas of teaching or admini-stration.

Religion and the Sciences\u2014FR (M.A.) RICHARD RICE, Program Coordinator As the academic study of religion has developed over the past fifty years, the exploration of religion and sci-ence has emerged as a discipline of its own. Scholars in the natural sciences, the human sciences, and numer-ous applied sciences recognize the importance of exam-ining religion from their particular perspectives. And religion scholars appreciate the importance of the ques-tions that the methods and conclusions of the sciences raise for religious belief and practice. 424 UNIVERSITY CATALOG As a Seventh-day Adventist health-sciences university, Loma Linda University rests on the conviction that there is a positive relation between religion and the sciences. Its commitment to a variety of health professional programs reflects the belief that the natural world is God's good creation and that human beings are inherently part of the physical order of things. Its commitment to higher education, including various avenues of graduate study, expresses the belief that all truth is God's truth, and that the acquisition of truth calls for the diligent application of all our powers. These convictions support the attempt to bring scientific knowledge within the overarching perspective of Christian faith. This Master of Arts degree is designed for several types of students: those who want a degree in religion and science before pursuing further graduate work in one or the other of these areas; graduate students in the natural and social sciences who would like to combine their other academic interests with a serious study of religion; students in professional programs who also have an interest in the area of religion and science; and individuals who wish to explore the interface of religion and the sciences within the context of serious academic work. The Religion and the Sciences Program is administered by the Faculty of Religion. It draws on resources from various sectors of the campus, including the Department of Earth and Biological Sciences faculty of the School of Science and Technology; the Department of Psychology faculty of the School of Science and Technology; and the members of other faculties in the University, as well as other scholars and professors with expertise in the area. The program is designed to encourage and assist students to\u2014 Understand the various ways people view the relation between science and religion. Appreciate the distinctive features of scientific and religious study. Appreciate religion and science as contrasting yet complementary approaches to truth. Participate in the ongoing conversation surrounding the relation of religion and the sciences.

Taylor, Jr. Respiratory care is an allied health profession that promotes health and improvement in the cardiopul-monary function of people with heart and lung abnor-malities and disease. Newborn, pediatric, adult, and elderly patients are treated for a wide range of prob-lems\u2014infant respiratory distress syndrome; trauma; cardiopulmonary arrest; conditions brought on by shock; postoperative surgical complications; and respi-ratory diseases such as pneumonia, asthma, cystic fi-brosis, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. The respiratory care practitioner is a member of the health care team in medical centers, skilled-nursing facilities, outpatient rehabilitation programs, physician offices, and in-home care. Many are involved in research and development of new and innovative care and equipment. They are effective communicators and compassionate caregivers, possessing an awareness of 426 UNIVERSITY CATALOG cultural sensitivity and diversity. They have leadership roles in patient education, wellness intervention, and development of respiratory care plans. Respiratory care professionals apply critical-thinking skills in cardiopulmonary diagnostics and patient assessment to optimize decision making and delivery of patient care. In a time of high technology, increasing growth of the elderly population, and increasing numbers of patients with asthma and chronic lung disease, there is a greater demand for educated and skilled respiratory care practitioners. Professional accreditation, licensure, and credentialing Respiratory care program accreditation is provided by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) upon recommendation of the Committee on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (CoARC). Standards and guide-lines published by CoARC must be met, relevant to general and respiratory care education and to on-going program assessment and improvement. Inquiries regarding CAAHEP can be directed to 35 East Wacker Drive, Suite 1970, Chicago IL 60601-2208; telephone 312/553-9355; Web site <http://www.caahep.org>; or FAX 312/553-9616. Inquiries regarding CoARC can be directed to 1248 Harwood Road, Bedford, TX 76021-4244; telephone 817/283-2835; or Web site <http://www.coarc.com>. The Respiratory Care Program at Loma Linda University is CAAHEP accredited. Graduates of CAAHEP-accredited respiratory care programs must apply to the State of California Department of Consumer Affairs Respiratory Care Board (RCB) for a license to practice in the state. The RCB requires that graduates of respiratory care programs complete general and respiratory care education courses with grades of \"C\" or above, resulting in a minimum of an Associate in Science degree in respiratory care. Graduates must successfully complete an examination for licensure, declare felony convictions, and undergo fingerprinting. License denial may occur due to prior felony conviction(s).

School Counseling\u2014ST (PB and PM certificates, PPS credential) IAN CHAND, Director of Clinical Training CHERYL SIMPSON, Program Coordinator for School Counseling Certificate and M.S. in counseling FACULTY Jennifer Andrews Karen Carlson Ian P. Chand Dorothy Clark-Brooks Gerald Corey Lolita Domingue Dinah Evans Carla Gober Suzanne Hanna Hattendorf Gayle Helenski Doris Hubbard Sandra May-Leggitt Michelle Minyard Mary Moline Hiram Rivera-Toro Randall Lee Roberts Claudia Ronaldson Lorraine Thompson Cheryl Simpson Joyce Volsch Randall Walker Colwick Wilson SCHOOL COUNSELING CERTIFICATE The School Counseling Certificate Program is one of two programs in the School of Science and Technology's Department of Counseling and Family Sciences, offered through the Department of Marital and Family Therapy, leading to school counselor certification. School counseling programs are accredited by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing within the California State Department of Education. Students enrolled in the M. S. degree in marital and family therapy must enroll for an additional 28 units and 600 hours of field experience in school counseling. In addition, they must successfully complete all published program requirements to qualify for the pupil personnel services (PPS) credential in school counseling. Students enrolled in the department's Master of Science degree in counseling qualify for this credential, which is built into their program. School counseling began as a profession in the early 1900s when vocational guidance emerged as a response to America's industrial revolution and to the advisement needs of veterans with educational benefits. Over the next century, school counselors became an integral part of the mental health community as more responsibility for at-risk children, adolescents, and young adults was shifted to educational institutions. Today, more than ever, students are in need of support as they maximize their potential to serve an ever changing world. ACCREDITATION AND ADVISORY BOARD The School Counseling Certificate Program is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) governed by the State Department of Education in Sacramento, California. The program is also guided by an advisory board of SCHOOL COUNSELING\u2014ST 431 professionals who are actively employed in local school districts and who serve as contract instructors as needed. THE PROGRAM General admission and program information Students are admitted in Fall and Winter quarters. With special permission, a student may be permitted to enter Spring or Summer Quarter. Program requirements for admission are as follows: Applicants must be enrolled in Loma Linda University's M.S. in marital and family therapy degree program or graduated from an accredited master's degree program in marital and family therapy. Applications must be submitted to the Dean of the School of Science and Technology in accordance with published policies. Applicants must have a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution in any field. Candidates must have a minimum 3.0 grade point average (on a 4-point scale) for the last 45 quarter credits (30 semester units) of course work completed before applying for admission. Applicants must submit two letters of recommendation supporting admission to graduate work in school counseling. Letters will not be accepted from relatives or friends. Verification of state health and criminal clearance must be on file with the department prior to application for field placement. Candidates must take the California Test of Basic Skills (CBEST) no later than the second quarter following enrollment. A passing score on all sections is required for the Pupil Personnel Services (PPS) credential in School Counseling and must be on file with the department prior to candidate recommendation to the state. Candidates must apply for field experience and meet all prerequisites outlined in the field experience manual prior to placement. Candidates will take a comprehensive examination. PREREQUISITE: Statistics Institutional and interdisciplinary fit Guided by the University's mission of whole-person health care, California's new standards for school counseling, and the expanding nature of professional collaboration in mental health, school counseling curriculum has been organized into the following three domains: I. Educational foundations and belief systems, II. Theoretical and cognitive competence, III. Counseling competence and commitment to service. Graduate students are expected to combine the knowledge and skills learned in these domains with an understanding of the University's mission to formulate a well thought-out, clearly articulated personal belief system that embodies the student's ethical values. Development of this personal epistemology requires that the student examine his or her understanding of the sources of meaning, purpose, hope, and practice. These issues include the following: Beliefs about the nature, origin, and future of humans Equality and inclusion Honoring personal and cultural values with sensitivity toward diversity Relationships to transitions and communities of faith Integrity toward self and others Sources of strength and renewal Generosity of spirit Competence and conscientiousness Courses with an asterisk indicate the 28 additional units required of students earning an M.S. degree in marital and family therapy. Curriculum Domain I: Educational foundations and belief systems Foundational courses in learning theory, educational psychology, sociocultural competence, research, and statistics are considered foundational to building competence as a school counselor. These foundational courses include the following. COUN 501 or MFAM 501 Research Tools and Methodology: Quantitative (3) COUN 502 or MFAM 502 Research Tools and Methodology: Qualitative (3) COUN 545 or MFAM 545 Gender Perspectives (2) *COUN 547 or MFAM 547 Social Ecology of Individual and Family Development (3) *COUN 574 Psychological Foundations of Education (4) MFAM 535 Case Presentation and Professional Studies (4) *RELR 564 Religion course as approved by coordinator (3) Curriculum Domain II: Theory and cognitive competence Candidates are challenged with a variety of theoretical constructs from which to develop an approach to counseling that is compatible with their own belief systems and personhood. They are expected to learn how to deconstruct theories, critically evaluate them, and create a foundation upon which to build their professional skills and relationships. The courses that address theoretical dimensions include: *COUN 575 Counseling Theory and Applications (3) 432 UNIVERSITY CATALOG COUN 556 or MFAM 556 Psychopathology and Diagnostic Procedures (3) COUN 568 or MFAM 568 Groups: Process and Practice (3) *COUN 576 Exceptional and Medically Challenged Children (3) *COUN 577 Assessment in Counseling (3) COUN 584 or MFAM 584 Advanced Child and Adolescent Development (3) COUN 674 or MFAM 674 Human Sexual Behavior (3) PREREQUISITE: Statistics (3) Curriculum Domain III: Counseling competence and commitment to service The counseling program is based on the assumption that counseling competence develops from the foundational knowledge, personal epistemologies and theoretical understandings learned in curriculum domains I and II. Another assumption is that competence embraces the concept of service. Activities involving case study and field experience are designed to emphasize service and the development of altruism. By helping K-12 pupils sense the dimensions of personal need and worth in others, candidates grow in their ability to respond with compassion and empathy and cultural competence. As educators, school counselors help K-12 students in their personal development, career preparation, and academic achievement in order to become lifelong learners.

Yacoub ADJUNCT FACULTY Emily Ascencio Alfred Burruel Cornelius Driscoll Lorraine Hedtke Sandra Herrera Flavia Jorge Julia Lambson William Loveless Victor Marshall William Murdoch Michelle Runnels John Ryan Christiane Schubert Frank Tetley Steve Thompson Craig Tucker Debbie Wright The profession of social work centers on the improvement of the quality of life for people and the enhancement of human potential for full productive participation in society. With this philosophy at its core, the master's degree in Social Work Program offered by the School of Science and Technology emphasizes ecological systems, a perspective that focuses on the interaction of a person or system in relation to his/her environment. Reflecting this stance is Loma Linda University's philosophy, \"To Make Man Whole,\" and its heritage as an interna-tional leader in the delivery of services in health care and related facilities. It is the combination of these influences that has guided the development of the foundation curriculum, professional concentrations, and selection of practicum sites for the Master of Social Work Program. SOCIAL WORK\u2014M.S.W. Mission The mission of the Master of Social Work Program is to prepare competent, ethical, and compassionate social work professionals who will possess the knowledge, values, and skills to equip them for a dedicated life of advanced practice in health and mental health institutions and agencies. Goals The goals of the Master of Social Work Program are: To provide quality graduate social work education that instills in students the common knowledge, ethics, and values of the profession; To provide a foundation curriculum to support students' development and application of a generalist practice; To provide quality graduate social work education that instills in students respect for diversity, populations at risk, and the promotion of social and economic justice; To provide advanced curricula in behavioral health concentrations in clinical social work practice, and policy planning and administration; To strengthen the student's academic experience through strong collaborations with area agencies and institutions; To be responsive in addressing the educational needs of social work in health and mental health institutions and agencies in the surrounding community; and To express through curriculum and co-curricular activities the University's mission of wholeness. Accreditation The Master of Social Work Program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education to provide graduate-level social work education. PREREQUISITE Graduate social work education builds on a broad liberal arts (general education) foundation. The program assesses the liberal arts foundation of students applying to the M.S.W. degree program from two perspectives: * 1. Foundation concepts and/or skills in each of the following: Interviewing and counseling (3) Human biology: (3) Human growth and development* (3) Cross-cultural issues (3) Introductory statistics (3) Unit values represent the quarter system of measurement. Content from multiple courses may be used to meet most requirements. SOCIAL WORK\u2014ST 435 2. A balance of course work in four liberal arts areas: Humanities (e.g., history, philosophy, literature, art, music, etc.) (20-24) English and communication skills (e.g., oral and written communication media, etc.) (8-12) Mathematics and natural sciences (e.g., mathematics, human biology, physiology, etc.) (12-16) Social sciences (e.g., psychology, sociology, anthropology, human development, ethnic studies, economics, political science or government, etc.) (12-16) Students not meeting the minimum number of units in any of the foregoing areas are required to complete additional course work prior to enrolling in the related M.S.W. classes. Table 1 outlines the time frame for completion of pre-requisites. Note: All prerequisite requirements must be completed before advancement to candidacy (prior to beginning the advanced curriculum). TABLE 1 SEQUENCING OF PREREQUISITE REQUIREMENTS Courses Time/place Human biology Prior to SOWK 511, 512 Human growth and development Prior to SOWK 511, 512 Cross-cultural issues Prior to SOWK 511, 512 Introductory statistics Prior to SOWK 549 Interviewing and counseling Prior to SOWK 578 and 757A-C Admission requirements Following are the admission requirements for the Master of Social Work Program: Applicants must have a bachelor's degree from an accredited university or college official transcripts are evidence of courses completed). The department assesses the liberal arts preparation of each of its applicants in two areas: (a) the balance of course work, in four liberal arts areas, and (b) specific course work considered preparatory to the program's foundation (first year) courses (see also Liberal Arts Requirements in M.S.W. Student Handbook). Applicants must submit a completed application, including a personal statement, application fee, all college and/or university transcripts, and three letters of recommendation at least (one from an academic source and one from a work supervisor). Applicants must meet the minimum academic and professional compatibility criteria established by the program. Applicants must have a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or above (on a 4.0 scale) (special consideration may be given to applicants with grade point averages as low as 2.85 if the last part of their college work shows significant improvement). Applicants whose cumulative grade point average does not meet the minimum requirements stated above may receive further consideration for admission to the M.S.W. program by providing a satisfactory GRE score, or two years related employment experience. Work experience must be verified by employers' statements on official agency stationery. Applicants must show evidence of professional compatibility, personal qualifications and motivation to complete a graduate program by obtaining a passing score on the admissions interview with the Department's Admissions Committee. Evaluation criteria for the interview includes: verbal communication skills; critical thinking ability; values congruent with the social word profession; appreciation of human diversity evidence of reflective learning; and comportment. No academic credit is given for life experience or previous work experience for any part for the Master of Social Work program (i.e., field practicum or courses in the professional foundation or advanced curricula). CURRICULUM The 78-unit curriculum of the M.S.W. degree program provides the mix of academic, experiential, and research experiences essential for M.S.W. degree students. Students must maintain a program grade-point average of 3.0 (or a letter grade of B on a 4.0 scale) and meet the knowledge, skill, and professional performance competencies outlined by the program. The minimum acceptable grade for required (core) courses is a B- (2.7). Grades in selective courses must be a minimum of a C (2.0). Courses with grades falling below the standards set for required and selective courses must be repeated. Students are financially responsible for the cost of repeating courses where grades obtained do not meet the minimum standards. General overview The program begins with the professional foundation content (first-year courses) common to all graduate social work education. Courses during this first year of study provide content in human behavior in a cross-cultural environment, social welfare policy and services, practice theory and skills, social research, and practica. These content areas are strengthened by the integration of social work values and ethics; as well as knowledge of special populations (i.e., issues of gender, race, class, disability, and oppression). Program options Alternate program options have been designed to address the varying needs of students. As such, the 436 UNIVERSITY CATALOG program offers a full-time two-year option, a three-year part-time option, and a four-year part-time option. Advanced standing The M.S.W. degree program does not admit students with advanced standing. Rather, it recognizes the knowledge and skills of individuals who have received a baccalaureate degree from an accredited social work program. This recognition indicates that the candidate may have already met the proficiency outcomes expected of M.S.W. degree students who have completed the foundation curriculum. Such candidates may transfer up to 30 course units of first-year course work and 280 hours of first-year field practicum. Criterion for course transfers is available through the department. The curriculum for students who are granted these transfers still requires two academic years of residency. The students will have additional time to complete their thesis or advanced research course work for socialization into the profession, as well as opportunity to take advantage of the rich inter-disciplinary options available at Loma Linda University. Students may petition to accelerate the completion of the M.S.W. degree with a minimum of four quarters in full-time residence. The unit load for each of these quarters cannot exceed 15 units, nor are students allowed to transfer foundation courses when content is required by California state law. In addition, students who have difficulty applying foundation skills in their practicum regard-less of their baccalaureate degree) may have course transfers revoked or denied. Transfer students Individuals transferring from other accredited M.S.W. degree programs may transfer units for didactic course work in accordance with University policy. Field practicum experiences are nontransferable. M.S.W. degree advanced curriculum The advanced curriculum of the program begins with course work that supports integration of the foundational first year with the program's advanced curriculum. As part of the advanced curriculum, students take core courses required of all students and then select one of two concentrations. PROFESSIONAL CONCENTRATIONS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH The Social Work Program offers two concentrations for professional practice, which are the focus of the second-year study: clinical practice; and policy, planning, and administration. Clinical-practice concentration The clinical-practice concentration requires mastery of advanced-practice roles, modes of intervention, and methods used in clinical health and mental health settings. Study includes the integration of clinical-practice theories, diagnostic assessment, problem-solving skills and techniques; as well as the impact of policy upon the availability of treatment, treatment modalities, and expectation of outcomes. Students' experiences and knowledge are expanded through the selection of practicum sites and selectives concerning special population and problem areas. These include, but are not limited to, children at risk, geriatric dilemmas, mental disorders, substance abuse, and family conflict. The integration of cultural diversity as a factor guiding the analysis and intervention with clinical populations is incorporated into the totality of the concentration. Policy, planning, and administration concentration The policy, planning, and administration concentration is designed to prepare students for management roles in health and mental-health care organizations. It focuses on giving students understanding and skill in: interdisciplinary practice; systems establishment and maintenance to assist individuals, families, and groups managing health and illness in the context of the life cycle; social change promotion in health and mental health care organizations; and health and mental health policy analysis. In this way, students have an opportunity to integrate and explore health and mental-health practices and policies from their underlying value base; and to explore the impact of cultural definitions on health, illness, and systems designs. CENTRAL ACADEMIC PROCESSES AND COGNATES Professional practica Professional practica experiences (field practica) are regarded as an integral part of the M.S.W. degree program because these offer students opportunities to integrate and apply theoretical and research knowledge with social work practice and intervention skills in institutional or agency settings. Practica are designed (and selected) to provide maximum learning opportunities under the supervision of a qualified field instructor. As such, experiences are patterned to build upon one another, presenting the increasing challenges present in the continuum of generalist to advanced social work practice. Students complete 21 units of professional practica\u2014which includes 1,080 hours of field work in a qualified setting and 120 hours of concurrent integrated seminar for a total of 1,200 hours. Emphasis during SOWK 757A,B,C Professional Foundation Practicum and Seminar (9 professional practica units requiring 480 hours of practicum and 60 hours of seminar) is placed on achieving generalist social work knowledge, values, and skills, including developing rapport with agency personnel and clients, acquiring interviewing skills, and obtaining beginning-level psychosocial assessment and intervention capabilities. The content of the concurrent seminar further supports this perspective as it provides students with opportunities to integrate their practicum experiences with their developing professional identity. SOCIAL WORK\u2014ST 437 The SOWK 787A,B,C Advanced Professional Practicum and Seminar (12 units of professional practica units requiring 600 hours of practicum and 60 hours of seminar) reflect students' choice of concentration and provide the depth and breadth of learning opportunities that underpin the acquisition of advanced-practice capabilities. More specifically, advanced professional practica experiences are expected to promote increased insight and understanding of agency and/or client systems as these build on the professional foundation skills achieved during the first year of study. Research The M.S.W. degree program includes completion of course work in applied research. An individually authored thesis option is available for students meeting program criteria. These study options aim to develop knowledge for the advancement of social work practice and provide guided experiences in the conduct of research applicable to a variety of professional and academic settings. Guidelines for these options are provided by the School of Science and Technology and the department. Professional foundation processes and cognates Two academic review processes take place during the first year of the M.S.W. degree program. These are: 1. M.S.W. advancement G.P.A. The M.S.W. advancement G.P.A. provides an initial predictor used for gatekeeping. The first 12 units completed towards the M.S.W. degree, including units acquired during nonmatriculation, must be completed with a G.P.A. of 3.0. Students who fail to achieve at this level may be dismissed from school. Students receive orientation to the process and requirements of the M.S.W. advancement G.P.A. during the student orientation conducted prior to the Fall Quarter. 2. Qualifying review When all foundation course work is completed, students are required to pass the program's qualifying review. The intent of this process is to: assist faculty and students in assessment of strengths and areas for improvement; provide feedback; foster an environment of self-evaluation; and encourage heightened participation in individualized academic development. Ultimately, the results of this review help both the student and faculty to develop learning objectives for the concentration year. A specific orientation is held to explain the expectations, format, and scheduling of the qualifying review process. Advanced curriculum cognate\u2014wholeness portfolio All students complete a wholeness portfolio during SOWK 787A,B,C Advanced Professional Practicum and Seminar. This review of the student's individualized objectives and professional development during the second year of study\u2014combined with a discussion of his/her plans for employment and further growth\u2014is seen as a capstone academic experience that facilitates closure and the final stage of reflection and review in the development of a scholar-practitioner.

CLINICAL SOCIAL WORK\u2014PH.D. The School of Science and Technology's Department of Social Work and Social Ecology is an interdisciplinary academic unit committed to the University's mission of human wholeness and to the belief that one's fullest development is achieved when all aspects of an individual's life are in balance. Both conceptually and pragmatically the programs in the Department of Social Work and Social Ecology are guided by an overarching ecological (bio-psycho-social-spiritual) perspective that employs scientific methods of problem analysis and program design. A key component in this framework is the importance of considering the relationships among behavioral, sociopolitical, economic, and environmental problems. The result is an interdisciplinary teaching, learning, and practice environment designed to create interventions that will improve the functions of the individuals, families, groups, organizations, and SOCIAL WORK\u2014ST 439 communities. As such, priority has been given to creating an academic milieu favorable to educating competent, ethical, and compassionate professionals and scholars who are capable of respecting and addressing the needs of diverse populations. Mission and objectives This doctoral program aims to provide social workers with advanced knowledge to become researchers, educators, and clinicians capable of applying this knowledge to every practice context in professional clinical social work. It purposefully instills a high appreciation for knowledge development and dissemination, and demonstrates respect and appreciation for the needs and issues inherent in human diversity, promotion of social and economic justice, and clinical populations-at-risk. To prepare graduates for leadership roles in social work education. To prepare graduates to analyze clinical issues and treatment alternatives as a basis for decision- making; and To prepare graduates to be researchers engaged in the development of knowledge regarding the bio-psychosocial-spiritual dynamics of human behavior. Admission requirements The Clinical Social Work Program is open to students who demonstrate leadership and scholarly potential. Admission to the program is governed by the policies and procedures established by the School of Science and Technology. An admission committee of social work faculty oversees the admission process, reviews applications and recommends students for admission to the program.

Spanish Studies for Health Care Professionals CLARA RAMIREZ, Program Coordinator Graduates of Loma Linda University have a long history of service, domestically and around the world. The purpose of this certificate program is to provide general education that articulates with community service, mission electives, or short mission trips in the United States and international settings. The certificate is consistent with WASC recommendations that baccalaureate programs actively foster an understanding of diversity and ensure breadth for all students in the areas of cultural, aesthetic, social, political, scientific, and technical knowledge expected of educated persons in this society. Course work in the cultural studies certificate enables the student to engage the population served at a deeper level than possible without skills in language and knowledge of Hispanic history, literature, and society. The theoretical, structured course in service learning provides a philosophical and theological basis for service, as well as an opportunity to reflect on and integrate the various components. The 22-unit certificate is available only to students who are concurrently enrolled in a degree program of the University or to those who complete a minimum of 17 of the required 22-quarter units at Loma Linda University. For undergraduate students, the courses also contribute to meeting GE require-ments. Courses include language (8 units); litera-ture, history and social sciences (4 units); diversity (4 units); and a service-learning course. For the certificate in Spanish Studies, an immersion language and culture program is required, as well as an international service project with a Spanish-speaking population. The Christian-service course units are the two bookends of the certificate. The first unit includes a theoretical, theological, and philosophical basis for service and provides the outline for the portfolio. In the second unit, the student completes the portfolio that integrates and summarizes the entire experience. SPECIAL IMAGING TECHNOLOGY\u2014AH 441 Spanish-language proficiency at the high-elementary or low-intermediate level is required and will be assessed by examination.

Bratlund Melissa K. Backstrom-Gonzales Noha S. Daher Keiko I. Khoo Jean B. Lowry Karen J. Mainess Jan McFarland Brian D. Sharp Paige Shaughnessy Speech-language pathologists evaluate and treat children and adults with communication disorders. Difficulties in the areas of speech, language, fluency, swallowing, and voice are associated with a variety of disorders\u2014including developmental delay, hearing impairment, cleft palate, cerebral palsy, stroke, and head injury. Audiologists are concerned with prevention, identification, assessment, and rehabilitation of hearing disorders. Students who choose these professions should have an interest in working with people. Speech-language pathology assistants work under the direction of a qualified speech-language pathologist. The assistant's duties include conducting nonskilled therapeutic activities and assisting in therapy, as directed by the supervising speech-language pathologist. Opportunities Employment opportunities for speech-language pathologists and audiologists exist in speech and hearing clinics, public schools, hospitals, universities, health departments, skilled-nursing facilities, home-health agencies, rehabilitation centers, industry, and private practice. These environments allow for considerable flexibility relative to personal interest within the profession. There is ample opportunity for employment. Employment opportunities for speech-language pathology assistants include working with children in schools; or with children and adults in private clinics, hospitals, or skilled-nursing facilities. SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY ASSISTANT \u2014A.S.

CARR, Program Coordinator, Biomedical and Clinical Ethics ROBERT GARDNER, Doctoral Degree Program Coordinator, Department of Social Work and Social Ecology FACULTY The faculty for the combined-degrees program in biomedical and clinical ethics and in social policy and social research is drawn from the Faculty of Religion and from the Department of Social Work and Social Ecology in the Loma Linda University School of Science and Technology. Purpose of the program The purpose of this M.A./Ph.D. combined-degrees program in biomedical and clinical ethics and in social policy and social research is to facilitate more efficient completion of two graduate degrees for students with strong interests in both bioethics and social policy. Students who complete this combined program will be prepared to make significant interdisciplinary contributions to the field of social policy and ethics. Individuals working in the area of social policy must be able to undertake and publish research on social problems. This requires the ability to apply ethical theory to real-world policy scenarios. Graduates will be able to provide leadership to the social policy arena by conducting interdisciplinary research on various issues and agendas that have significant moral implications. Participants in the combined program will utilize the important resource networks within the University (ethics, social sciences, health professions) and those organizations and persons working on solutions to social problems. COMBINED-DEGREES PROGRAMS 451 Course requirements To enter the proposed program, students must gain separate acceptance to both graduate programs. Students complete all the core requirements for each degree and complete approved electives for both degrees by taking course work in bioethics and social policy, authorized by their respective advisers in both programs. To the extent possible, research projects in both programs focus on the interface of ethics and social policy. All other degree requirements, such as comprehensive examinations and theses or papers, are to be completed as prescribed in the two programs.

Clinical Ministry\u2014FR with Marital and Family Therapy\u2014ST M.A./M.S. SIROJ SORAJJAKOOL, Program Coordinator, Clinical Ministry MARY E. MOLINE, Program Coordinator, Marital and Family Therapy FACULTY The faculty for the combined-degrees program in clinical ministry and marital and family therapy is drawn from the Faculty of Religion and from the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences, Loma Linda University School of Science and Technology. 452 UNIVERSITY CATALOG THE PROGRAM The combined Master of Arts degree program in clinical ministry and Master of Science degree program in marital and family therapy (MFAM) have many common subject areas, such as the spiritual and clinical emphasis in caring for the whole person. The joining of the two degree programs provides the student with the added Christian clinical counseling skills needed to minister to many spiritual and mental health problems. The MFAM degree also prepares the student for a clinical license. Licensure allows the student in the M.A./M.S. combined-degrees program more options for practice, including private practice. The student's ability to provide more services to the community\u2014in addition to the traditional areas of practice, such as hospitals, churches, and schools\u2014is increased. The primary objectives of the combined-degrees program in clinical ministry and marital and family therapy are to: 1. Produce skilled professionals in clinical ministry and marital and family therapy in a family clinical ministry track. 2. Expose students to the currently available content material in the fields of clinical ministry and marital and family therapy. 3. Provide for supervised field and clinical training that will give students the opportunities to apply and integrate theoretical knowledge toward the development of clinical ministry and family therapy skills and competencies. 4. Provide activities by which students can develop the personal and professional maturity required to identify with the spiritual preventive and curative aspects of clinical ministry and marital and family therapy. The family clinical ministry track provides the basis for doctoral work in mental health and religious studies. Outstanding students are encouraged to explore possibilities for further studies. Course requirements In order to receive the Master of Arts in clinical ministry and the Master of Science in marital and family therapy degrees from Loma Linda University, the student will complete a minimum of 102 units of course work as specified, with an overall grade point average of B or better, with no grade lower than a C and with no grade in a core course lower than a B-.
