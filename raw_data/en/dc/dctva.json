Steps To Meditate With Crystals Once you have chosen the best crystal for your meditation, the next step is to actually use it. Let's take a look at how to use them during meditation. - Begin by clearing your crystals' energy. This can be done by burning sage or palo santo around your crystals, or by soaking them in salt water overnight. - Place your crystal near you, hold it in your hand, or place it on a particular chakra while lying down. - Begin your meditation as you regularly would, but channeling your energy toward the crystal. - Allow the crystal to do its work. Go on with your meditation as you normally do. Your energy will bind to the crystal and then, if you later come back to the crystal or carry it with you throughout your day, it will bring you back to the state of mind you were in during your meditation. - If you are looking for a certain outcome or have a goal in mind, then set your intention with your crystal and use visualization during your meditation. Focus on channeling the energy that comes from your visualization into your crystal. Everyone has their own way of meditating, and using crystals is the same. There is no right or wrong way to use crystals in your meditation. It is more about the energy created while using them than how exactly you use them. Tips & Tricks When Using Crystals For Meditation If you are wanting to try using crystals in your meditation, then here are some tips & tricks to help you: - Use a clear quartz with any other crystals during meditation to enhance the effects of the other crystal. - Try placing the crystals on your chakras during meditation. For example, if you are wanting to manifest better communication, then try placing aquamarine over your throat chakra. - If you can't \"feel\" the energy from your crystal, try cleansing it with any of the above mentioned methods. - If you aren't sure what type of crystal to use for meditation, using just a clear quartz can help balance your chakras and create peace and calm. - Believe in their healing properties. If you use crystals in your meditation, you have to believe that they will bring you the outcome you are looking for, or they won't. What Crystal Shape Can You Use? Crystals come in all shapes and sizes. That being said, there are several different types that can be used for meditation. For example, the mala necklace comes with 108 crystals and is typically used for affirmations and meditation. Mala necklaces are used to repeat an affirmation 108 times during meditation and are helpful in focus and concentration. Another type of crystal that can be used is a crystal tower. These are great for setting up an altar or a space where you can clear your mind and focus on your meditation. They can also be held during meditation, in order to transfer energies. Of course, smaller, naturally shaped crystals are just as effective and can be used during meditation as well. Either held, placed upon different chakras, or set up in a sacred altar space. Grab your crystals, find a nice, quiet place, and get meditating!
