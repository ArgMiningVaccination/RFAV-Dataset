................................................................................................................63 Child Care Facility Handbook Page | 6 1 Introduction To protect the health and welfare of children, it is the intent of the Legislature to develop a regulatory framework that promotes the growth and stability of the child care industry and facilitates the safe physical, intellectual, motor, and social development of the child. To that end, the Child Care Regulation Program is responsible for regulating programs that provide services that meet the statutory definition of \"child care.\" This is accomplished through the inspection of licensed child care programs to ensure the consistent statewide application of child care standards established in statute and rule, and the registration of child care providers not subject to inspection. The Department regulates licensed child care facilities, licensed family day care homes, licensed large family child care homes, and licensed mildly ill facilities in 62 of the 67 counties in Florida. Five counties have decided- either by statute or by the adoption of a local ordinance or resolution- to designate a local licensing authority to regulate child care providers in their areas. The following counties have elected to exercise this option: Broward, Hillsborough, Palm Beach, Pinellas, and Sarasota. Local licensing agencies may use the same or different procedures to implement local licensing standards, which must have been determined by the state to meet or exceed the state's minimum licensing standards. Three of the five local licensing agencies have designated the local county health department as the licensing authority. Broward and Hillsborough counties have designated other agencies as the local licensing authority. 1.1 Child Care Programs Subject to Regulation \"Child care\" is defined as \"the care, protection, and supervision of a child, for a period of less than 24 hours a day on a regular basis, which supplements parental care, enrichment, and health supervision for the child, in accordance with his or her individual needs, and for which a payment, fee, or grant is made for care.\" If a child care program meets this statutory definition of \"child care, \"it is subject to regulation by the Department/local licensing agencies, unless specifically excluded or exempted from regulation by statute. Every program determined to be subject to licensing must meet the applicable licensing standards established by subsection 402.301-.319, Florida Statutes, and rules. 1.2 Definitions \"Active\" is the status of a candidate's awarded credential or certification signifying requirements have been successfully met. \"Age appropriate\" means of the right size, child sized, or adapted so that a child can use safely, and suitable to the chronological age range and developmental characteristics of a specific age group of children or child.

In such case, the provider will not be issued a renewal license until the final order is entered and any fine imposed has been paid. If the provider has filed a timely and complete application for the renewal of a license, the provider will be able to continue to operate as long as provisions are in place to ensure the continued health and safety of the children in care during the application determination and any subsequent administrative hearing. This provision does not limit Department's authority to issue an emergency suspension order. C.

All individuals authorized to pick up a child must be identified in writing prior to release by the custodial parent or legal guardian to the program, and the program must verify the individual picking up the child is authorized by using a picture form of identification. Each child transported must be dropped at the designated Child Care Facility Handbook Page | 13 location as agreed upon by the provider and the custodial parent/legal guardian and released to an authorized individual. F. No person shall be an operator, owner, or employee of a child care facility while using or under the influence of narcotics, alcohol, or other drugs that impair a person's ability to provide safe care and supervision. G. In addition to the number of child care personnel required to meet the staff-to- child ratio, one additional adult must attend field trips away from the child care facility to help provide direct supervision. The individual could be a parent volunteer as long as that person is under direct and constant supervision of a screened and trained child care personnel. H.

C. There must not be any propped bottles. If a child cannot hold the bottle, child care personnel must hold the bottle during feeding. There must be no automatic feeding devices unless prescribed by a doctor and documentation is available in the child's file. 2.4.5 Water Activity Supervision If a facility uses a swimming pool on site or during a field trip that is more than three feet deep or uses beach or lake areas for water activities, the following requirements must be met: A. There must be at least one certified lifeguard present and on duty. If the lifeguard is hired by the facility, this person is considered child care personnel and can also serve as the additional adult to meet the requirement in 2.4.1(G) above.

All areas of the facility must have lighting that provides adequate illumination and comfort for facility activities, a minimum of 20 foot-candles of lighting is required. Lighting must be sufficient to allow for adequate supervision and safe entering and exiting of the room. B. For reading, homework, painting and other close work areas, 50 foot-candles at the work surface is required. C. During naptime, lighting must allow child care personnel to visually observe and supervise children. 3.3.2 Windows and Screens When the windows or doors are open for more than entering/exiting purposes, all buildings must have and maintain screens to prevent entrance of any insects or rodents. Screens are not required for open-air classrooms and picnic areas. 3.3.3 Temperature and Ventilation A. An inside temperature of 65 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit must be maintained at all times. B. Adequate ventilation must be maintained in all areas of the facility, in particular in areas where arts and crafts are conducted, and during any cleaning, sanitizing, or disinfecting procedure, to prevent children and child care personnel from inhaling harmful or potentially toxic fumes. 3.4 Licensed Capacity 3.4.1 Licensed Capacity A. The capacity, as calculated by the licensing authority, must be posted in a conspicuous location within each room. B. The licensed capacity of a child care program is determined by the following factors: 1. Indoor floor space 2. Outdoor square footage 3. Sewer/septic capacity (as determined by Environmental Health) 4. Number of toilets/wash basins Child Care Facility Handbook Page | 23 Licensed capacity is determined by the most restrictive of these factors. C. The total number of children in care on-site and while on field trips may never exceed the facility's licensed capacity. 3.4.2 Indoor Square Footage/Usable Floor Space A. A child care that had a valid license on October 1, 1992 must have a minimum of 20 square feet of usable indoor floor space for each child. This provision is not affected by a change of ownership as long as the program remains continuously licensed at the original site. A child care facility that did not hold a valid license on October 1, 1992 and seeks approval to operate as a child care facility must have a minimum of 35 square feet for each child. B. Usable indoor floor space refers to space available for indoor play, classroom, work area, or nap area. C. To determine overall facility capacity, usable indoor floor space is calculated by measuring at floor level from interior walls and by deleting space for stairways, toilets and bath facilities, permanent fixtures and non-movable furniture. Kitchens and designated food preparation areas, offices, laundry rooms, storage areas, hallways, and other areas not normally used or accessible to the children in daily operations are not included when calculating usable indoor floor space to determine total facility capacity. D. Each room routinely used as a classroom must provide the minimum 35 square footage of usable indoor floor space per child. E. Shelves or storage for toys and other materials will be considered as usable indoor floor space if accessible to children. F. Where infants are in care, they must have open indoor floor space outside of cribs and playpens. The space used for play may be the same space used for cribs and play pens, if the cribs and play pens can be moved to allow for open floor space. 3.4.3 Multipurpose Rooms A. Space that is used as a common dining area or for large group assemblies/activities is included in the usable indoor floor space for purposes of determining overall facility capacity. B. Common area (i.e., multiple purpose rooms or dining rooms) square footage may not be counted in such a manner as to expand the capacity of individual rooms in the facility. C. Square footage per child and room capacity are determined on a room-by- room basis. D. While a common area is being used for dining or specific large group assemblies/activities (special events), the applicable 20- or 35- square foot requirement of usable indoor floor space does not apply, although supervision and ratios must still be maintained. This means that for special events, the overall room capacity may be greater than it would be under normal use; however, the facility must maintain minimum square footage per child in accordance with the local fire authority requirements. E. Common area square footage may not be counted toward the facility's overall capacity unless the space is used regularly, and other classroom capacity requirements are not exceeded. Child Care Facility Handbook Page | 24 3.4.4 Outdoor Square Footage The play area must be sufficient and safe to allow freedom of movement without collisions among active children. Children benefit from being outside as much as possible, and it is important to provide sufficient outdoor space to accommodate them. A. There must be a minimum of 45 square feet of usable, safe, and sanitary outdoor play area per child, one year of age and older. At a minimum, the outside play area must be able to accommodate one-half of the licensed capacity of the program. B. For the purposes of a licensed urban child care facility, an additional minimum of 45 square feet of usable indoor play space for 25% of the licensed capacity shall be substituted for outdoor play space. The urban child care facility must provide this additional indoor space with equipment that provides physical activity appropriate to the age of the children. C. Based on the outdoor square footage, the total number of children using the play area may not exceed the outdoor capacity. D. For Indoor Recreational Facilities or facilities that provide only evening child care, outdoor play space is not required provided an open area within the existing indoor space is designated and available for play that promotes the development of gross motor skills. 3.5 Outdoor Play Area A. The outdoor play area must be clean and free from litter, nails, glass and other hazards. B. The outdoor area must be designed to allow child care personnel to clearly see children while playing on all equipment. C. The outdoor play area must provide shade. Shade may be provided by trees, buildings, or structures. D. Children must not come into contact with any surface or equipment which poses a burn risk. E. The facility's outdoor play area must be fenced as required by local ordinances to prevent access by children to all water hazards within or adjacent to outdoor play areas, such as pools, ditches, retention ponds, and fish ponds. F. The outdoor play area must have adequate fencing or walls a minimum of 4 feet in height. Fencing, including gates, must be continuous and must not have gaps or opening larger than 3 \u00bd inches that would allow children to exit the outdoor play area. The base of the fence must remain at ground level and be free from erosion or build- up to prevent inside and outside access by children or animals. These areas must have at least two exits, with at least one being remote from the buildings. If an outdoor play area was approved for usage by the Department prior to October 25, 2017, no new exits are required to be added to meet this standard. However, if outdoor play area fencing is changed then the standard would apply, and two exits must be provided. 3.6 Napping/Sleeping Requirements For the purposes of these requirements, \"sleeping\" refers to the normal night-time sleep cycle, while \"napping\" refers to a brief period of rest during daylight or early evening hours. Child Care Facility Handbook Page | 25 3.6.1 Bedding and Linens Each child in care must be provided safe and sanitary bedding to be used when napping or sleeping. Nap bedding is not required for school-age children; however, the program must provide an area for children that choose to rest. A. Sleep bedding includes beds, cribs, or mattresses.

A handwashing sink shall not be used for any purpose other than handwashing. Handwashing stations must include posted signs visible to child care personnel and children demonstrating proper handwashing technique. Portable sinks may not be used for dishwashing or food preparation. If a portable sink is used for handwashing in the food preparation area, hot water must be provided. 8. Leak-proof, non-absorbent containers covered with a tight-fitting lid for all food waste stored inside the facility. The container must be emptied, cleaned, and sanitized or disinfected daily. 9. A food preparation area shall be clean and free of dust, dirt, food particles, and grease deposits. B. Child care personnel, while working in the food preparation area, must wear proper head covering, such as a hair net or hat. To prevent contact with ready- to-eat foods, child care personnel must use clean disposable gloves, utensils, or similar items in the food preparation area. C. For safety, children must not be present in the food preparation area when meals and snacks are prepared unless being supervised or participating in a cooking activity. 3.9.2 Food Storage Proper storage of food is essential to prevent food contamination, as well as, insect and rodent infestation. Correct handling and storage of all food is a key component in preventing food-borne illnesses. To prevent bacteria growth, cold food must be kept at or below 41 degrees Fahrenheit and hot foods at or above 135 degrees Fahrenheit. Facilities choosing to prepare food must have a designated space for food storage within the designated food preparation area or in a room not calculated as part of indoor floor space, and in an area not used for diapering. Off-site food storage is permissible only if the site of storage is a licensed child care facility under the same ownership that includes a food preparation area that meets licensing standards. A. Food containers, such as cans, plastic containers, boxes and bags must be stored above the floor on clean surfaces protected from splash and other contamination. B. Stored food must be consumed or discarded on or before the expiration dates listed by the manufacturer. C. Poisonous/toxic chemicals or cleaning products must be stored separately from food.

Frozen food must be labeled by date and type noted below and stored according to the following table: Food Item Months Bacon and sausage 1 to 2 mo nths Casseroles 2 to 3 months Frozen dinner and entrees 3 to 4 months Ham, hot dogs, lunch meats 1 to 2 months Meat, uncooked 4 to 12 months Meat, uncooked ground 3 to 4 months Meat, cooked 2 to 3 months Poultry, cooked 4 months Soups and stews 2 to 3 months 3.9.3 Food Safety Handling of food in a safe and careful manner prevents the spread of bacteria, viruses and fungi. Outbreaks of foodborne illnesses have occurred in many settings, including child care facilities. A. Children are at a higher risk for contracting food-borne illness, as their bodies are in the process of growing, developing, and building adequate immune systems to fight illness. While some food-borne illnesses originate at farms or food manufacturing plants, the majority are the result of poor food handling practices. B. If a child care facility provides food to children in care, it must provide nutritious meals and snacks of a quantity and quality to help meet the daily nutritional needs of the children. The USDA MyPlate is to be used to determine which food groups to serve at each meal or snack serving size and age appropriateness of the selected foods for children. Copies of the USDA MyPlate dieting guidelines, incorporated by reference in 65C-22.001(7)(t), F.A.C. In addition, meals and snacks must contain at a minimum the meal and snack patterns shown for infants and children in the Child Care Food Program Meal Patterns which are incorporated by reference in 65C-22.001(7)(r) and (s), F.A.C. Child Care Facility Handbook Page | 32 C. Foods that are associated with young children's choking incidents must not be served to children under 4 years of age, such as, but not limited to, whole/round hot dogs, popcorn, chips, pretzel nuggets, whole grapes, nuts, cheese cubes/sticks and any food that is of similar shape and size of the trachea/windpipe. Food for infants must be cut into pieces \u00bc inch or smaller, food for toddlers must be cut into pieces \u00bd inch or smaller to prevent choking. This applies to all food, even food provided by parents/guardians. D.
