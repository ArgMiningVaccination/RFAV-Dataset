What are the synonyms Surasa What is the source of Tulsi? Plant Based Benefits of Tulsi Modern Science View Tulsi is a well-known immunomodulatory herb that might improve the individual's ability to fight against common cold. Tulsi has antimicrobial, anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory properties, therefore prevents the inflammation of the nasal mucous membrane. It also prevents the regular recurrence of the common cold symptoms[1][16]. Another study states that Tulsi helps gives relief from cough. Ayurvedic View Common cold is caused by an aggravation of Kapha and weak digestion. When the food we eat is not fully digested, it changes into Ama. This Ama reaches the respiratory system in the form of sputum and causes cold or a cough. Tulsi has Deepan (appetizer), Pachan (digestive) and Kapha balancing properties which help to reduce Ama and expel the excessive sputum from the body. Tips to prepare Tulsi Kadha: 1.

It also has antipyretic and diaphoretic activity, which induces sweating and normalizes elevated body temperature[1][16]. Ayurvedic View In Ayurveda, influenza is known as Vata Shleshmika Jwara which is due to the imbalance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Tulsi helps manage influenza by balancing all the three doshas especially Kapha dosha by its Rasayana (rejuvenating) properties and helps boost immunity. Tips to prepare Tulsi Kadha: 1.

It also has anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory properties and reduces the inflammation of the mucous membrane of the bronchial tubes. Tulsi also acts as an expectorant that expels excess mucus from the lungs[1][16]. Ayurvedic View Asthma is known as Swas Roga and the main doshas involved are Vata The vitiated 'Vata' combines with deranged 'Kapha dosha' in the lungs causing obstruction in the respiratory passage. This results in gasping and labored breathing. Tulsi has Kapha and Vata balancing properties which help to remove the obstruction and get relief in asthma. Tip: 1.

Strain and drink warm to manage fever[5]. Modern Science View Tulsi is a well-known adaptogenic herb that might improve the individual's ability to deal with stress. Stress increases the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) which in turn increases the cortisol levels (stress hormone) in the body. Eugenol and ursolic acid in Tulsi reduces the level of cortisol and help manage stress and stress-related problems. The immunostimulant capacity and antioxidant property of Tulsi might also contribute to its adaptogenic action[1][18]. Ayurvedic View Stress can usually be attributed to an imbalance of Vata dosha, and is associated with insomnia, irritation and fear. Tulsi has the property of balancing Vata which helps to reduce stress when taken on a regular basis. Tips to prepare Tulsi Kadha: 1. Take 10-12 Tulsi leaves and add it to 2 cups of water. 2.

Studies suggest that Tulsi has hypoglycemic effect and decreases the elevated blood glucose levels by increasing insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. Tulsi has antioxidant properties, protects the pancreatic cells and also reduces the risk of diabetic complications like impaired liver, kidney and cardiac functions[1][13]. Ayurvedic View Diabetes also known as Madhumeha is due to an aggravation of Vata and impaired digestion. Impaired digestion leads to an accumulation of Ama (toxic remains in the body due to improper digestion) in the pancreatic cells and impairs the function of insulin. Tulsi helps remove Ama and controls aggravated Vata due to its Deepan (appetizer) and Pachan (digestive) properties. This thus helps control high blood sugar level. Modern Science View Tulsi might be useful in preventing stress-related heart diseases. Eugenol and ursolic acid in Tulsi lowers the level of cortisol and help to reduce stress and stress-related problems like heart diseases. Tulsi also has antioxidant property which prevents cardiac lipid peroxidation caused by free radicals. This lowers the risk of heart diseases and helps maintain a healthy heart[15][16]. Ayurvedic View Increase in cholesterol and blood pressure levels along with a stressful life can increase the risk of heart disease. Tulsi reduces the stress level due to its Vata balancing property and controls high cholesterol due to its Ama reducing nature. Together, it helps prevent the heart diseases. Modern Science View Tulsi might be useful in managing viral hepatitis. Tulsi has antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties because of which it protects the liver cells from the damage caused by the virus and free radicals. Therefore, Tulsi not only acts as a hepatoprotective agent but also helps restore the liver functions[1]. Ayurvedic View Liver disorders are due to an aggravation of the Pitta dosha and poor Pachak Agni (digestive fire). This affects the liver function and later vitiates other doshas as well. Tulsi helps to improve Pachak Agni due to its Deepan (appetizer) and Pachan (digestive) properties and prevent toxin-induced damage of liver cells due to its Rasayana (rejuvenating) nature. Modern Science View Tulsi is known to have antimalarial activity. Eugenol in Tusli is the main constituent that has mosquito repellent property[1]. Modern Science View Not enough scientific evidence is available to support the role of Tulsi in case of diarrhea. Ayurvedic View Tulsi manages digestion and gives relief in case of diarrhea by improving the Pachan Agni (digestive fire). It helps in proper digestion of food due to its Deepan (appetizer) and Pachan (digestive) properties and helps control diarrhea. Modern Science View Not enough scientific evidence is available to support the role of Tulsi in insomnia.
