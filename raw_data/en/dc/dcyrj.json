Even though our company started out making shots, we also love taking stick packs on the go. We got tired of all the artificial stuff out there with tons of added sugar, so we decided to create our own. All the best parts of our Clean Energy shots - just add the water to taste. Less water = more flavor! Add 4-8 ounces of water with the powder and mix well. To maximize taste, we suggest using less water as it concentrates the mix and brings out a wonderful burst of delicious flavor. You should not consume more than two energy products in a day. We have designed the caffeine content in one drink mix to be equivalent to one-and-a-half cups of coffee, or 150 milligrams of caffeine. The electrolytes in our drink mix are made up of magnesium, sodium, and potassium. Pure water actually pulls minerals out of your body, but by having minerals in solution you replenish what you sweat out. They are quite effective at providing long-term (not jittery blasts) of energy. Great to take in the AM for sustainable energy all day that can last through a moderate PM workout.
