[Featured products](/collections/front) Hello! My name is Alice. Thank you for visiting my store. Here I am glad to offer a unique collection of handcrafted wooden toys that inspire imagination, encourage exploration, and promote early childhood development. Why is this endeavor so close to my heart? For me, it's not just about the business; it's a passion and a mission to make a difference in children's lives. I firmly believe that the toys children play with during their formative years profoundly impact their growth and development. As a parent myself, I understand the importance of safe and high-quality toys for our little ones. That's why we use only the finest and eco-friendly materials to craft our toys. Each toy is handcrafted with love and attention to detail, ensuring a premium product that meets the highest safety standards. Smart Baby Board is a professional team of craftsmen who have been making busy boards for children around the world for more than 7 years! We believe it is important to comfortably and safely adapt kids to their environment as well as trust and let them try to do everything themselves. The ramp can be used from different sides: the first side is smooth, such a surface is excellent for sliding (what children love most), the other side is meant for climbing. Age: from 6 months Load: up to 60kg Materials: Birch, beech Paintwork: Water based acrylic enamel production We care deeply about the safety of your little ones, so we make sure to use only non-toxic, water-based varnishes and EU-certified acrylic water-based paints.
