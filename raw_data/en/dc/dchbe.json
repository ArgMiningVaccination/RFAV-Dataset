Not only is it extremely simple and cost effective for you, it's one of the most powerful detox protocols out there. How powerful you ask? Let's just say, this is the SAME detox program that the [911 firefighters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rescue_Workers_Detoxification_Project) used to successfully treat their extreme overexposure of toxic dust (a wide array of poisons, including lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins) from the WTC buildings collapsing. This [same detox method](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01672710) was also used to successfully treat veterans with Gulf War Syndrome or Golf War Illness (GWI) . Look up Gulf War Syndrome Project headed by David Carpenter. Why Should WE Detox? We are CONSTANTLY exposed to toxins and heavy metals from our environment and the food that we consume. Toxins are stored in our fat and brain tissue which directly impacts us physically and mentally. While eating healthy can help detox your body, it isn't extremely effective. Dr. George C. Yu, MD recommends that a Niacin detox program become part of our weekly regimen in order to stay healthy and remove harmful toxins that attribute to illnesses. Based on the [Biosphere 2 Studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10630592), Dr. Yu said, \"We also noticed that for the average person now, they are doomed to having lots of chemicals inside their bodies, from 500 times up [compared to their blood level results]\" - this means that when you get a toxicity test done on your blood, it might show that you're fine but in reality the toxins in your fat will show that you are 500 times more toxic! How Does it Work? What's the Science Behind it? Niacin is Vitamin B3 and is created naturally in your body. The idea behind the Niacin Detox is to take a high dose of Niacin paired with moderate to heavy exercise. This combination mobilizes and stimulates lipolysis (the break down of fats). When you take Niacin, it induces a flushing effect. Reaction time is different for each person but normally experienced in 5-10 minutes. As the fats break down from all the breathing and sweating in the infrared sauna, the toxins stored inside the fat are released into the blood stream and then you can remove it. If you don't remove it, you reabsorb the toxins back into your body. There are two main ways to eliminate it from your body: Sweat - Sweating the toxins through the skin via exercise and infrared sauna G.I. Tract - Excreting them out the G.I. tract by binding them with one of the following: Activated Charcoal Zeolite Clay Oils Even some fibers Dr. Yu also explains the detox protocol in this video here What is Removed? Heavy Metals: Mercury, Manganese, Lead, Aluminum, Cadmium from food pesticides etc Pharmaceutical Drugs: Pain Killers, Prozac, etc Other Substances: Heroin, cigarettes, PCP, cocaine, alcohol Formaldehyde, chlorines, Harmful PCBs Food Preservatives Pesticides & Herbicides Anesthetics Plastics Is the Niacin Detox Safe? Niacin is something that you already create in your body. It is converted from your amino acid, tryptophan. When detoxing high doses are safe, there are no side effects other than a flushing effect. We help you build tolerance to niacin slowly, most people can start at 100 mg and slowly build up to taking 1000 - 1500 mg per session. You can slowly build a tolerance by increasing the niacin dosage by 100 mg per detox session. For some extreme conditions of toxicity like the 911 firefighters, you can reach up to 5000 mg per detox session - however you should still consult your doctor on this. A Brief Overview of the detox: Purpose: We at Cloud-9 believe that everyone should detox because these toxins can build up and cause a large range of health issues. Because of this we made this detox as inexpensive as possible so that it's available to most people who want to see progress in their health and well being. It's a simple and extremely powerful detox method used by doctors to eliminate toxins.. Consult your doctor: With any diet, exercise, or supplement change, you should consult your doctor first before attempting to make sure this is right for you. Everyone is different. Brief Overview: We start you with 50-100 mg of Niacin on empty stomach to dilate the blood vessels and cells where toxins are stored so they can easily be removed. Then we use the PEMF for 1-hour to loosen toxins and heavy metals from the body after which you will enter the infrared sauna for 1hr allowing you to sweat out these toxins. After the sauna we give you 500mg of activated charcoal which acts as a binder for any leftover toxins to be removed through the digestive system. During all this we provide you with spring water to keep you hydrated. We provide all the essentials you need (towels, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash). All you need to do is bring yourself :) "}
