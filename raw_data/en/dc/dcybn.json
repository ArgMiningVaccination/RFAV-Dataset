Summaries Of The News: [ Appeals Court Grants Stay On Biden's Vaccine Mandate For Private Businesses ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/appeals-court-grants-stay-on-bidens-vaccine-mandate-for-private-businesses/) The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily halted the federal vaccine rules, pending legal review of the case. Biden administration officials expressed confidence that the orders will prevail as they wind their way through the judicial challenges. [ AP: Appeals Court Halts COVID Vaccine Mandate For Larger Businesses ](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-mandate-halted-osha-appeals-court/) A federal appeals court on Saturday temporarily halted the Biden administration's COVID-19 vaccine requirement for businesses with 100 or more workers. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted an emergency stay of the requirement by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration that those workers be vaccinated by January 4 or face mask requirements and weekly tests.

The court on Saturday ordered the vaccine and testing requirements halted pending review \"because the petitions give cause to believe there are grave statutory and constitutional issues with the Mandate.\" (Kimball, 11/6) [ The New York Times: Biden's Vaccine Mandate Temporarily Blocked, Foreshadowing Uphill Battle ](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/06/world/americas/biden-osha-vaccine-mandate-blocked.html) The stay, issued by a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Louisiana, doesn't have an immediate impact. The first major deadline in the new rule is Dec. 5, when companies with at least 100 employees must require unvaccinated employees to wear masks indoors. Businesses have until Jan. 4 to mandate Covid vaccinations or start weekly testing of their workers. But Saturday's move provided momentum for a wide coalition of opponents of the rule, who have argued that it is unconstitutional.

Citing historical precedents dating back to George Washington during the American Revolution, Murthy said President Joe Biden had faith in both the legality of the mandate and the effectiveness of such requirements. \"The president and the administration wouldn't have put these requirements in place if they didn't think they were appropriate and necessary,\" Murthy told host Martha Raddatz on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"And the administration is certainly prepared to defend them.\" (Cohen, 11/7) [ CNN: White House Chief Of Staff 'Confident' Biden Administration's Vaccine Mandate For Private Businesses Will Be Upheld ](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/07/politics/biden-vaccine-mandate-private-business/index.html) White House chief of staff Ron Klain said he was confident the courts will uphold the validity of the Biden administration's new vaccine rules that apply to private businesses with 100 or more employees, certain health care workers and federal contractors, after a federal appeals court temporarily blocked the requirements on Saturday. \"I'm quite confident that when this finally gets fully adjudicated, not just a temporary order, the validity of this requirement will be upheld,\" Klain told NBC's Chuck Todd on \"Meet the Press.\" \"It's common sense ... If OSHA can tell people to wear a hard hat on the job, to be careful around chemicals, it can put in place these simple measures to keep our workers safe.\" (Wright, 11/7) [ The Washington Post: Thousands Of Federal Workers Seek Religious Exemptions To Avoid Coronavirus Vaccines ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-workers-vaccines-exemptions/2021/11/07/761eb9d8-3da3-11ec-8ee9-4f14a26749d1_story.html) Federal agencies have yet to act on the requests piling into managers' inboxes from vaccine resisters seeking accommodations that would allow them to continue their jobs unvaccinated rather than face the possibility of being fired as the administration has threatened. A far smaller number of employees have asked for exemptions on medical grounds, officials said, prompting what are likely to be more clear-cut decisions on whether to grant them. The number of religious objectors ranges from a little more than 60 people at the Education Department to many thousands among the 38,000-strong workforce at the Bureau of Prisons, according to federal employee union officials.

But first, he has to make sure workers in his own federal government get the shot. About 4 million federal workers are to be vaccinated by Nov. 22 under the president's executive order. Some employees, like those at the White House, are nearly all vaccinated. But the rates are lower at other federal agencies, particularly those related to law enforcement and intelligence, according to the agencies and union leaders. And some resistant workers are digging in, filing lawsuits and protesting what they say is unfair overreach by the White House.

A vast majority of employees view vaccinations as a political issue, which can be tough to navigate in a professional workplace, the survey also found. An overwhelming 84% of employees said politics influences their company leaders' handling of vaccine, mask and testing policies. In fact, the top reason people reported for staying unvaccinated was a lack of trust in the government.

The planned mandates \u2014 which also include even more stringent standards for health care workers \u2014would impact more than 100 million Americans, or more than two-thirds of the workforce. (Reed, 11/8) [ With Infrastructure Win, Democrats Eye Bumpy Road On Spending Bill ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/with-infrastructure-win-democrats-eye-bumpy-road-on-spending-bill/) Late Friday night, the House approved the $1 trillion infrastructure bill and sent it to President Joe Biden to sign. Its companion -- the social spending package that could shake up health care programs -- still faces big hurdles in both chambers as Democrats try to navigate fractious factions and a slim majority. [ The Hill: Spending Bill Faces Senate Scramble ](https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/580454-democrats-shift-focus-to-spending-package-after-infrastructure) President Biden's climate and social spending bill is facing the threat of changes in the Senate as Democrats navigate a slim majority and tricky budget rules. Even as House Democrats have spent days agonizing over trying to work out an agreement that could win over nearly all of their members \u2014 ultimately punting until at least mid-November as moderates push for an analysis of the bill \u2014 Senate Democrats are warning that it is likely to change once it reaches their chamber. The bill faces multipronged challenges in the Senate: An even narrower majority, complex rules governing what can be in the legislation and a chaotic process that lets Republicans try to peel off enough Democrats to inject changes into the legislation or sink it altogether.

Congress is set to take a weeklong recess and return on Nov. 15 with a litany of items to complete in short order to avert a government shutdown and move forward on the roughly $2 trillion education, healthcare and climate package that has proven difficult to negotiate with the party's slim majority in Congress.

The 228-to-206 vote late on Friday is a substantial triumph for Biden's Democrats, who have bickered for months over the ambitious spending bills that make up the bulk of his domestic agenda.

Those two milestones capped off a frantic and nearly disastrous day for the party, ending what has proved to be Speaker Nancy Pelosi's most grueling exercise yet so far this Congress with just three votes to lose. \"The whole day was a clusterfuck, right?\" said senior progressive Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), who helped negotiate the rapprochement with the moderates. \"At the end of the day what we all want to do is get the president's agenda done, and that's what we're going to do.\" (Caygle, Ferris, Wu and Beavers, 11/5) [ CNN: Gottheimer Says He Expects To Move Forward On Social Spending Bill If CBO Score Matches ](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/07/politics/josh-gottheimer-build-back-better-act-cbo-cnntv/index.html) Rep. Josh Gottheimer, the Democratic co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus, indicated Sunday that he wants to wait for an official cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office before moving forward on President Joe Biden's economic agenda bill.\"I think what's most important for people to understand is, the responsible thing to do when you get a piece of legislation like this is to do a full analysis and to understand the impact on your district and the families in your district. And that's what I'm looking at, to make sure that when we vote for this and give the country this win that we deliver the way we should deliver,\" the New Jersey Democrat told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union,\" also expressing optimism that the bill would be fully paid for.

The coverage, which would take effect in 2023, is included in Democrats' proposed $1.85 trillion spending bill, dubbed the Build Back Better Act and aimed partly at strengthening the social safety net. The legislative package still needs approval in both the House and Senate before it could be signed into law by President Joe Biden.

One judge decided the federal government overstepped its bounds when it threatened earlier this year to penalize Novartis and United Therapeutics for curtailing discounts in what is known as the 340B drug discount program. However, the judge in the other case, which was brought by Sanofi and Novo Nordisk, took the opposite view, yet at the same time also told the government to reassess a key issue concerning the use of contract pharmacies, which are at the heart of the dispute.

Her challenge is especially tough because as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Walensky is a political outsider and finds herself playing second fiddle to Anthony Fauci, the face of the U.S. pandemic response who has advised presidents for decades. And there's this: The White House has not hesitated to undercut Walensky's scientific expertise, and the agency's scientific process.

The demands for access to the drug were loud and insistent, despite federal regulators' recent warning against using the drug to treat covid. Ivermectin is a generic drug that has been used for decades to treat river blindness, scabies and even head lice. Veterinarians also use it, in different formulations and dosages, to treat animals for parasites like worms.

However, U.K. data also suggest that among vaccinated people, the chances of getting a breakthrough infection are rising. The rise in breakthroughs in the U.K. is being driven in part by children, still largely unvaccinated in the U.K., passing on the virus to their vaccinated parents.

The adult hyenas, 22-year-old Ngozi and 23-year-old Kibo, have so far exhibited mild symptoms of Covid, including \"a little bit of coughing and sneezing,\" and nasal discharge and lethargy, but they are believed to be \"in good shape and improving,\" Jake Kubi\u00e9, a spokesman for the Denver Zoo, said on Saturday.

She still recalls the case of a young woman who came to New York-Presbyterian Hospital with what ultimately was diagnosed as typhoid fever and learning about the intricate process of tracing that transmission to a nearby fast food restaurant. \"I figured out, through what I had heard from the public health department, that there were three different cases in the city. And they were all traced back to one fast food restaurant in Queens,\" Juthani said. \"They traced it back to one specific worker in that establishment. There are people who can be chronically colonized with salmonella typhi, and they just shed it all the time. And if it contaminates food, it can infect somebody else. It infected three other people that way.\" (Carlesso, 11/7) [ Lake County News-Sun: Lake County Health Officials Say Herd Immunity Against COVID Appears Attainable; 'We're Getting There, But We Don't Want To Stop' ](https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/lake-county-news-sun/ct-lns-lake-vax-update-st-1106-20211105-ul6kysckmjhkffcp4lqvzploze-story.html) A pair of milestones in the effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic arrived this week in Lake County as children between the ages of 5 and 11 became eligible for vaccination against COVID-19, and 79.5% of people 12 and over have been fully vaccinated. Plans to vaccinate the newly eligible children in Lake County are currently shifting into full force as the goal of reaching herd immunity of 80% of the county's entire population looks attainable. \"We're definitely getting there, but a whole new bunch of people are now eligible so our percentage will go down,\" Mark Pfister, executive director of the Lake County health department, said Friday.

The national disease control center, the Robert Koch Institute, said the country has seen 201.1 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days. That was above the previous record of 197.6 from Dec. 22 last year. While it's still a lower rate than in several other European countries, it has set alarm bells ringing.

The protesters held portraits of the woman, 30-year-old Iza, who died in hospital in Pszczyna, southern Poland, from septic shock. She died in September but her death just became known in the last week. Doctors at the hospital held off terminating her 22-week pregnancy despite the fact that her fetus lacked enough amniotic fluid to survive, her family and a lawyer say. The doctors have been suspended and prosecutors are investigating.

The move, which Madrid said is likely to benefit some 8,500 people, was applauded by LGBTQ advocacy groups that have long called for the public health system to pay for procedures such as in vitro fertilization for individuals who can become pregnant. State-funded fertility treatment had previously been limited to heterosexual women who had trouble conceiving children, according to the Associated Press.

The health impact of climate change is immense, with an estimated 12.6 million deaths annually from environmental causes such as air pollution, unsafe drinking water, zoonotic diseases, and weather-related disasters. Clinically, climate effects are linked to increases in pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, mental health burdens, and trauma. This number is expected to grow, with an additional 250,000 annual deaths forecasted.

During the first four months of the pandemic, telehealth accounted for 23.6% of all doctor visits\u2014up from almost none a year earlier. But while experts predict virtual care is here to stay, the emergency legal provisions that allowed its emergence are beginning to expire.

Moline owns AdvisorNet Financial in Austin, Minn. The small business, located across the street from the SPAM Museum, is a MNsure broker enrollment center, meaning it provides free assistance to those buying health insurance on the state-run individual insurance marketplace.

But the latest intra-executive-branch dustup is particularly eyebrow-raising. This fall, acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock wrote a letter to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to share \"areas of concern\" about patents issued for prescription medications. Though couched in the measured tones of bureaucratese, the letter sent a clear signal to the USPTO: Set aside the industry-neutral, congressionally mandated criteria currently in place for deciding whether to grant a patent and weaken intellectual property protections for the drug industry.

That's according to newly released national data, but it is also a conviction I have long held \u2014 not because I represent the district that is home to UChicago Medicine, but because I have witnessed the program firsthand. Many years ago, my late wife, Carolyn, was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. After researching treatment options, we decided to seek care at the University of Chicago Medical Center. There, the heart team recommended that Carolyn receive a left ventricular assist device, or LVAD, a battery-operated pump inserted surgically to aid in pumping blood to the rest of the body. (Rep.

And as we watched them walk through their school doors on their first day this fall, we did so with both a knot of anxiety and a swell of hope. We knew the stakes were high because we are parents. But we also knew the stakes were high because we serve as the secretary of Education and the surgeon general of the United States. So far, we've been heartened by what we see in schools.

I was even unhappier when I learned that he'll be out in part because of how he reportedly tried to protect himself from the virus. Instead of getting vaccinated, according to NFL.com, he received a homeopathic treatment from his doctor and then asked the NFL to count that as being vaccinated. The league did not, and for good reason \u2014 because homeopathy has never been shown to work.

Harris is not over age 65, does not reside in a long-term care facility and does not have a publicly known underlying medical condition that would make her more vulnerable, nor does she hold a job, such as postal worker, that appears on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list of \"high risk\" occupations.

A critical component of any response to COVID-19 is addressing the health insurance coverage gap \u2014 a gap that is largely the result of Tennessee's failure to expand Medicaid. Medicaid expansion is Tennessee's best hope of closing the state's health care coverage gap, and COVID-19 presents a unique opportunity to act. (Kevin "}
