The study, \"Documentation of contraception and pregnancy when prescribing potentially teratogenic medications for reproductive-age women,\" is in Tuesday's issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine. Itexamined the prescriptions filled by 488,175 women between ages 15 and 44 who wereenrolled in a large health-care plan in California in 2001.The studyinvolved both prescription drugsdeemed safe for use in pregnancy (Aand B class drugs) and those seen as presenting a risk to the fetus (D and X class drugs). Class D and X classdrugs include such groups as antibiotics, bendodiazepines, psychiatric drugs and anticonvulsants. \"We found that over the course of a year, one in six women of reproductive age filled a prescription for a medication labelled by the Food and Drug Administration as increasing the risk of fetal abnormalities,\" said Eleanor Schwarz, assistant professor in medicine and obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. \"Many women - and perhaps their physicians - may be unaware of the risks associated with the use of some medications, the chance that women may become pregnant, or both,\" Schwarz, the first study author, said in a release. The study also finds that women who fill prescriptions that can increase risk of birth effects are no more likely to use contraception than other women. One per cent of women on D and X class drugs had a positive pregnancy test within three months of the drug prescription, compared to 1.4 per cent of women taking A or B class drugs. The authors conclude that approximately six per cent of U.S. pregnancies are exposed to classD and X medications. They feel women in their child-bearing years whocould become pregnant while on these drugs should be counselled by doctors about their contraceptive needs. The study's authors point out that their research might overestimate the frequency of inadequate birth control, because only contraceptive pills, patches, rings or injections weretracked. Alternative contraceptive methods, such as condoms, were not factored in. "}
