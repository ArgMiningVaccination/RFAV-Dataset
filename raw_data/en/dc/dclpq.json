Take Claire's story: Claire's Story Claire is a middle-aged woman who was determined to lose weight. She was frustrated that she kept hitting a plateau and could never go below it. She came to our Insights To Health clinic to take part in our 21-Day Detox. The first time Claire did the detox she lost 15 pounds in 21 days. She was able to maintain her weight well but she wanted to lose 10 more pounds. She had not been below 150 since getting married. She lost 5 pounds the 2nd time on the detox but still couldn't break 150. No matter what we tried, she was having trouble getting below 150. She was sleeping better, eating well and maintaining her weight. She had more energy and the muscle aches and pains that had plagued her for years were gone. She possibly had had fibromyalgia without knowing it. On occasion Claire would find that eating certain foods would cause her to swell and her joints to hurt but she couldn't figure out what that was. There was no pattern. I suggested doing heavy metal testing and we discovered she had very high levels of mercury. She stopped eating suspect food. The aches went away and she was able to lose another 7 pounds to get down to 145! We have helped over 500 patients lose an average of 25 pounds each with this program. The success rate of those maintaining that loss has been excellent because of our comprehensive, mind-body approach, education and habit-changing program.

Get started with your Detox For Health And Weight Loss Now! 3 Easy Payments of $59 Donna's Story This cleanse was nothing short of totally transformational, and not just a physical transformation for Donna, a 38-year-old woman from Portland. She was thrilled to have lost 25 pounds. She was feeling great in her clothes, but this program did much more for Donna on multiple levels. Adherence to the program changed long-standing behavior patterns surrounding food and it gave Donna a clarity regarding compulsive eating that she never experienced before. She's now enjoying physical health and a radiant sense of well-being. The detox felt like a vacation for her body. Instead of feeling like it was overly restrictive, Donna enjoyed the simplicity and freedom of the program. The most profound discovery for her was breaking the bad blood sugar roller coaster. Before the detox, Donna was in survival mode: crashing and unable to function when she had a dip in blood sugar that left her craving coffee, chocolate and sugary, floury things to get another lift. Then crashing even more after eating. Her weight continued to increase in this endless cycle. Now, Donna enjoys a tremendous, balanced and consistent energy level. This program brought her out of the downward spiral and into a whole new orientation where she can let her body provide the ample energy she needs without relying on unhealthy substances for short term bursts of energy with bad consequences for her health. Insights To Health Brings The Secret Sauce To This Detox For Health And Weight Loss Home Program This program is like none others you've seen before. It was developed right here at the Insights To Health clinic by Dr. Christie and Dr. Gil Winkelman. Both doctors are gifted naturopathic physicians. Additionally, they've each earned masters degrees in counseling psychology as well. This enables them to uniquely understand the connection between the mind and the body in relation to weight issues. They've created an holistic approach to weight loss that doesn't just focus on the amount of calories entering your system. They've uncovered the relationship between what you're eating and what your body is doing. By understanding the complex systems within your body and how they interact with each other, the doctors can guide you in the steps to take to help your body let go of the unhealthy weight. As counselors, they also understand what's going on with the emotional aspects of trying over and over to lose weight. This home version of the Detox For Health and Weight Loss program has been carefully crafted to lead you out of the wilderness of endless yo-yo dieting and into lasting good health. This new home version of the Detox For Health And Weight Loss is great for buddy dieting with your spouse or friends. Amelia's Letter Amelia, a 39 year old woman from Portland wrote in to say: \"I cannot say enough about both Drs. Gil and Christie Winkelman. They are both incredibly talented doctors and amazing human beings. They have the perfect combination of wisdom and intellect, along with loving kindness and compassion. I've been a yo-yo dieter for more than 20 years, and to finally find a program (Insights to Health's 21-Day Weight Loss and Detox) that feels like it's more about healing from the inside rather than an obsession with how I look, was refreshing. The proven protocols of the program supported me in shedding 30 pounds over the summer. I feel like I now have the knowledge and understanding of my body to maintain my health and weight from this point forth. I feel great physically, mentally and emotionally. I am so very grateful for the process.\" This Detox For Health And Weight Loss program is great for any age but it's especially helpful for women going through menopause when weight seems to appear and is extremely difficult to get rid of. As you metabolism changes, your body may become resistant to the traditional approaches to weight loss. With the special proprietary blend of homeopathic drops and this program's cleansing properties, menopausal weight gain is much easier to lose. Miranda's Story \"After I hit 52, my menopause began. I noticed that, along with the hot flashes and insomnia, I was gaining fat around my middle that was new. No matter how much I exercised, that fat on my stomach would not budge. I had read that hormone changes can cause this type of weight gain. Dr. Christie Winkelman explained how the hormone changes and resulting insomnia had changed how my body was processing food and blood sugar, causing it to gain and maintain that fat layer. I was also fatigued from my missed sleep. She addressed my energy levels, hormones (without prescribing hormones, just with botanical medicine alone), and sleep. As a result, the detox we did was very successful in helping me lose the weight that had been so stubborn. I am back to my slim, energetic self, sleeping great, and the hot flashes are gone!\" *Note: A special support pack is available to help the detox be more effective for women with hormonal issues such as pms, headaches with menses, or heavy menses.
