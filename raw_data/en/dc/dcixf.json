Broadly speaking, Ayurveda is understood to be the generic term for traditional Indian medicine. But as well as being a medical system it includes aspects of philosophy, mythology, diet and yoga as well as mental and spiritual refinement as part of its teachings. Ayurveda's medical branch uses herbal medicines, minerals, animal products, food, massage, air, water, heat, earth, surgery, detoxification and tonification to bring about health. Ayurveda focuses on preventing disease and optimising vitality as much as on removing illness. Thus, it has a holistic approach to health that includes every aspect of life in a philosophy where mind, body and spirit are considered to be an integrated whole.

Traditional Ayurvedic medicinal herbal actions Medicinal substances are classified according to groups that have different physiological actions. The Charaka Samhita lists 50 groups of ten herbs and the Bhavaprakasha Samhita has 24 such categories. These Ayurvedic pharmacological concepts offer deep insight into how herbs work to balance the doshas, dhatus, and malas. They tie together the concepts of taste (rasa), energetics (virya) and post-digestive effect (vipaka) as well as incorporating prabhava so that we can have a clear understanding of the primary action of the herb. The list below contains some of the most popular categories listed throughout the Ayurvedic literature. Abhishyandi These substances block the channels and cause heaviness. The flow of rasa is hindered and stagnation occurs when too much of these substances are used. They are mainly unctuous and heavy in nature; e.g. yoghurt obstructs the flow in the channels. Anuloma These herbs help vayu to move in its appropriate direction. They are often mild aperients and help with flatulence and constipation. They are usually aromatic and carminative herbs, commonly from the umbelifer Apiaceae as [myrrh](https://www.herbalreality.com/herb/myrrh/) (Commiphora myrrha). Balya This means strengthening and these herbs are tonics. They are usually heavy and filled with the earth element, like [bala](https://www.herbalreality.com/herb/bala/) (Sida cordifolia) or [ashwagandha](https://www.herbalreality.com/herb/ashwagandha/) (Withania somniferum). Bhedaniya These are purgative herbs that forcibly expel the solid and liquid parts of faeces. Kutki (Picorrhiza kurroa) has this effect at a high dose. Brmhaniya These are nourishing herbs that are full of the water element; e.g. Shatavari (Asparagus racemosus). herbs actively from the tissues; [guggul](https://www.herbalreality.com/herb/myrrh/) (Commiphora mukul), shilajit (Asphaltum) and black pepper help to detoxify the deeper tissues. Daha prasamana These herbs alleviate burning sensations in the body, such as sandalwood (Santalum album) or [coriander](https://www.herbalreality.com/herb/coriander/) (Coriandrum sativum). Dipaniya These herbs enkindle the digestive fire. They indirectly digest ama. They are usually pungent, hot and dry; for example [long pepper](https://www.herbalreality.com/herb/long-pepper/) (Piper and chitraka (Plumbago zeylanicum). Garbashaya These herbs have an affinity for the uterus, such as ashoka (Saraca indica) and [roses](https://www.herbalreality.com/herb/rose/) (Rosa centifolia). Grahi These herbs dry the moisture of the body and of the wastes; ginger (Zingiber (Syzygium aromaticum). Hridaya These herbs (Terminalia [amalaki](https://www.herbalreality.com/herb/amalaki/) (Phyllanthus officinalis). are renowned for their affinity for the throat; for example licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), long pepper (Piper herbs such as vasaka (Adhatoda vasaka) or long pepper (Piper longum). Krumighna These herbs are specifically for removing parasites and worms; for example [neem](https://www.herbalreality.com/herb/neem/) (Azadiracta indica) or [kalmegh](https://www.herbalreality.com/herb/andrographis/) (Andrographis paniculata). Kushtaghna These are herbs that treat skin as neem (Azadiracta indica) or manjishta (Rubia cordifolia). Lekhaniya These herbs 'scrape' the waste residues out of the body by a drying action. They are usually bitter and pungent in flavour; for Madakari These are substances that cause intoxication, such as alcohol. Mutra sangrahaniya These herbs reduce the flow of urine, such as bhallataka (Semecarpus anarcadium) Mutravirechana These herbs are diuretics that increase the flow of urine, such as [gokshura](https://www.herbalreality.com/herb/gokshura/) (Tribulus terrestris) and coriander directly ama. They do not necessarily stimulate digestion as well; e.g. triphala. Praja sthapana These herbs prevent miscarriage such as ashoka (Saraca indica). Pramathi These herbs remove the accumulated the dhatus and cells; e.g. sangrahaniya herbs specifically clean the blood and 'alter' its chemistry so that it does not cause inflammatory problems; for example [manjishta](https://www.herbalreality.com/herb/manjistha/) (Rubia cordifolia). Rechana These rejuvenate the cells and extend life. They are anti-oxidants and also remove e.g. vacha (Acorus calamus). Sandhaniya These herbs heal broken bones and hasten the repair of broken bone tissue. Guggul (Commiphora mukul) is famous for this. Resins have a significant role here because resins in general are considered to relate to the blood part of plants just as the bark of trees is said to relate to bone tissue. The analogy is that just as resin heals the bark so it heals the bone. They also encourage circulation to flow to the wounded part of the body and hasten healing. Shamana These are herbs that reduce the pathogenic level of a dosha to a more healthful level. The dosha is not expelled from the body, it is calmed. These are 'palliative' herbs; e.g. guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia). Shirovirechan These are herbs that clear the orifices of the head, also known as errhines. Such herbs are vacha (Acorus calamus) or Cloves (Syzygium aromaticum). Shodhana These herbs actually clear the excess doshas out of the body; e.g. manjishta (Rubia cordifolia). Shramshana Herbs that are laxatives and clear digestion is complete; e.g. trivrut (Operculina turpethum). prasamana These asafoetida](https://www.herbalreality.com/herb/asafoetida/)) or cumin (Cuminum cyminum). Shukrala Herbs that increase semen and/or give e.g. (Tribulus terrestris). Snehopaga These are moistening or Tila/Sesame indicum). Stambhana These are astringent herbs that are constipating, stop bleeding and are drying. They have the properties of vata and so increase it. Manjishta (Rubia cordifolia) is a renowned astringent that stops bleeding diseases. Stanyavardhana These herbs can increase lactation; for example fennel (Foeniculum and [shatavari](https://www.herbalreality.com/herb/shatavari/) (Asparagus racemosus). Stanya shodhana These (Foeniculum vulgare) and musta (Cyperus rotundus). Sukshma These herbs are penetrating herbs that can travel through the minutest channels, such as salt, neem oil (Azadiracta indica) and [gotu kola](https://www.herbalreality.com/herb/gotu-kola/) (Hydrocotyle asiatica). vulgaris) and vasaka (Adhatoda (Adhatoda vasaka). Triptighna These (Phyllanthus officinalis). Udara prasamana These pit shirish (Albizzia lebbek). Vajikarana These are aphrodisiacs that increase sexual desire, strengthen the reproductive system and nourish shukra work specifically on pitta and kapha that have accumulated in the stomach. They move upwards and outwards. High doses of [licorice](https://www.herbalreality.com/herb/licorice/) [Aloe vera](/herb/aloe-vera) (Aloe [Rosa centifolia](https://www.herbalreality.com/herb/rose/)). Vedana sthapana These are (Syzygium aromaticum) or ashoka (Saraca indica). Vikasi These herbs destroy the tone of the joints by loosening the ligaments; e.g. Betel nut (Areca catechu). Virechana These herbs are purgatives that move downwards. They dissolve undigested foods and expel them; e.g. [haritaki](https://www.herbalreality.com/herb/haritaki/) (Terminalia chebula). Vishaghna are indica). Vyavayi These herbs spread everywhere in the body and are then digested; e.g. ganja (Cannabis sativum) and opium (Papaver somniferum). Yogavahi These are catalyst herbs. When they are mixed with another herb they enhance its action; e.g. ginger (Zingiber officinale), Honey and Ghee. Traditional Ayurvedic treatment methods - Treat the doa - Treat the agni - Treat the dhtu - Treat the disease (Vydhi) - Detoxify the whole system and clear ma with pa\u00f1cakarma - Pacify the disease and clear ma with samana - Treat the gunas by increasing sattva and reducing rajas and tamas - Rejuvenate with tonics and aphrodisiacs Traditional Ayurvedic energetics Ayurveda uses herbs, foods and minerals according to their energetic qualities. Below is a simple introduction to the theory of the pharmacology of Ayurveda. Taste: Rasa Tastes have certain functions and effects: - Temperature: Each specific taste effects the thermo-regulatory qualities within the body; hot (ushna) and cold (shita). They heat it up or cool it down. For example, Cinnamon is pungent and hot which raises temperature whilst Grapes are sweet and cooling which can help to cool a fever. - Quality: The taste also defines whether a herb is light (laghu) or heavy (guru) to digest and wet (snighda) or dry (ruksha) on the mucus membranes. An example is Black Pepper that is pungent and also hot, light and dry; it is easy to digest and dries the mucus membranes. - Tropism: The taste also implies an affinity for certain tissues and organs. A herb will influence the function of an organ, tissue or channel by tonifying or reducing, stimulating or pacifying, drying or moistening. For example hot and dry herbs clear wet mucus from the lungs, whilst cool and bitter herbs drain heat from the blood and liver. - Doshic: The taste of each medicinal also influences the quantity and quality of each dosha. For example, sweet builds kapha, reduces vata and pitta and increases all the tissues - Direction: The taste has an effect on the movement of vata dosha by influencing the direction the five vayu move in: For example, the pungent taste ascends and spreads vyana vayu outward causing sweating whilst bitter descends causing apana vayu to move downwards with a laxative effect. Virya: The thermal action of herbs and foods Hot (ushna): Heat warms, dries, invigorates and stimulates the tissues. Just as the sun on a hot day causes the blood to come to the surface of the body, so energetically hot herbs cause our metabolism to expand upwards and outwards causing the pores of the skin to open. Heat increases the metabolism, encourages circulation, causes sweating, light headedness and thirst. Hot substances are usually used to treat cold, contracted and hypo or sluggish conditions. Beneficial to kapha and vata, it dries damp, phlegm and warms cold. As 'like increases like' pungent herbs encourage agni and digestion to function at optimum level. Herbs that are heating usually contain volatile oils or mustard glycosides that stimulate gastric secretions as well as assimilation of nutrients. Ushna substances have a particular affinity for the heart, head, liver and lungs and are commonly used when they are imbalanced but may damage them if used unjudiciously. Pungent, sour and salty herbs tend to be heating. Cold (shita): Cold natured herbs cool, moisten and sedate the tissues and metabolism. Rather like the cold of a winter's day causes you to shiver energetically cold herbs contract the muscles and narrow the channels of circulation. Cold substances are usually used to treat 'hot', inflamed and hyper conditions. Cold benefits pitta whilst aggravating kapha and vata; cold natured herbs soothe painful and inflammatory heat conditions. Digestion is easily damaged by cold natured herbs and should be used cautiously when there is diarrhoea and sluggish digestion from cold. Cold herbs have an affinity for the stomach, the kidneys and the bladder and can weaken them if used excessively. Bitter, astringent and sweet herbs tend to be cooling. Vipaka: Post-digestive effect This is a unique energetic category peculiar to Ayurveda. Vipaka refers to the post-digestive effect of tastes; it is the effect a certain flavour has on the tissues having been digested or after cooking. It is the long-term effect of a food or herb. Vipaka results from the mixing of the digestive fire with the particular flavour: Sweet and salty flavours: Digest into sweet: sweet is nourishing and moistening to the tissues and also has a mildly laxative effect. The cooling and anti-inflammatory nature of sweet make it beneficial to pitta and its wet and building properties will increase kapha. Sour: Digests into sour: this will encourage digestion, benefit the liver, increase heat and moisture in the body whilst also calming the nervous system. Its long-tem effect is to aggravate pitta and calm vata. Pungent, bitter, astringent: Digest into pungent: its nature is to increase dryness, constipation and gas. This can help kapha and aggravate vata. To give an example of how the vipaka varies according to the specific energetics of each herb we will look at the Peppers. Both Black Pepper (Piper nigrum) and Long Pepper (Piper longum) are pungent and heating. Whilst Black Pepper is pungent after digestion and therefore constipating, drying and damaging to the production of reproductive fluids, Long Pepper is sweet post digestively and therefore helps elimination, is moistening and is a beneficial rejuvenative tonic to kapha and as an aphrodisiac to the reproductive system. Onions and Ginger are other examples of herbs that are hot and irritating in the raw state but become less hot and sweeter and nourishing after cooking; both also have respected anti-inflammatory effects and promote the reproductive system. Guna: The qualities of the herbs The specific 'quality' of a herb indicates its potential therapeutic activity. There are twenty qualities listed in Sushruta but these five listed below are the main ones used in Ayurvedic herbal energetics: Light (laghu) Plants, foods and minerals that are light have a quality that moves upwards, are easily digested and also remove sluggishness and kapha. Aromatic and warming herbs often have a light quality. The bitter and astringent flavoured herbs are usually light in nature. Leaves, seeds and fruits are mainly light. The aromatic Cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum) seeds are light. Heavy (guru) Substances that are heavy sink downwards, are difficult to digest, increase kapha and nourish the whole system. They benefit vata by opposing its light, dry qualities. Heavy natured herbs are often sweet, salty or sour. Roots, resins, nuts and barks are often heavy. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is heavy. Unctuous (snigdha) These medicinals are soft, demulcent and oily. They are strengthening, increase virility, fertility and kapha. They are usually sweet, heavy and contain a high content of volatile oils, mucilage or essential fatty acids. Sesame (Sesamum indicum) seeds and oil are unctuous. Dry (ruksha) Any plant with a dry quality is naturally astringent, absorbs moisture and therefore reduces kapha and increases vata. They are usually high in tannins and may also be heating as well (as heat dries fluids). Most plants have tannins in but certain barks and fruits are especially astringent. Haritaki (Terminalia chebula) is dry. Penetrating or Sharp (tikshna) Herbs with a penetrating or sharp quality are usually pungent, acrid and aromatic. They spread deeply into the tissues, open the channels and by their intense nature increase pitta and calm kapha and vata. Vacha (Acorus calamus) has penetrating properties. Prabhava: The unique action of a plant Ayurveda includes the descriptive category of prabhava or specific action. This term implies the individual action of a substance regardless of its taste, energy or post-digestive effect. It includes these concepts but is not dependent upon them. It is the specific action of a plant above and beyond its energetic classification. For example, tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) is classified as heating but it therapeutically helps to clear heat and reduce fever through diaphoresis. This means that whatever the causes of the fever, tulsi is indicated and this is its prabhava. Sesame seeds (Sesamum indica) and Madanphala (Randia dumentorium) are both sweet, astringent and bitter in flavour but Sesame is a tonic whilst Madanphala is an emetic and reduces any excess of the doshas. Whilst they have similar flavours, their actions are different. Each has their own unique and individual prabhava. Bibliography Pole, S.
