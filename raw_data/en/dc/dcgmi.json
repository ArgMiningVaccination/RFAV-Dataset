One way to consider how well a public service ag ency is managed is in terms of the five sequential functions of management. Likely to occur in predictable sequence, the functions provide continuity to the process of management: \u00be Planning \u00be Organizing \u00be Staffing \u00be Directing \u00be Controlling Picture three consultants assigned the task of designing from scratch an agency to serve a community of 50,000. Consider the major questions they would have to address: 7 Planning What resources are set as ide for this agency? How should we state the mission and goals? What programs and activities ar e needed to achieve them? What standardized procedures? What about standing decisions on im portant recurring matters (policies)? How will we develop the first budget? Organizing We need to establish an organizati onal structure, delineate positions and relationships and create job descrip tions with necessary qualifications. How do we divide up the necessary work so that personnel are assigned most effectively? Staffing What steps should we take to recruit and deve lop qualified employees? What standards established to avoid the \"rejects\" of neighboring agencies, or the people who cannot make it in the private sector? How much to budget for recruit training and continu ous upgrading of employee skills, knowledge and ability? Directing What can be done to insure that empl oyees are motivated and produce, both day- to-day and over the course of a career? How to resolve conflicts and encourage independent thought? How to stimulate innovation and creative solutions to problems? Can we set up structures to make it easier for them to keep at the cutting edge of the field? 8 Controlling How to make sure the agency achieve s its objectives according to plan? What performance standards are required? Reporting systems? How to insure that necessary corrective actions take place to stay on target? How to measure results so that it can be shown that obj ectives are being achieved? Using the Basic Resources: In addition to money and tim e managers must conserve and utilize their resources to achieve agen cy objectives: Conceptual : ideas, planning a nd managerial skills, training, technical competence, in- house information and access to outside databases and the worldwide web; Physical : vehicles and professional equi pment, consumable materials, uniforms, safety gear, fu rniture; the buildings and constructed facilities for housing employees as well as the above; Human : health, motivation to work, su pervisory leadership, intelligence, interpersonal skills, loya lty to the agen cy, commitment to the field. In utilizing these resources manager will resort to the five sequential functions as well as other management skills and functions; e.g ., analyzing problems, making decision, communicating with employees and citizens. Evaluating Agency Management : No one public service manager (or management team) can be fully capable in utilizing appropriate manageme nt skills and functions. In evaluating agency management, however, it is he lpful to consider the full range of duties, responsibilities and activities' needed for e ffective and efficient management. The following items are divided according to the five sequential functions. Many of them may be delegated to subordinates; nevert heless, the chief executive and management team must accept responsib ility for all of them. 9 Evaluation Exercise Directions : Indicate using the scale below ho w well in your judgment the chief executive & management team of your agen cy accomplish the follo wing responsibilities and activities: Planning - How well do they: 1. ______ Determine the purpose of the agency with a clear mission statement, goals and objectives. 2. ______ Develop essential policies (e.g., au thority defined, use of discretion, alternatives to arrest, use of deadly force, high speed pursuit), and then require adherence to them. 3. ______ Divide the agency's wo rk into program (e.g ., traffic, patrol, crime prevention, criminal investigation, work with youth) and annually review each program's objectives with emphasis on increased effectiveness for the next twelve months. 4. ______ Establish the priority, sequence, and timing of all the steps necessary to achieve annual program objectives (with a timetable and milestones indicated. 5. ______ Develop a budget that realistically reflects the importance of the annual objectives to be accomplished. 6. ______ Administer the budge effe ctively throughout the budget year. 7. ______Develop written directives (procedures, ru les) to cover all essential, recurring operations. 8. ______ Utilize staff who are qualified fo r specialized planning and problem-solving. 9. ______ Hold staff meetings for effective planning (and at an appropriate frequency). 10 Excellent 8 - 9 Good 6 7 Adequate 4 - 5 Barely Adequate 1 - 3 Poor10 10. ______Provide for adequate manpower resear ch, crime analysis and deployment of personnel according to work load. 11. ______ Push the planning process as far dow n into the operational level as possible; i.e., get as many peopl e involved as practical.

SWOTT Analysis is an effec tive way of identifying your Strengths and Weaknesses, an d of examining the Opportunities, Th reats, and Trends you face. How to use tool: To carry out a SWOTT Analysis write down answers to the followi ng questions. Where appropriate, use similar questions: Strengths: What advantages do you have? What do you do well? What relevant resources do you have access to? What do other people see as your strengths? Consider this from your own point of view an d from the point of vi ew of the people you deal with. Don't be modest. Be realistic. If you are having any difficulty with this, try writing down a list of your ch aracteristics. Some of thes e will hopefully be strengths! Weaknesses: What could you improve? What do you do badly? What should you avoid? Again, consider this from an internal and external basi s: Do other people seem to perceive weaknesses that you do not see? Ar e your competitors doing any better than you? It is best to be realistic now, and face any unpleasant truths as soon as possible. Opportunities: Where are the good op portunities facing you? What are the interesting trends you are aware of? Useful opportunities can co me from such things as: Changes in technology and markets on both a broad and narrow scale Changes in government policy related to your field Changes in social pattern s, population profiles, lif estyle changes, etc. Local Events 24 A useful approach to looking at opportunit ies is to look at yo ur strengths and ask yourself whether these open up any opport unities. Alternativel y, look at your weaknesses and ask yourself whether you coul d open up opportun ities by eliminating them. Threats: What obstacles do you face? What is your co mpetition doing? Are the required specifications for your job or services changing? Is changing technology threatening your position? Do you have bad debt or cash-flow problems? Could any of your weaknesse s seriously threaten your opportunity for promotion and/or success? Trends: What are the current tr ends in the industry? What do I need to do to make myse lf more competitive? Carrying out this analysis w ill often be illuminati ng - both in terms of pointing out what needs to be done, and in puttin g problems into perspective. Key points: SWOTT analysis is a framework for analyzi ng your strengths and weaknesses, and the opportunities, threats and trends you face. This will help you to focu s on your strengths, minimize weaknesses, and take the greatest po ssible advantage of opportunities available. Carrying out a personal SWOTT Analysis is an important step in finding life and career direction. 25 26 Managerial Skills (A summary of Katz's HBR article) M.J. Arul What makes a good manager? Innate traits or acquired skills? Assuming that a manager is one who directs the activities of other pers ons and undertakes the responsibility for achievement of objectives through such effo rts, successful management seems to rest on three basic developable skills: technical, hu man and conceptual. The relative importance of these three skills varies with the level of managerial responsibility. (See diagram, below.) Technical Skill The technical skill implies an understanding of and proficiency in a specific kind of activity, particularly one invo lving methods, processes, pr ocedures, or techniques; it involves specialized knowledge, analytical ability with in that specialty, and facility in the use of the tools and techniques of the spec ific discipline. Vocational and on-the-job training programs largely do a good job in developing this skill. Human Skill This refers to the ability to work with, understand and motiv ate other people; the way the individual perceives (and recognizes the pe rceptions of) his supe riors, equals, and subordinates, and the way he behaves subsequently. The pe rson with highly developed human skills is aware of his own attitude s, assumptions, and beliefs about other individuals and groups; he is able to see th e usefulness and limitations of these feelings. He is sufficiently sensitive to the needs and motivations of ot hers in his organization so that he can judge the possible reactions to, and outcomes of, the various courses of action he may undertake. Human skills could be usefully divided into (a) leadership ability within the manager's own unit and (b) skill in inte rgroup relationships. Experi ence shows that outstanding capability in one of these role s is frequently accompanied by mediocre performance in the other. Intragroup skills are essential in lower and middle management roles and intergroup skills beco me increasingly important in su ccessively higher levels of management. To acquire the Human Skill, th e executive must develop his own personal point of view toward human activity so that he will (a) recognize the f eelings and sentiments which he brings to a situation, (b) ha ve an attitude about his own e xperience which will enable him to re-evaluate and learn from them, (c) deve lop ability in understanding what others by their actions and words are trying to comm unicate to him and (d) develop ability in successfully communicating his id eas and attitudes to others. The process of acquiring this ability can be effectively aided by a skilled instructor through use of case problems coupled with impr omptu role playing. It is important that the trainee self-examines his own concepts a nd values, which may enable him to develop more useful attitudes about himself and about others. 27 Conceptual Skill This skill involves the ability to see the enterprise as a whole; it includes recognizing how the various functions of the organization de pend on one another, and how changes in any one part affect all the others; and it exte nds to visualizing th e relationship of the individual business to the in dustry, the community, and the political, social and economic forces of the nation as a whole. The conceptual skill involves thinking in te rms of the following: relative emphasis and priorities among conflicting objectives and cr iteria; relative tendencies and probabilities (rather than certainties); rough correlations and patterns among elements (rather than clear-cut cause-and-effect relationships). Training can enhance previ ously developed conceptual abilities. In developing the conceptual skill, some of the best results have been achi eved through \"coaching\" of subordinates by superiors. One way a superi or can help \"coach\" his subordinate is by assigning a particular responsibility, and th en responding with se arching questions or opinions, rather than giving answers. Another excellent way to deve lop this skill is through trad ing jobs: by m oving promising young men and women through di fferent functions of the business but at the same level of responsibility. Special assignments, pa rticularly the kind which involve inter- departmental problems, can also help develop this skill. Relative Significance of Managerial Skills Conceptual Human Technical Conceptual Human Technical Conceptual Human Technical * Supervisory level Middle mgmt level Top mgmt level * Technical skills are not so important for the chief executives in large organizations where such executives have extensive staff assistance and highly competent, experienced technical operators are available.

Five Managerial Objectives Across OutwardUpward Downward 44 Leadership versus Management by Bonnie Bucqueroux The best police departments benefit from exce llent leadership and superior management. But what we must remember are the differenc es between the two -- and the fact that the same person may not be good at both. Leadership - Leadership rests on vision - what th e late Bob Trojanowi cz characterized as the ability to paint the Big Picture. A leader is someone who can pers uade other people to envision a better future and inspire them to work enthusiastically to make that dream a reality. Some leaders can pers uade by sheer charisma, but that can result in a shaky foundation for long-term change. Others wisely rely on includi ng key stakeholders in the decision-making process, grounding major de cisions in consensus. The challenge of leadership also requires communicating, clearly and consistently, what the future should look like and what it will take to get there. Management - Management is the ability to struct ure and supervise the changes that can make that vision a reality. The manager's job is to focus on the individual brush strokes that make up the Big Picture, prodding peop le to do their best, ove rcoming obstacles and pitfalls, and documenting and assessing progress to ward ultimate goals. On rare occasion, a great leader is also a great manager and vice versa. Lincoln apparently not onl y had the ability to inspire, but al so the skills to manage the steps required to make his vision a reality. Yet it is more likely that a person is one or the other. LEADER MANAGER Vision Implementation \"Big Picture\" Detail Long Term Short Term Inspire Direct Strategic Planning Action Planning Outline Framework Assess Progress Proactive Reactive Motivate Facilitate Change Agent Steady Hand Delegate Delegate Communicate Communicate 45 President Reagan, like him or not, was clea rly an exceptional leader. His successor, President Bush, like him or not, was more the manager. The challenge for police departments is to make sure that they strive for excellence in both categories. Both are essential It is a mistake to think of leaders as to managers. If a police department is going to implement a change as profo und as implementing community policing, it will need the skills of both. It would also be a mistake to think of leader ship and management as the sole province of the chief and top command. As Drew Diamon d of the Police Execu tive Research Forum notes, all people have both po sitional and personal power. The chief clearly has the top leadership position, and that position has po wer. But in almost any police department, it wouldn't take long to come up with a list of sergeants w ith the positional and personal power to make or break any chief's best-laid plans. Or think of the officer who, by force of personality, can inspire his peers to do th eir best. The challenge is to harness the personal and positional potential at all leve ls in service of implementing community policing. Qualities of a Successful Police Manager Patience - managers must be calm and steadfast, despite opposition to their beliefs, opinions, and attitudes . Wisdom - managers must have the ability to fair ly and equitably judg e the behaviors and actions of subordinates. Virtue - managers must show moral excellen ce, not only speaking it, but also by everyday actions in dealing with depa rtmental problems and personal issues. Empathy - managers must learn to accept an d understand the feelings of their subordinates, always being prepared to see others in a positive light. Kindness - managers must try to be kind and ge ntle in all their d ealing with others. Trust - managers must develop confidence in subordinates, not just respecting their position or knowledge, but also allowing them to achieve their personal goals as well as those of the organization. Knowledge - managers must constantly attempt to upgrade their knowledge of technical matters, the management theories being developed and implemented in government and industry, and facts as they occur within their own department. Self-Control - managers must be able to restrain their emotions. 46 Police Managers Can Deve lop These Qualities by: 9 Showing a high frustration tolerance. 9 Encouraging full particip ation of subordinates 9 Emphasizing the subordinate's right to express another point of view 9 Understanding the rules and acts of ethical competitive warfare 9 Expressing hostility tactfully 9 Accepting victory with controlled emotions 9 Never permitting setbacks to defeat them 9 Knowing how to \"be their own boss\" 9 Continually seeking success 9 Being experts in their field 47 Tenets for the Modern Day Police Leader 1.

Harvard Business Review 53 54 Instructional Goal: Provide supervis ors and managers information on how to create an action plan. Performance Objectives: Discuss action plans Discuss reason to create an action plan Review steps to complete an action Review action plan template 55 WHAT IS AN ACTION PLAN? An action plan is a document that lists what st eps must be taken in order to achieve a specific goal. The purpose of an action plan is to clarify wh at resources are required to reach the goal, formulate a timeline for when specific tasks need to be completed and determine what resources are required. A ro admap on where you are going and how you will get there. In some ways, an action plan is a \"heroic\" act: it helps us turn our dreams into a reality. An action plan is a way to make sure your organization's vision is made concrete. It describes the way your group will use its strategies to meet its objectives. An action plan consists of a number of action steps or changes to be brought about. Each action step or change to be sought should include the following information: What actions or changes will occur Who will carry out these changes By when they will take place, and for how long What resources (i.e., money, staff) are needed to carry out these changes Communication (who should know what?) WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA FOR A GOOD ACTION PLAN? The action plan for your initiative should meet several criteria. Is the action plan: Complete ? Does it list all the action steps or change s to be sought in a ll relevant parts (e.g. agency, schools, bu siness, government, etc.)? Clear ? Is it apparent who will do what by when? Current ? Does the action plan reflect the cu rrent work? Does it anticipate newly emerging opportunities and barriers? WHY SHOULD YOU DEVELOP AN ACTION PLAN? There is an inspirational adage that says, \"People don't plan to fail. Instead they fail to plan.\" Because you certainly don't want to fail, it makes sense to take all of the steps necessary to ensure success, including developing an action plan. There are lots of good reasons to work out the details of your organization's work in an action plan, including: To lend credibility to your organization. An action plan show s members of the community (including grant make rs) that your organization is well ordered and dedicated to getting things done. To be sure you don't overlook any of the details To understand what is and isn't pos sible for your organization to do 56 For efficiency: to save time, energy, and resources in the long run For accountability: To increase the chances th at people will do what needs to be done WHEN SHOULD YOU CREATE AN ACTION PLAN? It is developed after you have determined the vision, mission, objectives, and strategies of your group. If you develop an actio n plan when you are ready to start getting things done, it will give you a blueprint for runni ng your organization or initiative. Remember, though, that an action plan is always a work in progress. It is not something you can write, lock in your file draw ers, and forget about. Keep it visible. Display it prominently. As your organization changes a nd grows, you will want to c ontinually (usually monthly) revise your action plan to fit the ch anging needs of your group and community. HOW TO WRITE AN ACTION PLAN Determine what people and sector s of the community should be changed and involved with finding solutions. If you have been using the VMOSA (Vision, Mi ssion, Objectives, Strategies, Action Plans) model, you might have already done this, when you were decidi ng upon your group's objectives. Again, try to be inclusive. Most issu es that community partne rships deal with are community-wide, and thus need a community -wide solution. Possible sectors include the media, the business community, religious organizations, schools, youth organizations, social service organizations, health organizations, and others. Some members of the commun ity you might consider asking to join the action planning group include: Influential people from all the parts of the community affected by your initiative (e.g., from churches and syna gogues, the school system, law enforcement, etc.) People who are directly i nvolved in the problem Members of grassroots organizations Members of the various ethnic and cultural groups in your community People you know who are interest ed in the problem or issue Newcomers or young people in the co mmunity who are not yet involved Convene a planning group in your co mmunity to design your action plan . This might be the same group of people who worked with you to decide your group's strategies and objectives. If you are organizing a new group of people, try to make your planning committee as diverse and inclusiv e as possible. Your group should look like the people most affected by the problem or issue. Once everyone is present, go over your organizations: Vision 57 Mission Objectives Strategies Targets and agents of change Proposed ch anges for each sector of the community Develop an action plan composed of action steps that address all proposed changes. The plan should be complete, clea r, and current. Additionally, the action plan should include information and ideas you have already gather ed while brainstorming about your objectives and your strategies. What are th e steps you must take to carry out your objectives while still fulfilling your vision and mission ? Now it's time for all of th e VMOSA components to come together. While the plan might address general goals you wa nt to see accomplished, the action steps will help you determine the specifi c actions you will take to help make your vision a reality. Here are some guidelines to follow to write action steps. Members of the community initia tive will want to determine: What action or change will occur Who will carry it out When it will take place, and for how long What resources (i.e., money, staff) are need ed to carry out the change Communication (who should know what) Review your completed action plan carefully to check for completeness. Make sure that each proposed change will help accomplish your group's missi on. Also, be sure that the action plan taken as a whole will help you comp lete your mission; that is, make sure you aren't leaving anything out. Follow through. One hard part (figuring out what to do) is finished. Now ta ke your plan and run with it! Remember the 80-20 rule: successful efforts are 80% follow through on planned actions and 20% planning for success. Keep everyone informed about what's going on. Communicate to everyone involved how his or her input was incorporat ed. No one likes to feel like their wit and wisdom has been ignored. Keep track of what (and how well) you've done. Always keep track of what the group has actually done. If the community change (a new program or polic y) took significant time or resources, it's also a good idea to evaluate what you have done, either fo rmally or informally. Keep several questions in mind for both yourself and others: Are we doing what we said we'd do? Are we doing it well? Is what we are doing advancing the mission? You can address these questions informally (ask yourself, chat with friends and other people), as well as formally, through surveys and other evaluation methods. 58 Celebrate a job well done! Celebrate your accomplishments; you and those you work with deserve it. Celebration helps keep everyone excited and interested in the work they are doing. A Guide for Creating Action Plans 1. Identify the issue, challenge, or problem to be addressed. The purpose of an action plan is to or ganize and develop solutions to address a specific issue, challenge, or problem. The challenge could range from lack of equipment, staff, training, etc. the best way to determine the issue, challenge, or problem would be to conduct a needs assessment. 2. Evaluate the issue. Examine the list of challenges agai n and choose one that you feel most committed and confident a bout addressing through a plan of action. Once you have done this, the next step is to evaluate the challenge more objectively and thoroughly. Evaluate the challenge in relation to five primary areas: 1) Background 2) Need 3) Constraints 4) Resources available 5) Resources needed Background refers to the history of the issue/challenge, including the cause and other individuals and programs that have tried to address it. If you are not familiar with the issue, th is may take a little research on your part. However, based upon what you und erstand now, what is the history of this issue in the given context. Need has to do more with solutions to the issue or challenge. Essentially ask yourself: \"What needs to happen to effectively address this issue?\" Constraints are those factors that are keeping you from addressing the challenge. They might include lack of time, money, education about the issue, volunteers, etc. Resources Available are those resources that are easily and readily available and accessible right now to address the issue. 59 Resources Needed are those resources that are not easily and readily available and accessible right now to address the challenge. 3. Develop a Mission Statement Now that you have developed a more thorough conceptualization of the issue/challenge, you can now work to refine the purpose of the action paln and the projects it will initiate. the Mission (or Vi sion) Statement aims to be a broad and concise description of your purpose for creating an action plan to address the problem. It does not establish spectific tasks that the organization/agency will accomplish, but rather what the problem is and generally how it will be addressed. 4. Create Goals Goals function as a kind of thesis st atement for the action plan. They explain exactly what the intended tasks will be in order to fulfill the mission. Keep in mind that effective goals are action orie nted, clear (who, what , where, by when), and are related directly to the problem. You may want to tailor your goals to mee the criteria of being SMART: S specific M measurable A achievable R realistic T timed 5. Construct Action Steps Now you have arrived to the most crucia l part of the action plan: the action steps. Essentially, the action steps are a r ealistic list of solutions and activities that will address the challenge, thus fulfilling the goals and working to achieve the mission. To develop the action steps, you must first brrainstorm a list of possible solutions using your backgroun evaluation earlier developed. Especially keep in mind your Need, Constraints, Resources Ava ilable, and Resources Needed assessment. Once you have developed this primar y action step, determine (using your evaluation) if there are any constr aints and if there are resources. Next, decide 3 more things: 60 1) Who will be responsible for c oodinating or carrying out the action? 2) A time by which that action migh occur 3) The intended outcome of the action. 6. Format your action plan Now arrange the plan into a formal document that you can easily distribute to those in your organization or anyone ju st interested in knowing your plans. Suggested action plan format: Title 1) Mission Statement 2) Goals 3) Issue and Background 4) Action Steps Action Plan Template Use this Action Plan Template to identify specific steps you need to take in order to achieve the goals and objectives outlined in your business plan. This tool can also be used to create the action plan that will accompany your marketing plan. Tip: Make each action step as simple and specific as possible, breaking down co mplex actions into single steps. Goal : Action Step What needs to be done? Responsible Person Who should take action to complete this step? Deadline When should this step be completed? Necessary Resources What do you need in order to complete this step? Potential Challenges Are there any potential challenges that may impede completion? How will you overcome them? Result Was this step successfully completed? Were any new steps identified in the process? 61 Using Action Plans Use an Action Plan whenever you need to plan a small project. To draw up an Action Plan, simply list the task s that you need to carry out to achieve your objective, in the order that you need to complete them. (This is very simple, but it is still very useful!) Use the three-step proce ss below to help you: Step 1: Identify Tasks Start by brainstorming all of the tasks that you need to complete to accomplish your objective. It's helpful to start this process at the very beginning. What's the very first action you'll need to take? Once that task is complete, what co mes next? Are there any steps that should be prioritized to meet specific dead lines, or because of limits on other people's availability? Step 2: Analyze and Delegate Tasks Now that you can see th e entire project from beginning to end, look at each task in greater detail. Are there any steps that you c ould drop, but still meet your obj ective? Which tasks could you delegate to someone else on your team, or coul d be dealt with by a freelancer? Are there any deadlines for specific steps? Do you need to arrange additional resources? Step 3: Double-Check with SCHEMES Use the SCHEMES* mnemonic to check that your plan is comprehensive. SCHEMES stands for: Space. Cash. Helpers/People. Equipment. Materials. Expertise. Systems. You may not need to think about all of these to complete your project. For instance, for a small internal project to streamline the format of your team's reports, you might only need to think about \"Helpers/People,\" \"Expertise,\" and \"Systems.\" 62 Note: Once you've completed your Action Plan, k eep it by you as you carry out the work, and update it with additional activities if required. Learning from Your Action Plan If you think you'll be trying to achieve a similar goal again, revise your Action Plan after the work is complete, by making a note of a nything that you could have done better. For instance, perhaps you could have avoided a last-minute pani c if you'd alerted a supplier in advance about the size of order you'd be placing. Or maybe you didn't allow enough time to do certain tasks. References Action Coach. 9 steps to developing a plan for action.

You are doing a fabulous job of learning from every experience, and not allowing obstacles to affect th e way you see yourse lf. But you need to nurture your self-confidence, to ensure that your life remains full of confidence-building success. 67 Building Self-Confidence Believe in Yourself, and Find Success!! From the quietly confident doct or whose advice we rely on, to the charisma tic confidence of an inspiring speaker, self-confident people have qualities that everyone admires. Self-confidence is extremely important in almo st every aspect of our lives, yet so many people struggle to find it. Sadly, this can be a vicious circle: People who lack self- confidence can find it difficult to become successful. After all, most people are reluctant to back a project that's bei ng pitched by someone who was nervous, fumbling and overly apologetic. On the other hand, you might be persuaded by someone who speaks clearly, who holds his or her head high, who answers questions assuredly, and who readily admits when he or she does not know something. Self-confident people inspire confidence in others: their audience, their peers, their bosses, their customers, and their friends. And gaining the confidence of others is one of the key ways in which a self-c onfident person finds success. The good news is that self-confidence rea lly can be learned and built on. And, whether you're working on your own self-confidence or building the confidence of people around you, it's well-worth the effort! So, how confident do you seem to others? Your level of self-confidence can show in many ways: your behavior, your body language, how you speak, what you say, and so on. Look at the following comparisons of common confident behavior with behavior a ssociated with low se lf-confidence. Which thoughts or actions do you recognize in yourself and people around you? Self-Confident Low Self-Confidence Doing what you believe to be right, even if others mock or criticize you for it. Governing your behavior based on what other people think. Being willing to take risks and go the extra mile to achieve better things. Staying in your comfort zone, fearing failure and so avoid taking risks. Admitting your mistakes, and learning from them. Working hard to cover up mistakes and hoping that you can fix the problem before anyone notices. Waiting for others to congratulate you on your accomplishments. Extolling your own virtues as often as possible to as many people as possible. Accepting compliments graciously. \"Thanks, I really worked hard on that prospectus. I'm pleased you recognize my efforts.\" Dismissing compliments offhandedly. \"Oh that prospectus was nothing real ly, anyone could have done it.\" 68 As you can see from these examples, low sel f-confidence can be self-destructive, and it often manifests itself as negativity. Self-c onfident people are generally more positive - they believe in themselves a nd their abilities, and they also believe in living life to the full. What is Self-Confidence? Two main things contribute to self-conf idence: self-efficacy and self-esteem. We gain a sense of self-efficacy when we see ourselves (and others similar to ourselves) mastering skills and achieving goals that matter in those skill areas . This is the confidence that, if we learn and work hard in a pa rticular area, we'll succeed; and it' s this type of confidence that leads people to accept difficult challenges, and persist in the face of setbacks. This overlaps with the idea of self-esteem , which is a more general sense that we can cope with what's going on in our lives, a nd that we have a right to be happy. Partly, this comes from a feeling that the people around us approve of us, which we may or may not be able to control. However, it also comes from the sense that we ar e behaving virtuously, that we're competent at what we do, and that we can compete su ccessfully when we pu t our minds to it. Some people believe that self-confidence can be built with affirmations and positive thinking. At Mind Tools, we believe that th ere's some truth in this, but that it's just as important to build self-confidence by setting and achieving goals - thereby building competence . Without this underlying competence, you don' t have self-confidence: you ha ve shallow over-confidence, with all of the issues, upset and failure that this brings. Building Self-Confidence So how do you build this sense of balanced self-conf idence, founded on a firm appreciation of reality? The bad news is that there's no quick fix, or 5-minute solution. The good news is that building self-confidence is readily achievable, just as long as you have the focus and determination to carry thi ngs through. And what's even better is that the things you'll do to build self-confidence will also build success - after all, your confidence will come from real, solid achievem ent. No-one can take this away from you! So here are our three steps to self-confid ence, for which we'll use the metaphor of a journey: preparing for your journey; se tting out; and accelerating towards success. 69 Step 1: Preparing for Your Journey The first step involves getting yourself re ady for your journey to self-confidence. You need to take stock of where you are, think about where you want to go, get yourself in the right mindset for your journey, and commit yourself to starting it and staying with it. In preparing for your journey, do these five things : 1. Look at what you've already achieved: Think about your life so far, and list the te n best things you've achieved in an \"Achievement Log.\" Perhaps you came top in an important test or exam, played a key role in an important team, produced the best sales figures in a period, did something that made a key difference in someone else's life, or delivered a project that meant a lot for your business. Put these into a smartly form atted document, which you can look at often. And then spend a few minutes each week enjoying the success you've already had! 2. Think about your strengths: Next, use a technique like SWOTT Analysis to take a look at who and where you are. Looking at your Achievement Log, and refl ecting on your recent life, think about what your friends would consider to be your strengths and weaknesses. From these, think about the opportunities, threat s and the trends that you face. Make sure that you enjoy a few mi nutes reflecting on your strengths! 3. Think about what's important to you, and where you want to go: Next, think about the things that are really important to you, and what you want to achieve with your life. Setting and achieving goals is a key part of th is, and real self-confidence comes from this. Goal setting is the process you use to set yours elf targets, and measure your successful hitting of those targets. Set goals that exploit your strengths, minimize your weaknesses, realize your opportunities, and control the threats you face. And having set the major goals in your life, identify the first step in each. A tip: Make sure it's a very small step , perhaps taking no more th an an hour to complete! 70 4. Start managing your mind: At this stage, you need to start managing yo ur mind. Learn to pick up and defeat the negative self-talk which can destroy your confidence. Further useful reading - this teaches you how to use and create strong mental images of what you'll feel and experience as you ach ieve your major goals - there's something about doing this that makes even major goals seem achievable! 5. And then commit yourself to success! The final part of preparing for the journey is to make a clear and unequivocal promise to yourself that you are absolutely committed to your journey, and that you will do all in your power to achieve it. If as you're doing it, you find doubts starting to surface, write them down and challenge them calmly and rationally. If they dissolve unde r scrutiny, that's great. However, if they are based on genuine risks, make sure you set additio nal goals to manage these appropriately. Either way, make that promise ! Tip: Balanced Self-Confidence Self-confidence is about balance. At one extreme, we have people with low self- confidence. At the other end, we ha ve people who may be over-confident. If you are under-confident, you'll avoid taking risks and stretching yourself; and you might not try at all. And if you're over-confident, y ou may take on too much risk, stretch yourself beyond your capabilities, and cras h badly. You may also find that you're so optimistic that you don't try hard en ough to truly succeed. Getting this right is a matter of having the ri ght amount of confiden ce, founded in reality and on your true ability. With the right amount of self-confid ence, you will take informed risks, stretch yourself (but not beyond your abilities) and try hard. 71 Step 2: Setting Out This is where you start, ever so slowly, moving towards your goal. By doing the right things, and starting with small, easy wins, you'll put yourself on the path to success - and start building the self-confiden ce that comes with this. Build the knowledge yo u need to succeed: Looking at your goals, identify the skills you'll need to achieve them. And then look at how you can acquire these skills confidently and well. Don't ju st accept a sketchy, just- good-enough solution - look for a solution, a prog ram or a course that fully equips you to achieve what you want to achieve and, ideally, gives you a certificate or qualification you can be proud of. Focus on the basics: When you're starting, don't try to do anything clever or elaborate. And don't reach for perfection - just enjoy doing simple things successfully and well. Set small goals, and achieve them: Starting with the very small goals you identified in step 1, ge t in the habit of setting them, achieving them, and celebrating that achi evement. Don't make goals particularly challenging at this stage, just get into the habit of achiev ing them and celebrating them. And, little by little, start piling up the successes! Keep managing your mind: Stay on top of that positive th inking, keep celebr ating and enjoying success, and keep those mental images strong. Y ou can also use a technique like Treasure Mapping to make your visualizations even stronger! And on the other side, learn to handle failu re. Accept that mistak es happen when you're trying something new. In fact, if you get into the habit of treating mistakes as learning experiences, you can (almost) start to see them in a positive light. After all, there's a lot to be said for the saying \"if it doesn 't kill you, it makes you stronger!\" 72 Step 3: Accelerating Towards Success By this stage, you'll feel your self-confiden ce building. You'll have completed some of the courses you started in step 2, and y ou'll have plenty of success to celebrate! This is the time to start stretching yourse lf. Make the goals a bit bigger, and the challenges a bit tougher. Increase the size of your commitment. And extend the skills you've proven into new, but closely related arenas. Tip 1: Keep yourself grounded - this is where peop le tend to get over-confident and over-stretch themselves. And make sure you don't st art enjoying cleverness for its own sake... As long as you keep on stretching yourse lf enough, but not too much, you'll find your self-confidence building apace. What's more, yo u'll have earned your self-confidence - because you'll have put in the hard graft necessary to be successful! 73 Leadership Caffeine: 9 Ideas for Strengthening Your Self-Esteem January 31, 2011 by Art Petty One definition of self-esteem reflects, \"confidence in one's own worth or abilities.\" Another source, psychologist a nd author, Dr. Nathaniel Brande n, offers: \"Self-esteem is the experience of being competent to cope with the basic challenges of life and being worthy of happiness.\" While typically not a topic discussed over co ffee, many leaders struggle with issues of low self-esteem. They question their abilities to cope with the problems at hand, they often doubt they are worthy of the position of leadership they oc cupy, and they most definitely agonize quietly over much of their professional existence. Others manifest their low self-esteem with over-the-top aggre ssiveness and strong co ntrolling behaviors. Regardless of how the self-esteem issue is expressed, the sufferers struggle with a debilitating level of self-doubt. Unfounded criticism and minor setbacks easily derail the positive thought train. Instead of pursuing success, the leader with low self-esteem settles for a kind of tortured survival. Nine Ideas to Help Strengthen Your Leadership Self-Esteem 1. Recognize that you're not alone. The greatest historical figures and leaders throughout history struggled w ith self-doubt, and many of the most outwardly confident leaders battle this same issue in private. You are most definitely not alone. 2. Cultivate \"bigger purpose\" thinking about your job . The focus on a large and compelling mission promotes acti on and helps set priorities. It also sets the stage for self- esteem reinforcing beha viors and achievements. I crafted my Leader's Charter to remind me of my true role as a leader and serve as my \"bigger purpose.\" A few moments reviewing and reflecting upon The Charter every morning, does wonders for your attitude a nd for providing a stro ng reason for being. The Leader's Charter: Your primary role as a leader is to: -Create an environment that facilitates high individu al and team performance, -Support innovation in process, programs and approaches, -Encourage collabora tion where necessary, and -Promote the development of your associates in roles that leverage their talents and that challenge them to pursu e new and greater accomplishments. 74 With all of that \"purpose\" to focus on , it's hard to spend time wondering whether you are up to the job. Your actions and approaches towards others are inherent in The Charter. And as you live your day(s) according to the concepts, you cannot help but produce small victorie s. These small victories are rocket-fuel for self-esteem. 3. Small victories count! Keep tabs on yours . Keep a list of the small victories to reinforce your growing self-esteem and good a ttitude. And remember to share the wealth by celebrating or praising the positive accomplis hments of others. Your positive praise helps others build their own self-esteem. 4. Read something inspirational . My own doses of self -esteem fuel come from biographies of historical figures who battled overwhelming odds, only to succeed. It's amazing what looking at a truly bad situatio n faced by someone else will do to put your own situation in perspective. 5. Trust feedback from trusted sources . Not all feedback and not all feedback providers are created equal. The comment fro m an audience member recently regarding a concept that I \"failed to develop\" on one of my slides was in teresting but frankly irrelevant. The talk had been a success howeve r, it clearly bugged this guy that I had not expanded upon the issue he felt so passionately about. I suggested he make it a self-study topic. 6. Pull out of a stall. Take action. Actions...and movement are important steps in building self-esteem. An internal preoccupa tion on your supposed ne gatives coupled with no action is truly self-reinforcing. 75 7. Focus your actions on your strengths . Just for a few moment s, forget about the weaknesses that you believe are holding y ou back. Preoccupying on your weaknesses reinforces low self-esteem thinking. 8. Don't overlook your physical appearance. Focus on getting in shape, losing weight, getting a better haircut and/or improving your style of dress. Much of our self-esteem flows from how we feel about our looks and physical presence. 9. Selectively take action to strengthen weaknesses. As the small victories pile up, and as you build upon your stre ngths and refocus your efforts around your priorities (The Charter ), selectively identify weaknesses to strengt hen and take action. Buy and read and apply the lessons in a self-help book, take a c ourse or seek a mentor to guide your efforts and offer reinforcement. 76 Build Self Confidence Self confidence is the difference between fee ling unstoppable and feeling scared out of your wits. Your perception of yourself has an enormous impact on how others perceive you. Perception is reality \u2014 the more self confidence you have, the more likely it is you'll succeed. Although many of the factors affecting self conf idence are beyond your control, there are a number of things you can co nsciously do to build self c onfidence. By using these 10 strategies you can get the mental edge you need to reac h your potential. 1. Dress Sharp Although clothes don't make the man, they certainly affect the way he feels about himself. No one is more conscious of your physical appearance than you are. When you don't look good, it changes the way you carry yourself and interact with other people. Use this to your advantage by taking care of your personal appearance. In most cases, significant improvements can be made by bath ing and shaving frequently, wearing clean clothes, and being cognizant of the latest styles. This doesn't mean you need to spend a lot on clothes. One great rule to follow is \"spend twice as much, buy half as mu ch\". Rather than buying a bunc h of cheap clothes, buy half as many select, high quality items . In long run this decrease s spending because expensive clothes wear out less easily and stay in styl e longer than cheap clothes. Buying less also helps reduce the clutter in your closet. 2. Walk Faster One of the easiest ways to tell how a person f eels about herself is to examine her walk. Is it slow? Tired? Painful? Or is it energetic and purposeful? People with confidence walk quickly. They have places to go, people to se e, and important work to do. Even if you aren't in a hurry, you can increase your self confidence by putting some pep in your step. Walking 25% faster will make to yo u look and feel more important. 3. Good Posture Similarly, the way a person carries herself te lls a story. People with slumped shoulders and lethargic movements display a lack of self confidence. They aren't enthusiastic about what they're doing and they don't consider themselves im portant. By practicing good posture, you'll automatically feel more confid ent. Stand up straight, keep your head up, and make eye contact. You'll make a positive impression on others and instantly feel more alert and empowered. 77 4. Personal Commercial One of the best ways to bu ild confidence is listeni ng to a motivational speech. Unfortunately, opportunities to listen to a great speaker are few and far between. You can fill this need by creating a personal co mmercial. Write a 30-60 second speech that highlights your strengths and goa ls. Then recite it in front of the mirror aloud (or inside your head if you prefer) whenever you need a confidence boost. 5. Gratitude When you focus too much on what you want , the mind creates reasons why you can't have it. This leads you to dwell on your we aknesses. The best way to avoid this is consciously focusing on gratitude. Set aside ti me each day to mentally list everything you have to be grateful for. Recall your past su ccesses, unique skills, loving relationships, and positive momentum. You'll be amazed how much you have going for you and motivated to take that next step towards success. 6. Compliment other people When we think negatively about ourselves, we of ten project that feeli ng on to others in the form of insults and gossip. To break this cycle of ne gativity, get in the habit of praising other people. Refuse to engage in backstabbing gossip and make an effort to compliment those around you. In the proc ess, you'll become well liked and build self confidence . By looking for the best in others, you in directly bring out the best in yourself. 7. Sit in the front row In schools, offices, and public assemblies around the world, people constantly strive to sit at the back of the room. Most people prefer the back because they're afraid of being noticed. This reflects a lack of self confiden ce. By deciding to sit in the front row, you can get over this irrational fear and build your self confidence. You'll also be more visible to the important people talking from the front of the room. 8. Speak up During group discussions many people never speak up because they're afraid that people will judge them for saying someth ing stupid. This fear isn't really justified. Generally, people are much more accepting than we imagine. In fact most people are dealing with the exact same fears. By ma king an effort to speak up at least once in every group discussion, you'll become a better public spea ker, more confident in your own thoughts, and recognized as a leader by your peers. 78 9. Work out Along the same lines as personal appearance, physical fitness has a huge effect on self confidence. If you're out of shape, you'll feel insecure, unattractive, and less energetic. By working out, you improve your physical appearance, energize yourself, and accomplish something positive. Ha ving the discipline to work out not only makes you feel better, it creates positive momentum that you can build on the rest of the day. 10. Focus on contribution Too often we get caught up in our own desires. We focus too much on ourselves and not enough on the needs of other people. If you st op thinking about yourself and concentrate on the contribution you're making to the rest of the world, you won't worry as much about you own flaws. This will increase self confidence and allow you to contribute with maximum efficiency. The more you contribute to the world the more you'll be rewarded with personal success and recognition. 79 How To Build Self-Confidence Whether you think you can or think you can't - you are right.\" Henry Ford When I was in my late teen s a friend of mine, an elite athlete, gave me the most profound, yet simple advice that changed th e way I would view myself forever. He told me: \"If you don't think very highly of yourself, you can't expect an yone else think it of you.\" Translation - It means that we alone are responsible for building self-confidence. We cannot depend upon, or wait for anyone else's approval. We mu st see ourselves as worthy and capable of achieving anything we choose to achieve. Ultimately, how we see ourselves is more important than how anyone else sees us. If we don't work at loving and accepting ourselves, nothi ng anyone else thinks matters. Tips For Building Self-Confidence Acknowledge Your Uniqueness. Believe in yourself and know that you are one of a kind. In the words of Walt Whitman know: \"That you are here--that life exists, and identity; That the powerful play goes on, a nd you will contribute a verse.\" There is no one else like you on this pl anet. No one looks like you, has the same talents, experiences, or perspective as you do. You are unique a nd are therefore here to make your unique contribution. If we each focus on what we br ing into the world to share, there can be no comparisons, envy or regret. We are here to \"contribute a verse\". Give it Your Best. When you do the best you can, with the best of what you've got, you can't help but feel good about yourself and that confidence comes through in ev erything that you do. Giving it your best makes you unafraid to take risk s or step out of your comfort zone - both great confidence-builders. Persevere. Everybody has setbacks and obstacles to c ontend with. Don't let them undermine your confidence. Treat them as opportunities to strengthen your resolve and then persevere. Overcome adversity. Overcoming adversity builds and strengthens self-c onfidence. The greatest songs, works of art and literary pieces have been writte n by those who have experienced the depths of despair, loss and emptiness a nd overcame them. Experiencing sadness and loss, and then rising above them, gives ri se to hope and triumph. It makes you stretch and become more than you were. 80 Accomplish something. Set goals for yourself and then push yourself to reach them. Self-confidence soars when you know you can do what you put your mind to. It makes you feel unstoppable. Likewise, achieve mastery. Mastery experi ences are those in which you know you have worked hard and put in gr eat effort to achieve success. Separate Yourself From the Event. You are not what happens to you, nor how you believe othe rs see you. In other words, you are not defined by what happens to you, nor are you defined by how others see you. You are who you choose to be - a person of character , dignity and self- confidence. Confront your fears. There's nothing that destroys self-confiden ce more than succumbing to fear. Everyone feels fear a t various times; we're human, howe ver facing circumstances with courage and poise strengthens character and builds se lf-confidence. Put yourself out there! If you're afraid to meet new people, attend soci al events, etc. - don't stay home and fret. Doing builds confidence. Of course, you'll feel , and probably be awkward the first few times in new situ ations, however, the more you do it, the better you'll get, and therefore the better you'll f eel about yourself. Good looks do not equal self-confidence. Some of the most attractive people in the wo rld are insecure and lack self-confidence. Marilyn Monroe was considered to be one of the sexiest, most beautiful people in the world, yet she lacked a positive self-image. She misguidedly allowed external factors, such as the approval of others, to determ ine her self-worth. Good looks may help you feel good about yourself temporarily , but are by no means enough. Take good care of yourself . When you are in fit, in good health, and make a point of looking your best, you can't help but feel confident. This is different , of course, from comparing your looks to others. It's about being comfortable with you. Everyone looks good when they're in good shape, well groomed, and healthy. Yo u can't help but have a glow about you when you take good care of yourself. Learn how to give yo urself a pep talk. We all have our down moments, moments of doubt, confusion and uncertainty. When that happens, we must learn how to restor e self-confidence. One way is to understand that everyone goes through such moments. Another is to remember past successes, visualize the desired outcome, and keep at it! Practice makes perfect. Self-confidence is absolutely essential to achieving success in any endeavor. You acquire it by doing, learning , accomplishing, and persisting. 81 How to Build Self Confidence: 6 Essential and Timeless Tips by Henrik Edberg \"Never bend your head. Always hold it high. Look the world straight in the face.\" Helen Keller \"Whatever we expect with confidence b ecomes our own self-fulfilling prophecy.\" Brian Tracy \"Confidence is courage at ease.\" Daniel Maher I believe that one of the most common wishes is simply to feel more confident in various situations in life. But how? Confident friends may say:\"Well, just be c onfident, man!\" However, to a person that doesn't feel that confident this piece of advice may not be very helpful at all. Here are however some time-tested and timele ss advice. I hope you w ill find is useful to improve and maintain your own levels of confidence. 1. Take action. Get it done. \"Having once decided to achieve a certain task, achieve it at all costs of tedium and distaste. The gain in self-confidence of having accomplished a tiresome labor is immense.\" Thomas A. Bennett \"Nothing builds self-esteem and self- confidence like accomplishment.\" Thomas Carlyle \"Inaction breeds doubt and fear . Action breeds confidence an d courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.\" Dale Carnegie The most important step in build ing self confidence is simply to take action. Working on something and getting it done. Sitting at home and thinking about it will just make you feel worse. Simple. But not always easy to do . To make it a bit easier, here are a three of my favourite ways to make it easier to take action: Be present. This will help you snap out of ov er thinking and just go and do whatever you want to get done . This is probably the best tip I have found so far for taking more action since it puts you in a state where you fe el little emotional resistance to the work you' ll do. And it puts you in st ate where the right actions often just seem to flow out of you in a focused but relaxed way and without much effort. One of the simplest wa ys to connect with the presen t moment is just to keep your focus on your breathi ng for a minute or two. 82 Lighten up. One way to dissuade yourself from taking action is to take whatever you are about to do too seriously. That ma kes it feel too big, too difficult and too scary. If you on the other hand relax a b it and lighten up you often realize that those problems and negative feelings are ju st something you ar e creating in your own mind. With a lighter state of mind your tasks seems lighter and become easier to get started with. Really, really want it. Then taking action isn't so mething you have to force. Taking action becomes a very natural thing. It's something you can't wait to do. 2. Face your fear. \"The way to develop se lf-confidence is to do the thing you fear.\" William Jennings Bryan \"You gain strength, courage a nd confidence by every experien ce in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, 'I have lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.' You must do the thin g you think you cannot do.\" Eleanor Roosevelt Look, I could tell you to do affirmations or ot her exercises for months in front of your mirror. It may have a positive e ffect. Just like preparing yourse lf it may help you to take action with more confidence. But to be frank, if you don' t listen to the quotes above and face your fears you won't experience any better self confidence on a deeper and more fundamental level. Having experiences where you face your fear is what really builds self confidence. There is no way around it. However, there are ways to face your fears that do not include that much shaking of the knees. There are ways to make it easier for yourself. Be curious. When you are stuck in fear you ar e closed up. You tend to create division in your world and mind. You create barriers between you and other things/people. When you shift to bein g curious your perceptions go SWOOSH! and the world just opens up. Curiosity is fi lled with anticipati on and enthusiasm. It opens you up. And wh en you are open and enthusias tic then you have more fun things to think about than focusing on your fear. How do you become more curious? One way is to remember how life has become more fun in the past thanks to your curiosity and to remember all the cool things it helped you to discover and experience. 83 Realize that fear is often base d on unhelpful interpretation. As humans we like to look for patterns. The problem is just that we often find negative and not so helpful patterns in our lives based on just one or tw o experiences. Or by mi sjudging situations. Or through some silly miscommunication. When you get too id entified with your thoughts you'll believe anything they tell you. A more helpfu l practise may be to not take your thoughts too seriously. A lot of th e time they and your memory are pretty inaccurate. 3. Understand in what order things happen. One of my favourite snippets of movie-dial ogue is this one from the 1999 film \"Three Kings\". In this scene Major Archie Ga tes (George Clooney) wants the small team to save a fellow soldier and steal Saddam's gold just after the first Gulf War has ended. The young soldier Conrad Vig (Spike J onze) has his doubts about the plan: Archie Gates: You're scared, right? Conrad Vig: Maybe. Archie Gates: The way it works is, you do the thing you're scared shitless of, and you get the courage AFTER you do it, not before you do it. Conrad Vig: That's a dumbass way to work. It should be the other way around. Archie Gates: I know. That's the way it works. Great movie. Great little piece of dialogue. Even though it may not be what people want to hear. The thing is, when you do things you don't just build confiden ce in your ability to handle different situations. You also experience progr essive desensitization. What that means is that situations - like for example public spea king or maybe just showing your latest blog post to an audience out there - that made you feel all shaky become more and more normal in your life. It is not longer someth ing you psyche yourself up to do. It just becomes normal. Like tying your shoes, hanging out with your friends or taking a shower. It may seem scary now. But after having done whatever you fear a few to a dozen times or so you may think: \"Is that it?\". You almo st feel disappointed of how anticlimactic it has become. You may even get a bit angry with yourself and wo nder why you avoided doing it for so long. 4. Prepare. \"One important key to success is self-confiden ce. An important key to self- confidence is preparation.\" Arthur Ashe 84 When you know nothing of what you are about to do it's ve ry easy to get lost in vague, foggy fear and start building big horror scen arios in your mind of what may happen if you give it a try. Preparing yourself and educa ting yourself can be a big help here. By for example rehearsing and rewriting your spe ech over and over you can pr etty much learn it by heart. By doing research you can fi nd breathing techniques that can quickly make you calmer and present. Or simple visua lization techniques that make you feel more confident and positive as you step out on the stage. This is obviously more work than not doing a nything about the speech at all before you start giving it. But it can make a huge differe nce in your confidence levels if you take the time to prepare yourself. And of course, the speech and the delivery of it will most likely be a lot better too. So prepare and you will feel more comfortable and confid ent. Just don't make the mistake of getting stuck in the preparation phase and using it as a way to avoid taking action and the possible pain that it may result in. 5. Realize that failure or being wrong will not kill you. \"Confidence comes not from always being ri ght but from not fear ing to be wrong.\" Peter T. Mcintyre \"I quit being afraid when my first ve nture failed and the sky didn't fall down.\" Allen H. Neuharth Again, you have to face your fear. Because it is only then that you discover the thing that billions of people throughout history have discovered before you. Failure won't kill you. Nor will being wrong. The sky will not fall down. That's just what people that haven't faced their fear yet think. The thing is to reframe failure from being something that makes your legs shake to something useful and important for the growth of your self confidence and your overall growth as a human being. Here are four ways that failure can help you out: You learn. Instead of seeing failure as someth ing horrible you can start to view it more as a learning experience. When stan ding in the middle of a failure, you can ask yourself questions like: What's awesom e about this situation? What can I learn from this situation? You gain experiences you coul d not get any other way. Ideally, you probably want to learn from other people's mistakes and failures. That's not always easy to do though. Sometimes you just have to fail on your own to learn a lesson and to gain an experience no one can rela te to you in mere words. You become stronger. Every time you fail you become more accustomed to it. You realize more and more that it's not th e end of the world. And, again, you get desensitized. You can handle things that w ould have been very hard to handle a 85 few years back. Failing can also a have an exhilarating comp onent because even though you failed you at leas t took a chance. You didn't just sit on your hands doing nothing. And that took quite a b it of courage and determination. Your chances of succeeding increases. Every time you fail you can learn and increase your inner strength. So every fa ilure can make you more and more likely to succeed. And remember, the world doesn't revolve ar ound you. You may like to think so. But it doesn't. People really don't care that much ab out what you do. They have their own life, problems and worries that the world revolves around them to focus on. They don't think that much about you or are c onstantly monitoring what you do wrong or when you fail. Maybe a disappointing thought. But a liberating and relievi ng one too because now you can let go of that worry that everyone is watching you. 6. Get to know who you are a nd what you want out of life. \"The world has the habit of making room for the man whose words a nd actions show that he knows where he is going.\" Napoleon Hill \"Don't listen to anyone who tells you that you can't do this or that. That's nonsense. Make up your mind, you'll never use crutches or a stick, then have a go at everything. Go to school, join in all the games you can. Go anywhere you want to. But never, never let them persuade you that things are too difficult or impossible.\" Douglas Bader To build and find more confidence in yourself you have to get to know yourself better. Go exploring. Face some of your fears. Fail over and over and understand that it isn't really that big of a deal. Grow stronger th rough such experiences and also become more internally relaxed. Figure out what really excites you by simply tr ying a whole bunch of stuff out. When you know more about who you are and what you want out of life - not other people say you want - you will have more confidence in yourself and what you can do. What other people say or think will have le ss of an impact than it used to because you know who you are better than they do. And since you have had all these experiences, since you have taken time to really get to know yourself and st retch yourself you will trust your own opinion and ability more than a nything outside of you. You become stable and centred in yourself. This will of course take time. It may be something that never really ends. So you might as well get started now. 86 62 Ways to Build Self Confidence Confidence is a tool you can use in your ever yday life to do all kinds of cool stuff, not least to stop second-guessing yo urself, manage your fears and become able to do more of the things that really matter to you. But not many people realize that thei r self-confidence works just like a muscle - it grows in response to the level of performance require d of it. Either you use it or you lose it. That's why I've given you 62 ways to grow y our confidence so that you can become a giant. 1. Learning is a Good Thing, so sign up for that evening class and enjoy it. 2. Get out of your own head by asking your partner or best friend what you can do for them today. 3. Hit the gym. The physiological effe cts will leave you feeling great. 4. Go to a networking event and focus on how you can be helpful to other people rather than being nervous about your own stuff. 5. Get crystal clear on the things that truly matte r to you. If they're not in your life, you need to bring them in. 6. Write a list of the things you're tolerating and putting up with in y our life, then write down how you can remove, minimize or diminish each one. 7. Look at a great win or success you've expe rienced and give yourself credit for your part in it. Recognizing your ac hievements is not egotistical, it's healthy. 8. Next time you're at a social event, don't ju st stick with the people you know - go and have a conversation with someone you don 't know and you never know what - or who - you'll discover. 9. Next time you talk yourself out of doing so mething (a party invite, a challenging project or whatever else), say ' What the Heck' and go do it anyway. 10. Do one thing each day that makes you smile (on the inside or on the outside). 11. Look for the patterns of th ought that take you to a pl ace where you start second- guessing or over-thinking. Now imagine that your best friend went through exactly the same thought process and e nded up holding themselves back - what would you want to say to them? 12. Ask out that girl or guy you fancy the pants off (only if you're single, don't want to get you into trouble). 13. You have to keep your mind well fed, so wr ite a list of 20 things that keeps your mind feeling nourished and make sure you 're giving them room in your life. 14. Stop playing different roles and squeezing yourself into boxes based on what you think people expect you to act like. 15. Learn to catch yourself every single time you tell yourself that you can't have, won't get or aren't good enou gh to get what you want. 16. Take yourself off auto-pilot - make deliberate decisions on what really matters to you. 87 17. Next time you come up against a risk or a challenge, listen to what you tell yourself and look for a way that that inner di alog can be improved. Ask yourself, \" What would make this easier ?\" 18. Scared of looking silly? You and everyone else. It's no biggie so don't let it stop you. Say it with me - \" It just doesn't matter. \" 19. Don't think for a second that you can't be confident. There are already loads of things you do with natura l self-confidence, you just have to notice them and get familiar with how it feels. Look for the things you do where the question of whether you're confident enough never arises. 20. Listen to your doubts but be ready to make deliberate decisi ons once you've heard them. Sometimes your doubts are ther e to let you know what you need to prepare for, so you can use them to your benefit as you move forwards. 21. Think of a time when it felt lik e a whole bank of switches in your head flicked to the on position and you were firi ng on all cylinders. What were you doing and what's the reason it felt so great? 22. You've got a whole bunch of out-dated rules that determ ine what you do, don't do, should do and shouldn't do. These rules limit your thinking and limit your behavior. Tear up your ru le book and notice how free you are to make great decisions. 23. Do you get annoyed with your self because you didn't make the most of something or stepped back form an oppo rtunity? Don't beat yourself up because that's just going to make you feel worse. Instead, be brutally honest and ask yourself what you gained from the situation and what you lost out on. Based on this win/lose balance, what's a differe nt choice you can make next time? 24. If you'd already done ev erything in life you'd have no need to be scared. Don't ever think that being scared means you're not confident, it simply means you're going somewhere new. 25. If there's someone in your life who puts you down or makes you feel small, you owe it to yourself to let them know that yo u expect something different from now on. You deserve better. 26. Reveal a little bit of the real you in a relationship that might feel like it's in a rut. 27. Acknowledge and welcome all of your experi ences - the good stu ff as well as the bad stuff. It's all equally valid and hiding things away because you don't like them is just creating conflict. 28. Always recognize that you're more than a match for any situation you might find yourself in, no matter ho w tough the going gets. 29. Don't get swept up in the drama of what's happening right now, look for more useful ways of engaging with wh at happens in your life. 30. Don't automatically give in to the inst ant pay-off - it often means you're selling yourself short. 31. When you feel like stampi ng your foot and yelling \" I deserve better than this! \", take a step back and say \" I can BE better than this. \" 32. Confidence sometimes means ad mitting you're wrong - always be ready to hold your hands up and change your mind. 33. Trust your instincts. They k now what they're talking about. 88 34. Fear is a way of letting you know that you're about to stretch yourself and grow your confidence. That's a good thing, so use it to take yourself forwards rather than run away. 35. Imagine you're visited by a successful, confid ent, attractive and vibrant version of you from the future, a version of you wh o's everything you hope to be. What do they want to tell you? 36. Don't feel like you have to do everything yourself - sometimes the most confident thing to do is ask for help. 37. Take a chance on something tomorrow. Anyt hing, big or small, just take a chance. 38. You need to be around people who make yo u feel like YOU, so spend more time with the people who support and encourage you and less with those who undermine you. 39. Stop struggling against the things you do n't like in your life - create a congruent environment around you that fl ows and allows you to be you. 40. No man's an island, and you need to be a part of the world you around to feel confident. What can you partic ipate in that's important to you? 41. Forget the pros and cons - do somethi ng bold in the face of your challenges and fears. 42. Work on developing the skills you need to wi n at the things that matter to you. What can you practice that would radically improve your chances of winning? 43. The body is a mirror for th e mind, so shifting your body into a confident state can have surprising results. 44. Don't get disheartened or demotivated when you get to 90% with something you're working on - push through and you'll see that the last 10% is where the magic happens. 45. Keep comparing yourself to others? Stop it, don't try to validate yourself through comparison - you're just peachy as you are. 46. Put your head above the parapet at work an d speak up if there's something you think could be improved or if you have an idea you think has legs. 47. If there's something you've been struggli ng to understand for a while, stop trying to understand it. Accept it just as it is, fully and wholly. 48. Shy with new people? Not a problem, th ere's nothing wrong w ith being shy and it doesn't mean you're not confident. Just don't over think it, start beating yourself up or thinking you're less than because you're shy - the more you think like that the worse it gets. 49. Your environment directly impacts your se lf-perception, so if you're surrounded by clutter, paperwork and rubbish put a mornin g aside to clean up your stuff and get organized. 50. Write yourself a list of the amazing things you'd love to do in your life, and make a start by simply looking into the first one or two things that leap out at you. 51. Don't make your happiness or sel f-worth dependent on being in a relationship or being validated by someone else. Find your inherent value first, and your relationships and confidence will be immeasurably better. 52. Your strengths can be used to overcome any of your weaknesses. We all have weaknesses but they only undermine your confidence if you let them. 89 53. The longer you leave that big thing on your to-do list the more it'll drain you and the bigger it'll seem - get it done and free yourself up. 54. What golden threads, themes, patterns and passions have always been in your life? If those things aren't present in your life right now, you need to shift your priorities. 55. Your body image does matter, because if you have a bad relationship with your body you won't be feeling confident in yourself. Get trim if you need to, just make sure you get along with your body. 56. Being confident is an ongoing process. It isn't a goal or an end-point that you reach and then stop. Keep playing to the be st of your ability and your confidence will always be there to support you. 57. Try a new path. The well-trod den paths of your life can eas ily turn from fa miliarity to apathy and disconnection. A new path wakes you up. 58. Don't say \"Yes\" to taking on a task simply because you don't want to rock the boat - you can politely decline requests you can' t meet and don't need to create an excuse for it. 59. Look at the people you respect who seem confident - don't copy them, but identify what it is they do differently that conveys confidence and what you can learn from it. 60. Make a plan to do something, then make deliberate choices to follow through. Seeing progress gives you important self-reinforcement. 61. When you feel yourself focusing inwards an d becoming paralyzed with doubt or fear, switch to focusing outwards at what you can engage and interact with. 62. Still beating yourself up for failing or screwi ng up? It might not be a barrel of laughs but it's not going to help you get throu gh it. Much better to recognize that everything, whether it turns out or not, is how you practice living a rich life. The Bottom-Line for Now: Your self-esteem is an intensely personal issue that impacts others and affects your ability to succeed. A strong sens e of your own self-worth is important for building self- confidence, and self-confidence is an important ingredient for success as a leader. If you're struggling with a sense of low-self es teem, it's important to do something. Try the items on the list, add in others, and if you 're still struggling seek help. You deserve a strong self-esteem, and your colleagues deserv e a leader with enou gh self-confidence to help them strive and succeed. 2011 at: www.artpetty.com/2011/01/31/lead ership-caffein e-9-ideas-for... 91 92 Instructional Goal: To discuss critical incident protocol and the importance of managing critical stress reaction symp toms in self and their staff.

Initial reports indicate that a gunman entered the plant and shot a receptionist. Employees and visitors are running from the plant in panic and the gunman is still inside. The following co nditions exist: \u00be It is 2:15 PM, on a Thursday afternoon. The weather is a typical mild spring day with no wind. \u00be Novelty Manufacturing is located next to a medium size strip mall. The company employs 125 workers. \u00be There is a school located immediately behi nd the Mall and school gets out at 3:00 PM. Many student s cut through the back lo t of the plant to meet their friends at the shopping center after school. Two unarmed plant security officers are outsi de the plant. Witnesses running from the plant have informed security that the gunman is also hol ding several containers of a liquid-like substance. One fleeing employee also inform ed security that she knows th e receptionist who is shot. She believes the husband is the shooter. The employee also indicated that the receptionist just filed a restra ining order against her husband. Police, fire, and emergency serv ices are on the scene. The plant's manager is in the front parking lot. The police are requesting information on the victim, floor plans, and if all employees are out of the plant. It is not known what visi tors are still in the plant. The fire department wants to know where flammable materials or items are located in the plant. The press is on the scene and interviewing wi tnesses. They want a spokesperson from the responders to meet them and appear on camera. They want to know if there is a danger to the school and also other stores in the mall. Persons are calling Mall security wanting to know if any of their friends or relatives are hurt. Mall security wants a representative of th e plant to handle the calls or come to their officer. Mall security has in formed the plant manager that his home office wants him to call. Hysterical parents are calling the school and th e police saying that th ey heard that there had been a shooting at the school. 97 Step 1 - Individual Analysis (20 Minutes) Members of the emergency management te am (public and private sector) should list their response actions based on the above information. Any resources needed and contemplated actions should be not ed. Any emergency planning documents should be referred to. ________________________ ______________________ ____________________ ______________________ ____________________ 98 Step 2 - Group Analysis (30 Minutes) Members should present their recommended actions to the emergency management team. Team discussion should occur and any action(s) should be listed.

The process may be long or sh ort; however, planning for the recovery phase will decrease recovery time Recovery should not conflic t with the \"crime scene\" pr eservation and examination 100 Operational Leadership The most essential element of successful management of a critical incident is competent and confident leadership. Leadership means providing purpose, direc tion, and motivation for personnel working to accomplish difficult tasks under dange rous, stressful circumstances. In confusing and uncertain situati ons, a good operational leader will: TAKE CHARGE of assigned resources MOTIVATE personnel with a \"can do safely\" attitude. DEMONSTRATE INITIA TIVE by taking action in the absence of orders. COMMUNICATE by giving specific in structions and asking for feedback. SUPERVISE at the scene of action. Be proficient in your job, bo th technically and as a leader Take charge when in charge. Adhere to professional st andard operating procedures. Develop a plan to ac complish given objectives. Make sound and timely decisions Maintain situation awareness in order to anticipate needed actions. Develop contingencies a nd consider consequences. Improvise within the leader's intent to handle a rapidly changing environment. Ensure tasks are understood, su pervised, and accomplished Issue clear instructions. Observe and assess actions in progress without micro-managing. Use positive feedback to modify du ties, tasks, and assignments when appropriate. Develop your subordin ates for the future Clearly state expectations. Delegate tasks that you are not required to do personally. Consider individual skill levels and developmental ne eds when assigning tasks 101 R E S P E C T Know your subordinates and look out for their well-being Put the safety of your subordin ates above all other objectives. Take care of your subordinate's needs. Resolve conflicts between individuals on the team. Keep your subordinates informed Provide accurate and timely briefings. Give the reason (intent) for assignments and tasks. Make yourself available to answer questions at appropriate times. Build the team Conduct frequent debriefings with th e team to identify lessons learned. Recognize individual and team accomplis hments and reward them appropriately. Apply disciplinary measures equally. Employ your subordinates in a ccordance with their capabilities Observe human behavior Provide early warning to subordinates of tasks they will be responsible for. Consider team experience, fatigue, a nd physical limitations when accepting assignments . I N T E G R I T Y Know yourself and seek improvement Know the strengths/weaknesses in your character and skill level. Ask questions of p eers and superiors. Actively listen to fee dback from subordinates. Seek responsibility and accept responsibility for your actions Accept full responsibility for poor team performance. Credit subordinates for good performance. Keep your superiors informed of your actions. Set the example Share the hazards and hardsh ips with your subordinates. Don't show discouragement when facing setbacks. Choose the difficult right over the easy wrong . 102 Communication Responsibilities All personnel have five communication responsibilities: Brief others as needed Debrief your actions Communicate hazards to others Acknowledge messages Ask if you don't know Leader's Intent In addition, all leaders ha ve the responsibility to pr ovide complete briefings and ensure that their subordinates ha ve a clear understanding of their intent for the assignment: Task = What is to be done Purpose = Why it is to be done End State = How it should look when done Human Factor Barriers to Situation Awareness Low Experience Leve l with Local Factors Unfamiliar with the area or th e organizational structure. Distraction from Primary Task Radio traffic Conflict Previous errors Collateral duties Incident within an incident Fatigue Carbon Monoxide Dehydration Heat stress Poor fitness level can reduce resistance to fatigue 24-hours awake affects your decision-ma king capability like .10 blood alcohol content. Stress Reactions Communication deteriorates or grows tense. Habitual or repetitive behaviors. Target fixation - Locking into a course of action, whether it makes sense or not, just try harder. Action tunneling - Focusing on small tasks, but ignoring the big picture. Escalation of commitment - Accepting increas ed risk as comple tion of task gets near. 103 Hazardous Attitudes Invulnerable - That can't happen to us Anti-authority - Disregard of the team effort Impulsive - Do something even if it's wrong Macho - Trying to impress or prove something Complacent - Just another routine incident Resigned - We can't make a difference Group Think - Afraid to speak up or disagree After Action Review (AAR) The climate surrounding an AAR must be on e in which the participants openly and honestly discuss what transpir ed, in sufficient detail and clar ity, so everyone understands what did and did not occur and why. Most importantly, participants should leave with a strong desire to improve their proficiency. An AAR is performed as immedi ately after the event as possible by the personnel involved. The leader's role is to en sure skilled facilitation of the AAR. Reinforce that respec tful disagreement is OK. Keep focused on the what , not the who. Make sure everyone participates. End the AAR on a positive note. What was planned? - What actua lly happened? - Why did it happen? What can we do next time? - (Correct weaknesses/sustain strengths) 104 From the 'Lectric Law Library's Stacks Guide To Crisis Negotiations - http://www.lectlaw.com Incidents involving barricaded subjects, hosta ge takers, or persons threatening suicide represent especially trying and stressful moments for law enforcement personnel who respond to them. Officers first responding to the scene must quickly assess the totality of the situation, secure the area, gauge the threat to hostages or bystanders , and request additional units as appropriate. Crisis negotiators must establish contact with subjects, identify their demands, and work to resolve tense and often volatile standoffs without loss of life. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) te ams must prepare to neutra lize subjects through swift tactical means. Field commande rs assume ultimate responsibility for every aspect of the police response. For such a coordinated response to be suc cessful, each component needs to understand clearly the functions of the others . This article clarifies the role of crisis negotiators for field commanders, of whatever rank, who find themselves in comm and of hostage or other critical incidents. Supervisors who understand the purpose behind the actions taken by negotiators will avoid delays at the scene that occur when negotiato rs must stop and explain or justify their intended courses of action. Such understanding has taken on particular impor tance in recent years. Negotiators have become very active, due in part to the reputa tions they have established for the successful, peaceful resolution of various types of critical incidents. For exampl e, in 1993, the Hostage Negotiations Team of the Sea ttle, Washington, Police Depart ment resolved 21 incidents, expending a total of 263 nego tiator hours. In 1994, negotiators resolved 32 incidents, spending 407 hours in negotiations. TRAINING Although it might appear that nego tiators and tactical teams wo rk at cross-purposes during a crisis, nothing could be further from the tr uth. Society requires that law enforcement exhausts all means available prior to launching a tactical resolution to an incident. If these means prove unsuccessful, then the transition fr om negotiation to tactical assault must be a smooth one. To enhance cooperation, negotiato rs and personnel from tactical teams should train together on a regular basis. In Seattle, the Hostage Negotiations Team and the Emergency Response Team conduct joint training exercises four to six times a year. These training sessions include four fully enacted crisis scenarios. Members of the department's command staff are encouraged to participate, and through this training, have learned how the two teams work together. Law enforcement agencies generally place a premium on the training provided to tactical teams. Administrators should place no less em phasis on the training provided to their negotiations teams. At a very minimum, negotiators shoul d complete the FBI's Basic Hostage/Crisis Negotiations course. 105 Because the department's training qualifications may become subj ect to critical review in the courts should negotiations fail, negotiators sh ould further their training through advanced courses, seminars, basic psychology classes, and de tailed critical analysis of past incidents. TYPES OF INCIDENTS Most negotiations teams group incidents into three main categories -- hostage takings, barricade situations, and suicide attempts. Trad itionally, hostage taking s assume the highest profile. However, in recent years, the Sea ttle Police Department's Hostage Negotiations Team has responded to an incr easing number of high-profil e barricade situations. Field commanders should remember that the peaceful resolution of a barricade situation is as important to negotiators as the resolution of an incident involving a person threatening to jump from a bridge or a hostage taking with extensive media coverage. THE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS In negotiations, as in most endeavors, no absolute s exist. Each incident takes on a personality of its own. Field commanders can be sure of only one thing: Their decisions will be scrutinized by every \"Monday morning quarterb ack\" from city hall to the city desk. Therefore, they should base their decisions on an understanding of the negotiations process and the many factors that affect it. Untrained Personnel A successful negotiations process requires a good foundation. Often, ci rcumstances force the first responding officers to initiate some type of negotia tion with the subject(s). However, once line officers or fi rst-line supervisors realize that an incident appears to be heading for something other th an a prompt resolution, they should immediately terminate negotiations and call in trained negotiators. Too many tragedies in comm unities across America demonstr ate how negotiations should not be initiated. A bad start by well-intentioned, but untrained, personn el can have negative effects throughout the proc ess. Simply put, personnel who ar e not trained negotiators should not negotiate. Time A negotiator's most important ally in all situat ions is time. Field commanders should not rush anything unless the loss of life appears immi nent. Although it may seem as if nothing is happening because a suspect is not negotiating, th is is not so. During these quiet times, many things occur that will eventually lead to a peaceful resolution. Negotiators refer to these quiet intervals as \"dynamic inactivity.\" As long as time passes without any harm to persons involved, then ne gotiators are making progress. The passing of time works for the police in many ways and only means that a resolution is closer at hand. Field commanders should keep in mind that patience is a virtue. 106 The Negotiations Team Generally, the negotiations team consists of at least three main negotiators. Each team member plays a vital role in the successf ul resolution of critical incidents. The primary negotiator actually communicates w ith the subject. The s econdary (or backup) negotiator assists the primary negotiator by of fering advice, monitoring the negotiations, keeping notes, and ensuring that the primary negotiator sees and hears everything in the proper perspective. The intellig ence negotiator interviews pe rsons associated with the suspect to compile a crim inal history and a hist ory of mental illness, as well as to gather other relevant information. Often, an additional negotiator will act as th e chief negotiator, whose primary responsibility is to act as a buffer between comma nd personnel and the negotiations team. Invariably, and understandably, field comman ders want to offer their advice to the negotiations team. Whenever possible, suggestions should be routed to the negotiations team via the chief negotiator. The Negotiations Area Typically, the negotiations team sets up away from the rest of the activity and maintains communications with the comman d post via a liaison. In Seattle, a member of the Emergency Response Team generally monito rs the negotiations and provide s tactical intelligence to the arrest, entry, and perimeter teams. Only the Police Should Negotiate Often, well-meaning civilians offe r to negotiate with subjects . Sometimes, these civilians insist that they be allowed to negotiate. A wide range of individuals - from parents, spouses, and lovers to friends, members of the clergy, attorneys, counselors, and mental health professionals - might offer to do the talking. As a general rule, direct civilian participation in negotiations is entirely unacceptable. The tacti cal negotiations process is a police operation. When faced with these offers, field commanders should keep in mind that the individual now so willing to help might have played a large pa rt in driving the subject over the edge. While these individuals might be a useful source of information, only in ve ry rare circumstances should they be allowed to speak directly with su bjects. Instead, they should be escorted to the intelligence negotiator and kept well clear of the actual negotiations process. Containment and Control Basic police procedure dictates that any crisis incident be contained using both inner and outer perimeters established and maintained by the police. Critical incidents such as hostage takings, barricade situations, or suicide attemp ts must be contained prior to the start of negotiations. Mobile negotiations should not be attempted. 107 While the need for a se cure inner perimeter is obvious, crisis incidents also require an emphasis on a well-controlled outer perimeter. When arriving at the scene of a hostage taking, barricade situation, or suicide intervention, negotiators often encounter a large crowd made up of bystanders, the pre ss, and the subject's family memb ers. It is important that the subject not be given an audience to \"play to.\" Negotiation cannot succee d if negotiators must compete with outside influences for the subject's attention. Individuals with potentially help ful information about a subject should be secured in an area where they can provide details to the intellig ence negotiator. Likewise, the press should be provided a designated gathering area away from the perimeter and be briefed regularly regarding the status of the negotiations process. Field commanders should remember that reporte rs have a job to do. They will do that job, with or without the help of the police. It is far more preferable to provide them with the accurate information they need than to fo rce them to gather it for themselves. The relationship need not be confr ontational. In Seattle, the poli ce generally enjoy good relations with the on-scene press. Duri ng protracted incidents, supervisors should request the assistance of the department's media relations personnel to he lp deal with the press. The highly unstable nature of these incidents also makes it imperative that an arrest team be prepared to take the subject(s) into custody at a moment's notice. In fact, the surrender phase represents the most critical stage in any ne gotiated incident. In some cases, surrender can occur very rapidly. Depending on the severity of the incident, the arrest team can be made up of patrol officers or members of specialized t eams. Once the SWAT team sets up at a scene, it should assume this duty. Control of Phone Lines During a protracted crisis, it is essential that the police control the phone lines. Generally, one of the first actions negotiators take when ar riving at an incident is to arrange with the telephone company to deny origination to telephones at the subject's disposal. Once origination is denied, the subject's telephon es will no longer get a dial tone. At the negotiators' request, the telephon e company then establishes a ne w number that serves as a direct line between negotiators and the subject. Restricting telephone access in this way prohibits the subject from talking to family, frie nds, attorneys, an d most important, the press. It also prevents the suspect from gather ing intelligence about police maneuvers from associates. The Throw Phone When there is no telephone accessible to the su bject, or the telephone has been disabled as a tactical move by SWAT, the police must reesta blish a means of comm unication. Because of the potential danger posed to negotiators, fa ce-to-face negotiations do not represent an acceptable option. In these s ituations, the SWAT team often tactically delivers a \"throw phone\"--a standard telephone linked to a hardli ne system connected to the hostage phone system. Because telephone delivery places members of the SWAT team in dangerous situations, it should be practiced regularly du ring joint negotiator-SWAT training exercises. 108 Controlling Utilities In Seattle, control of the phone lines generally can be secured without supervisory approval. However, in many instances, the negotiations team might determine a need to control the electricity and water, as well. Only the on-scene commander ca n make the final decision to interrupt these services. Negotiators will bring the specific reasons fo r disconnecting utilities to the attention of the on-scene commander. Some of the most common reasons incl ude taking away a subject's ability to monitor the incident on television; da rkening the environment to provide a tactical advantage for SWAT; and el iminating comforts, such as toilet facilities. Tactical teams also might ca ll for disconnection of plumbing services to deny subjects the ability to neutralize chemical ag ents, as has occurred in seve ral recent incidents in Seattle. For whatever reason, the deni al (or resumption) of utilities provides negotiators with an effective bargaining tool. Different perspectives exist concerning the appr opriate time to deny subjects utility services. Some experts believe that utilities should be di sconnected before negotiations begin. Others believe negotiators should save such steps for use as bargaining tools later. While this is a matter of individual agency polic y, administrators should ensure that the department adopts well-established policy guidelines in this pivotal area. Demands and Deadlines It is preferable for field commanders to re sist the tendency to monitor the negotiations process personally. Supervisors who monitor negotiations or hear demands, deadlines, and death threats related during briefings should not become overly concerned. They should remember that the negotiating team is trained to deal with such scenarios. When a subject demands \"$1 million,\" the negotiators actu ally hear \"a 6-pack of soda.\" Likewise, if the on-scene commander hears a s ubject say, \"If I don't get the car by 2:00, I'll kill a hostage,\" negotiators actually hear, \"Go od, now we are really negotiating.\" Remarkably few hostages have ever been ha rmed as a result of missed d eadlines. Of course, negotiators take deadlines and demands very seriously; however, skilled ne gotiators generally can work around them and even make them work to law enfo rcement's advantage. During an incident, a member of the negotiati ons team keeps the field commander informed of the negotiations. Commanders who find it absolutely necessary to monitor the negotiations need to inform the negotiations te am, which should have th e capability to wire a speaker to the command post to enable supervis ors to listen to exchanges with the subject. However, field commanders' decisions should be based on the law, departmental policy, and the need for preservation of life and propert y. They should not make decisions based on exchanges they overhear betw een subjects and negotiators. Th e decision-making ability of commanders who personally monitor the negotiations proc ess may be affected by any number of factors that have little actual bearing on the situation. 109 Psychology Much of the insight into the minds of tr oubled subjects comes fr om the specialized psychological training that crisis negotiators re ceive. As part of their training, negotiators learn a great deal about pers onality types, personality disorders, and the psychological motivations of hostage takers, suicidal pers ons, and subjects who barricade themselves. This training enables negotiators to manipulate a subject through their understanding of that person's state of mind. Accordi ngly, negotiators rely primarily on mental rather than physical tactics to resolve conflicts. Checklist Each field commander with the Seattle Police Departme nt carries a pocket -sized checklist of actions that must be performed during a ne gotiated crisis. The checklist assists on-scene commanders to accomplish in an orderly fashion the various ta sks required during a crisis. Other agencies might benefit from a similar checklist.1 During times of extreme pressure , even the most prepared and composed professionals might not always remember to do ever ything at the right time. A checklist can prove invaluable in assisting supervisors to keep te nse situations under control. Debriefings Agencies should conduct debriefings after the resolution of any crisis incident. Whenever possible, these debriefings should take place im mediately following an incident, when details are still fresh in the participants' minds. The debriefing should focus on how the various un its handled their roles during the incident. Each component must be repr esented, and officers should feel free to offer criticism--both positive and negative. However, de briefings of this type should not be confused with or conducted in place of critical incident stress debriefings. Both serve valuable but distinct purposes. CONCLUSION Despite moves toward proactive policing methodologies, law enforcement remains an inherently reactive profession. Wh en violent or troubled subjects create a crisis, they force the police to react to a situation in which th e offenders already hold many of the cards. The press and the public judge the police by how well they respond to such situations. Generally, concerns for hostage and officer safety, in additi on to the well-being of often mentally disturbed subjects, dictate that the poli ce respond at the lowest force level possible. Therefore, on-scene commanders should be prepared to supe rvise a negotiated settlement. The negotiations process can be tedious, comple x, and at times, confusing. The better field commanders understand the many f actors that affect it, the more likely that negotiators will get the support necessary to resolv e critical incidents peacefully. 110 Critical Incident Stress Reactions What it is, how to recognize it, and what to do about it! What is Critical Incident Stress? Police work can be stressful on a regular basis. While continual stress will take its to ll, Critical Incident stress is different in that it directly relates to a dramatic event or events in the life of an officer that results in a number of debilitating symptoms. Definitions of a Critical Incident include: Any situation beyond the realm of a person's usual experience that overwhelms his or her sense of vulnerability and or lack of control over the situation. - Roger Soloman, Ph.D Any Situation faced by emergency service pe rsonnel that causes them to experience unusually strong emotional reactions which ha ve the potential to interfere with their ability to function either at the scene or later. - Jeff Mitchell, Ph.D. A life experience or series of experiences th at so seriously upsets the balance of the individual that it creates changes in the pe rson's emotional, c ognitive or behavioral functioning. Daniel A. Goldfarb, Ph.D. & Gary S. Aumiller, Ph.D. Perhaps the simplest definition of Critical Incident Stress is: A normal reaction to an abnormal event. Critical Incidents: \u0083 Are sudden and unexpected \u0083 Disrupt our sense of control \u0083 Disrupt beliefs, values, and basic assumptio ns about the world in which we live, the people in it, and the work that we do \u0083 Involve the perception of a life damaging threat \u0083 May involve emotional or physical loss The police subculture hol ds many myths that can lessen th e officer's ability to deal with the situation. \"Real men can handle it!\"; \"If you can't deal, find a new line of work!\"; \"Keep it to yourself,\" Don't be a baby!\" The reality is that police officers, as all human beings, will experience deep emotional reacti ons to a critical incident. Attempts to deny this fact often cause officers to suffer in s ilence, not seek help, and in some instances, truly disrupt their lives and the lives of their families. You have experienced a traumatic event or a critical incident (any incident that [would cause most individuals] to experience unus ually strong emotional reactions which have the potential to interfere with their ability to function either at the scene or later). Even though the event may be over, you may now be experien cing or may experience later, some strong emotional or physical reacti ons. It is very common, in fact quite normal, for people to experience emotional aftershocks when they have passed through a horrible event. 111 Sometimes the emotional afters hocks (or stress reactions) appear immediately after the traumatic event. Sometimes th ey may appear a few hours or a few days later. And, in some cases, weeks or months may pass before the stress reactions appear. The signs and symptoms of a stress reaction may last a few days, a few weeks or a few months and occasionally longer depending on the severity of the tr aumatic event. With understanding and the support of loved ones the stress reactions usually pass more quickly. Occasionally, the traumatic event is so painful that professional assistance from a counselor may be necessary. This does not imply craziness or weakness. It simply indicates that the particular event was just too powerful for the person to manage by themselves. Police officers and rescue workers in general, share personality traits that can feed into the stress of a critical incident. Personality factors of Law Enforcement Personnel include: A need to be in control Obsessive/perfectionist tendencies Compulsive/traditional values -- wantin g things to remain unchanged High levels of internal motivation Action-oriented High need for stimulation and excitement (easily bored) High need for immediate gratification Tendency to take risks Highly dedicated Invested in the job due to months of trai ning and preparation , view job as life long career Identify strongly w ith their role as a police officer High need to be needed These personality factors not only make officers do a good job, but al so make them more vulnerable to critical incidents. The demands of the job, in combination with these personality factors, are reasons why officers need to be more aware of stress. They also need to be especia lly aware of the impact stress has on their everyday functioning. Types of critical incidents include: Line of duty death/injury/shooting. This event highlights the officers own mortality. In an instant, an incident shatters the \"myt h\" of invulnerability that officers often need to functio n on a day to day basis. Suicide of a Co-worker. ...\"It can happen to anyone...E ven me!\" The pressures of the job, a personal life and the toll both can take come into focu s. Add to this the \"If only's...\" and guilt develops as well. The suicide of a co-w orker can turn the officer's world upside down. 112 Death of a child. The innocence represented by children can have a profound impact on an officer. The death of a child can push an officer over the edge. It can disrupt the \"natural order of things\". It can make everything the officer stands for seem useless. Should the officer have ch ildren or worse, children the same age, \"factors of identification\" can add even more stress. Prolonged failed rescue attempt. This is especially true if the officer has come to know the victim. A great deal of stress is encountered in this situation. The officer is continually focused on the \"absolute n ecessity to succeed\". The officer's very reason \"for being\" is put on the line: someone needs him/her, their life depends on him/her. He cannot let them down! A deep sense of personnel failure, coupled with the stress of the situation, can trigger deep emotional consequences. Mass Casualty Incidents. Multiple victims, mass c onfusion, shortages of manpower and resources all add to make these situations overwhelming! The enormity of the situation can merely ov erride an officer's ability to cope. Safety of the officer is unusually jeopardized. An officer sees the worst side of life every day. He is constantly exposed to society's underbelly. It can be difficult to maintain a view that th ere are any decent people out there. This is somewhat complicated since an officer faces potential danger on a daily basis. However, if an officer finds himself in a situation th at focuses him on his vulnerability and lack of control, a critical incident st ress reaction can be triggered. Victim is known to responder. Seeing death and tragedy is bad enough. If the officer finds he knows the victim, this can trigger a critical incident stress reaction. He is unprepared, is close to the victim , and may believe that he/she is somehow responsible. \"I should have driven faster, etc..\". Factors affecting magnitude of Response: No t all people exposed to a critical incident experience a stress reaction. In fact it appears to be consistently divided into thirds such that: 1/3 experience little to no reaction 1/3 experience moderate symptoms 1/3 experience severe symptoms The symptoms may show up immediately after the incident. This is called an acute reaction. If symptoms are going to ap pear, this is as good a time for them as any. It is clear what caused the sy mptoms, support is usually at its highest, and help is often sought. Often future problems are avoided when reactions ar e acute since the symptoms are dealt with promptly. Symptoms may appear up to a few months later. Not all symptoms appear at once. After the onset of the first few (and it varies fro m person to person what those will be), other symptoms start to pile on. This is called a delayed reaction. It represents difficulty because there is not always a clear associ ation between the even t and the subsequent symptoms. As a result, the o fficer often thinks he/she is going \"crazy\" for no reason. 113 They do not seek out support from family and friends. Ofte n they will try to deny they are having symptoms to others, even to themselv es. They do not seek professional help. The result may be that symptoms needlessly worsen until the offi cer's life has become over- complicated and outside pressure is applied to seek some form of treatment. Even at this juncture, if the symptoms are not related to th e event, treatment may be ineffective. As a peer team member, you can be helpful to in dividuals with delayed reactions by pointing out to them that you see them having problems and that these problems may be connected to an incident that they went through. Symptoms of stress may also appear in officers who have had repeated exposure to critical situations (i.e. emergency services). Years may elapse. Hundreds of incidents may have occurred. The officer ma y consider him/herself immune to stress problems. Then it hits: \"a cumulative stress reaction.\" This may be the most difficult person to help. There is almost no association between thes e symptoms and the critical incidents the officer has faced. The sy mptoms appear to have come from \"out of the blue\". The officer may fear he/she has suddenly be come weak or \"lost it.\". They question their ability to go on with the job; a job which they may love. Often seeking help does not even cross their mind. Since there is no clear single incident , friends or peer team members may not realize that the stress symptoms shown are the result of th e toll taken by experiencing just too many stressful calls. As a friend or peer, you can serve a crucial function in helping thes e officers. If you see symptoms appearing, and you are aware of their work history, you are in a unique position to help them put the puzzle of their symptoms t ogether. You can help them understand that they are not \"cra zy\" or \"weak.\" They just need to get on the right track as any human exposed repeat edly to high levels of stress will eventually sh ow symptoms. As noted, not all people exposed to a critical incident will experience symptoms. This does not mean that some people are immune fro m the pressures of police work. In fact, a person who has been through a number of critical incidents without effect may find themselves terribly shaken by a particular call. The reverse is true. A person who took some time to recover from an incident may find that they have few symptoms after a particularly harrowing call. In fact, the e ffect of any call on an officer can be a complicated mixture of his/her personality, comb ined with specific ch aracteristics of the call itself. Some factors that may a ffect an officer's response include: \u0083 The nature of the Event - How involved was the officer? How much control of the situation did he/she have? The le ss control -- the mo re traumatic the experience. What was the degree of thre at or loss? How grot esque was the call? Remember, what a person considers grot esque will vary from person to person. How much did the call disrupt his/her expectations of the job/the world/people in general? \u0083 Degree of warning - The less warning often the mo re severe the response. Warning provides an officer with time to develop some coping strategies. 114 \u0083 Ego Strength/Coping Style - Everyone comes to a situation with a different character and personality. Th e individual's personality is molded th rough their genetics and past experiences. Some people have stronger coping mechanisms and higher degrees of awareness in their ph ilosophical and spiritu al life. All these characteristics will alter the effects of a critical incident. \u0083 Prior mastery of the experience - Practice makes better! Going through a hairy call successfully may make it easier to go through the experience again. The past experience helps the officer think more clearly and more positively in a similar situation. This can help not only with one' s physical surviv al, but with the emotional survival once the call has ended. \u0083 Proximity - The closer an officer is physically to the scene the greater the impact. Proximity is also created by psychological closeness. Seeing a dead three year old girl may have more of an impact on the officer with a three year old at home. Often there may be emotional links betw een the scene and the officer's life for which he/she is unaware. The officer may then experience th e stress symptoms, may even be able to relate it to the incident he/she just lived through, but may feel like some piece of the puzzle is missing, be cause they can't make the connection to their own life. Many times thes e links need to be discover ed in order for the stress level to subside. This is an area where a pr ofessional may prove to be very helpful. \u0083 The amount of stress in one's life -- It is better not to be going through a bitter divorce when one is responding to a pa rticularly stressful call! The amount of stress in a person's life and how it is be ing handled can have a tremendous impact on the effects of added stress. \u0083 Nature and degree of social support ava ilable to an officer after a critical incident -- The officer's willingness to accept support is also important. If the officer pushes people away with the idea that he/she \"can handle it\", then they place themselves at greater risk. This sup port includes all of the significant people in an officer's life: peers, supervisor s, professionals, and family. The family especially plays a crucial role. Their degr ee of support, willingn ess to listen, and the officer's ability to open up and talk, all factor into the degree of response to a critical incident. So from the above, it can be seen that the likelihood and severity of an emotional response resulting from a critical incident is a combination of factors. These include both personality factors within the officer, as well as factors about the call itself, and even factors revolving around the officers current life situation. 115 39 \u008a\"Real men can handle it.\" \u008a\"If you can't deal, find a new line of work.\" \u008a\"Keep it to yourself.\" \u008a\"If you don't cope, you can lose your job, or worse, no one will want to work with you.\" CRITICAL INCIDENT STRESS REACTION SYMPTOMS The acute signals of distress exhibited by people after a critical incident can be observed in four spheres: Physical - Cogn itive - Emotional - Behavioral Physical Signs Tension, aches, pains; trembling, poor coor dination, chest pains, dizziness, weakness, chills, thirst, fainting, twitches, elevated blood pressure, rapid heart rate, shock symptoms Jumpiness: startle at sudden sounds or movement; grinding of teeth Cold sweat; dry mouth; pale skin; eyes hard to focus; profuse sweating Feeling out of breath; hyperventilating un til fingers and toes go numb or cramp Upset stomach; vomiting, diarrhea, c onstipation, frequent urination Fatigue: feel tired, drained; takes effort to move Distant, haunted, \"1000\" mile stare Cognitive Signs Difficulty making decisions; uncer tainty; poor decision making Confusion; suspiciousness; Disorientation of time, place or pers on; increased or decreased awareness Poor concentration; heightened or lo wered alertness, lack of attention Memory loss, especially for recent events ; difficulty identifying objects or people Unable to perform multiple tasks Flashbacks (either visual or auditory) Nightmares; hyper vigilanc e; blaming someone; Poor Panic; Irritability; Apprehension; Emotional Shock Depression Anger Resentment Anxiety; Fear Feelings of numbness Feelings of being overwhelmed; Emotional outbursts; Loss of emotional control; Constant second guessing/self doubting Feeling detached from reality 116 Behavioral Signs Decreased job performance Withdrawn from friend/ colleagues/family Outbursts (either crying or laughing) Changes in normal humor patterns Excessive talkativeness or silence Hyperactive behavior Antisocial acts Inability to rest Intensified pacing; Erratic movements Change in social activity Loss or increase of appetite Increased consumption of alcohol and/or drugs Peer actions o Remove officer from scene as soon as possible. o Help him/her notify his/her fam ily that he/she is safe. o Reassure officer that his/ her symptoms are normal. o Allow and encourage officer to talk.

When in doubt, contact a physician. Things to Try WITHIN THE FIRST 24 - 48 HOURS periods of appropriate physical exercise, alternated with relaxation will allevi ate some of the p hysical reactions. Structure your ti me - keep busy. You're normal and havi ng normal reactions - don't label yourself crazy. Talk to people - talk is the most healing medicine. Be aware of numbing the pain with overuse of drugs or alcohol, you don't need to complicate this with a substance abuse problem. Reach out - people do care. Maintain as normal a schedule as possible. Spend time with others. Help your co-workers as much as possibl e by sharing feelings and checking out how they are doing. Give yourself permission to feel rott en and share your feelings with others. Keep a journal; write your way through those sleepless hours. Realize those around you are under stress. Don't make any big life changes. Do make as many daily decisions as possibl e which will give you a feeling of control over your life, i.e., if someone asks you what you want to eat - answer them even if you're not sure. Get plenty of rest. Reoccurring thoughts, dreams or flashbacks are normal - don't try to fight them - they'll decrease over time and become less painful. Eat well-balanced and regular meal s (even if you don't feel like it). FOR FAMILY MEMBERS & FRIENDS Listen carefully. Spend time with the traumatized person. Offer your assistance and a listening ear if they have not asked for help. Reassure them that they are safe. Help them with everyday tasks like cleaning, cooking, cari ng for the family, minding children. Give them some private time. Do not take their anger or other feelings personally. Do not tell them that they are \"lucky it wasn't worse\" - trau matized people are not consoled by those statements. Instea d, tell them that you are sorry such an event has occurred and you want to understand and assist them. DO NOT \u0083 Second guess officer. \u0083 Say \"Everything will be fine\". \u0083 Try to protect him/her by withholdi ng information (do use judgment). \u0083 Give too much advice. \u0083 Make promises and not follow up . 119 Critical Incident Stress Management - Written by Stephenie Slahor Whether it is an officer-involved shooting, a te rrorist incident, an accident scene, a wide- scale disaster, or any of the other events th at involve law enforcement personnel as first responders, there will be stress as sociated with the ev ent. That stress will be felt not only by the first responders, but also by those dire ctly, or even indirectly, affected by the event. Strategic intervention planning is a necessary component of responding to such stress-produci ng events. Offering help on group crisis intervention is Dr. Michael M acIntosh, chaplain with the San Diego, Calif., Police Depa rtment and Newport Beach, Ca lif., Police Department. He is a certified instructor in cris is intervention and has served as a reserve police officer. He is the author of \"When Your World Falls Ap art,\" which describes his experiences as one of the chaplains on the scene of the terrorist attack agai nst the Twin Towers in New York. He also served as a ch aplain at the Oklahoma City Fe deral Building bombing site. MacIntosh held a two-day critic al incident stress management training seminar at the Palm Springs, Calif., Police Department Tr aining Center. The seminar was one of the events of the \"Festival of Life\" that took pl ace in the Coachella Valley of California (in which Palm Springs is located) in alliance with Lighthouses of the Valley, a cross- denominational group of Chris tian pastors, churches, para-c hurch groups and community leaders. MacIntosh said that police departments need to form critical incident stress management (CISM) teams composed of trained personnel who can guide individuals, small groups or large groups through recovery fr om a stress-provoking event. In a critical incident, those affected react in many different ways, but their tension and stress levels will be \"unbelievable,\" MacIntos h said. In a stress-provoking incident, \"The thoughts you're having are nor mal thoughts that any normal person would have in an abnormal situation,\" he said. It is the nature of the work of police pe rsonnel, fire fighters and emergency medical 120 responders to face such abnormal situations al most daily. \"It's the situation that's nuts,\" he said. \"You're OK.\" He added, \"It's only b ecause of the work you 're doing. It's not the end of the world at all.\" He pointed out that when first responders are asked why they chose their job, their answers are usually, \"I want to help people, \" and \"I want to make a difference.\" Those sentiments are key to being a first responder, and they result in what MacIntosh termed \"a love in the culture\" among those who do firs t responder work. First responders regard one another as brothers and sisters, and that camaraderie extends to their support workers as dispatchers and staff, too. The critical incidents that are a part of the wo rk of first responders have the potential to create significant distress, so much so that a person's normal coping mechanisms cannot handle the distress without help. CISM can he lp first responders through some of the rough spots, but CISM is not a clinical pres cription or a substitute for further help or therapy. \"It's not the cure-all,\" said MacIntosh, but a psychological crisis face d by first responders can be lessened or assuaged if intervention is provided in a timely manner to give active, short-term, supportive help that can mitigate the significa nt distress, impairment or dysfunction that first responders e xperience after a critical incident. The goals of CISM are to stabilize those affe cted, reduce their symptoms of impairment or dysfunction, help them re turn to adaptations that w ill assist them in functioning normally again, and facilitate access to furthe r care, if needed. Th e help given by CISM should be as immediate as possible, because that immediacy can reduce impairment. CISM is much akin to first aid for a physical injury \u2014that temporary, immediate care during which there is assessment of need, immediate treatment, reduction of further injury, and quicker recovery, said MacIntosh. In a way, crisis intervention is a kind of psychological or emotional first aid, he said. \"CISM is designed to ke ep you in the race,\" he stated. As positive as all this sounds, there may be re sistance to forming CI SM teams, he said. Such things as administra tive misunderstanding of CI SM, turf wars, multi-agency conflicts, politics, untrained \"helpers\" or limi ted follow-up all need to be considered and rectified before a CISM team can be effective in its work. \"Each one of us is completely different,\" MacIntosh said, but psychological distress will take a toll if a person's usual coping or defense mechanisms are overwhelmed. A psychological crisis will disrupt a person's natural, homeostatic balance between thinking and emotions. The crisis can provoke stress that causes failure of the coping mechanisms. Crisis intervention targets these changes and responses, not the event, he emphasized. The intervention assesses the need in light of what is occurring. \"When you intervene quickly, you're saving someone\" fro m more severe mental damage that can occur hours, 121 days, weeks or even months la ter, MacIntosh said. A variety of interventions can be used, but they must match what is needed in the situation and am ong the people affected by the event. MacIntosh noted that police personnel are usua lly \"the most flexib le people,\" adept at multitasking and coping. But even the most fl exible may need help , and not just the people who have been especially close to th e incident as it occurre d or who were caught in its immediate aftermath. Right after the event is the be st time to begin the process of intervention, MacIntosh recommended. \"Intervention reduces the stress levels, helps you get back to the job, and helps others get back to doing the job,\" he said, though adding, \"It is not reasonable to think that any one thing can help.\" There will likely be many processes and many people involved in the course of in tervention. Assessment, interv ention and evaluation will occur all along the steps of the process of care, to lead to the resilience and recovery needed. MacIntosh pointed out that sometimes it is po ssible to create a \"resistance\" to distress through pre-incident training and preparation that teache s people how to build their immunity to the manifestations of distress, dysfunction and impairme nt. Practices, drills and mock scenarios may be beneficial. Or maybe not! The event may be of such ma gnitude that pre-incident training is not enough, or the personnel may be so close to the event that copi ng mechanisms cannot work effectively. Family of such personnel wi ll also need assistance and intervention for their safety, security, reactions, a nd spiritual and emotional care. In such cases, the interven tion will focus on building re silience and helping toward recovery. Resilience means rebounding in an effective and quick manner from the psychological effe cts of an incident. Recovery is the ability of someone to function adaptively, despite the incide nt. Both resilience and recove ry can apply to individuals, small groups, large groups or entire populations. The intervention is only one part, MacInt osh reminded. There must be access to appropriate levels of care, as needed, and CISM teams must facilitate that access. There must also be consideration of the various pe ople served: individuals, small groups, large groups, communities, neighborho ods, diverse populations, special populations, and so on. MacIntosh noted that most peopl e can cope with some stress if they have general well- being in their physical body and in their ps ychological, social, emotional and spiritual domains. Most people are effe ctive problem-solvers and make responsible lifestyle choices. Those factors also help them cope with stressful s ituations. A healthy sense of home and family, honor, strong social support, and faith also help. MacIntosh paraphrased Romans 13: 1-6 saying that police officers, as part of the rulers of the people, are as ordained ministers of God, to strike fear in the wicked and bring hope to the good. While CISM usually means \"cri tical incident stress management,\" it also stands for a \"comprehensive, integrated, sy stematic, multi-compon ent\" approach to stressful situations, he said. Inner peace and character and pre-incident training will help, but when further intervention is needed, it must be given so that people can rebound and have \"the ability to get back in to service,\" MacIntosh said. There are six core skills for teams in crisis intervention: assessment (similar to triage), strategic planning, one-to-o ne crisis intervention, sma ll group intervention, large group intervention, and follow- up/referral to further help. The task for CISM teams is to learn the methods and tactical skills to be used in CISM, and also to know strategically when and where to employ the most appropriate intervention methods and skills for the people to be se rved, he said. CISM is not ps ychotherapy, he reminded, but only a part of a continuum of care needed after a critical incident. CISM mitigates the impact of the event a nd lowers the tension being felt, facilitates recovery in normal people who are experienci ng an abnormal event, and restores those people to adaptive functioning. It is a focused form of cris is intervention to manage the traumatic stress of th e critical incident. MacIntosh noted that not only does CISM apply intervention skills to a situation, but it also considers how and where that interven tion takes place. Immediacy is important, because rapid intervention is just like rapid fi rst aid for a physical injury. Contact should be made quickly and in a place where there is a sense of safety, privacy and relaxation. He termed it a \"respite cente r\" and said pre-planning by the CISM team should include decisions about where such a center can be qu ickly arranged. Proximity to the site of the incident may be a factor, or the respite center can be at the station. But he said it should be \"your place where you're out of the limelight.\" MacIntosh said stress is created as a re sponse to a physical, cognitive, emotional, psychological and/or spiritual arousal. Stress is a normal reaction of the body, but the cumulative effects of it can be damaging, eroding health and performance, and even causing disease. The \"fight, flight, fre eze\" reaction to sudden stress, and the accompanying adrenaline rush it causes, can be debilitating. CISM team members must learn what symptoms people might exhibit after a critical incident and the stress it has caused. MacIntosh reminded that CISM assistance mi ght need to be offe red not only to those directly impacted by an inci dent, but to support staff, dispatchers, family of those involved, the bereaved, people with pre-existing psychiatric problems, or those who ask for such help. While so me of the intervention will come almost immediately after the event, intervention may also be needed much later, for ex ample, when a court trial stemming from the incident begins or is in progress. 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 References Critical Incident Protocol.

Performance Objectives By the end of this training, you will be able to pass a written exam at or above 80% on the following: List the three types of evidence us ed to prove intent to discriminate List 5 of the eight overall factors for discrimination Describe reasonable accommodation List the three elements of employment opportunity Discuss know or should have known re garding harassment and hostile work environment List the three categories of harassment List five characteristics that can cr eate a hostile work environment List three reasons why people hesitate to report sexual harassment and/or hostile work environment Title VII complaint must be fi led within how many days per NERC Title VII complaint must be file d within how many days per EEOC 165 History Based on principles set forth in 1781: _________________________ and ________________________________ ___________ Laws Enforced y Title VII of the Civil Righ ts Act of 1964/1991 (CRA) y Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) y Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA) y Americans with Disabilit ies Act of 1990 (ADA) y Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA) y Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) y State Statute NRS 613.330 - Sexual Orientation The courts and the U.S. Equal Employm ent Opportunity Commission (EEOC) have identified a number of discrimination theori es in adjudicating EEO complaints: Disparate Treatment, Adverse Impact, Harassment/Hostile Environment Retaliation 166 Disparate Treatment exists when similarly situa ted individuals are treated differently because of their membership in a protected class. y Complainant must establish a prima facie case by showing that: y He/she is a member of a protected class. y He/she suffered some adverse action. y A similarly situated individual outside of his/her class was treated more favorably. Intent to discriminate is proven by three types of evidence : y direct, y circumstantial (comparative), and y statistical. Shifting Burden : Once a prima facie case is established the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitim ate, non-discriminatory reason for taking the action; then shifts back to compla inant to argue pretext. Adverse Impact Discrimination y Exists when a facially neutral employment policy/practice disproportionately impacts members of a protected class. y The burden shifts to the agency to pr ovide a business jus tification for the challenged policy/practice. y After management meets its burden, the complainant may prevail by providing an alternative practice that would accom plish the same business objective with a less adverse impact on the protected class. y Discriminatory motive is not required. y Examples of policies that may adversely impact some groups: y Educational Requirements, y Tests, y Height and Weight Requirements, y Subjective Standards for Hiring, y Promotions, and y Assignments. 167 Griggs v. Duke Power Co. 401 U.S. 424 (1971) y Griggs was an African American male; y He was denied a ditch digger job because he failed to meet selection criteria (possession of high school diploma or passing grade on a written test); y Supreme Court found that the facially neutral employment criteria violated Title VII because: y It had a disproportionate impact on Griggs' protected group and y It was not job-related or consistent with business necessity. Title VII Civil Rights Act of 1964 Title VII prohibits employers from discr iminating against workers because of: y Age y Race y Color y Religion y Sex y National Origin Under Title VII, the ADA, and the ADEA, it is illegal to discriminate in any aspect of employment, including: y Hiring and firing y Compensation, assignment, or classification y Transfer, promotion, layoff, or recall y Job advertisements y Recruitment y Testing y Use of company facilities y Training and apprenticeship programs y Fringe benefits y Pay, retirement plans, disability leave; or y Other terms and conditions of employment 168 Equal Employment Opportunity Laws (EEO) Protect employees from discrimination on the basis of: Race Age 40+ Ancestry Mental Disability Color Creed Medical Condition Marital Status Sex Religion Pregnancy Family Medical Leave National Origin Physical Disability Sexual Orientation Retaliation Eight Overall Factors: y Race y Color y Religion y Sex or gender y National Origin y Disability/Handicap Condition y Age (+40) y Retaliation and/or reprisal Discriminatory Practices include: y Harassment on the basis of race, color, reli gion, sex, national origin, disability, or age; y Retaliation for filing a ch arge of discrimination y Employment decisions based on stereotypes; and y Denying employment opportunities to a person because of marriage to, or association with, and individual of a particular race, religion, national origin, or an individual with a disability. 169 Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA): y Prohibits an employer from refus ing to hiring, firing, or otherwise discriminating against an employee age 40 or older, solely on the basis of age Equal Pay Act (EPA ): y Prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in the payment of wages or benefits y Wage differences permitted for : y Seniority, Merit, Quantity/quality of Production, any other factor other than sex What is a BFOQ?????? _________________________ ______________ __________ (BFOQ) are employment qualifications that employers are allowed to consider while making decisions about hiring and retentio n of employees. The qualification should relate to an essential job duty and is co nsidered necessary for operation of the particular business. The Bona Fide Occupational Qualifications rule allows for the hiring of individuals based on race, sex, age, and national origin if these ch aracteristics are bona fide occupational qualifications. This is an exce ption and complete defense to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which protec ts employees from discrimination based on religion, sex, age, national orig in and color at the workplace. In order to establish the defense of bona f ide occupational qualification, an employer must prove the requirement is necessary to the success of the business and that a definable group or class of employees would be unable to perform the job safely and efficiently. An employer shou ld demonstrate a necessity for a certain type of workers because all others do not have certain characteristics necessary for employment success. However, the employer's motivation fo r excluding the protected class is not significant in evaluating the BFOQ defense. The inquiry focuses on the necessity of using an expressly forbidden classification. Examples of BFOQ's are: mandatory retirement ages for bus drivers and airplane pilots for safety reasons, churches requiring members of its clergy to be of a certain denomination and may lawfully bar, from em ployment, anyone who is not a member. However, for positions at a church such as janitors, discrimination based on religious denomination would be illegal because reli gion has no effect on a person's ability to fulfill the duties of the job. Other example s of bona fide occupation qualifications include the use of models and actors for the purpose of authenticity or genuineness, the requirement of emergency personnel to be bilingual, judged on language competency, not national origin. 170 Sex Discrimination y Sexual Harassment a form of sex discrimination y Pregnancy Based Discrimination y Pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions must be treated in the same way as other temporar y illnesses or conditions. y Additional rights are available to pa rents and others under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) enforced by the Department of Labor Sexual Orientation Protected under state law - NRS 613.330 Unlawful employment practices: y Discrimination on basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability or nati onal origin; y Interference with aid or appliance for disability; y Refusal to permit service animal at place of employment.

S ource T arget O pportunity P erson in authority 177 Source T OPThe source of the disrespectful behavior has the responsibility to stop behaving in such a manner. What about US. Are we part of the problem? Have we added to the disrespectful behavior? S Target OPThe target must help - confront the Harassment/harasser! If we are offended by other's actions or words, we need to let them know and ask them to stop. S Target O PConsider this: How can this person correct his or her behavior if he or she is unaware of its impact ?The source of the disrespectful behavior may not even know that his/her behavior is offensive to us . S T Observer PThose who observe disrespectful or harassing behavior have a responsibility to stop it when it occurs; and one who notices such is NEVER an innocent bystander! It is simply the right thing to do . S T O Person in authorityEvery person in auth ority has a duty to keep the workplace free from offensive and harassing behavior. Each person in authority is crucial to creating a respectful workplace. 178 Why People Hesitate in Reporting 1. May be embarrassed and do not want to talk about it 2. They do not want the sexual harasser to get in trouble 3. Some women are told: \"Be a good sport,\" \"Can't you take a joke?\", \"Boys will be boys,\" or \"You have got to expect that in a traditionally male job.\" 4. They fear that if they talk about it, nothing will be done 5. They fear reprisal from the harasser 6. They may be concerned about being labeled 7.

Retaliation There are three essential elements of any retaliation claim: y Protected activity : (i.e., participation in the statutory complaint process or opposition to discrimination); y Adverse employment Action : Demonstrating that the employer's action in question \"well might have dissuaded a reasonable employee from making or supporting a charge of discrimination\"; and y A causal connection between the protected act ivity and the employer's action(s). 180 Burlington Northern v.

The Future of Retaliation Claims - Source: HR Magazine 1/1/2011 Retaliation claims are increasing, so take steps to limit them. Some HR professionals and lawyers pr edicted that the U.S. Supreme Court's 2006 decision in Burling ton Northern v. White, 548 U.S. 53 (2006), would open the floodgates for retaliation charge s and lawsuits. Although cause and effect is hard to determine, the following fact s are undeniable: Through 2009, when the most recent U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission statistics were available, there was a steady increase in retaliatio n charges filed. There was al so an increase in state and federal retaliation lawsuits filed. In its Burlington Northern decision, th e Supreme Court lowered the standard of proof for retaliation claims, making it much easier for employees to prove those kinds of cases. Typically, an employee who engages in an alleged protected activity, such as filing an internal complaint, is subsequently disciplined or treated in an adverse way. The employee will claim that the disciplin e or adverse action was motivated by the protected activity. To succeed, the employee need only show that retaliation was a motivating factor in the employer's later decision. 181 In Burlington Northern, the U.S. Supreme Court expanded the scope of unlawful retaliatory adverse employment ac tions to those viewed by a reasonable person in the employee's position as materi ally adverse but not necessarily ultimate employment actions. Burlington Northern repr esented a significant departure from prior legal consideration as to the required proof in employees' retaliation complaints. This article revisits Burl ington Northern in light of the retaliation cases that followed, and suggests ways to avoid or reduce retaliation claims. Burlington Northern The Burlington Northern case was filed by Sheila White, who worked as a \"track laborer\" for Burlingt on Northern railroad company. Her assignment was to operate a forklift, one of the least physica lly demanding and cleanest job assignments at White's facility. The forklift driver pos ition was considered one of the most desirable jobs. White complained that her supervisor repeatedly made comments that women should not work in his department. Burlingt on Northern investigated White's claim, found that it had merit and suspended her s upervisor for 10 days. The supervisor was required to attend a se xual harassment class. But Burlington Northern's investigation had another consequence. During the investigation, several employees complained that, because they were senior to White, it was unfair that she was given the forklift assignment. Burlington Northern decided that these complaints had merit and reassi gned White, giving he r forklift assignment to a senior male co-worker. White filed a charge with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that she was reassigned in retaliation for complaining about her supervisor. She claimed that sh e was placed under surveillance by her employer. Later, White was accused of bei ng insubordinate to another supervisor and was suspended without pay for 37 days. White filed and won an internal grievance, and received back pay for those 37 days. She filed a second charge with the EEOC about the suspension. White's lawsuit alleged retaliation for the reassignment and the suspension. A jury agreed with White and awarded her $43,500 in compensatory damages. Burlington Northern appealed. The 11th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that White's reassignment was not an adverse emplo yment action that could form the basis for a retaliation claim because White's ti tle and compensation remained the same. When the Supreme Court heard the case, it disagreed, reversed in favor of White and widely expanded the definition of \"adverse employment action\" to include reassignment to a less-desirable job. Rath er than focus on the negative financial impact, courts now must look at whether the alleged adverse employment action is material in that it would dissuade a reason able individual from reporting harassment or discrimination. 182 Subsequent Cases After Burlington Northern, many pred icted that retaliation claims would skyrocket, and they have. In addition, retaliation cases that previously would have ended at summary judgment are now going to juries, who are often sympathetic to employees- especially in this economy. More U. S. courts are holding that job transfers and changes in work assignments can be considered retaliatory adverse employment actions. In fact, a federal court in Michigan has even held that a job transfer that involved a one-time bonus and nominal pay increase was an adverse action because it resulted in less opportunity for advancement and less prestige for the employee (Pitts v. Kone Inc., Case No. 05CV71436 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 16, 2006)). Courts are finding that negative perfor mance evaluations and discipline notices can be considered retaliatory adverse empl oyment actions. This is true when the evaluations are less favorable than previous ones or when they result in denial of a bonus. Even a suspension over turned by a grievance process can constitute an adverse employment action. Other adverse employment actions in cases where employees have avoided summary judgment include threats of losing pa y, benefits or a jo b; investigations that focus on character rather than the co mplaint or harassment; and denial of opportunities for advancement or use of accrued sick leave. But not every employer action that makes an employee unhappy will be considered an adverse employment action by the courts. For example, courts have found that performance improvement plans ar e not, on their own, materially adverse employment actions. Keep in mind that courts in different parts of the country are coming to different results, and it is not ea sy to discern what distinguishes cases that win on summary judgment from cases that go to a jury. It does seem, however, that courts are making an effort to distinguish trivial actions and petty slights from material adve rse actions that would deter a reasonable employee from engaging in protected activity. Several appellate courts, for example, have held that rude comments by supervis ors do not amount to retaliation, even when a supervisor refers to an employee as a \"troublemaker\" for making complaints. Back to the Basics So, in light of Burlington Northern and cases decided in favor of employees since then, what can employers do to prot ect themselves? They can and should be proactive and consider the basics. Most successful retaliation claims result from employers taking so-called \"adverse employm ent actions,\" including terminations and other discipline, without enough due diligence and planning. This may be particularly true when line managers come to you and declare, \"I have had it. I want him fired today.\" Too often, this may be the first time an HR professional has heard about this employee. While there are no silver bullets, there are basic actions that may help 183 avoid or reduce the likelihood of a retaliation charge or lawsuit. When confronted with termination or other discipline of an employee, consider the following steps as part of due diligence: * Implement and follow a zero-tolerance anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation policy. It will inform employees tha t such behaviors are prohibited. * Have a toll-free telephone number fo r complaints. Such a process may allow employees to resolve complaints internally. * Reflect on what discipline to take. Se ldom is it necessary to terminate an employee on the spot. Even when immediate termination is the appropriate sanction, it is recommended that the employee be susp ended pending invest igation subject to discharge. * Recognize employee-protected activity. Knowing what employee behavior is protected, such as filing an internal complaint, and knowing when it occurred, may keep you from retaliating agains t the employee. Retaliatory actions may include job transfers; changes in wo rk assignments; negative performance evaluations; discipline notices; threats of losing pay, benefits or a job; internal investigations; denial of career adva ncement opportunities; and more. * Timing is important. Discipline closel y linked in time to pr otected activity may create a presumption of retaliation. * Listen to the employee's version. Fairne ss requires that you give the employee the opportunity to tell his or her side. Sometimes, motive may be critical in your decision as to what discipline, if any, to administer. * Conduct a complete investigation. Investig ate all leads and interview all relevant witnesses. * Take appropriate action. If a violation is found and discipline warranted, take the action and document it. * Follow up on discrimination and harassme nt complaints. Speak with complainants after the initial investigation to ensure that they feel comfortable in the workplace and do not perceive retaliatio n. Follow up quarterly, at least for a while. * Don't overreact. It is easy to act in haste and based on the facts as they appear at the moment. A suspension pending further investigation allows you time to reflect, in case the facts are n ot as they first appear. * Be consistent. Discrimination and retaliation charges often succeed because employers are inconsistent in following po licies and procedures or adhering to past practice. * Document, but don't over-document. Docume ntation should be timely, thorough and accurate. Sometimes there is a tende ncy to document everything a \"bad\" employee does. Advise your managers to resist the urge. Documentation should be consistent with past practice and the same for all employees. If you use a progressive process, docum ent within that process. 184 * Train supervisors on the basics. Line ma nagers may not remember HR policies and procedures. Revisit them regularly. * Review EEOC guidelines. These guide lines can often provide guidance for particular situations. * Consult with legal support before taking severe disc iplinary action. * Don't retaliate. Enough said. First Line of Defense HR professionals represent the employer's first line of defense to charges and complaints of retaliation. Be proactive and prepare for such cases in advance of the charge or lawsuit being filed. No matter what safeguards you have in place, or how fair your discipline or other processes, certain employees will consider them unfair. Therefore, some employees inevitably will file re taliation charges or lawsuits. That's the price of doing business. Being proactive, considering the basics and conducting due diligence reviews should minimize their number and effect. Most successful retaliation claims result from employers taking adverse employment actions with out enough due dilige nce and planning.

Discrimination. Family leave. Ha rassment ...Federal em ployment laws govern all of these issues - and many more - that you deal with at some point in your career. It's important for supervisors and managers to kno w the basics of how to comply with those laws. Here's a list of the top 10 most important federal employment laws: 1. Job discrimination. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits you from discriminating in hiring, firing or pay based on a person's race, religion, sex or national origin. It also prohibits sexual harassment. (Resource: www.eeoc.gov ) Action: Treat all employees and app licants equally, without regard to their race, religion, gender or any other characteristics not relate d to job performance. Demand the same from anyone you supervise and don't tole rate any kind of harassment. 2. Overtime/minimum wage. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is the nation's main wage law. It sets the fede ral minimum wage (many stat es have higher minimums) and requires time-and-a-half overtime pay for hourl y employees who work more than 40 hours in a workweek. The FLSA also li mits the hours and type of duties that teens can work. (Resource: www.dol.gov/dol/topic/wages ) Action: Always pay employees above the minimum wage and pay ov ertime when applicable. Contact HR when making majo r changes to employees' dutie s, which could make the employee eligible or inelig ible for overtime pay. 3. Family leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act (F MLA) says eligible employees - those with at least a year of service - can take up to 12 weeks pe r year of unpaid, job- protected time off for the birth of a child or adop tion of a child or to ca re for themselves or a sick child, spouse or parent who has a \"ser ious\" health condition. The FMLA applies to organizations with 50 or more employees. (Resource: www.dol.gov/whd/fmla ) Action: When employees request leave, listen fo r requests that would meet the FMLA criteria. Employees don't need to use the word s \"FMLA leave\" to gain protection under the law. Contact HR when hearing such requests. 4. Age discrimination. The Age Discrimination in Em ployment Act says you can't discriminate in any way against applicants or employees older than 40 because of their age. (Resource: www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/age.cfm ) Action: Never take a person's age or proximity to retirement into account when making decisions on hiring, firing, pa y, benefits or promotions. 5. Disability discrimination. The Americans with Disabilitie s Act (ADA) prohibits job discrimination against qualified people with disabilities (i.e., those who can perform the job's essential functions with or without a reasonable accommodation). (Resource: www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/disability.cfm ) 187 Action: Never immediately rej ect applicants because you thi nk their disability would prevent them from doing the job. When hiring, stick to questions about the applicant's ability to perform the job's essential functions; don't ask questions that would re veal an applicant's disability. Work with HR to help create reasonable accommoda tions for disabled employees. 6. Military leave. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) makes it illegal to disc riminate against employees w ho volunteer or are called to military duty. When reservists return from active duty tours of less than five years, you must reemploy them to their old jobs or to equal jobs. (Resource: www.esgr.org/site/USERRA/FAQ.aspx ) Action: Don't challenge a returning reservist's bid to get his old job back; courts typically side with employees in USERRA disputes. 7. Gender-pay differences. The Equal Pay Act (EPA) says employers can't pay female employees less than male employ ees for equal work on jobs that require equal skill, effort and responsibility. (Resource: www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sex.cfm .) Action: Review department pay scales to identi fy possible equal-pay complaints. Different pay for the same job title is fi ne as long as you can point to varying levels of responsibility, duties, skill requirements or education requirements. 8. Workplace safety. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) requ ires employers to run a business free from re cognized hazards. (Resource: www.osha.gov ) Action: Provide a safe work environment for your staff, and point out any noticeable hazards or potential safety problems as soon as possible. 9. Pregnancy discrimination. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) prohibits job discrimination on the basis of \"pregnancy, childbirth and rela ted medical conditions.\" You can't deny a job or promotion merely because an employee is pregna nt or had an abortion. She can't be fired for her condition or forced to go on leave. (Resource: www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/pregnancy.cfm ) Action: Treat pregnant employees the same as other employees on the basis of their ability or inability to work. Example: If you provide li ght duty for an employee who can't lift boxes because of a bad back, you must make sim ilar arrangements for a pregnant employee. 10. Immigration. The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) makes it illegal to hire and employ illegal aliens. Employ ers must verify identificati on and workplace eligibility for all hires by completing I-9 Forms. (Resource: www.uscis.gov ) Action: Managers should note that it's still illegal to discriminate against illegal aliens - via harassment or subminimum pa y - even if the illegal immigrant is hired inadvertently. 188 How to Respond to an EEOC Co mplaint: 10 Steps to Success The EEOC and state and local agencies have been filing more admi nistrative charges in recent years and that trend is likely to continue. Because administrative charges ca n be precursors to discrimina tion lawsuits, it's critical for you to handle them properly. These 10 tips will help you prepare to respond: 1. Tell the whole story Often, an EEOC charge contains just one or two paragraphs, containing little more than conclusory allegations of discrimination. Resist the temptation to put minimal effort into your response. It's usually advisable to provide a compre hensive response, detailing the circumstances surrounding the employment relationship and th e reasons for adverse employment actions. Try to nip the claim in the bud by giving the ag ency all the facts. De monstrate that there were legitimate business reasons for your actions. 2. Use documentation If you have documents supporting your version of events, consider including them in your response. Documentation dating fr om the time of the adverse employment action can be the best way of discrediting the allegations. A ttendance records, sale s reports and e-mail messages can all help prove that events ha ppened as you say they did, and that the company's concerns were bona fide. 3. Verify the response's accuracy Attorneys love catching an empl oyer in a lie. Since the inform ation you submit could be used in later legal proceedings, make sure everyone involved reviews the response and verifies the accuracy of every statement. 4. Highlight consistent past decisions One of the best ways to demonstrate th at a decision was not motivated by unlawful discrimination is to point to the same acti ons being taken against similarly situated employees who are not members of th e charging party's protected class. For example, if the charging party allege s that her termination was motivated by discrimination against women, tell the agency of instances when you te rminated men for the same misconduct. 5. Remember, the agency doesn't know your business In telling your version of the events, share de tails about your business that will help the agency understand your actions. Think about why the charging pa rty's performance concerned you. Would that be read ily apparent to an outsider? For example, if you are legally required to ha ve a certain number of staff on hand at all times, explaining this will emphasize why poor attendance would be a si gnificant problem in your workplace. 189 6. Maintain confidentiality Information about the charge should be on a ne ed-to-know basis, especially if the charging party is still employed. If you know investigators will contact employees , couch your message in terms like this: \"While we do not feel there is a ny merit to the allegations, we respect Employee X's right to bring this charge. If you are contacted by the agency, you should cooperate and be completely honest with the investigator.\" 7. Be prompt and cooperative Don't put off preparing your response. Anti-dis crimination agencies are less inclined to provide extensions than they on ce were. Failure to respond to a charge in a timely way can result in an adve rse determination. 8. Work with legal counsel Because a discrimination charge can be the first step in a chain of legal actions, you must protect your company's interests. Many employ ers ask their attorneys to investigate and prepare the response. At the very least, have an attorney review a draft before you submit it. 9. Contact your insurer Insurance policies require in sured parties to provide pr ompt notice of claims. Many employment-practices liability policies define claims to include di scrimination charges. Failing to apprise the insurer of a charge could result in denial of coverage, not only for the charge but all subsequent legal claims. 10. Preserve all documents Courts are increasingly imposing harsh sanctio ns on companies that fail to adequately preserve relevant evidence. When you receive an administrative charge, collect and preserve all documents that could be re levant. You may also want to suspend any routine practices that might result in the destruction of relevant records, particularly electronic information like e-mails, voice mails and Internet usage records. Final note: Taking the charge process seriously, and de fending against the allegations at this stage can increase the likelihood of a favorable determination a nd help prevent further legal actions. _________________ Author: Carl Crosby Lehmann is an attorney with Gray Plant Mooty's Employment Law Practice Group in Minneapolis.

It gives you the right to obtain information from the em ployee's physician about the me dical condition and, at least for the first certification, to obtain a second or third opinion from an independent physician. Because of the strict limits on what an em ployer may ask an employee, the following steps are important parts of an effective anti-fraud program: 1. Obtain a medical certification for each request for leave due to a serious health condition. It's important that the employer's sick leave or attenda nce policies require a doctor's certification for all abse nces of three or more days fo r the leave to be excused. If there is no such requirement and the employer intends to require paid leave to run concurrent with FMLA leave, the employer might not be able to require a medical certification, which is the first step in the anti-fraud program. 2. Enforce a policy denying the leave request if an employee fails to submit certification within 15 days. In each instance, assess any appropriate penalties for failure to be at work. 3. Examine the certification closely to ensure that it has been properly and fully completed. Many doctors will complete the form in a hurried fashion. In some cases , they'll intentionally leave some sections incomplete in order to remain \"truth ful\" while accommodating the desires of the patient/e mployee for leave. If you're not satisfied with an employee's ce rtification, you may contact the employee's health care provider directly to clarify or authenticate a certifi cation form so long as you first give the employee seven days to cl ear up any deficiencies on the form. Of course, if the medical certification does not support the existence of a serious health condition, the leave request should be denied. 4. Require a second opinion if the circumstances are even s lightly suspicious and it is an original certification. 5. Once the certification is appr oved, make a limited inquiry each time the employee requests more leave, pa rticularly in the case of intermittent leave. Th e goal is to determine whether the leave is for the same qualifying reason. 6. Watch the schedule of absences closely in cases of intermittent leave to determine whether a suspicious pattern develops (e.g., im mediately before and af ter weekends or days off) or whether there is a change in the freq uency or timing. Such actions could suggest a change in condition that enables the employer to request a recertification. Require that employees who take inte rmittent leave follow your normal call- in procedures for reporting an absence, unless there are unusual circumstances. 191 7. Request recertifications as often as the law allows. The frequency of recertification permitted will differ depending on th e type of leave and the type of serious health condition. 8. Require accrued leav e to run concurrently with FMLA leave when allowed by law. When an employee realizes that taking leave today will affect fu ture vacation tim e, he or she is more likely to take FMLA onl y when the need is legitimate. 9. Ask the physician to verify that the medical certif ication is exactly as he or she signed it and has not been altered. 10. Inquire about the intended method of transportation if an employee requests to leave work early because of his or her own serious health condition. If th e employee cannot work, perhaps an ambulance is needed. 11. Aggressively pursue potential fraud and, if strong, concrete evidence of fraud is discovered, take appropriate disciplinary action. Always follow up on reports from fellow employees or other sources that the em ployee does not, in fact, need leave. Following these steps will help eliminate fraud by employees who are inc lined to \"work\" the system. Because of the limitations placed on th e employer, however, determined efforts are unlikely to be detected. Yet even if no fr aud is uncovered, your efforts will still reap dividends. Once employees become aware that you intend to use these tools to detect fraud, many of those otherwise inclined to take inapprop riate advantage of th e FMLA will wait until a legitimate need arises. 192 25 Off-Limits Interview Questions Job interviews present a minefield of lega l problems. One wrong question could spark a discrimination lawsuit. That's why you should never \"wing it\" during interviews. Instead, create a list of interview que stions and make sure every question asks for job-related information that will help in the selection process. Federal and state laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of an applicant's race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age or disability. Some state laws also prohibit discrimination based on factors such as marital status or se xual orientation. If you ask a job applicant a question specifically relating to one of those ch aracteristics, you're subject to being sued. Every question you ask should somehow relate to this central theme: \"How are you qualified to perform the job you are applying for?\" Managers usually land in trouble when they ask for information that's irrelevant to a candidate's ability to do the job. To avoid the appearance of discrimination during interviews, do not ask the following 25 questions: 1. Are you married ? Divorced? 2. If you're single, are you living with anyone? 3. How old are you? 4. Do you have children? If so, how many and how old are they? 5. Do you own or rent your home? 6. What church do you attend? 7. Do you have any debts? 8. Do you belong to any social or political groups? 9. How much and what kinds of insurance do you have? The following questions could result in an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) lawsuit: 10. Do you suffer from an illness or disability? 11. Have you ever had or been tr eated for any of these conditions or diseases? (followed by a checklist) 12. Have you been hosp italized? What for? 13. Have you ever been treated by a psychiatrist or psychologist? 14. Have you had a major illness recently? 15. How many days of work did you miss last year because of illness? 16. Do you have any disabilities or impairments that might affect your performance in this job? 193 17. Are you taking any prescribed drugs? 18. Have you ever been treated fo r drug addiction or alcoholism? Many companies ask female applicants questio ns they don't ask males. Not smart. Here are some questions to avoid with female applicants : 19. Do you plan to get married? 20. Do you intend to start a family? 21. What are your day care plans? 22. Are you comfortabl e supervising men? 23. What would you do if your husband were transferred? 24. Do you think you could perfor m the job as well as a man? 25. Are you likely to take time off under the Family and Medical Leave Act? Final point: If a job candidate reveals information that you're not a llowed to ask, don't pursue the topic further. The \"she brought it up\" excuse won't fly in court, so change the subject right away.
