No other energy source is as abundant as hydrogen. When hydrogen combines with oxygen inside a fuel cell, its only byproducts are water and heat. This makes hydrogen the ideal energy solution for improving air quality and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At Nikola Energy, we are pioneering cost-effective solutions for sustainable hydrogen production and distribution. Our Solutions [ 1 Source ](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-storage) Hydrogen Hydrogen is the ideal energy source for long-distance, heavy commercial transportation. It is lightweight, with nearly three times the energy as diesel1 on a mass basis, yet emits zero carbon. Additionally, we work with several partners to provide the infrastructure that ensures hydrogen fuel is both conveniently accessible and competitively priced.

ENERGY IS OBTAINABLE The challenge with transitioning to clean energy at any scale is about connecting supply with demand in the right location and with the right customers. We have taken on this challenge to provide high-quality zero-emission trucks with access to the refueling source at a cost that is competitive to diesel. To achieve this clean energy state where both sides win, we have developed an innovative, full-service lease program that covers the truck, the fuel, and the service. A COMPLETE SOLUTION Our innovative lease program includes the vehicle, the fuel and service. This full-service operation delivers clean energy at a large scale, all at a cost competitive to diesel. HYDROGEN SOLUTIONS Hydrogen is an eco-friendly element that plays a vital role in sustaining life. No other energy carrier is as abundant, making hydrogen the ideal solution for a zero-emissions world. As an extension of Nikola, [HYLA](https://hyla.co) provides cost-effective hydrogen production, distribution, and dispensing solutions. Powered by hydrogen, the Nikola Tre fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) emits zero carbon, with water being the only byproduct. HYLA's mission is to solve the hydrogen fuel supply challenge to transition the commercial trucking industry to zero-emissions. Production Distribution Dispensing Production Distribution Dispensing ELECTRIC SOLUTIONS Electricity for battery-powered vehicles is available today. However, the ability to charge large batteries for commercial trucks still faces several challenges. Grid capacity, optimal recharging times, and infrastructure for effective operations are examples of complexities that remain. Our solution focuses on consulting you throughout the process and supporting the transition to permanent charging infrastructure with our mobile charging solutions.
