With the progress we have made in going digital, forging closer ties through greater collaboration, and adopting a stakeholder-centric approach, I am confident that HSA is poised to continue growing and reaching greater heights. MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN PROFESSOR BENJAMIN ONG Chairman 09 08CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021/2022 ADAPT, EVOLVE, ADVANCE 11 10We also completed a collaborative study with DSO National Laboratories and Singapore General Hospital on the preparation and use of frozen whole blood derived pooled platelets for transfusion therapy. The frozen platelets are effective in preventing bleeding among patients with very low platelet counts, and have the advantage of a significantly longer shelf life of at least two years. Another significant breakthrough we have made is to validate and optimise the process of removing excess plasma to produce plasma-reduced platelets. Such platelets have proven to be particularly useful for patients who develop allergic reactions from the standard platelets. Our Digital Transformation Strategy In our drive towards greater efficiencies, we continued to embrace digital transformation. Our digital transformation strategy leverages the capabilities of our staff to better serve the different needs of our stakeholders. To ensure HSAians have the right digital mindset, we rolled out various initiatives including digitalisation seminars, digital work tools for knowledge building, and even specialised training programmes for senior staff. We also enhanced our Data Analytics Strategy to enable more effective use of data in developing insights, and decision making in the organisation. Specifically, we appointed Data Champions to drive and initiate strategic data analytics projects across HSA, organised a Data Arcade Tournament (DATx@HSA) to promote the use of data analytics across departments, and onboarded GovTech's Workflow Management System to automate our internal work processes. One of the most important milestones in our digitalisation journey so far is the launch of our Audit Management System (AMS) for Good Distribution Practice (GDP) and retail pharmacy inspections in January 2022. This AMS digitalises GDP and pharmacy audit-related work processes, by using technology to facilitate the entire workflow from inspection scheduling, to communicating with companies on inspection findings, to closing out of inspections. Indeed, such technology enablement has significantly streamlined the inspection processes and improved connectivity with our stakeholders. A Positive Outlook The past year was no doubt intense, but at the same time productive and fulfilling. With the progress we have made in going digital, forging closer ties through greater collaboration, and adopting a stakeholder-centric approach, I am confident that HSA is poised to continue growing and reaching greater heights. This is my first year as Chairman of HSA and I am honoured to be part of the mission to secure public health and safety, especially during this challenging period when Singapore has been busy battling the COVID-19 pandemic. Since I joined the HSA Board in 2020, I have been impressed by HSAians' professionalism and passion in their pursuit of scientific excellence and rigour. Building Strategic Collaborations Recognising the value of partnerships, we have continued to grow our strategic collaborations to enable knowledge exchange between HSA and our counterparts. Building on the Memorandum of Understanding signed with Korea's Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) on Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) for Pharmaceutical Products in 2019, we embarked on a one-year pilot project to establish mutual confidence in each country's GMP inspection regulatory framework. The project was successfully completed in July 2021, paving the way for MFDS and HSA to recognise GMP certificates issued by either side without the need for any additional inspections, thereby enhancing regulatory efficiency. We are now working towards formalising the arrangement through a Mutual Recognition Agreement. Another noteworthy collaboration was with NUS Pharmacy Department to boost our capabilities in detecting designer drugs abuse, such as synthetic cannabinoids. In August 2021, we developed a new testing approach that identifies unique urinary biomarkers to prove consumption of the new synthetic cannabinoids. HSA has also begun trialling an automated e-commerce surveillance tool developed by the Home Team Science and Technology Agency. Using robotic process automation and artificial intelligence to trawl through listings of illegal drugs, health products and cosmetics, as well as unauthorised COVID-19 test kits and vaccines, we have managed to shorten the detection process from weeks to just a matter of hours. Enhancing the Safety of Blood Products through Continuous Research A key focus of HSA is the National Blood Programme, and we are always looking to enhance the safety and quality of our blood products for patients. This year, we have validated the extension of the shelf life of our platelets from five to seven days. This extended shelf life allows us to better manage our platelet inventory, while continuing to ensure the safety and quality of platelets for use in transfusion therapy. 12 13ANNUAL REPORT 2021/2022 ADAPT, EVOLVE, ADVANCE CEO'S MESSAGE Through the many challenges that we have had to face, we have learnt that the world is ever-changing and that we must be agile and adaptable. At HSA, we strive to learn, unlearn and relearn new skills. As we advance, we will continue to hone our professional and scientific expertise, and embrace new digital skills that will enable us to transform to become even more efficient and ready for the journey ahead. MESSAGE FROM THE CEO DR CHOONG MAY LING, MIMI Chief Executive OfficerANNUAL REPORT 2021/2022 ADAPT, EVOLVE, ADVANCE 14CEO'S MESSAGE 15These past two years have been a challenging period - one which continuously tested us but also taught us many valuable lessons. We demonstrated our agility, adaptability and resilience by quickly developing and embracing new working methods. As an organisation, we continued to evolve and advance our transformation journey. Fighting COVID-19 In December 2021, following the first-in-Asia interim authorisation of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines in 2020 and 2021, HSA approved Pfizer-BioNTech's Comirnaty, transiting it to full registration, and extended its use to children aged 5 to 11 years old. We continued to expedite the review of other vaccine types to facilitate the diversification of Singapore's COVID-19 vaccine portfolio, as well as COVID-19 treatments, via the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR). PSAR has allowed us to evaluate data from clinical studies as and when they are ready, allowing for faster, yet thorough reviews. Under PSAR, we were able to grant interim authorisation for two COVID-19 vaccines - CoronaVac and Nuvaxovid in October 2021 and February 2022, two monoclonal antibody therapies for the treatment of COVID-19 (Sotrovimab, and a combination of Casirivimab and Imdevimab), and Singapore's first oral medicine for COVID-19 treatment - PAXLOVIDTM. Additionally, we also put in place the Special Access Route (SAR) in June 2021 to enable healthcare institutions to bring in World Health Organization Emergency Use Listing (WHO-EUL) vaccines, not authorised under PSAR, to vaccinate eligible doctor-supervised patients. As of 31 March 2022, we have approved 521 applications for WHO-EUL vaccines and 47 applications for COVID-19 therapeutics through SAR. To ensure that safety is not compromised, HSA came up with a vaccine safety monitoring framework for COVID-19 vaccines. Our most intensive effort to date, this framework ensures that emerging public health and safety concerns associated with vaccines are promptly detected and managed, and the public are kept informed through regular Safety Update Reports. We also worked with key stakeholders, including the Ministry of Health and the Health Promotion Board, to leverage electronic medical records and the National Immunisation Registry records for the active surveillance of COVID-19 vaccines. With these data points, we were able to detect potential safety concerns more effectively, using data analytics and epidemiology studies. Putting Our Blood Donors First Even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were heartened by the support of warm- hearted donors who continued to altruistically give their time and blood to patients in need. We continued to have enough blood to meet patients' needs throughout the pandemic. To ensure a constant and safe supply of blood, we looked at ways to make it more conducive for donors to donate blood regularly. In September 2021, we launched our first-ever DonateBlood mobile app, which was jointly created with the Singapore Red Cross, to give donors easier access to blood donation-related services anytime and anywhere. To accommodate more donors at our centrally-located Bloodbank@DhobyGhaut (BB@DG), whose daily blood collection has almost doubled since it opened in 2012, we embarked on a renovation project. The new BB@DG features a more spacious donor waiting area and refreshment area for improved donor experience.Developing New and Improved Techniques To enable us to deliver top tier scientific services, we focused on innovation to raise our efficiency. In April 2021, HSA was alerted by overseas regulatory counterparts to the potential of azidomethyl-biphenyl-tetrazole contamination in angiotensin II receptor blocker products. As there were no existing test methods internationally for such analysis, we swiftly moved to develop our own testing methodologies. This initiative enabled our health products regulation arm to take timely and appropriate regulatory actions to safeguard public health. In another example of innovation at work, we developed a novel DNA testing method to detect cannabis plant material to complement existing methods comprising physical examination and chemical analysis. Using this method, we were able to obtain >99% match to known cannabis references, which is particularly useful in identifying highly fragmented cannabis samples. Garnering Recognition for Our Contributions HSA's prompt, proactive facilitation and regulatory agility have enabled Singapore to swiftly roll out essential COVID-19 diagnostic testing and ensure that we are amongst the earliest in the world to access critical vaccines, therapies and medical devices to combat the pandemic. For our efforts, we were awarded a total of three Public Service Transformation awards - two \"One Public Service Awards\" for building capacity and capability for COVID-19 testing and securing access to vaccines; and the \"Agility Award\" for our role in supporting Singapore's fight against COVID-19. I am also extremely proud of HSA achieving WHO's Maturity Level 4 (ML4) - the highest recognition for an advanced medicines regulatory system. HSA is the first agency out of 194 member states to achieve ML4. This achievement comes after a rigorous and comprehensive assessment by a team of WHO-appointed international assessors who looked at over 250 indicators across the entire regulatory lifecycle spanning medicines from clinical trials, marketing authorisation, post-market safety monitoring, audit and licensing of manufacturers and dealers, and laboratory testing of medicines. Over the year-in-review, we put our scientific expertise to good use by participating in a multi-agency study led by the Singapore Civil Defence Force to investigate the cause of vegetation fires along expressway road dividers. Through our two- year study to analyse mulch samples to determine the volatile organic compounds emitted and the particle size of the samples, we managed to help decrease the number of vegetation fires on our expressways, as well as pick up a Ministry of Home Affairs Ops Excellence Award for our efforts. I trust that all these external validations will enhance the Singapore public's confidence and trust in HSA's role to protect and advance public health and safety. Transforming to Advance Through the many challenges that we have had to face, we have learnt that the world is ever-changing and that we must be agile and adaptable. At HSA, we strive to learn, unlearn and relearn new skills. As we advance, we will continue to hone our professional and scientific expertise, and embrace new digital skills that will enable us to transform to become even more efficient and ready for the journey ahead.

HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2021/2022 ADAPT, EVOLVE, ADVANCE 27 26 REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AND REVIEWS We review our regulatory processes regularly to ensure they remain updated and relevant to the latest developments. OUR WORK DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC Interim Authorisation via Pan demic Special Access Route (PSAR) Following the interim authorisation of the first two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in December 2020 and February 2021, HSA continued to expedite the review of other vaccine types to facilitate diversifying Singapore's vaccine portfolio. This included inactivated and protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines, as well as PAXLOVIDTM, Singapore's first oral medicine for COVID-19 treatment. As a condition for interim authorisation under PSAR, companies are required to submit data from ongoing clinical studies for HSA's continual benefit-risk assessment. In December 2021, HSA also approved the New Drug Application by BioNTech Pharmaceuticals Asia Pacific Pte Ltd for the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Comirnaty, to transit from PSAR interim authorisation to full registration. Concurrently, the authorisation of Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine by Pfizer- BioNTech was extended to children of ages 5 to 11 years.Facilitating Access to WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) Vaccines and Therapeutic Products (TP) To facilitate access to WHO EUL vaccines which have not been authorised under the PSAR by HSA, the Special Access Route (SAR) was put in place in June 2021. This SAR allows healthcare institutions to bring in unauthorised vaccines as an alternative to PSAR-authorised vaccines to cater to the needs of their patients. Expediting Clinical Trials We continued to play a critical role in providing early regulatory guidance and following up closely with companies that are developing COVID-19 vaccines in response to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Through prioritising and expediting the review of COVID-19 clinical trials, we helped to bolster Singapore's capabilities to develop vaccines and therapeutics quickly and efficiently to manage the global pandemic.Piloting Remote Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Inspections As COVID-19 safe management measures meant that physical GCP inspections could not be carried out, we successfully piloted and conducted remote virtual GCP inspections in 2021. With the virtual inspections, we were able to ensure that the safety and well-being of trial participants were safeguarded, and that the clinical trial data was monoclonal antibodies therapies for the treatment of COVID-19 (Sotrovimab, combination of Casirivimab and Imdevimab) 1 oral anti-viral medicine (PAXLOVIDTM) OVER THE PAST YEAR, HSA GRANTED INTERIM AUTHORISATION FOR: 52147 applicationsapplications WHO EUL vaccines COVID-19 therapeutics made available throughTo date, HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2021/2022 ADAPT, EVOLVE, ADVANCE 29 28 Facilitating Access to Medical Devices As of 31 March 2022, we granted marketing authorisation for 273 COVID-19 diagnostic test kits. Enhancing Communications to He althcare Professionals and Public Given the speed at which COVID-19 vaccines and treatments are being developed and made available to the public, rapid communication of information on newly authorised COVID-19 vaccines and treatments to healthcare professionals is crucial. Accordingly, HSA has published monthly safety updates on COVID-19 vaccines on our website since April 2021. Rare SAEs identified with the COVID-19 vaccines that have been highlighted in these safety updates include anaphylaxis and myocarditis. Active Safety Monitoring of Vaccines HSA initiated its most intensive vaccine safety monitoring effort to date with an enhanced safety monitoring framework for COVID-19 vaccines. The aim of this exercise was to ensure that any emerging safety concerns associated with vaccines could be detected and managed promptly to protect public health. This in turn ensured that the benefits of vaccines continue to outweigh any known risks. Initiatives that were rolled out under this framework included: Expedit ed reporting of serious adverse events (SAE) by healthcare professionals Consum er self-reporting of adverse events (AE) Appointm ent of clinical experts in the different disciplines neurology, cardiology, rheumatology, haematology and nephrology to adjudicate SAEs of interest received locally We also worked with key stakeholders including the Ministry of Health and the Health Promotion Board to leverage electronic medical records and the National Immunisation Registry records for the active surveillance of COVID-19 vaccines. With these data points, we were able to enhance our detection of potential safety concerns, using data analytics, as well as epidemiology studies. with clinical experts to discuss SAE reports received after vaccinationTo date, HSA has conducted more than 40Our intensive safety monitoring efforts resulted in the implementation of risk mitigation measures such as: 30-minute 2 weeks post-vaccination observation periodand advice toAvoid strenuous activity for Ensuring Regulations Remain Relevant and Responsive To safeguard the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants, the Health Products (Clinical Trials) Regulations was amended in October 2021.

[infographic] To date, e-labelling has been im- plemented for prescrip- tion-only GUIDANCE ON E-LABELLING OF TP s In April 2021, after consultation with industry and healthcare professionals, HSA finalised and implemented the guidance for the e-labelling of approved package inserts and patient information leaflets for prescription-only TPs. E-labelling not only allows for efficient and timely dissemination of the latest approved product information, it is also eco-friendly. Our next step would be to review the feasibility of extending e-labelling to non-prescription TPs. NEW AND UPDATED GUIDELINES To date, e-labelling has been implemented for over Updating of Guidelines for Traditional Medicines (TM) and Heath Supplements (HS) In March 2022, the updated safety, quality, labelling and claims guidelines for TM and HS were finalised and published on our website. These guidelines provide good practices for the industry to level up relevant standards and ensure that the products that companies deal with are of good and consistent quality. The guidelines were published after HSA held discussions with and solicited feedback from industry experts and relevant associations.

The purpose of this process is to allow companies to divert stock from other markets to mitigate potential stock- out situations in Singapore, and to ensure the continued availability of registered TPs. TAPPING ON TECHNOLOGYWe tapped on technology to better serve our stakeholders and improve our efficiency. Medical Device Grouping Tool We launched a new medical device grouping tool in February 2021 for users to quickly and easily ascertain which medical devices can be grouped together for pre-market registration preparation. Grouping allows certain medical devices to be included in a product registration submission to reduce cost and effort. LAUNCHING OF AUDIT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (AMS) We launched the AMS for GDP and retail pharmacy inspections in January 2022. The AMS digitalises GDP and pharmacy audit- related work processes such as arranging for inspections, scheduling and communicating with companies on inspection findings. Inspectors can now use handheld devices to review company information and document findings in the AMS, thereby enhancing the inspection processes and improving our connection with stakeholders. To ensure a smooth transition to the new process, we will continue to monitor the system and engage with stakeholders on a regular basis.

The topics we spoke on included total product lifecycle, international and ASEAN frameworks, as well as post-market and regulatory requirements for next generation sequencing-based IVDs and companion diagnostics. NEW LOCAL PARTNERSHIPSWe are committed to building up our partnerships with local agencies and companies. COLLABORATING WITH HOME TEAM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AGENCY (HTX) ON CONTRABAND PRODUCT SURVEILLANCE In a bid to crack down on contraband products sold online in a more accurate and effective way, and to further safeguard public health, HSA began trialling an automated e-commerce surveillance tool developed by HTX. The use of robotic process automation and artificial intelligence to trawl through listings of illegal drugs, health products and cosmetics, as well as unauthorised COVID-19 test kits and vaccines has shortened the process to a matter of hours, instead of weeks taken previously. The automated process also helped to free up manpower as enforcement officers had to manually sift and analyse one listing at a time prior to this initiative.ENGAGING HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS ON COVID-19 V ACCINE SAFETY SURVEILLANCE In August 2021, we participated in the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore's Continuous Professional Education Session to share on the topic of \"Regulatory Updates on COVID-19 Vaccines in Singapore\", which included HSA's Pandemic Special Access Route and the safety surveillance of COVID-19 vaccines. A total of 351 pharmacists attended and we received positive feedback that participants had benefitted from the session. PUBLISHING OUR ADR NEWS BULLETIN ON AGENCY OF INTEGRATED CARE'S (AIC) WEBSITE In our efforts to ensure effective communication of health products safety information to healthcare professionals, we collaborated with AIC to publish our ADR News Bulletin and relevant AE Guides on their website regularly.

BLOOD SERVICES GROUP We are committed to ensuring the safety and sustainability of the nation's blood supply, and engaging our donors regularly to improve their blood donation experience. BLOOD SERVICES GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2021/2022 ADAPT, EVOLVE, ADVANCE 53 52 PEOPLE AND VALUES We strive to develop, nurture and upskill our people, who are at the heart of the organisation. OPERATION & TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP WORKSHOP From September to November 2021, we collaborated with the NTUC Industry Training & Transformation team to conduct a virtual workshop, titled \"Operation & Technology Roadmap\". In line with our objective to build a sustainable workforce that will be able to support the transformation of our blood supply operations through automation, the workshop focused on instilling in our staff a greater sense of ownership and a better understanding of the need for change. Through this workshop, our staff got the chance to co-create ideas and identify gaps in skillsets, as well as explore new job functions for process automation. The next step will be to roll out a training roadmap to prepare our team to be ready for these newly identified processes. CLINICAL NURSE LEAD PROGRAMME With the implementation of our Clinical Nurse Lead (CNL) programme, qualified staff nurses can now take the lead for blood collection activities at our Bloodbanks. The CNL role not only provides our staff nurses with additional professional development opportunities, but also solves the issue of medical screening personnel shortages. Many of the tasks that could previously only be done by medical screening professionals and doctors, can now be performed by our CNLs. Such tasks include: Medical screening an d medical care at Bloodbanks Clinical asse ssment of donors with adverse reactions Ensuring appropria te management is instituted in accordance with relevant guidelines and standards Counselling o f deferred donors and donors with low haemoglobin levels To ensure the highest standards of donor safety and blood collected, only experienced, knowledgeable and qualified staff who meet the training and competency requirements will be allowed to take on the CNL role. As of Q1 2022, Our eventual goal we have 3 fully trained CNLs To train a total of 6 CNLs BLOOD SERVICES GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2021/2022 ADAPT, EVOLVE, ADVANCE 55 54 Ever since its launch in 2012, Bloodbank@DhobyGhaut's (BB@ DG) average daily blood collection has jumped 87%, from 47 units in 2012 to 90 units in 2021. Last year, BB@DG's collection accounted for 26% of our total blood collection. In response to BB@DG's growth, we embarked on an expansion project to accommodate more donors at the site. Completed in 2022, the new BB@DG features a more spacious donor waiting area and refreshment area for improved donor experience. FOR OUR DONORSWe endeavour to make the blood donation experience comfortable and convenient for our donors. DONOR MOBILE APP In September 2021, HSA launched our first-ever DonateBlood mobile app, which was jointly created with the Singapore Red Cross (SRC). This is part of a series of digital initiatives aimed at making the blood donation process more convenient. The DonateBlood app allows donors to easily access blood donation- related services anytime and anywhere with their mobile phone. Such services include: Donation app ointment Donation his tory (including their milestones, total number of donations) Upda ting their particulars Health As sessment Form Digital Donor C ard Informa tion about blood donation To ensure relevance of the app, HSA and SRC gathered donors' inputs on the user experience via focus group discussion during the app development phase.

This will ensure that they are able to supply compatible blood and blood products to their patients in a timely manner. To assist them with their transition, we conducted on-site training for our private hospital counterparts on how to set-up their crossmatching laboratories. KNOWLEDGE AND INNOVATIONIn our efforts to maintain a best-in-class blood services outfit, we are constantly building our knowledge base and innovating new processes. IMPROVING PATIENT BLOOD MANAGEMENT (PBM) KNOWLEDGE In addition to our regular audits and sharing of good practices on PBM with the public hospitals in Singapore, we came up with a patient information leaflet on PBM. The leaflet contains useful information about PBM as well as strategies to enhance red blood cell production and minimise blood loss. The leaflet also provides advice for patients to discuss with their doctors about PBM, with the aim of optimising their haemoglobin level and reducing transfusion requirements. This brochure has been distributed to all hospitals as well as made available on our website. IMPROVED SAFETY AND ADEQUACY OF BLOOD PRODUCTS In July 2021, we implemented two new initiatives to enhance the safety and adequacy of our blood supply. Health Sciences Authority | Blood Services Group | All rights reserved 1 of 6 AA GGuuiiddee shelf life from five days to seven days Leading up to the implementation, we conducted extensive time-based bacterial contamination detection studies, as well as monitored quality control indicators of both apheresis and whole blood derived pooled platelets to ensure safety and quality of platelets for use in transfusion therapy over the extended seven-day period. This extended shelf life allows us to better manage our platelet inventory, as well as reduce product wastage.Provision of plasma-reduced platelets Plasma is the main media used for storing platelets for transfusion therapy. However, in rare situations, plasma proteins can lead to allergic reactions in patients who cannot tolerate large volumes of plasma. To cater to the needs of such patients, we validated and optimised the process of removing excess plasma from platelet units to produce plasma-reduced platelets. BLOOD SERVICES GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2021/2022 ADAPT, EVOLVE, ADVANCE 59 58CONVERSION OF CELL PROCESSING LAB TO CELL & GENE THERAPY FACILITY To better reflect our current work and direction, the Cell Processing Lab that was built as a prototype in 2006 has been renamed to the Cell & Gene Therapy Facility (CGTF). In addition to the name change, the lab has also undergone infrastructural modifications to incorporate new capabilities, such as viral-related and genetically modified cell manufacturing. Among the reasons for this change was a growing interest and patient demand for the use of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T Cells for relapsed leukaemia and lymphoma. Hospitals needed a facility that could support the piloting of gene modified viral vector work. The launch of CGTF is exciting as it gives us the capability to not only manufacture CAR-T cells locally, but also enables us to translate and scale up other viral vector-based cell therapy works. INFRASTRUCTURAL CHANGES OUR COLLABORATIONSTo enhance efficiency and better synergise our efforts, we made several infrastructural changes. To better serve our stakeholders, we worked with partners on various blood-related clinical trials and studies. INTRODUCING NEW TESTING SERVICE AND METHODOLOGY TO IMPROVE TRANSPLANT OUTCOMES AND TEST TURNAROUND TIME The upcoming introduction of a new testing service - killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) genotyping, will assist clinicians in selecting the most suitable donors for haplo-identical haematopoietic stem cell transplants, thereby improving transplant outcomes when full matched donors are not available. The use of the new real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methodology in human leukocyte antigen (HLA), human platelet antigen (HPA) and KIR genotyping, coupled with an automated analysis software, will significantly reduce the need for manual post-PCR procedures and interpretation of results, thus freeing up man hours and hence improving test turnaround times. V ALIDATION WORK FOR LENTIVIRAL-BASED GENE THERAPY PRODUCTS We collaborated with SCG Cell Therapy Pte Ltd to evaluate and validate the cell therapy manufacturing process for SCG101 - an autologous T-cell receptor (TCR) T cell therapy for patients with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This process is performed in our renovated CGTF in full compliance with current GMP requirements. Our validation results will be able to support globally TCR T cell therapy clinical trials in Singapore and the US, and hopefully improve treatment outcomes for HCC patients.

Currently, platelets are stored in room temperature and have a short shelf life of seven days. Freezing of the platelets can significantly extend its shelf life to at least two years. Through this collaboration, we were able to study the safety and efficacy of the frozen platelets in preventing bleeding among patients with very low platelet counts. PROVISION OF RESIDUAL PLASMA SAMPLES FOR DENGUE SERO-PREV ALENCE STUDY To support blood and public health safety, we collaborated with the National Environment Agency from July to September 2021 to provide de-identified residual plasma samples. These samples came from blood donors who consented to use their residual blood samples for research purposes. This study is conducted periodically to generate information on disease epidemiology and geospatial analysis of dengue immunity. MANUFACTURING OF CD19-DIRECTED AN D DUAL CD22/19-DIRECTED CAR -T CELLS We worked closely with KK Women's and Children's Hospital to produce CD19-directed and dual CD22/19-directed CAR-T cells for children and adult patient trial participants. In line with the newly released Cell, Tissue and Gene Therapy Products (CTGTP) regulatory framework, we ensured that we are in compliance with the new guidelines on GMP for CTGTP for manufacturers. New biosafety procedures to handle viral-related processing, which is carried out in our CGTF, were also drafted. If the trials are successful, it will pave the way for the production of safe and effective locally made CAR-T cell products that can serve as alternatives to other commercial products, and provide access to potential life-saving treatment. 03. APPLIED SCIENCES GROUP We champion innovation, adopt a progressive mindset and develop new capabilities to deliver faster and better solutions. APPLIED SCIENCES GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2021/2022 ADAPT, EVOLVE, ADVANCE 65 64RESPONSIVE ANALYTICAL SUPPORT TO DETECT NITROSAMINE IMPURITY IN ARB PRODUCTS In April 2021, HSA was alerted by overseas regulatory counterparts to the potential contamination of azidomethyl-biphenyl-tetrazole (AZBT) in angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) products. As there were no standard test methods for such analysis available internationally, we swiftly developed our own testing methodologies. With strong commitment from our team, we successfully developed a Liquid Chromatography Q-Exactive Hybrid Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (LC-HRMS) method in two weeks, to determine the amount of AZBT in ARB products. Our responsive analytical support enabled our colleagues in the Health Products Regulation Group to take timely and appropriate regulatory actions to safeguard public health. KNOWLEDGE AND INNOVATIONWe harness scientific knowledge to bring about greater innovation in our work. 38DNA-BASED IDENTIFICATION OF CANNABIS Traditional cannabis identification largely relies on a combination of physical examination and chemical analysis. To complement existing methods particularly for highly fragmented cannabis samples, we developed an innovative DNA testing method for forensic samples suspected to contain cannabis plant material. With our new DNA testing method, we were able to obtain a A total of EXAMINATION OF DIGITAL-FORMAT DOCUMENTS In today's world where digital technology is used widely, it is increasingly common that documents for examination are often available only as soft copies. The limitation of examining soft copies is that some handwriting features such as pen pressure cannot be determined. However, digital files can contain traces of crucial information, such as authorship, and whether data has been manipulated. Recognising the benefits of such examination techniques, we initiated a multidisciplinary approach incorporating digital evidence analysis in handwriting examination as part of our standard practice. This additional information identifying the subject and associated alteration activity will be beneficial for the court.ENHANCING THE INTERPRETATION AND ANALYSIS OF BLOODSTAIN PATTERN THROUGH RESEARCH Bloodstain pattern analysis aims to provide information on the deposition of blood at a crime scene by studying the number, shape, size and distribution of bloodstains. The key to effective bloodstain pattern analysis lies in the classification of bloodstain patterns and understanding how the blood was deposited. In our efforts to develop an established classification criterion, we successfully constructed a device to study the characteristics of downward cast-off and cessation bloodstain patterns, as well as the formation and deposition of blood droplets. Through the subsequent application of statistical methods, we were able to obtain and publish qualitative insights to enhance our interpretation of bloodstain patterns at crime scenes. marketed locally in Singapore were analysed using our in-house developed testing methodology ARB products to known cannabis references from samples tested match >99%APPLIED SCIENCES GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2021/2022 ADAPT, EVOLVE, ADVANCE 67 66AUTOMATING PROCESSES FOR ILLICIT DRUGS ANALYSIS We turned to Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to assist us in the daily autotuning process of all our Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometers (GC-MS) in the laboratory. The use of RPA has enhanced our work efficiency and prevents oversight which can occur during manual verification. Additionally, to enhance users' experience when using the GC-MS, we have also implemented macros that allow users to: Automa te library matching of sample peaks to databases to enhance efficiency of result interpretation Directly display method information on instrumental printouts for traceability Proc ess data from instrument runs and generate PDF printouts of results for interfacing to the Laboratory Information Management System Extract ion chr omatograms to look for trace amounts of commonly searched drugs As a result, it eliminates the need for manual documentation, thereby reducing human errors and improving process productivity. AUTOMATED URINE BOTTLE UNSEALING DEVICE ENHANCING OUR EFFICIENCYWe continue to enhance our efficiency through the improvement and refinement of existing techniques. SEMI-AUTOMATED TOOL FOR QUALITY CONTROL DATA MONITORING To ensure our laboratory processes adhere to the highest standards, we regularly monitor quality control (QC) standards and data. To improve our efficiency, we developed a semi- automated tool to analyse QC data trends and quickly address potential issues before they arise. At the 2021 Annual European Network of Forensic Science Institute (ENFSI) DNA Expert Working Group Meeting, we shared our practices and methods with other international laboratories that were also gearing towards monitoring their QC data.AUTOMATED PROFICIENCY TEST SYSTEM As part of our continual efforts to enhance productivity, we upgraded our manual proficiency test (PT) system into an automated one in 2021. This new e-PT system allows authorised users to create the annual PT masterplan and route for approval with tracked changes, among other functions. The initiative has enhanced work productivity through effective management of PTs and upkeeping of stringent quality standards, in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025:2017 requirements. Annually, we receive approximately urine samples in sealed plastic bottles for testing of controlled drugs20,000 to 22,000 Old Method We needed to manually open the water resistant tamper-proof seal on these urine samples using a cutter, which was both labour intensive and posed a risk for injuries.New Method Working with a commercial company, a custom device was built to automate the unsealing of urine samples. The portable device is made up of a bottle feeder, a conveyor belt, an attached blade and a collection tray. Efficiencies Achieved SAMPLE SAMPLE SAMPLE SAMPLE With this automated device, we can now unseal 90 urine bottles in around 5 minutes, as compared to 20 minutes by hand previously. This has increased our efficiency and more importantly, reduced the risk of injuries when handling the biohazardous specimens.

Early recognition and management of such toxicities is key in minimising complications related to the therapy. In August 2021, our document examiners collaborated with the NUH Department of Paediatrics in a project to help determine if changes in the patterns of handwriting in patients that preceded major seizure events could be a sign of more severe neurotoxicity. OUR LOCAL COLLABORATIONSWe continue to actively collaborate with our local partners on various projects. ASSESSING THE QUALITY AND SAFETY OF COSMETIC PRODUCTS To assess the quality and safety of cosmetic products sold in Singapore, we assisted the Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE) to conduct a heavy metals (lead and cadmium) consumer survey on 30 popular lipsticks sold in physical and e-commerce platforms in May 2021. The results of the survey revealed that the levels of toxic metals in most of the lipsticks sold were generally within regulatory limits, and CASE issued a statement on the findings. DETECTING THE ABUSE OF EMERGING SYNTHETIC CANNABINOIDS To boost the detection of designer drug abuse such as synthetic cannabinoids, we partnered with the NUS Pharmacy Department to develop a new testing approach in August 2021 that employs the concepts of drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics to identify unique urinary biomarkers of new and prevalent synthetic cannabinoids. PLAYING OUR PART IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC In our continued fight against the pandemic, we worked closely with the Coroner's Court and the Singapore Police Force to safely transfer and handle deceased persons who were suspected to have or diagnosed with COVID-19. In line with the roll out of the national COVID-19 vaccination programme, we also assisted with autopsy findings relevant to the investigation of deaths that occurred after COVID-19 vaccinations.

APMP FOCUS GROUP ON FOOD SAFETY PROJECT ON MEASUREMENT CAPABILITIES FOR TOXIC ELEMENTS IN SEAFOOD In May and June 2021, we partnered with the National Institute of Metrology (Thailand) and Government Laboratory (Hong Kong SAR, China) to organise a series of virtual training workshops under the Asia Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP). Joining as speakers and moderators were experts from HSA's Chemical Metrology Laboratory; Thailand Food and Drug Administration; National Measurement Institute, Australia; National Institute of Metrology, China; Government Laboratory, Hong Kong SAR, China; and Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science. As part of the post-training activity, the organisers tested the measurement capabilities of participating institutes for toxic elements in a fish sample. TRAINING SESSIONS FOR ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS In November 2021, we held a virtual training session for Singapore Police Force officers on the preservation and submission of evidence, the laboratory processes, and the interpretation of results. We also shared about our new test services, namely Y-STR testing, mitochondrial testing, and age/ancestry prediction. These key learning points provided attendees with a better understanding of DNA evidence and the role that HSA plays in investigations. In March 2022, we conducted an exhibit processing refresher training programme for Forensic Response Team (FORT) officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau. The programme was specifically tailored to their current work processes and needs, with a special focus on swabbing techniques in exhibit processing, exhibit integrity preservation and contamination prevention. Through this programme, both parties gained a better understanding of the mutual challenges faced, thereby facilitating better support for future casework.PROVIDING OUR EXPERTISE TO THE HONG KONG LABORATORY ACCREDITATION SCHEME (HOKLAS) In March 2022, our scientists from the Illicit Drugs Division and the Analytical Toxicology Division were invited as technical experts to assist in the online reassessment of the Hong Kong Government Laboratory under the HOKLAS. SHARING OUR KNOWLEDGE AT THE ASIAN FORENSIC SCIENCES NETWORK (AFSN) Gaining Insight on Secondary DNA Transfer In recent years, a common question in court trials has been around the likelihood and frequency of secondary DNA transfers; whereby a person's DNA is transferred onto an object through an intermediate object or person. During the AFSN DNA Workgroup meeting, we delivered a presentation on factors associated with such transfers. These findings would allow fellow scientists from the region to gain more insight on secondary transfers. Workshop on Forensic Analysis of P aint As part of the AFSN symposium, we conducted a workshop titled \"Forensic Analysis of Paint Evidence\". Our key objective was to share about common practices in forensic paint examination and the challenges in the interpretation of paint evidence. Through our sharing, participants were equipped with the requisite knowledge on how to make an informed decision when selecting methods for paint examination. Analysis of Explosives Another session that we hosted at the AFSN symposium was on the challenges faced by regional forensic scientists in analysing explosives. We touched on the difficulties of analysis brought about by the sheer diversity of explosive types, as well as which techniques were the most suitable for analysing each explosive type.
