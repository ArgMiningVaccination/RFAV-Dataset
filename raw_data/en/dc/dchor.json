A growing number of pioneering researchers embrace a new view of healing\u2014one expounded by Dr. Richard Gerber in his groundbreaking bestseller, Vibrational Medicine. Now he shows how to put this new way of thinking into practical use, describing the role of consciousness and \"thought forms,\" as well as the benefits of homeopathy, acupuncture, color and light healing, magneto biology, and other therapies. A traditionally trained physician, Dr. Gerber combines scientific evidence with traditional methods from the East and West to unlock our potential for healing ourselves. Richard Gerber has spent nearly as much of his adult life studying as working, in fields as diverse as computer programming and knowledge management. His first written work was an engineering text book titled 'New Connections', published by the University of Cape Town Press. In 1987 he and his wife moved to Switzerland, where first hand experiences in the Swiss-German culture inspired this novel. Widely travelled and an avid adventurer, he loves to bungie jump and has a keen interest in 60's rock. Despite degrees in Physics and Electrical Engineering, as well as an MBA, he made the transition to creative writing and published his first novel 'Summers Past' on Amazon Kindle. Richard Gerber lives in Berne Switzerland but loves to holiday in Cape Town. WONDERFUL, simple to read and better yet simple to explain. People always ask how Reiki works and I'm always on an ongoing quest to be able to explain it better, although really all you need to know is that it chills you out and makes you feel better. But if you want to know why on a cellular level, this book explores deeply the energetic and electrical connections that exist within our biological systems and takes a look at total wellbeing from the holistic angle of mind/body/spirit balance. The best thing you can do for your own health is to be aware of how your body works on a simple level, of how your emotions actually effect you physically, how your body feels when you are \"well\" and what kinds of things YOU can personally do to keep yourself well..... The current field of western medicine is so focused on \"fixing\" biomechanical problems with drugs and surgeries, and it's also the biggest for-profit industry (and the #1 cause of bankruptcy!!!) in the USA right now. However what makes the most $$$ (\"take this drug for the rest of your life\") is not necessarily what is best for the patient! It will be interesting to see how our healthcare system changes as the political climate changes, but in the meantime the only thing I want from the US medical system is to stay the heck out of it!!!! A really interesting book that confirms that most ailments originate from the mind and spirit. I have practiced Homeopathy for many years with some outstanding healings witnessed as well as in Spiritual Healing. This book gives a scientific explanation of these unseen forces available for us to use. It's one of these rare books that you go... wow! One of these rare books that are so skillfully written, with so much information, perfectly organized and sincerely presented. It was absolutely a magnificent read! Thoroughly presented and in a simple language the author takes us through a metaphysical - spiritual - energetic - holistic journey on healing. In this book we read about the various aspects of vibrational healing, how they started, their development in time and the people and schools of thought behind those healing systems that continued to practice and teach. Certainly a major reference book for my own healing journey as a healer. Read for an overview of the new paradigm in medicine: the human system as an energy system (aka vibrational medicine), connecting the mind-body-spirit-energy matrix together. This is a basically a summary of all of alternative medicine, for a lay audience. Sometimes got too specific (since Richard focuses on what to do when you're going to the doctor), but for a non-doctor type, this is the best overview of alternative medicine I've found so far. I'd love to see him update this book, add pictures, and use better quality paper. The info is superb. If you're looking for validation for the stuff you intuitively know, Gerber's getting it out there. While I am grateful to modern medicine for providing wonderful life-saving techniques, I am also interested alternative approaches to overall health and wellness. This book talks about the innate energy that exists in all living things. "}
