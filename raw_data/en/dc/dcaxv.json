Around 85% of those we're seeing in the hospital are unvaccinated. Even if an individual does contract COVID, if they are vaccinated, they will experience much more manageable symptoms. Masking People should continue masking indoors, even if they are vaccinated, for a number of reasons. First, masking can decrease community spread. It can also protect others if a person has been exposed and not yet been tested for the virus. And finally, masking can protect others in the home who might be at particularly high risk for severe COVID. Pregnancy and vaccination The COVID vaccine is safe for [pregnant women](/blog/covid-19-vaccine-guidance-pregnancy) and strongly recommended. Expecting mothers are at a much higher risk of severe COVID compared to other women, so they need that protection. If the mother is vaccinated, she can also provide immunity to her newborn through breastfeeding. Information There are so many misperceptions and bad information out there. I would encourage everyone to analyze the content and sources they get information from and have a healthy skepticism about what they're reading. Think about the intent of the author or source. Reputable sites include [parkview.com](https://www.parkview.com/patients-visitors/covid-19) the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) (CDC), [familydoctor.org](https://familydoctor.org/) and the [State Department of Health](https://www.in.gov/health/). Again, COVID vaccines are safe and effective at preventing severe disease. If you have questions, speak with your healthcare provider. "}
