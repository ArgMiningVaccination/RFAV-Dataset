It aims to restore balance to your overall health. Behind homeopathy is the belief that symptoms of a disease can be treated by a very small dose of a substance, which in a healthy person, would bring on the same symptoms. A little goes a long way Homeopathic remedies are often made from plant extracts. They may also be made from minerals or substances derived from animals. If given at full strength to a healthy person, these remedies could cause symptoms. But they're prepared in a special way that involves extreme diluting. This means that they're thinned with water or some other liquid. Once the remedy is mixed and prepared, the active substance often can't be detected. And the amount of the substance in the remedy is also too small to cause side effects. Homeopathy is thought to create a healthful balance within the body. It is also thought to unlock the body's natural power to heal itself. Some homeopaths give one remedy at a time. This is called the constitutional or classical approach. Other homeopaths give many remedies at once. This is known as the combination approach. Questions for the homeopath Before you decide whether to have treatment, talk with a homeopath.
