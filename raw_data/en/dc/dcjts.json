Eating certain foods are also important during times of change, times of awakening and times of high emotional stress. As your vibration level moves up in frequency, it can cause your energy to feel displaced, shaky or even unstable. You may even start experiencing bodily sensations, vivid dreams or feel sensitive towards others. During this time, it is important that you nourish your body with foods that are going to not only support you through this process but also support your pineal gland. The pineal gland is the \"seat of consciousness\" and is often referred to as the third eye. It is responsible for our dreams, visions and being able to connect us with our higher purpose or source energy. The Pineal Gland has other functions in the body too, however from a more spiritual or esoteric approach, the pineal glad is truly how we awaken into our own consciousness and raise our vibration. If you are looking to support or enhance your intuition, refocus your energy or need some help with ascension symptoms, here are 5 foods that will help support you: 1. Cold pressed Extra Virgin Olive or Coconut Oil Healthy fats like those found in olive and coconut oil not only support brain and nervous system function but they also help us to expand our intuition. Often when you first come into your awakening, you may feel anxious or even depressed as you try to adjust to the changes. Eating a diet rich in these fats can help to calm you and keep you balanced through the process. These fats are also stabilising and will help you to connect with Mother Earth. They can also increase your intuitive connection with nature. 2. Raw Cacao Cacao is not only high in nutrients and antioxidants but it is also believed to help support the functioning of the pineal gland and enhance your intuition.

Water Staying hydrated is always important, but during times of ascension it is crucial. Water helps you to detox negative energy and emotions out of your body and also helps to clear toxins.
