ASD affects how the brain develops and creates numerous challenges that affect social skills, interaction and communication. Autism has risen steadily over the past few decades. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that about one in 68 children in the U.S. has this disorder. This increase is due in part to greater awareness of ASD and also how it is diagnosed. It's not clear what causes ASD. Most scientists agree that it has more than one cause and both genes and environment play a role. Although there are claims that vaccines can cause ASD, no scientific studies have linked ASD and vaccines. Symptoms, Diagnosis and Outlook People with ASD have trouble with social interactions and communication. Their interests may be minimal. They may also show repeated patterns of behavior and activities. ASD symptoms often start in early childhood, but may also appear later. For example: - Children with severe ASD may be diagnosed as early as 12 to 18 months of age. - Children with milder ASD may not show major symptoms until early in their teen years. - Some people with ASD are not diagnosed until they are adults. They have often been diagnosed with other mental health conditions first. Common symptoms include: - A sing-song or flat tone of voice - A tendency to avoid or ignore other people - Difficulty following or participating in a conversation with others - Excessive talking about different subjects without the ability to gauge interest levels in others - Facial expressions, gestures and movements that don't correspond to what's being said - Inconsistent or infrequent eye contact - Making unusual movements, including arm flapping, rocking from side to side and or twirling Autism is typically diagnosed based on its signs and symptoms. A multidisciplinary team will conduct a neurological, language and cognitive assessment to evaluate your child for ASD. People with autism can lead active, full lives. For many, symptoms improve with age and treatment. Experts in Care Meet our doctors, view their profiles and select the one that's right for you.
