Objective: To evaluate whether the MMR vaccine increases the riskforautisminchildren,subgroupsofchildren,ortimeperiodsafter vaccination. Design: Nationwide cohort study. Setting: Denmark. Participants: 657461 children born in Denmark from 1999 through 31 December 2010, with follow-up from 1 year of ageand through 31 August 2013. Measurements: Danish population registries were used to link information on MMR vaccination, autism diagnoses, other child-hoodvaccines,siblinghistoryofautism,andautismriskfactorstochildren in the cohort. Survival analysis of the time to autism di-agnosis with Cox proportional hazards regression was used toestimate hazard ratios of autism according to MMR vaccinationstatus, with adjustment for age, birth year, sex, other childhoodvaccines, sibling history of autism, and autism risk factors (basedon a disease risk score).Results: During 5025754 person-years of follow-up, 6517 chil- dren were with rate, per100000 person-years). Comparing MMR-vaccinated with MMR-unvaccinatedchildrenyieldedafullyadjustedautismhazardratioof0.93 (95% CI, 1.02). Similarly, no increased risk for autismafter MMR vaccination was consistently observed in subgroups ofchildren dened according to sibling history of autism, autism riskfactors (based on a disease risk score) or other childhood vaccina-tions, or during specied time periods after vaccination. Limitation: No individual medical charts were reviewed. Conclusion: The study strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism insusceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of au-tism cases after vaccination. It adds to previous studies throughsignicant additional statistical power and by addressing hy-potheses of susceptible subgroups and clustering of cases.

The hypothesized link between the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism continues to cause concern and challenge vaccine acceptance almost 2 de-cades after the controversial and later retracted Lancet paper from 1998 (1), even though observational studieshavenotbeenabletoidentifyanincreasedriskforautismafter MMR vaccination. In a 2014 meta-analysis, 10 obser- vational studies on childhood vaccines were identied: 5cohort studies and 5 case-control studies (2). Of these, 2cohort studies and 4 case-control studies specically ad-dressed MMR and autism, all reporting no association.This is consistent with more recent studies of note (3, 4). We previously addressed this issue in a nationwide cohort study of 537 303 Danish children with 738 casesof autism spectrum disorders (5). In our cohort, MMRvaccination was not associated with autistic disorder(rate ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.68 to 1.24]) or disorders (rate ratio, 0.83 [CI, 0.65 to 1.07]). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association again in a more recent and nonoverlapping cohort ofDanish children that has greater statistical power owingto more children, more cases, and longer follow-up. Acriticism of our and other previous observational studieshas been that these did not address the concern thatMMR vaccination could trigger autism in specic groupsof presumably susceptible children, in contrast to all chil-dren (6); the current study addresses this concern in de-tail. We evaluate the risk for autism after MMR vaccinationin subgroups of children dened according to environ-mental and familial autism risk factors. Another criticismhasbeenthatMMRisassociatedwitharegressiveformof autism, leading to a clustering of cases with onset shortlyafter MMR vaccination (7). We evaluate the risk for autismafter MMR vaccination in specic periods in detail. METHODS Ethical approval is not needed for register-based research in Denmark. The Danish Data Protection Agencyapproved the study. Cohort We conducted a nationwide cohort study of all children born in Denmark of Danish-born mothers from1 January 1999 through 31 December 2010. We sourcedthe study cohort from the Danish Civil Registration Sys-tem, which assigns a unique personal identication num-ber to all people living in Denmark and keeps track ofbasic demographic information for each individual (8).Thisuniqueidentierisusedinallothernationalregistriesandallowsforindividual-levellinkageofhealth-relatedin-formation, including vaccinations and autism diagnoses.

The mainstays of the early part ofthe Danish program are MMR and a diphtheria, tetanus,acellular pertussis, inactivated polio, and Haemophilus in- fluenzae type b (DTaP-IPV/Hib) combination. A rst dose of MMR vaccine is offered at 15 months (MMR1), with asecond dose (MMR2) at 12 years of age or, since 2008, at4 years of age. The DTaP-IPV/Hib vaccine is offered in 3dosesat3,5,and12months.Boostersareofferedlaterinchildhood. General practitioners administer all childhoodvaccinations and are reimbursed when reporting these tothe National Board of Health; these reports are includedin the Danish National Health Service Register (9). We obtained individual-level information on MMR1 and MMR2 vaccinations and other childhood vaccina-tionsadministeredintherstyearoflife.Therewerenothimerosal-containing vaccines in the Danish programduring the study period. The specic MMR vaccine usedin the study period contained the following Information on autism spectrum disorder diagno- ses in the study period was obtained from the DanishPsychiatric Central Register (10). Child psychiatrists di-agnose and assign diagnostic codes for this register,which contains information from psychiatric hospitalsand psychiatric wards (inpatients and outpatients in thestudy period). The coding classication used in the studyperiod was the International Classication of Diseases,10thRevision;weusedthecodesF84.0(autisticdisorder),F84.1(atypicalautism),F84.5(Aspergersyndrome),F84.8(other pervasive developmental disorder), and F84.9 (un-speciedpervasivedevelopmentaldisorder).Wedenedourmainstudyoutcomeofautismasadiagnosisofanyofthese autism spectrum disorders. From the Danish National Patient Register compris- ing diagnoses from all somatic departments, we ob-tained information on several syndromes and condi-tions with an inherent increased risk for autism (fragileX syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, Angelman syndrome, congenital rubellasyndrome) (11). Children with any of these conditionswere excluded from the study if the condition was di-agnosed before their rst birthday or censored at dateofthediagnosisifitwasmadewhenthechildwasolderthan 1 year (14). Autism Risk Factors We included many autism risk factors for stratica- tion and confounder adjustment, on the basis of a liter-ature review on environmental autism risk factors andavailability of data in our registers (12); these were ma-ternal age, paternal age, smoking during pregnancy,method of delivery, preterm birth, 5-minute Apgarscore, low birthweight, and head circumference. Forvariables with missing values, we included a missingvalue category in the analyses. Table 1 of the Supple-ment(available at Annals.org) provides a complete list of variables with categorizations). These variables wereobtained from the Danish Medical Birth Registry, whichincludes information on the parents and the newborn,pregnancy, date of birth, multiple births, gestationalage, and vital status and other physical characteristicsof the newborn (13). From the Danish Civil Registration System, we ob- tained parental links to identify siblings (dened ascommon father and mother) for each cohort child.Cases of autism among siblings were identied simi-larly to the main study outcome. Statistical Analysis The main goal of our modeling strategy was to evaluate whether the MMR vaccine increases the riskfor autism in children, subgroups of children, and timeperiods after vaccination. We dened subgroups ac-cording to 1) sibling history of autism (\"genetic suscep-tibility\"), sex, birth cohort, and prior vaccinations in therst year of life and 2) a summary index estimated fromadiseaseriskmodelcombiningmultipleenvironmentalrisk factors. The motivation for a summary index wasthat the combination of several factors each associatedwith only a moderate risk increase in autism had thepotential of identifying children at higher risk throughmultiple risk factors, in contrast to many stratied anal-yses of single moderate risk factors. We analyzed the study cohort by using survival anal- ysis (14). Children in the cohort contributed person-timeto follow-up from 1 year of age and until a rst diagnosis of autism, death, emigration, unexplained disappearancefrom the source registers, diagnoses of autism-associatedconditions or syndromes, or end of the study on 31August 2013. TheMMRvaccinationstatuswasconsideredatime- varying variable; children could contribute time as bothunvaccinated and vaccinated in our study. Using thecases of autism among siblings, we constructed a time-varying variable summarizing each child's sibling his-tory of states \"no siblings,\" autism,\" or \"siblings with at least one case ofautism\"; a missing value category covered the childrenwho had unknown fathers. We used sibling history atstudy entry unless otherwise specied. In a preliminary analysis based on maternal age, paternal age, smoking during pregnancy, method ofdelivery, preterm birth, 5-minute Apgar score, lowbirthweight, and head circumference, we estimated adisease risk score (15) (termed \"autism risk score\"throughout)foreachchildinthecohort.Theautismriskscore was derived in the complete study cohort by t-ting a proportional hazards model of autism risk withattained age as underlying time-scale comprising thepreselected variables as covariates. For each child, ascore (in the form of a hazard ratio [HR] relative to achild with reference values for all variables included)was calculated as the exponential of the sum of theestimated regression coefcients corresponding to thecharacteristics of the child. The score was categorizedaccording to deciles which were combined into 4 risk ORIGINAL RESEARCH Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccination and Autism 514 Annals of Internal Medicine Vol. 170 No. 8 16 April 2019 Annals.org Downloaded from https://annals.org by Mayo Clinic on 02/03/2021.groups: very low (rst to third decile), low (fourth to sixth decile), moderate (seventh to ninth decile), orhigh (10th decile). Survival times were then analyzed by using Cox re- gression with attained age as underlying time scale,producingHRsaccordingtovaccinationstatus.Forfullyadjusted models, the baseline hazard function wasstratied on birth year, sex, other childhood vaccinesreceived, sibling history of autism and autism risk score(in deciles). We evaluated the proportional hazards as-sumption of the main analysis by a joint test of homo-geneity allowing the effect of vaccination to vary be-tween the age intervals 1 to 3 years, 3 to 5 years, 5 to 7years, 7 to 10 years, and more than 10 years (16). WeestimatedautismHRs(aHRs)accordingtoMMR vaccination status (yes or no), overall in the cohort andin several subanalyses: 4 analyses, each restricting risktime to young children by censoring observed survivaltimes at 3, 5, 7, or 10 years of age; in subgroups char-acterized by sex, birth cohort, other childhood vaccinesreceived, autism risk score, or autism history in siblings(joint tests for homogeneity of aHRs between levels ofeach factor were carried out [16]); and in specic peri-ods after vaccination (comparing the hazard rates ofautism in the rst, second, third, and fourth year aftervaccination and more than 4 years after vaccination, re-spectively, with the rate among unvaccinated children.A test for homogeneity of aHRs between intervals wasconducted using a type 3 test (16). We conducted several sensitivity analyses. To in- crease the validity of our autism case denition further,we conducted a main analysis with a case denitionrequiring at least 2 autism diagnosis registrations; anevent was dened at date of second autism diagnosis.We evaluated specic autism phenotypes by conduct-ing main analyses of autistic disorder and other autismspectrum disorder separately (with right censoring ofother autism spectrum disorder when analyzing autisticdisorder and vice versa). We conducted a dose-dependent fully adjusted analysis taking the secondMMR dose into account by estimating the increase inHR per vaccination. Instead of adjusting for birth year,sex, other childhood vaccines received, sibling historyof autism, and autism risk score by stratication of thebaseline hazard, we included these as covariates. Fi-nally, we replaced the autism risk score of the previousmodel with the 8 variables on which it was based. Crude associations between variables included in the analyses and autism were estimated in proportionalhazards models with attained age as underlying time-scale and autism as outcome, including only the spe-cic variable of interest as a covariate. Data management and statistical analyses were conducted by using SAS, version 9.4; the gures were created by using R, version 3.5.1. All Cox regressionswerettedbyusingtheSASPHREGprocedurewiththeBreslow option for handling ties. Cumulative risks werecalculated from the Kaplan-Meier estimates using thesurvt function in R with the log-log option for con-dence limits.Role of the Funding Source The study was supported by a grant from the Novo Nordisk Foundation and the Danish Ministry of Health.The funder of the study had no role in study design,data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, orwriting of the report.

Thenumber of children and autism cases in the study ac-cording to age and vaccination status are presented inFigure 1 of the Supplement (available at Annals.org). The mean attained age in the study was 8.64 years (SD, 3.48). The rst autism-related diagnoses pervasive developmental disor- der ( n= 2309). The mean age at rst autism diagnosis was 7.22 years (SD, 2.86), and the mean age amongautistic disorder cases was 6.17 years (SD, 2.65). Up-take of the MMR1 vaccine was 95.19%, with a medianage at vaccination of 1.34 years (interquartile range,0.24 years). There were no appreciable differences invaccine uptake according to sex, birth cohort, autismrisk score, or autism history in siblings; MMR vaccina-tions were more common among children previouslyvaccinated in early childhood ( Table).

Cumulative incidences of autism accordingto age and MMR vaccination status, stratied by sex andsibling history, are presented in Figure 2 of the Supple- ment(available at Annals.org). Cumulative incidences of autism according to age stratied on autism risk scoregroups are presented in Figure 3 of the Supplement (available at Annals.org). The crude effect sizes of sex, birth cohort, other early childhood vaccinations, sibling history of autism,and autism risk score are presented in Tables 2 and 3 of the Supplement (available at Annals.org). The high- est risk for autism was conferred by being a boy (HR,4.02 [CI, 3.78 to 4.28]), being born in a late birth cohort(2008-2010; HR, 1.34 [CI, 1.18 to 1.52]), having (HR, 1.17 [CI, 0.98 to 1.38]), andhaving siblings with autism at study entry (HR, 7.32 [CI,5.29 to 10.12]). The autism risk score had a modesteffect on autism risk compared with sex and sibling his- tory of autism (highest-risk group versus moderate-riskgroup; HR, 1.38 [CI, 1.28 to 1.48]). We evaluated HRs in 1-year risk periods after MMR vaccination; we identied no period after MMR vacci-nation with an increased aHR ( Figure 3 ). The analysis requiring at least 2 autism diagnosis registrations for case ascertainment resulted in similarresults as the main analysis (aHR, 0.99 [CI, 0.88 to1.11]). Using autistic disorder cases or other autismspectrum cases only resulted in aHRs of 0.96 (CI, 0.81to 1.13) and 0.91 (CI, 0.82 to 1.02), respectively. In ananalysis taking the second MMR dose into account,there was no evidence of a dose-response (increase inaHR per 0.90 confounders as covariates instead of strat-ication of the baseline hazard function did not affectthe result (aHR, 0.93 [CI, 0.84 to 1.02]). Replacing theautism risk score with the individual covariates used toestimate it in the above model yielded an aHR of 0.94(CI, 0.85 to 1.03). Figure 2.

We previously addressed this issue in a similar but nonoverlapping nationwide cohort study of 537 303Danish children (5). Reassuringly, the main results aresimilar between the 2 studies, which supports the inter-nal and external validity of both. The major differencebetween our studies is a signicant increase in statisti-cal power and additional susceptible subgroup and clustering analyses. In a 2014 meta-analysis of MMR vac-cination and autism studies, 2 cohort and 4 case-controlstudieswereidentiedfromDenmark(5),Poland(17),Ja-pan (4, 18), the United Kingdom (19), and the UnitedStates (20), with no support for an association\u2014for exam-ple, a pooled odds ratio from cohort studies of 0.84 (CI,0.70 to 1.01) (2). A concern about observational studies is that they do not often take into account the possibility of MMRvaccination triggering autism in susceptible subgroups of children. The large number of cases in our studyallowedustodenesubgroupswithsufcientstatisticalpower for useful inference. Specic denitions of sus-ceptible subgroups have lacking. We denedFigure 3.

We are only aware of 1 previousstudy taking a similar approach: A U.S. study by Jainand colleagues (3) evaluated the association betweenMMR and autism according to sibling history of autism.Those researchers found no support for an associationin children with a sibling history of autism, but identi-ed lower MMR uptake rates in children with affectedsiblings, a potentially important public health issue withincreasing autism prevalence and supported by otherstudies (21). Another frequent criticism of observational studies of MMR vaccination and autism is a perceived failure totake into account the existence of specic autism phe-notypes associated with vaccination, such as regressiveautism. Our analysis of specic time periods after vac-cination does not support a regressive phenotype trig-gered by vaccination with excessive clustering of casesin the subsequent period, and no other studies havebeen able to substantiate the existence of this pheno-type (22). A general criticism of observational vaccine effect studies is that they do not include a completely unvac-cinated group of children (23). The number of childrencompletely unvaccinated throughout childhood will below in a country such as Denmark. We evaluated theassociation between MMR and autism in children withno DTaP-IPV/Hib vaccinations in the rst year of life; wefound no support for an association in this vaccine- naive subpopulation. Our study has several strengths. Comprising 6517 cases, it is by far the largest single study to date andaddssignicantlytoourknowledgeontheissue,inthatit allows us to conclude from one study that even min-ute increases in autism risk after MMR vaccination areunlikely, assuming unbiased results. We evaluated thehypothesis in an unselected setting with a nationwidecohort from an ethnically and socioeconomically ho-mogenous population. We obtained independent andprospectively collected information on vaccination andautism from nationwide health registries with manda-tory reporting reducing concern about ascertainmentand recall bias. We included information on a range ofenvironmental and familial risk factors, which allowedus to consider their potential confounding effect. We obtained autism cases from the Danish Psychi- atric Central Register, which has previously been usedextensively for autism research in Denmark. This regis-ter has a high degree of validity; an earlier medical re-cord review revealed a positive predictive value of92.5%(5),andourstudyprevalenceof1.0%issimilartothat found in other studies (24) and the estimated gen-eral U.S. prevalence of 1.5% (25). A limitation of our study is that we used date of rst diagnosis of autism, which is probably delayed com-pared with the age at onset of symptoms. This can be asource of information bias\u2014for example, in the casewhere symptoms precede vaccination and diagnosisoccurs after vaccination. This will result in misclassica-tion of autism cases as vaccinated, biasing the hazardratio toward an effect. If onset of symptoms results inavoidance of vaccination, or conversely if symptoms in- crease the probability of vaccination through increasedhealth care utilization, bias in either direction is possi-ble. During the study period, the measles strain in thevaccine changed in 2008 from Schwarz to Ender's Ed-monton. However, birth cohort-specic HRs were ho-mogeneous, suggesting that the change in composi-tion had no effect on autism risk. Measles outbreaks are not uncommon in Europe and in the United States, and vaccine hesitancy oravoidance has been identied as a major cause (26). Ina mathematical modeling study, U.S. researchers con-cluded that even a 5% reduction in vaccination cover-age would triple measles cases, with signicant healtheconomic costs (27). A main reason that parents avoidor are concerned about childhood vaccinations hasbeen the perceived link to autism (28). Our study addsto previous studies through signicant additional statis-tical power and by addressing hypotheses of suscepti-ble subgroups and clustering of cases. We believe thatour results offer reassurance and provide reliable dataon which clinicians and health authorities can base de-cisions and public health policies. In conclusion, our study does not support that MMR vaccination increases the risk for autism, triggersautism in susceptible children, or is associated withclustering of autism cases after vaccination.
