Nutritional Supplements and Chiropractic Here at Health From Within, chiropractic nutritional supplements help to enhance the work we do and the many home use interventions we prescribe. Increasing circulation to treated areas by adjustments, massage, and custom exercise plans help ensure that an adequate supply of nutrients and oxygen gets to the tissues. If the nutrients aren't of sufficient quantity or of high quality, improving nutrient flow won't do any good. One of our least favorite aspects of living in this country is the American diet. Depleted of nutrients, convenience and fast foods serve no health purposes so our patients need adequate vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients from high-quality nutritional supplements from chiropractors. The objective tests that we perform to gauge results are one of the most exciting aspects of our practice. Determining the levels of various vitamins and other supplements in the blood through blood tests is one example of these tests. Wound healing and immune function are positive changes we can see in our patients with these tests as they allow us to correct deficiencies and monitor levels of supplements. Common Nutritional Supplements From Chiropractors The nutritional supplements our chiropractors recommend will vary since individual health needs can vary greatly. From our experience, there are certain supplements that we commonly prescribe because of their effect on overall health which include: Probiotics Calcium Multivitamin, vitamin C and vitamin D Omega-3 fatty acids The Holistic Approach A holistic approach that empowers the whole person is achieved with nutritional supplements. Our patients at Health From Within can see the role that daily self-care plays in improving their own health through strategic supplementation. This is a great chance to take advantage of the complete power of potent phytochemicals and other nutrients. Nutritional Supplement Benefits There are many benefits of prescribing nutritional supplements from chiropractors. Our patients can reap some of these rewards from taking our most popular prescribed supplements as discussed in the next section. Probiotics Supplements can help ensure consistent probiotic consumption rather than just eating yogurt and drinking kefir. Reduced inflammation and enhanced immune functions are ways that the good bacteria in probiotics can help. Complete digestion of foods improved absorption of medications, and reduced illness from harmful bacteria are some benefits of this supplement. Multivitamins A type of insurance policy against the typical American diet are multivitamins. Gaps in nutrition can still occur even when our patients do their best to follow nutritional recommendations. Our patients can get an adequate supply of essential vitamins and minerals with a complete multivitamin. Vitamin C Reducing the risk of cancer, heart disease, and arthritis are things a powerful antioxidant like Vitamin C can help do. Vitamin C also helps the body absorb iron which means it can help boost energy in those with anemia or low blood iron levels in addition to its role in immune health. Forming and healing body tissue, creating collagen, healing wounds, and maintaining the teeth are other ways the body uses vitamin C. Vitamin D Taking a supplement of vitamin D is an excellent way to ensure adequate consumption of the essential vitamin the skin needs when exposed to sunlight. Absorbing calcium and building strong bones and teeth are vital reasons for vitamin D. Plus, it can also help immune defense against some diseases. Omega-3 fatty acids A supplement of Omega-3 fatty acids can help ensure consistent daily intake of this vital nutrient found in flaxseed and fish. Reducing blood pressure and triglycerides are some of the many anti-inflammatory benefits they provide. They can also reduce the chance of sudden death from a cardiac event for those living with heart disease, developing an abnormal heart rhythm, or having a stroke or heart attack. How Nutritional Supplements Help Autoimmune and Inflammatory Disease Inflammatory and autoimmune diseases can cause a lot of dysfunction and illness. A lot of the supplements we prescribe here at Health From Within include probiotics and omega-3 fatty acids which help lower inflammation.
