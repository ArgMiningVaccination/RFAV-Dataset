Toxicity in the body can initiate or worsen existing health conditions. A detox is not about a massive diet overhaul or spending a lot of time at some clinic. Detox support involves making small changes/adjustments that will help support the body's natural detoxing process without radical changes. One way that a detox is supported is with chiropractic. Table of Contents Detoxing the Body The body is exposed to chemicals/toxins every day from food, air, and other particles that the body comes in contact with. However, the body has a natural ability for managing exposure to toxins to maintain overall health. If the toxins become too much to handle it can lead to a range of symptoms. Symptoms can range from: - Sleepiness - Fatigue - Poor concentration - Chronic disease [Musculoskeletal conditions](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&rlz=1C1SQJL_enUS774US774&sxsrf=ALeKk02_S9bHbZpKZh9F0TtMvmINAL9_0g%3A1610665091712&ei=g8wAYKnyKpO-tAainr-4DA&q=Musculoskeletal+conditions&oq=Musculoskeletal+conditions&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIHCCMQsAMQJzIHCAAQsAMQQzIHCAAQsAMQQzIHCAAQsAMQQzIHCAAQsAMQQzIHCAAQsAMQQzIHCAAQsAMQQzIHCAAQsAMQQzIHCAAQsAMQQzIHCAAQsAMQQ1DT8CdY0_AnYKH0J2gCcAJ4AIABAIgBAJIBAJgBAKABAqABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrIAQrAAQE&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjpv5KFw5zuAhUTH80KHSLPD8cQ4dUDCA0&uact=5) Methods Reducing the toxic load can be accomplished by supporting the body's natural detox pathways. The body has organs/systems that detoxify and keep the body in balance. These support detoxification and include: [Lymph nodes](https://www.google.com/search?q=Lymph+nodes&rlz=1C1SQJL_enUS774US774&oq=Lymph+nodes&aqs=chrome..69i57.484j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) - Kidneys - Blood - Liver - Digestive system Reducing toxin exposure is a long term strategy for improved health. Detox options include: - Increased water intake - Nutritional adjustments that focus on increased nutrient whole foods and reduced processed chemical foods [Regular exercise](https://www.dralexjimenez.com/strengthening-core-muscles-pain-relief/) - More sleep - Improved stress management skills/techniques - Reducing environmental exposure with hygiene and cleaning product awareness - Cleansing supplements - Lifestyle changes - Fasting, intermittent or longer with nutritionist/health coach supervision Chiropractic Can Help When the body struggles with toxin overload, the body can begin storing some of these toxins.

If toxins buildup in the spine, spinal misalignment can be exacerbated as it affects blood and nerve circulation. Spinal alignment restoration will help open and support the body's natural detox abilities and prevent unnecessary storage of toxins. A chiropractic practitioner specializes in naturally restoring spinal alignment and the body's balance. This supplies the body with the energy it needs to process and rid itself of toxins. When the body is optimally supported and its detox pathways cleared overall optimal health can be achieved. Contact Injury Medical Chiropractic Clinic and experience what chiropractic support can do.
