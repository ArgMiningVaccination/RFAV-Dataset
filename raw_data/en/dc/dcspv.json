Not applicable (NA) a. NA NA NA Education Stigma Behavioral Health is identified as a health need in SMH's patient community , and a lthough SMH is not an LPS facility, SMH provides resources to address this priority. SMH employs a team of registered nurses and a nurse practitioner working under the direction of a California licensed psychiatric physician. The nurse practitioner s provide psychiatric assessm ent, treatment and medications to patients in the ED, observation units, and in-patient units at the request of the medical attending physician. An interdisciplinary Behavioral Health Committee provides evaluation, direction and oversight to assure behavio ral health -related education for facility staff and processes are optimized. Further , SMH's clinical social workers provide patients with support, education and resources to help address behavioral/emotional health issues that often accompany many health conditions (e.g., cancer, postpartum depression, physical rehabilitation, etc.). In addition , more comprehensive behavioral health needs of SMH's patient community are addressed through the programs/services provided th rough Sharp Mesa Vista Hospit al (SMV ) and Sharp McDonald Center, which are the major providers of behavioral health and chemical dependency services in SDC. SMV is located on the same campus as SMH , and is a collaborative partner to SMH in providing psychiatric care . 2.

Improve navigation of the health care system for cancer patients in San Diego County through patient navigation services. a. Continue to offer the cancer patient navigator program to SMH cancer patients. Ongoing SMH Clinical Case Manager, Oncology Administration Access to Health Care Patient Navigation Care Management In FY 2021, cancer patient navigators were diverted from cancer care to assist with COVID -19 patients and patients on other units. Due to the pandemic, the cancer centers also saw a decrease in patients. Despite these circumstances, a substantial number of patients were supported. In calendar year 2021 , more than 3,100 patients were assisted by S MH's cancer patient navigators in person and virtually . The team includes nurse patient navigators , licensed clinical social worker s (LCSW) , genetics counselor s, dietitian s and clinical trials specialist s. Nutrition plays a vital role in cancer care, and more than 600 patients were seen at the Cancer Centers of Sharp HealthCare (Cancer Centers of Sharp), which includes SCVMC , SGH and SMH , for nutritional assessment and ongoing support. Nurse navigators provided ongoing guidance for patients and families impacted by all cancer diagnoses through myriad supportive services, including referrals to numerous community agencies , explanation of procedures and te st results , assistance with financial resources and more. During an annual review with the navigators from the Cancer Centers of Sharp, the most significant challenge identified was the shortfall in providing navigation services to all Sharp cancer patien ts. An analysis of patients navigated by tumor site was completed using Navigation PowerForm documentation. The top three sites navigated in 2021 included breast, head and neck, brain and gastrointestinal tract cancers. With the recent addition of the hepa tobiliary tumor board, Sharp has increased the support this patient population needs from dedicated navigators and Sharp Memorial Hospital and Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns Community Health Needs Assessment - Implementation Strategy Fiscal Years 2023 - 2026 Current as of: 9/7/2022 Page 24 of 90 Identified Community Health Need - Cancer Objectives/Anticipated Impact Strategy/Action Items Target Completion Date Responsible Party/ies Identified Themes in 2022 CHNA Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets, and Other Comments dieti tians. In addition, the Cancer Centers of Sharp plan to revamp the current model for navigation and restructure navigator roles and responsibilities to better distribute resources to more disease sites. The Cancer Centers of Sharp share direct links to community resources and agencies by service needed as well as information on advance care planning (ACP) on sharp.com. The Cancer Cent ers of Sharp also include an online assessment on sharp.com for individuals to assess if at risk and qualify for a lung screening. Representatives throughout the Sharp system are exploring ways to further assist newly diagnosed cancer patients who are pa rticularly anxious at this vulnerable time. A new educational resource published in late FY 2021 \u2014 both printed and on sharp.com \u2014 provides a wealth of information for newly diagnosed patients including how to prepare for upcoming visits to cancer speciali sts; what they can do personally and with family and friends to prepare for the days ahead with treatment; and how to access information about cancer services and support provided by Sharp. While developing the brochure, access gaps were identified, and so special efforts are underway to ensure the brochure is easily accessible and that patients have reliable methods for questions to be answered in a timely manner. b. Provide and refine SMH Cancer Patient Navigation Distress Screening technology to screen, track and respond to psychological, spiritual, practical and other social needs experienced by Ongoing (evaluated annually) VP On cology Service Line SMH Cancer Patient Navigator Coordinator Care Management Continued goals for the Cancer Centers of Sharp's distress screening tool include expand ed use of the tool to increase the number of patients screene d at least one time, as well as the number of patients screened more than one time, especially at times of care transitions. COVID -19 had a substantial impact on the administration of the distress screening survey as well as im pacted results. In 2019, 2,327 surveys were completed versus only 1,483 in 2020, resulting in a 36% decrease. W hile facing the same challenges in Sharp Memorial Hospital and Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns Community Health Needs Assessment - Implementation Strategy Fiscal Years 2023 - 2026 Current as of: 9/7/2022 Page 25 of 90 Identified Community Health Need - Cancer Objectives/Anticipated Impact Strategy/Action Items Target Completion Date Responsible Party/ies Identified Themes in 2022 CHNA Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets, and Other Comments cancer patients and their families. Oncology Social Workers Sharp Nurses 2021 , the number of distress screenings increased to 1,655, but remained lower than pre -COVID -19 pandemic time s. Challenges in screening patients included intended brevity in patient visit times and exchange of materials to reduce COVID -19 exposure. Staff shortages impacted screening figures as well. In FY 2021, 39% of Sharp patients reported distress responses as serious or very serious concerns, a 3% increase from 2020. Also in 2021, patients with cancer at the Cancer Centers of Sharp expressed concern over the COVID -19 pandemic. The Cancer Centers of Sharp continue to be in frequent communication with patients, ensuring care is not disrupted. Financial concerns and health insurance remained a key source of distress for Sharp cancer patients. Other top concerns included worrying about the future and what lies ahead, pain, physical discomfort, exercise and physical activity and feeling too tired. Referrals are made to appropriate resources both within Sharp Healthcare and the greater community. Distress Screening Background : Beginning in June 2019, an electronic distress screening (available in both English and Sp anish), using a validated tool distributed by the Cancer Support Community, was implemented. The tool provides easier methods for completion, timely results sharing, report tabulation and chronologic comparison of results for each patient , for monitoring purposes . Algorithms were established for each question to identify information resources for areas of concern and staff member provided support if desired. Distress Screening \u2014 to assess psychological, social, spiritual and practical issues contributing to cancer patient distress - has been conducted at SMH over the past several years . This tool identifies patient needs in greater detail in order to make them actionable and rate them by i ntensity so that they may be prioritized and addressed appropriately. Routine reports including number of patients screened, Sharp Memorial Hospital and Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns Community Health Needs Assessment - Implementation Strategy Fiscal Years 2023 - 2026 Current as of: 9/7/2022 Page 26 of 90 Identified Community Health Need - Cancer Objectives/Anticipated Impact Strategy/Action Items Target Completion Date Responsible Party/ies Identified Themes in 2022 CHNA Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets, and Other Comments information on the issues that are most challenging for patients and the percentage of patients rated in high distress are reported to the Integrated Network Cancer Program (INCP) and to hospital entities annually. The information will drive efforts to target and provide additional support and resources to better meet our patient needs. c. Provide and refine SMH Cancer Patient Navigator PowerForm technology to screen, track and respond to psychological, spiritual, practical and other social needs experienced by cancer patients and their families. Ongoing (evaluated annually) VP Oncology Service Line Care Management Data Management/ Technology Similar to the SMH Cancer Patient Navigator PowerForm, a Social Work PowerForm was implemented in 2019. In 2020, the Social Work PowerForm was modified for better clarity and interpretation of social work documentati on. Cancer Patient Navigator PowerForm Background : Cancer patient navigators across Sharp collaborated to define, develop and propose a new Cerner Oncology Navigator PowerForm. The PowerForm was designed to standardize the cancer patient navigator's docu mentation, increase efficiency in patient care coordination, and improve overall patient care. By utilizing the PowerForm, navigators can document their assessment of patient needs and barriers to care , in addition to how they addressed patient unmet needs with appropriate internal and external support services and referrals. The documentation is annually reviewed to identify opportunities for improvement to the navigation program. 2.

In collaboration with the Cancer Centers of Sharp, participate in a systemwide initiat ive to improve community cancer screenings to pre -pandemic (COVID -19) levels. Ongoing VP Oncology Service Line Screening The Cancer Centers of Sharp saw a decline in breast and colorectal screening during the COVID -19 pandemic. Patients delayed cancer screenings, and as a result, delayed cancer diagnoses. Cancer, when identified, shifted to later stage diagnoses than seen in previous years. The Cancer Centers of Sharp were selected to participate in a national American College of Surgeons (ACS) C ommission on Cancer (CoC) research study with a goal of returning to screenings. A portion of the study focuses on monthly initiatives to draw patients back to screenings at pre -COVID -19 levels and beyond. Monthly goals for screenings have been established and are closely monitored. This is a systemwide initiative for the Cancer Centers of Sharp with engagement from major medical groups, marketing and screening services to achieve breast and colorectal cancer screenings. In 2021, the Cancer Centers of Sharp, including the Barnhart Cancer Center, offered cancer education, risk awareness, HPV vaccinations and a screening event.

Increase education and awareness of health care professionals and community members in San Diego around violence and trauma, including human trafficking. a. Collaborate with community organizations and health care professionals to share best practices and provide education around human trafficking.

The Health Subcommittee for the San Diego Regional Human Trafficking and Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Advisory Council (Health Subcommittee) is collaborating with local stakeholders and HASD&IC to include human trafficking in HASD&IC's Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and promote TIC in all clinical settings. In an effort to equip Sharp and community health systems with TIC skills, Sharp collaborated with the Health Subcommittee, Palomar Health and the Institute on Violence, Abuse and Trauma to create a TIC continuing education series for physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, licensed marriage and family therapists, LCSWs , and other interested individuals within and Sharp Memorial Hospital and Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns Community Health Needs Assessment - Implementation Strategy Fiscal Years 2023 - 2026 Current as of: 9/7/2022 Page 83 of 90 Identified Community Health Need - Community Safety Objectives/ Anticipated Impact Strategy/Action Items Target Completion Date Responsible Party/ies Identified Themes in 2022 CHNA Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets, and Other Comments outside the medical profession . Topics include ACE ( Adverse Childhood Experience ) score \u2014 a metric that represents the amount of toxic stress endured during childhood ; PEARR (provide privacy, education, ask, respect and respond) Tool \u2014 an effective, evidence -based and trauma -informed assessment for human trafficking , domestic violence and related violence; Neurobiology of Trauma ; Vicarious Trauma ; and Trauma -Informed Principles. The series addresses TIC, a gap in addressing human trafficking, which is vital to supporting patients who have been trafficked as well as the SDOH that contribute to human trafficking and similar exploitation, including poor health outcomes. An evidence -based and trauma -informed assessment like the PEARR Tool is more effective than screening. A trauma -informed assessment using the PEARR Tool facilitates discussions between patients and clinicians about personal safety , and hand offs to social work ers should be done with consent and transparency to avoid stigmatizing patients. TIC is a best practice to help patients feel safe requesting help, even if they do not request help to exit the ir situation. Since disclosure is not the goal, patients do not feel manipulated and are more likely to seek medical attention as needed. As part of the Health Subcommittee in FY 2021, the SMH assistant librarian presented A Trauma -Informed Approach to Human Trafficking at three continuing education events to nearly 90 clinical staff, which included nurse practitioners, social workers and registered nurses. The SMH team member was a facilitator at the Health, Education, Advocacy, Linkage Trafficking Train the Trainer Academy, along with a cohort of 42 individuals.
