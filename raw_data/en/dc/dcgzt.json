From birth to kindergarten. Are you anxious about vaccinating your baby or child? You want the best for them and wonder: Is giving multiple vaccines all at the same appointment good for them? Isn't there a gentler way to do this, that still protects my kid from life-threatening illnesses? You've decided to vaccinate, but don't know where to turn for evidence-based information. How do I space out vaccines? What can I do to prevent serious side effects? What's a normal reaction and when should I call my pediatrician? If that's you, you're not alone. As a parent and a pediatric East Asian Medicine practitioner, I get it. I am a licensed pediatric acupuncturist in NY, PA, and VT with a [specialty pediatric acupuncture clinic in Burlington, VT](https://www.vtpediatricacupuncture.com). I bring East Asian Medicine and evidence-based practices together to help you think through your options, formulate a plan, and feel ease and confidence throughout the 6+ year journey of decision-making that comes along with immunizing your little one. THERE ARE SO MANY BARRIERS TO MAKING AN INFORMED CHOICE. FROM MISINFORMATION TO FEAR TO SIMPLY FINDING THE TIME TO DO YOUR RESEARCH. On top of all that, you may just not be sure that there is anything can CAN do except bodyfeeding or \"lollipop\"-ing your way through the immunization appointment. But hoping for the best doesn't always work out. From the panicky feelings that come with not knowing what to do when your kid reacts to a vaccine to facing more serious side effects, being without a plan or resources can be unsafe and can have lifelong implications. Who's Vax Ready for? All parents and parents-to-be. All genders welcome. It's for people who care about informed consent but need more information and support around their child's vaccines to do so. It's for those of you who want to protect your little ones from serious illnesses, but know, intuitively, that there's got to be a smarter, safter, gentler way to go about it. And it's for parents who want to give their kids protection from Covid-19, and are concerned about vaccine safety. You want a do everything you can to reduce side effects. What you really want (and deserve) is to be equipped to make an informed choice. Imagine having: - An understanding of immunizations and how they interact with your little one's body - Strategies to identify and address your baby or young child's imbalances BEFORE receiving their vaccine - A Homecare plan for the week before, DURING, and the week after the vaccine appointment - A clear understanding of what's a normal side effect and when to seek medical care - Access to an East Asian Medicine practitioner who specializes in pediatrics through a private community forum - An affirming, solid plan to guide you through the process (that you can use for each and every immunization through kindergarten). The informed, critically thinking parent that you are deserves this. You CAN BE supported to make fully informed decisions that will impact your babies' health and wellbeing.
