A term for a system of alternative medical practices originating as early as 1796. Homeopathy is based on the concept that disease can be treated with minute doses of drugs thought capable of producing the same symptoms in healthy people as the disease itself. Allopathy Allos, \"opposite\" and pathos, \"suffering. A method of treating disease by use of agents th at Produce effects different from those of the disease treated by the homeopathy. The term \"allopathy\" was coined in 1810 by Samuel Hahnemann to designate the usual practice of medicine (allopathy) as opposed to homeopathy the system of therapy that he Homeopathic medicine: o Mostly derived from natural substances that comes from: Minerals Plants Animals o Used often to treat asthma ,flue , allergies and cholera. o Some Homeopathic medicines are still used such as Nitroglycerine tablets. HOMOEOPATHY FOR SNAKE BITE The effects of insect stings and snakebites preventing insect allergies and long-term lingering conditions. Although there is little scientific research on the use of homeopathy for bites and stings, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence from over 250 years of effective use of HOMEOPATHY for the relief of insect stings and snakebites. TREATMENT o MODE OF TREATMENT Anti snake venom is the only one specific antidote for snake bite (MAX DOSE 10 TO 25 VIALS) depending upon patient symptoms : o ANTIBIOTICS o BP o PULSE o ECG o HEART RATE o RESPIRATORY RATE. Hypotension Definition: o Low blood pressure can be broadly defined as any blood pressure that is below the normal expected for an individual in a given environment. o Low blood pressure is also referred to as hypotension. Causes of Hypotension: o Heart problems o Endocrine problems o Dehydration o Blood loss o Lack of nutrients in your diet o Severe infection Homeopathic remedies for low blood pressure o Most people prefer homeopathic remedies than allopathic treatment. o these remedies are the healthy extracts from the plants and herbs in the form of tinctures. o Ayurvedic treatment Cont.. o In the case of hypotension, consuming alcohol is not recommended, because it can aggravate low blood pressure by dehydration. o Healthy foods are advisable, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fish. o Most doctors recommend the intake of sodium and salt if a person suffers from hypotension Cont... it is recommended not to change body position abruptly, but very slowly, especially when trying to stand up. It is better to eat several small meals during a day, rather than three large meals. Allopathic Medications for hypotension: o Hypertensive: a number of plants are known that raise BP, but most are inappropriate for ordinary usage. Broom (Scots Broom) is the safest example. o Circulatory Stimulant: this stimulation will help to move the blood around the body. o Bitter Tonic: bitter stimulation will help metabolism in general. If this is not immediately apparent, please review Bitters. Cont.. Several medications, either used alone or together, can be used to treat low blood pressure that occurs when you stand up (orthostatic hypotensiofludron). For example, o fludrocortisones : The drug cortisone is often used to treat this form of low blood pressure. This drug helps boost your blood volume, which raises blood pressure. o Midodrine: Doctors often use this medicine to raise standing blood pressure levels in people. It works by restricting the ability of your blood vessels to expand, which raises blood pressure. Comparison: Homeopathy embrace the natural defense system attacking the root cause. Treat the patients according to the symptoms. Allopathy seek fight against body's natural defense mechanism attacking symptoms rather then diease. Treat the patients according to the disease.

For swelling Pain killer For healing To maintain metabolism Conclusion: Homeopathy is 100% compatible with other medications and will not interfere with effectiveness of other medicines. A homeopathic remedy does not cause side effects. I have never heared of a homeopathic medicine being recalled for causing adverse effects, which is an enviable record considering that these remedies have been in use for more than 150 years. Homeopathic remedies are gentle, Why do we prefer allopathy? Shortage of time Modern curriculum Modern technology Profitable method Despite of all the efforts and advance technology people are not completely fit today and we are also going away from nature and it is very alarming sign for us.
