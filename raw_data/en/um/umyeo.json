CARES Act funding supports a wide range of research areas to help the country fight and recover from the COVID-19 crisis through several research funding mechanisms including Rapid Response Research (RAPID), a fast-tracked grant process to accelerate critical discovery. This update spotlights several recent awards, just a snapshot of the essential work NSF is funding through the CARES Act and FY2020 appropriations. You can explore all of the COVID-19 related research grants awarded through the National Science Foundation here.AWARDS SPOTLIGHT COVID-19 related awards by state , shade of blue correlates to number of awards. CARES Act All COVID-19 Number of Awards 94 Funding Deployed $14,022,596 163 $24,367,607 Title Institution What Why RAPID: A multiscale approach to dissect SARS-CoV-2 attachment to host cells and detect viruses on surfaces Washington University in St Louis; St. Louis, MO This multidisciplinary collaboration focuses on how the virus that causes COVID-19 attaches to human cells and will use experimental techniques and computational modeling to try to develop a test that can quickly detect SARS- CoV-2 in environmental samples. To better understand, detect and take proactive measures against coronaviruses that could cause pandemics, greater knowledge of viral receptors is necessary. MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCES CARES Act $200,000 CIVIL, MECHANICAL AND MANUFACTURING INNOVATION CARES Act $100,000 Title Institution RAPID: Scalable Manufacturing of a Microneedle Coronavirus Vaccine Delivery System University of California San Diego; La Jolla, CA This multidisciplinary collaboration takes an advanced nanomanufacturing approach to vaccine development using unique biomaterials. A vaccine developed with this technology wouldn't require cold chain supply and distribution, can be massively scaled, and has the potential for self- application in the form of a patch. What Why RAPID: Prediction of Cardiac Dysfunction in COVID-19 Patients Using Machine Learning Johns Hopkins University ; Baltimore, MD The project aims to develop a machine learning (ML) approach to identify COVID-19 patients at risk for cardiac dysfunction and sudden cardiac death. Such an ML classifier will be distributed to any interested healthcare institution. Up to one in every five COVID-19 patients suffers acute cardiac injury\u2014this approach could reduce mortality by providing early warning and therapeutic intervention. Title Institution What Why CHEMICAL, BIOENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND TRANSPORT SYSTEMS CARES Act $195,621DIVISION OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES CARES Act $199,009 RAPID: Epidemiological and Phylogenetic Models for Contact-Based Control of COVID-19 University of Louisiana at Lafay ette; Lafay ette, LA This project will develop new disease outbreak models to better understand the role of contact tracing in mitigating the COVID-19 virus spreads. The models will predict how to best implement contact-based measures for efficiently containing the outbreaks by integrating case and phylogenetic data. Increased case detection, contact tracing and information technology, along with social distancing measures, have been vital in slowing down COVID-19 outbreaks. The combined phylodynamic and epidemic model analysis will better quantify disease spread and contact-based control efficacy to help advise public health authorities. Title Institution What Why Title Institution What Why RAPID: Molecular Imprinting of Coronavirus Attachment Factors to Enhance Disinfection by a Selective Photocatalytic \"Trap-and-Zap\" Approach Rice University; Houston, TX A nanotechnology-based \"trap-and-zap\" approach to absorbing and deactivating antibiotic resistant genes could be modified into a new method for viral disinfection that is fast, reliable, and chemical-free. Because the COVID-19 virus and other pathogenic foes are transported in air and sewage, a new sanitization method could help secure infrastructure like airducts, wastewater treatment plants and bathroom pipes. CHEMICAL, BIOENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND TRANSPORT SYSTEMS CARES Act $187,858RAPID: Collaborative Research: The effects of evolutionary adaptations on the spreading of COVID-19 Princeton University; Princeton, NJ Carnegie Mellon University; Pittsburgh, PA Researchers are applying recent advances in mathematical modeling that will enhance epidemiological models of COVID-19 to more accurately account for potential coronavirus mutations, changes in environmental factors like temperature and humidity, and public health measures. Small changes in how the coronavirus spreads\u2014due to mutations, seasonal weather patterns, or changes to public health guidelines\u2014could have big implications. This research enhances epidemiological models by more accurately accounting for those factors, enhancing the tools available to public health officials.
