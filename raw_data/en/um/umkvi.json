AVD sets forth evidence from hundreds of scientific studies confirming the majority of these ingredients may be potential prevention against - or treatments for - SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. 'AVD' has grown from the past fifty years of research in nutritional science, microbiology, phytochemistry, virology, infectious diseases, dietetics inter alia - a convincing body of evidence appears to have emerged of the anti-viral qualities of numerous elements in our diets. - Edouard d'Araille has stated that: \"Millions of lives might be saved from viral illness if we learn to include anti-viral ingredients in our diets - whose properties are verified by scientific evidence and not based on opinions or rumor\". - AVD advances in three stages which progressively introduce the idea of an 'Anti-Viral Diet'. In Part 1 the author defines this as: \"a diet whose primary purpose is to counteract viral threats and to maximize the ability of our immune systems to fight off both viruses and viral diseases \". The impact of Coronaviruses on us is considered - above all SARS-CoV-2 - plus scientific evidence in favour of investigating the potential of anti-viral dietary ingredients. - Part 2 explores the anti-viral and/or immunomodulatory properties of fifty-two natural ingredients - found in or as food - in each case indicating which viruses they have been shown to act against or how the immune system can be enhanced by them. SARS-CoV-2, Influenza viruses, HIV, Ebola, Yellow Fever, Dengue and Zika are just some of those included. - Finally, Part 3 sets forth the outline of a preliminary 'Anti-Viral Diet', which shows how to incorporate some of the ingredients from Part 2 into one's daily dietary intake. - AVD is based on the research of over 1000 scientists and each section is web-linked with online resources that present studies, reviews and trials in support of the anti-viral ingredients. - Two editions of AVD are available: the 'COVID-19 Edition' focuses on identifying dietary ingredients that may be effective against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, while the 'ACADEMY Edition' incorporates 200 pages of extra scientific research data. Follow-up volume 'The Science Behind AVD' - which explains the molecular mechanisms of anti-viral ingredients and the human immune system - is out Dec. 2020. - Previous releases by Edouard d'Araille include 'Adapa's Ascent - The First Story' (2020), 'Que Chronology of Thought' (2002) and 'Words Can't Hold...' (2011). He is current series editor of the Nobel Prize Collection for Living Time Books.

'AVD' is available to buy now from www.AVD.Today. 2020 Following research obtained from the previous SARS and MERS outbreaks, we've gained knowledge about the mechanisms of bioactive plant ingredients against the attachment and replication of COVID-19 as well as overshooting immune responses. This could be used for designing COVID-19 trials utilizing bioactive compounds. The receptors for SARS, ACE-2, and CD26 show associations with mechanisms that regulate human senescence. Several functional foods interact with the epigenetic regulation of viral infection and mechanisms of senescence. This review concentrates on the link between bioactive plant ingredients and their activities against mechanisms of viral Keywords: COVID-19, is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that has become a global pandemic as announced by WHO. The outbreak of COVID-19 has created panic worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment considering the urgency of the situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase. When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment. Slowing the spread of the COVID-19cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick byCOVID-19 and need hospital care. Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeutic agents targeting SARS-CoV-2. Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response. Further, the current treatment options, synthetic drugs available, ongoing trials and recent diagnostics for COVID-19 have been discussed. We suggest traditional Indian medicinal plants as possible novel therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways. T\u00dcBA Assesment Report on COVID-19 Global Outbreak that prepared in the light of available data under the guidance of the above issues consists of scientific works about process management, analysis, and prediction of our country's scientists and scientific studies of other countries. Due to the ongoing feature of the COVID-19 process and the necessity to constantly update in the texts we receive from scientists; the efforts have been given place to include the most up-to-date data as much as possible in the report. T\u00dcBA Working Groups on Cancer; Food and Nutrition and Sustainable Development, Finance and Environment also made important contributions to the preparation of the report. In this context, in the first part of the study, the history of pandemics and important definitions that should be known are mentioned. This section also includes the current situation about COVID-19 outbreak and Turkey's existing health infrastructure. In the second part, which contains the epidemic process management about COVID-19, the interaction in other science disciplines is given in detail. In the third part, a future projection of the economic and social effects of the epidemic with the similar cases in history has been put forward. In the fourth part, current data tracking platforms and useful internet resources are presented for the researchers' benefit. In the fifth part, besides COVID-19 reports of the World Science Academies, some COVID-19 research and projects conducted by T\u00dcBA members are included. In the appendix, there are other internet resources and reports that are thought to be useful. This report is basically revised English version of the \"COVID-19 K\u00fcresel Salgn Deerlendirme Raporu\" which has been updated 6 times in Turkish as cited in the generic page. Journal of Science and Technology 2020 Now a days the news of coronavirus is on all news paper's headline. Coronavirus is spreading from animal market of Wuhan in central China. There are several types of coronavirus but all are not dangerous but this new coronavirus is very dangerous. It is a group of RNA viruses that cause a variety of disease in animal and animal to human. The efficiency of this new coronavirus found in the live animal market of Wuhan in central China, circulate in a range of animals and spread from animal to animal and animal to human also which is called Spillover. Mild symptoms of coronavirus are cough, shortness of breath and severe problems are pneumonia, kidney failure and death also. Basically corona virus effects on immune systems and decrease the immune power. There are no specific treatments or vaccines for this disease still now. So in this condition, people have to maintain immunity and should increase immune power to fight against coronavirus. Only washing hand and wearing a mask are not enough to fight against this virus, people have to modify their daily diet. This article summarizes the immune-boosting therapeutic diet against coronavirus (COVID-19). Lifestyle Medicine Wiley 2020 Although the practice of strengthening the immune system may not guarantee that people will not contract severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is evidence that suggests that the likelihood and severity of many viral infections can be considerably reduced if appropriate measures are taken to increase the efficacy of the immune response to invading organisms. Evidence-based public health measures to reduce viral spread include-personal isolation, physical distancing, wearing facial masks, frequent hand washing with soap and running water, not touching the face, vaccination, etc. However once infected, recovery relies on host immunity to eradicate the foreign invaders, with symptomatic management, which is the core management strategy in COVID-19 management guidelines. Researchers have observed that severe COVID-19 prevalence and mortality is highest in people with preexist-ing conditions. Eighty percent of these preexisting diseases are lifestyle related. Also, 2020 The entire world is currently under the grip of a pandemic of COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV2. The virus caused an initial outbreak in Wuhan, China with affected individuals presenting with viral pneumonia. Early on, in the outbreak, metagenomic RNA sequencing shed light on this novel coronavirus which is an enveloped virus, containing a single stranded RNA and gets it name from the crown like spikes on their surface. With limited availability of antivirals at the beginning of the pandemic and no vaccine; a lot of medications were initially re-purposed to treat COVID-19. As more clinical studies continue to be done, and the availability of antivirals increase, there is a huge need to consider alternative ways and means to boost one's immune system along with preventive measures of social distancing, masking and isolation of infected individuals. Natural plant-based products with medicinal properties along with increased exercise and meditation to relax and de-stress, are vital resources that should be overlooked. Tropical journal of Pharmaceutical and Life Sciences (An International Peer Reviewed Journal) Journal homepage: http://informativejournals.com/journal/index.php/tjpls 2020 In this review, an attempt is made to comprehensively study the effectiveness of probiotics for the prevention and/or treatment of viral infectious diseases, which may be useful to combat the new corona virus. This review will provide an overview of the unique mechanism by which viruses are eliminated through the stimulation of type 1 interferon production by probiotics via the activation of dendritic cells. Till today, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials which are evaluating potential agents for treatment. Corona virus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered corona virus named as SARS Corona virus-2. The pathophysiology of COVID-19 clearly indicate the sensitivity of SARS CoV-2 to IFN. Reports on treatment of COVID-19 patients with IFN shows positive results. Considering the proven antiviral and immunomodulatory activity of probiotics and ability to stimulate interferon production, it is recommended to use probiotics as the adjunctive therapy for the prophylaxis of COVID-19. The ongoing pandemic has upturned the whole world socially and economically. Although further detailed research is necessary in the future, probiotics are expected to be among the rational adjunctive options for the treatment of Corona viral diseases. Crimson Publishers Advanced age, having comorbidities, and vitamin D deficiency are three most important reasons for increased vulnerability to COVID-19 and also worsen complications and increase the risk of death. Despite the vast amount of information available and lessons learned, many countries are still not fully utilizing these to manage secondary peaks of COVID-19 infection. Factors associated with worse COVID-19 prognosis include, older age, ethnicity, male sex, having comorbidities, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking; all these are associate with vitamin D deficiency. COVID-19 symptomatology varies from mostly asymptomatic, to, up to 2% fatality. Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable. You can download the paper by clicking the button above.
