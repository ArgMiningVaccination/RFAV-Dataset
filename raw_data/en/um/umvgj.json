Immune mechanisms of peanut allergy remission Food allergies are a major health burden globally, Australia having the highest reported rates . There is currently no cure so management relies on allergen avoidance, causing severely reduced quality of life and rarely death. A treatment that can induce r emission of allergy is needed. Understanding immune mechanisms supporting clinical remission o f allergy, and long -term persistence of remission will facilitate development of novel treatments. Several therapies under investigation can induce remission , however remission may be transient or long -lasting. We have shown that a combination treatme nt, Probiotic and Peanut Oral Immunotherapy (PPOIT), induces long -lasting remission persisting to 4 years post -treatment; whereas remission following peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) without an adjuvant appears short -lived, with two thirds (67%) of treatmen t responders losing remission by 12 -months post -treatment. We have completed a large (n=201) Phase 2b randomised trial comparing PPOIT vs OIT vs Placebo with pat ients followed to 12-months post -treatment, allowing identification of transient (lost) vs per sistent remission. Biosamples collected before, during and after treatment are available for analysis. This project aims to characterise shifts in cytokine produc tion that occur during the transition from allergy to remission, and patterns associated with transient vs persistent remission. Findings will contribute to understanding the immune mechanisms involved in retraining the allergic response towards remission, as well as remission that persists or is lost. Cytokine levels in cell culture supernatants w ill be measured by multiplex assay before and after treatment in 1) patients who achieved remission of peanut allergy following PPOIT treatment, 2) patients who a chieved remission of peanut allergy following standard OIT, 3) patients who remain allergic to peanut following placebo treatment. Findings will help to identify key immune factors driving lasting remission of allergy compared to remission that is lost ove r time, which may in turn lead to development of more effective long -term treatments for food allergy.

Understand ing pneumococcal pathogenesis Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is the most common cause of community -acquired pneumonia and a leading killer of children world -wide. However, it is also commonly found as an asymptomatic coloniser of the upper res piratory tract (carriage). Pneumococcal carr iage is an important reservoir for transmission and a precursor to disease. In this project, you will identify novel genes and characterise their role in pneumococcal carriage and/or disease. Key approaches to th is project include: genetic manipulation of pneumococcal isolates, working with in vitro and/or in vivo models such respiratory cells from patients grown as air -liquid interface and mouse models, as well as microbiological and immunological analysis of loc al and systemic samples. Your research will provide new insights into how pneumococci colonise and cause disease.

Interplay between Streptococcus pneumoniae and respiratory viruses In this project, you will elucidate the underlying microbiological and/or immunologica l mechanisms that govern the synergistic and antagonistic relationships between pneumococci and respiratory viruses. Key approaches to this project include: working with in vitro and/or in vivo models to understand the effect of coinfection on the host and microbes, including microbio logical and immunological analysis of local and systemic samples. Your project will provide novel insights into bacterial -viral interactions.

Introduction of PCVs result in major changes to pneumococcal epidemiology and to the microbiota more broadly. In this project, you will examine nasophar yngeal sample s and isolates collected from children from vaccine studies in low -income settings from the Asia - Pacific region. You will apply traditional and molecular microbiology approaches including culture and serotyping, qPCR, DNA microarray, whole -genome sequencin g and antimicrobial resistance testing. Your results will inform vaccine strategies world -wide.

Anti-inflammatory effects of sulforaphane Sulforaphane is a dietary compound with a diverse range of biological effects, including anti -oxidant, anti-inflammatory and chemoprevention. The biological effects of sulforaphane against infectious pathogens are less well understood, although some effects have been described for specific bacteria and viruses. Identification of novel anti -viral compounds w ith activity against SARS -CoV-2 is a priority research area. This project will involve undertaking some in vitro assays to assess the anti -inflammatory effects of sulforaphane against SARS -CoV-2. A combination of flow cytometry and cytokine assays will be performed. E: paul.licciardi@mcri.edu.au E: zheng.quantoh@mcri.edu.au Available as Masters Projects: Yes 6. Analysis of cord blood immune profiles in preterm and term infants Preterm infants have increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial infectious diseases in comparison to term infants. The reason for this is not well understood but is thought to be due t o delayed immune system development in preterm infants. Understanding early life immune responses in preterm infants is important in the development of novel vaccines or therapeutics in the prevention and/or treatment of infectious diseases. This project a ims to define di fferences in cord blood immune responses to RSV between preterm and term infants from Vietnam using a range of immunological techniques including cell culture, flow cytometry and cytokine assays.

Characterisation of the early life exposures that induce Innate Immune Memory. We all know that the adaptive immune system develops memory following specific antigen exposure, but is the same true for the innate immune system? An emerging field of research tells us exactly this, with e pigenetic remodelling as th e underlying mechanism. Innate immune cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, form this non -specific memory in response to a variety of exogenous signals. Exposure - induced epigenetic remodelling governs their future response to a range of pathogens. This process can be modelled in vitro, using both yeast and bacterial antigens and metabolites (Novakovic et al. Cell 2016), metabolites (Bekkering et al. Cell 2018), vaccines (Arts at el. Cell Host Microbe 2018) and a range of other stimuli. During pregnan cy, both maternal and foetal monocytes show attenuated pro responses correlated with pregnancy -associated hormones. Additionally, foetal monocytes are exposed to a range of environmental factors. We hypothesise that monocytes remodel their chr omatin in response to early life environments, which explains their altered function during pregnancy. To test this hypothesis, we will isolate pure monocytes from human blood, and treat them with various stimuli in vitro. After treatment we will measure c ytokine release, RNA expression and epigenetic (histone modification) changes. This project is appropriate for students with an interest in molecular biology and immunology and will utilise monocyte isolation and culture, ELISA, chromatin immune -precipitat ion (ChIP), DNA and RNA extraction and real -time PCR.

Epigenetic reprogramming of immune cells in response to cross -sex hormone therapy Transgender people, whose gender identity is markedly and persistently incongruent with their biological s ex, almost always experience gender dysphoria. Characterised by severe distress and discomfort, and the feeling of 'having been born in the wrong body ', gender dysphoria compels transgender individuals to seek cross -sex hormone treatment. While there is cl ear sexual dimorphism (differences between sexes) in immune function and response to infection, it is not known how hormone therapy influences these a t the functional or molecular level. In this project we will study immune cells from individuals that unde rwent cross -sex hormone therapy to answer these questions. A key aim is to understand what proportion of sexual -dimorphism is due to genetics and how much is due to sex hormones alone. Two clinical trials of cross -sex therapy were completed, for which we have biological samples: 1. Whole blood genome -wide DNA methylation data is available for 12 individuals who underwent female -to-male hormone tre atment and 12 underwent male -to-female hormone treatment (baseline, 6 months and 12 months after treatment ). These data need to be analysed using bioinformatics tools. 2. Live frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells are available at baseline and 6 mont hs after cross -sex estrogen hormone treatment in male -to-female transition (n = 30). These live frozen cel ls will be used for immune -phenotyping, epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone modifications) and transcriptomic profiling of specific innate (monocytes ) and adaptive (na\u00efve T and B) cell types. This will evaluate the changes in immune function during sex ho rmone administration. Methods involved Molecular Biology: RNA/DNA extraction, chromatin preparation and pulldown, sequencing library preparation . Cellular Immunology: Cell sorting and analysis of immune -phenotyping data. Cell culture to elicit inflammatory responses in immune cells. Bioinformatics: R and linux to analyse DNA methylation, ChIP -seq and RNA -seq data (no prior knowledge of codin g is required).

Modelling cortical development with human stem cells to ellucidate the role of epigenetic regulators in neuronal maturation and activity Studies into human cortical development (or corticogenesis) have identified unique cellular processes during embryog enesis which further our understanding of how the human cortex is formed. However, primary human neuronal tissue ca n be difficult to source and is less amenable to genetic and cellular manipulation for experimental purposes. Therefore, researchers have t urned to human embryonic stem cells (hESC's) to model human cortical development in culture. hESC's are highly expa ndable which allows for scaled up experimentation and established cortical differentiation protocols mimic key cellular hallmarks of cortico genesis such as neural stem cell proliferation, synaptic maturity, neurite morphology and activity. More recently, the ability to generate gene knockouts with CRISPR/Cas9 technology has allowed researchers to scrutinise the role of specific genes in the d evelopment of their tissue of interest. Our interest is focused on a subset of epigenetic regulators - proteins whi ch modify histones and DNA to regulate transcription of underlying genes - and how these genes regulate aspects of neurodevelopment. A grow ing body of genetic evidence has identified a large number of epigenetic regulator genes to be associated with neuro developmental disorders resulting in intellectual disability, suggesting that neurodevelopment is highly susceptible to epigenetic changes a s neurons develop and mature. How these genes affect neuron -specific functions at the cellular level is largely une xplored. The aim of this Honours project is to generate a CRISPR/Cas9 -mediated knockout of an epigenetic regulator gene associated with i ntellectual disability and characterise its role in corticogenesis using a stem cell -based model of cortical develop ment. This will involve designing and cloning of CRISPR/Cas9 constructs, clonal generation of knockout stem cell lines, live -cell imaging o f stem cell -derived neurons using virally delivered fluorescent reporters and calcium indicators to assess cell prol iferation, synaptogenesis, maturation, neurite extension and activity, and biochemical assays to assess changes in histone modifications dur ing neuronal development in the knockout neurons.

A high throughput drug screen to identify candidate targets for the treatment of Neurofibromatosis Type 1. NF1 is a single -gene disorder cause d by a loss -of-function mutation in the NF1 gene resulting in a reduction of the protein neurofibromin. Cognitive d eficits occur in approximately 80% of children with the genetic syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), making them the greatest cause of d isability for individuals with this lifelong genetic condition. These manifest as academic failure due to learning disabilities (70%), attention deficit -hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; 40%) and a significantly increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD ; 25%). Current therapies, whether medication or behavioural interventions, are often ineffective because they use 'trial and error' approaches targeting symptoms, rather than the cause. Therefore is an urgent need to discover new therapeutics for the impairing ne urodevelopmental symptoms experienced by children with NF1. This drug screening project aims to identify compounds that may modulate neurofibromin expression using patient derived stem cell lines.. Cells will be differentiated into neurona l cells and t hen used to perform a high throughput drug screen. Functional readouts from the screen will include assessment of neurofibromin steadystate levels as well as structural readouts including neurite development, length and number of neurons in th e cultures. O nce candidate compounds have been identified, validation assays will be performed in NF1 -patient derived stem cell models to determine whether the compound treatment/s can ameliorate neuronal deficits. Extensive functional analyses will be per formed includ ing the assessment of neuron growth and maturation (using immunofluorescence assays), neuron function (using multi electrode arrays and calcium imaging) as well as biochemical assays such western blotting, real time PCR and ELISAs to determine biological c hanges in our patient lines versus control lines.

Understanding the neurobiology of autism in nf1 using patient derived stem cell mo dels Autism (or autism spectrum disorder; ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by debilitating impairments in social communication and restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. In most cases, the cause of autism is unknown and because of this, there are no effective treatments for autism in the general population. However, a subset of individuals (15 -20%), autism occurs in children with a clinically defined syndrome which arise from a single gene disord er. This is the case in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a loss -of-function mutation in the NF1 gene. Studying a monogenic disorder with a high prevalence of autism will allow a more targeted and deeper understanding of the neurobiologi cal mechanisms of ASD in NF1. Whilst animal models have traditionally been used by researchers to understand disease mechanisms, translation from animal studies to effective human clinical trials has proven difficult, including in NF1. A potential expl anation for this is the inadequacy of animal models to recapitulate the complexity of the human disease state. This project will investigate how and why 25% of children with the genetic syndrome NF1 develop neurodevel opmental disorders such as autism. This project will use patient derived stem cell models to characterise the neuronal deficits in individuals with NF1. Specifically, human stem cell -derived brain cell networks (comprising neurons and glia) will be generat ed to examine the effects of NF1 m utations on neuronal development, determine how well they connect together in networks and whether they are able to function efficiently. Various drugs targeting specific pathways important in NF1 will also be used in the stem cell derived neuronal network s to determine whether they can reverse the biological abnormality in these cells. Some of the techniques that will be used in this project include stem cell culturing, differentiation of stem cells into brain cells, confo cal microscopy, network activity a ssays, drug screening techniques, real time PCR and western blot analysis.

Developing a functional assay to evaluate pathogenic variants in one of the most common genetic loci linked to paediatric mitochondrial disease Each week in Australia a child is born with a disorder affecting mitochondria, our cellular power plants. Many such children die in the first years of life and most suffer from severe disease. Current genomic strategies have improved the ability to provide molecular diagnoses for these children and their families, with diagnosis rates around 50%. However, it is often difficult to determine whether a novel genetic variant is patho genic, and diagnoses can be missed in regions of the genome that are more diffi cult to analyse, such as those with repetitive sequences. The ATAD3 locus is one such genomic region, consisting of three repeated genes with high homology. Since its identif ication as a mitochondrial disease locus in 2016, ATAD3 has emerged as one of t he top 5 most common nuclear loci linked to mitochondrial disease. These diseases range from milder neurodegenerative diseases, to severe presentations with early lethality affe cting the heart and/or the brain. Many of these severe presentations result fro m duplications and deletions in the ATAD3 locus that frequently arise due to its origin as a gene duplication event. While its precise function is unresolved, ATAD3 is linked t o mitochondrial DNA maintenance and cellular cholesterol homeostasis. All three ATAD3 genes encoded within the locus (ATAD3A, ATAD3B and ATAD3C) have ATPase domains, although it is unknown if they are all functional. This project will involve the develo pment of a protocol for isolation of ATAD3 proteins and direct measurement of t heir ATPase activity, using extensive molecular biology and biochemistry techniques. This assay will then be used to evaluate ATPase activity in all three ATAD3 proteins, as wel l as to analyse the effect of known and novel variants on ATAD3 ATPase function to determine their contribution to Frazier et al.

NAXD deficiency: unravelling the pathological consequences, and evaluation of therapeutic opportunities There are major gaps in our basic understanding of the inborn error of metaboli sm, NAXD deficiency, and no specific treatments are available. It is likely that disruption of core metabolic processes including ATP synthesis, the Krebs cycle and other pathways could be aggravated by intercurrent illnesses and challenge an already compr omised energetic state. Our research team focuses on uncovering the molecular basis of undiagnosed childhood brain disorders using genomic sequencing. We have recently identified mutations in a new gene called NAXD in young children who were born health y and developed normally un til a febrile episode or common infection triggered failure of the metabolite repair system associated with NAXD. All of these children died rapidly during such an episode. We have shown that mitochondrial energy production was s everely compromised in skin cells from these children and was associated with a vast accumulation of damaged metabolites. Prior to our discovery, mutations in this gene had never been described before in humans. This work was published in Brain in January 2019. We will utilise a n umber of techniques to investigate mitochondrial impairment including, but not limited to cell culture, mitochondrial inhibition assays, mitochondrial enzyme activities and metabo lite extraction and analysi s and proteomics. We are currently undertaking high throughput drug screening, which may identify targets to modulate NAXD deficiency. There is scope to expand this project from an Honours to a Masters project by the inclusion of stem cell modelling for sc reening of potential therapeutic agents for NAXD deficiency, using patient - derived and gene -corrected iPSC for differentiation into relevant cell types for NAXD deficiency. This research proposal will enhance our understanding of this new genetic disord er by uncovering molecular pathways perturbed by loss of gene function, and may provide an understanding of therapeutic targets to protect the brain when children with gene mutations suffer febrile illnesses that would otherwise overload the repair system. Please note that this is primarily a laboratory -based project and there are only limited opportunities for remote work.

What are the consequences of is for neuronal function and differentiation. CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD) is an X -linked developmental encephalopathy that results in early onset and difficult to control seizures a nd severe neurodevelopmental impairment, leading to lifelong disability. The CDKL5 protein is expressed in the brain, predominantly in neurons and regulates key phosphorylation events that in turn regulate cell proliferation, neuronal maturation, synaptic activity, neuronal network function and the movement of subc ellular cargo in neurons. This project will contribute to our investigations on the critical role of the mammalian CDKL5 protein in neurons. CDKL5 is a kinase that regulates key phosphorylation events on many proteins. Some recently identified targets of CDKL5 in neuronal cells inc lude microtubule proteins, however only a few targets have been discovered, leaving many potential targets yet to be identified. The phosphorylational regulation of microtubules is very important as it will affect neuronal matur ation, synaptic activity, an d neuronal network function and the movement of subcellular cargo in neurons. This project will validate potential new targets regulated by CDKL5. These targets will be validated using complementary in vitro techniques. We wi ll validate potential CDKL5 targets using a combination of standard biochemical and molecular biology techniques including, but not limited to cell culture, qPCR, SDS -PAGE immunoblotting, phospho - specific -immunoprecipitation, and enzym e assays. We will identify key pathways regulated by CDKL5 and which will improve our understanding of how this kinase regulates synaptic activity in brain -like neural networks. This project will for the first time provide a comprehensive and detailed un derstanding of the CDKL5 kinase in neuronal cell biology. Our project will provide future opportunities for drug design and therapeutics targeting kinase activity.

Novel Transcriptomic Signatures in Peripheral Tissues and Brain Predictive of Behaviour in PWS Prader -Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder arising from a deletion or duplication of the 15q11 -q13 imprinted region, affecting the regulation of genes essential for normal neurodevelopment. The clinical features of PWS in childhoo d incl ude intellectual disability, and behavioural challenges including autistic features and hyperphagia. However, there is significant variability in symptoms which is not well understood, particularly between deletion and non -deletion subtypes. Better u nderst anding the relationships between the biology underlying these differences is important for improved stratification of patients and for the development of targeted early treatments. Genetics Laboratory based researc h 12 We have recruited and assessed 35 individuals with PWS. Extensive behav ioural and parent -reported medical history data, as well as bio -specimens including DNA, RNA and protein lysates have been collected from various tissue types for most participants. We have also processed post -mortem brain tissues from 16 individuals with PWS and 30 neurotypical controls. We then characterise changes at DNA copy number, methylation, RNA and protein levels between tissues of these individuals to help us better understand biological pathways involved in pathology of deletion and non -deletion sub-types of PWS. This project will expand on this work to examine relationships between expression of key genes in different peripheral and brain tissues within the 15q11 -q13 imprinted region (e.g., UBE3A, MAGEL2, NIPA, NDN), and will relate th ese to formal clinical assessments. Ten new participants will be recruited and assessed. Molecular analyses for the new PWS participants and RNA from 10 post -mortem PWS brain tissues will be performed as part of this study. These data will be combined with the e xisting dataset to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying clinical features between different sub -types of PWS. The student will gain experience in laboratory work, interpreting genetic and clinical data, biostatistic s, and working with children and families affected by PWS.

SPILLOVER: What is the impact of preterm respiratory support outside of the lung? 70% of all preterm infants within the Neonatal Intensive Care unit (NICU) require assisted respiratory support. However wh ilst life -saving, even brief periods of support when applied to the immature lung may not only initiate lung injury, but may also result in extra -pulmonary organ dysfunction.

The tree of life: Mapping changes in the trachea, bronchus and alveolus during ventilation of the pre term lung The majority of studies to date have focussed on the impact of mechanical ventilation on the gas exchange units of the lung (alveolus) with large bod ies of evidence demonstrating that even brief periods of support when applied to the immature lun g can initiate lung injury. What is not clear is how mechanical ventilation parameters such as flow, pressure and tidal volume, influence the morphometry and f unction of other respiratory tissues such as the trachea and bronchus.

Generating gene edited tools for CRIS PRi screening The use of stem cells to generate human tissue is now readily available. This provides the ability to understand the role of all genes in disease by interfering with their function within the stem cell -derived models. To facilitate screening to identify the outcome of gen e inhibition, it will be necessary to build a stem cell line able to deliver CRISPRi technology. Building such a resource will train the student on gene editing technology and stem cell technology and provide an excellent trai ning ground for eventual scree ning programs. Dr Sara Yes 19. Identifying safe harbour loci from stable gene expression The stable expression of a selected gene is now commonly used in stem cells to change cellular fate, identify cellular state or readout response to compounds. Generat ing stable expression of an introduced gene requires the identification of 'safe harbours' that will support robust expression of the reporting gene. In this project, the student will generate gene edited lines to test out the appropriateness of different genetic loci to act as safe harbours. This will train the student in gene editing technology and stem cell technology, representing an ideal starting point for a subsequent Masters or PhD Dr Sara Howden Prof Melissa Little E: sara.howden@mcri.edu.au E: melissa.little@mcri.edu.au T:03 99366444 Available as Masters Projects: Yes Cell Biology Laboratory based research 15 20. Assessing the effect of congenital nephrotic syndrome mutations on podocyte calcium flux Project description: Congenital nephrotic syndrome presents early in life and results in kidney failure and resulting severe proteinuria which can be life threatening. The genetically inherited forms of this condition mos t commonly result from m utation in genes expressed in the podocytes of the glomerulus. We have developed a method for generating human kidney tissue from pluripotent stem cells that represent good models of the human kidney. We have also established that w e can model genetic neph rotic syndrome in this way. In characterisation of the forming glomeruli in this stem cell -derived kidney model, we have identified transient calcium flux within podocytes that may be related to the degree of podocyte cell -cell interaction. This project w ould seek to examine the effect of congenital nephrotic syndrome mutations on this podocyte readout as a measure of disease severity. The project would include the use of patient and genetically edited pluripotent stem cells and wil l train the student in s tem cell maintenance and differentiation as well as kidney development and disease. Dr Aude Dorison Generating a patient -specific model for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis due to a de novo mutation in TRIM8 Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a kidney disease that can b e caused by genetic mutations affecting podocyte biology. Kidney organoids are mini -kidney tissues in a dish that can be differentiated from patient -derived induced pluripotent stem cells as a model of that patients disease. Our laboratory has demonstrated the utility of this approach in the study of genetic glomerular diseases. The aim of this project is to study the effect of genetic variants in TRIM8 using iPSC derived from a local patient presenting with FSGS and comorbid epilepsy (a known association). TRIM8 plays a role in ubiquitination, which marks proteins for degradation within the cell. We plan to study the effect of mutant TRIM8 protein on fundamental slit diaphragm proteins and po docyte biology using kidney organoids derived from this patient's cells.

Evaluating the generation of morphogen gradients for patterning of stem cell derived tissues The directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into nephron -containing human kidney tissue provides a major opportunity to generate engineered kidney tissue for renal replacement. However, nephron function is completely reliant upon patterning and segmentation with distinct responses to morphogen gradi ents between the proximal and distal ends of the nephrons. An ability to provide a gradient of growth factor signalling across patterning tissue is a major opportunity to align nephrons in a particular fashion. This project will use reporter lines that can indicate the level of growth factor signalling in an individual cell to investigate how nephron patterning can be instructed or enhanced in vitro to improve the structures that are derived. The project will draw on methods in stem cell differentiation, bi oengineering and computational image analysis. Prof. Masters Projects: Yes 23. Characterising molecular and mechanical properties of bioengineered heart valve tissues Congenital heart disease is the most common congenital disorder in newborns. Currently, 1 in 100 babies are born with a heart defect, a major portion having heart valve abnormalities. Heart valves play a critical role in m aintaining unidirectional blood flow through the chambers of the heart. The only treatment option for heart valve defects is replacement surgery with either a biological or mechanical prosthetic. While these prosthetics are routinely used in adults, there are no prosthetics that are designed specifically for children. This presents a major problem as the child outgrows the valv e prosthetic and will have to undergo multiple replacement surgeries until adulthood. Bioengineering a valve has become a viable opt ion in recent years as it eliminates the need for donor tissue and can utilise human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) as a sour ce of cellular material. We have developed a protocol to differentiation human PSC into heart valve cells that will be used to const ruct a 3 - dimensional valve leaflet using state -of-the-art bioengineering approaches. In this project, we aim to characterise mechanical properties and protein expression of the valve leaflets with techniques including immunohistochemistry and western blott ing.

Gene regulation in the developing retina and the childhood eye cancer retinoblastoma Retinoblastoma is the most common eye cancer of infancy and childhood; these tumours are considered to be developmental in origin. The seven cell types of the re tina all derive from a pool of retinal progenitor cells (RPC). The distalless (DLX) family of evolutionarily -conserved hom eobox genes encode transcription factors expressed in the developing and mature retina as well as the majority of retinoblastoma tumou rs examined to date. The DLX transcription factors are necessary for retinal ganglion cell (RGC) development, in part due to direct regulation of other transcription factors that are either activated or repressed during eye development. The student will un dertake RNAseq and ChIPseq studies in the developing mouse retina to identify DLX2 gene regulatory networks, validate in t ransgenic mouse models available in the laboratory and assess expression of these DLX2 targets in retinoblastoma cell lines and tumour specimens. The student will learn key methods in molecular, cell and developmental biology, including primary cell cultur e and advanced microscopy skills. The student should preferably have an undergraduate background in cell, developmental and/or molecul ar biology. Professor David Yes 25. How does ACTN3 deficiency influence the short and long term response to anabolic steroids in muscle? Alpha -actinin -3 (ACTN3) is a major structural component of skeletal muscle. 1 in 5 people worldwide are completely deficient in alpha -actinin -3 due to homozygous inheritance of a common null polymorphism (R577X) in ACTN3 (ACTN3 577XX). While this does not cause disease, the alpha -actinin -3 deficiency results in significantly lower muscle mass and strength/power in elite athletes and in the general population. We have generated a knockout mouse (Actn3 KO) to model human alpha -actinin -3 deficiency. Using this model, we have shown that alpha -actinin -3 deficiency alters muscle mass, fast fibre size, muscle metabolism, calcium handling, and increases muscle susceptibility to eccentric contraction induced damage - all of which explains the altered muscle function in ACTN3 577XX humans. Recently, we found that alpha -actinin -3 deficiency alters the pathways that regulate muscle mass. Actn3 KO mice showed red uced expression of androgen receptor in skeletal muscle and also reduced downstream androgen receptor signal ling. Actn3 KO mice also showed reduced muscle hypertrophy in response to acute treatment with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) compared to WT mice, sugges ting that alpha -actinin -3 deficiency diminishes the hypertrophic response to anabolic steroids. This pr oject will examine the mechanism behind the diminished response to DHT with alpha -actinin -3 deficiency as well as the long term effects of acute ste roid exposure. Skeletal muscle is thought to have a cellular memory in which hypertrophy is 'remembered' thr ough the retention of newly recruited myonuclei long after steroid exposure and onset of muscle atrophy. Silastic tubing containing solid DHT (or em pty tubing) will be implanted in WT and Actn3 KO mice for 6 weeks, then removed, and mice will Cell Biology Laboratory based research 18 be assessed a t 3 and 11 weeks following implant removal.

Linking enteric nervous system development to Hirschsprung Disease in children The developing gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is accompanied by development of the enteric nervous system (ENS) along the proximal -distal axis. When GIT development is impai red through disorders of neuronal migration, cell signalling, etc., then a r ange of GIT motility disorders can result. One of the most severe disorders is Hirschsprung Disease (HD) which can sometimes manifest as complete intestinal obstruction in the newb orn infant requiring emergency surgery. More than 30% of patients with HD ha ve loss -of-function mutations in the RET proto -oncogene or in other members of the RET signalling pathway (Sergi C et al, Pediatric Research 2017). Until recently, the transcriptio nal regulation of RET expression during ENS development has been under -explo red. The Eisenstat laboratory studies the distalless (DLX) family of homeobox transcription factors. The Dlx1/Dlx2 double knockout mouse dies shortly after birth with several conge nital anomalies of the brain, retina and craniofacial structures. They also have a distended abdomen with a phenotype of intestinal pseudo -obstruction closely resembling human HD. Moreover, DLX2 binds directly to the Ret gene promoter in vivo and regulates its expression in a proximal -distal fashion during ENS development. The stu dent will assist to complete the ENS phenotyping of the Dlx1/Dlx2 double knockout mouse as well as assess expression of DLX2, PGP9.5, RET and Calbindin in patient samples assessed for a diagnosis of HD obtained through collaborating Paediatric anatomic pat hologists and surgeons.

Molecular remodelling of endothelial cells in response to specific lymphocytes and other signals The vascular endothelium is a highly specialized barrier that p lays a key role in the regulated migration of leukocyte cells out o f the circulation and into peripheral tissues as part of the systemic immune response. In atherosclerosis, this barrier function is impaired leading to uncontrolled leukocyte accumulation a nd systemic inflammation. Recent data have shown that cells of the innate immune system, such as monocytes and macrophages, have capacity to develop a non -specific memory in response to inflammatory signals. Termed 'innate immune memory', it is increa singly clear that this is not restricted to cells of the hematopoie tic lineage. We have recently demonstrated that endothelial cells of different origins have the capacity to establish innate immune memory following an initial stimulus (viral or bacterial) . Further, we have mapped the molecular 'reprogramming' involved in this process, that enables an enhanced response to an unrelated second stimulus. It is important to note that cells do not act in isolation, and we now aim to explore the impact of a ran ge of human plasma and lymphocyte (white blood cells) protein stimu li on endothelial memory. This project will involve culturing vascular endothelial cells with plasma from individuals of variable health outcomes (diabetes, obesity, allergic and autoimm une conditions) and endothelial -lymphocyte co-culture experiments. We couple these with state -of-the-art transcriptome and epigenetic profiling. Techniques include cell culture, DNA/RNA extraction, a range of epigenetic approaches, RNA sequencing (RNA -seq) and bioinformatic analysis. This project will reveal novel insi ghts into the role of circulating lymphocytes and other factors in modulating endothelial molecular function, a key determinant in a range of adverse health outcomes, including atherosclero sis and cardiovascular disease.

How does early -life epigenetic variation relate to infant metabolic profile? In utero, the developing embryo/foetus is sensitive to a range of environmental exposures with the potential to impact growth and development . These include maternal anthropometry, metabolic profile and health during pregnancy, each with the potential to shape infant metabolism and health after birth. Techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) allow the simultaneous measurement of a large number of metabolites (metabolome) in both maternal and offspring circulations. While specific metabolites have been linked to a range of diseases in adults, little is known about the factors that shape metabolomic profile in early life. We hypothe sis that altered infant epigenetic profile, particularly D NA methylation at key genes, plays a role in mediating the relationship between early life exposures and childhood metabolic health. To investigate this, we will test the relationship between a rang e of maternal and pregnancy measures (including maternal m etabolome), offspring DNA methylation profile at birth, and offspring phenotype and metabolome in infancy. We will also assess the potential contribution of DNA methylation to infant growth, as well as how genetic variation might influence these relationsh ips. This project is appropriate for students with an interest in understanding the link between pregnancy and childhood health, with a focus on molecular measures and biostatistics.

The same but different: Transcriptional responses to inflammatory stimuli in phenotypically discordant monozygotic twins The term 'epigenetics' literally means 'above DNA' and refers to the study of molecular interactions that influence chromosome structure and gene activity. We can think of epigenetic marks as signals that determine whether a stretch of DNA is 'open for busi ness' and accessible for regulatory factors or 'closed' and therefore inaccessible. A key property of many epigenetic marks is that they not only indicate the state of the cell at a set point in time, but can also carry 'memories' of past exposures, with the potential influence cellular responses to future stim uli. Therefore, the epigenome (the complete epigenetic prole of a cell) contains information about the 'past, present, and future' of a cell or tissue. Understanding the relative roles of genetic and environmental influence to epigenetic variation is impo rtant in many aspects of human health, particularly the immune system. Inflammation is a key outcome of the immune response to exogenous 'foreign' stimuli and is also a feature of excessive weight i n children and adults. This project will examine the tr anscriptional response of purified blood monocytes to inflammatory stimuli in vitro in twins discordant for weight from birth to 6 years of age. As monozygotic twins are genetically identical, any diff erences in response will be directly attributable to cu mulative environmental exposures, allowing the relative contribution of genes and environment to this important aspect of immune cell function to be directly assessed. The project will be laboratory -based and will involve will stimulating peripheral blood monocular cells and purified monocytes, profiling cytokine release and transcriptional response via single -cell RNAseq and bulk RNAseq. It is anticipated that the results will form the basis of a futur e publication.

Assessing the relationship between circulating Vitamin D, genetic variation and bone density in an Australian cohort of 11 -12yr old children and their parents The role of vitamin D [calcitriol -1,25( OH)D and 25(OH)D] in bone health remains unclear, particularly early in life. Twin -based and family studies have reported a large genetic component to 25(OH)D concentrations. However, herit ability estimates vary widely (20 - 80%) and the estimated genetic contribution base on common SNPs is only 7.5% in mid -life adults [2]. Little corresponding data is available for calcitriol. Utilising already generated data from the finely curated LSAC Child Health Checkpoint study in Australia this project will; (i) assess the relationship between childhood and parental measures of vitamin D, (ii) estimate the SNP -based genetic contribution to vitamin D measures, and (iii) assess the relationship betwe en vitamin D and pQCT measures of BMD in children and adults . This project will yield valuable insights into the interplay between vitamin D levels, genetic variation and bone mineral density in a large population -based study of children (n>2500) and t heir parents.

High Dimensional Immune and Epigenetic Profiling of Children with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) Autoimmune Disease is a conditio n arising from an abnormal immune response to a functioning body part. There are about 80 Autoimmune Diseases, which affect 5 -10% of the population of the Western world. Arou nd 70% of those affected are female, owing to a combination of genetic and hormona l factors. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an autoimmune rheumatic disease that is one of the leading causes of childhood disability, affecting around 6000 Australi an children. It typically causes joint pain and inflammation in the hands, knees, ankles, elbows and/or wrists. Despite its relatively high incidence, the molecular and cellular changes associated with JIA remain poorly understood. We hypothesise that bl ood cells (e.g. T cells, monocytes and B cells) from JIA patients will show differ ences in cellular proportions, responses to activation in culture, and have a distinct molecular profiles relative to controls.

Unacceptable toxicities in Paediatric Cancer Survivors - the trade off of cure Five-year survival rates have surpassed 90% for childhood Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia survivors (ALL), but survivors are frequently burdened by severe permanent hea lth sequelae. Recently 15 international ALL study groups launched an initiative to constru ct a measure (designated Quality Survival (QS)) to quantify the occurrence of unacceptable toxicities (published Lancet Haematology July 2021). This project seeks to document the 21 QS conditions within an established cohort of patients treated at The Roya l Children's Hospital and Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne. The reporting of the QS conditions within the established cohort will document for the first time these ne w measures within an Australian Cohort. Once the QS conditions are documented within the cohort, a pharmacogenomic analysis will be performed to identify novel variants predisposing to these unacceptable toxicities. Pharmacogenomic analysis will be pe rformed for toxicities where a functional model is available to validate findings (i.e. pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes). Ultimately, once variants are established and validated, these could be used to screen the patient population for their r isk for unacceptable toxicities. This project will be lead by a supportive team of supervisors with extensive clinical and basic science experience and an established track record both in the field of interest, and in supervision of Honours, Masters an d PhD students. The project is a collaboration between The Royal Children's Hospital Children's Cancer Centre and the Cell Biology Theme within Murdoch Children's Research Institute.

Identifying a diagnostic test for food allergy that can replace the food challeng e Food allergies are a major health burden globally, and Australia has the highest reported rates. Currently, the oral food challenge (OFC) remains the gold standard test to detect presence or absence of food allergy and the only test to detect response to food immunotherapy (sustaine d unresponsiveness, also referred to as remission of allergy). While allergen -specific IgE (sIgE) can support the diagnosis of food allergy, these tests have high sensitivity but poor specificity, so can confirm allergy diagnos is at high concentrations or with positive clinical history, yet perform poorly as screening diagnostic tests and as tests for allergy resolution. Despite significant research effort, advances toward identifying an affordable, safe and simple alternative t o the OFC has been severely l imited by the absence of well phenotyped longitudinal studies that measure both immune biomarkers (skin prick test, serum sIgE) and challenge -confirmed food allergy outcomes at multiple time points. Our suite of internationally unique studies at the Murdoc h Children's Research Institute overcomes this obstacle. We have developed a novel modelling approach that can accurately detect (test for) and predict (forecast) a child's allergy status following peanut oral immunotherapy tr eatment. Further work is now required to validate this approach and to establish similar predictive models for detecting and predicting response to egg and milk oral immunotherapy. Additionally, this approach will be applied to develop accurate models that diagnose food allergy at fir st presentation (untreated patients) and predict the likelihood of future resolution of food allergy. This project is an exciting opportunity for a student with a biostatistics background to work with us in further testing and developing this algorithm for detecting response to food immunotherapy and diagnosis of food allergy.

Auto -titrating positive airway pressure in Paediatric patients for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea. Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep breathi ng disorder associated with multiple neurobehavioral &medical problems in children. The first -line treatment of OSA in children is adenoto nsillectomy however many have residual symptoms of OSA postoperatively &require continuous positive airway pressure (C PAP). CPAP therapy involves the provision of pressure via a face mask to treat upper airway obstruction. Currently the gold -standard for d etermining appropriate treatment pressure is a manual pressure titration by a sleep scientist during attended in -labor atory sleep study. This method of in -laboratory titration is labour intensive, costly &subject to hospital waitlists. Auto -titrating posit ive airway pressure (APAP) devices provide variable pressure delivery by constantly monitoring the patient's airflow u sing algorithms developed by each company. APAP for the treatment of OSA has been widely used in adult patients, particularly during the i nitiation phase of therapy, however there is a paucity of data in children. Aims: To assess the efficacy of APAP in treating OSA in children. Methods: All children with OSA requiring an in -laboratory CPAP titration study at the Royal Children's Hospi February -July 2021 will undergo titration study using the ResMed Airsense 10 APAP device wit h portable sleep monitoring equipment to determine their appropriate treatment pressure. The sleep studies will be set -up &data collated &analysed by the student. The titration study will be analysed by Sleep Scientists to determine efficacy of APAP for treatment of paediatric OSA. Clinical Implications: CPAP therapy is an effective &safe treatment for OSA in children. In -laboratory titration PSG is standard to determine optimal therapeutic pressure in children with OSA treated with CPAP. The use of APA P devices as an alternative is not well studied in children however has the potential to provide therapeutic pressures in the home without the need for in -hospital titration sleep studies.

Non -communicable diseases (NCD) are the leading cause of mortality in Australia and worldwide. The burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other NCD f alls disproportionately on those who are socioeconomic disadvantaged. Inflammation may play a role in this 'social gradient' of CVD, through both acute inflammation (e.g. from acute infections) and chronic inflammation over the life course. While elevated inflammation is a known risk factor for CV D and other NCD in adulthood, there is a growing body of evidence that risk of CVD begins to accumulate from early in life. However, the relationship between socioeconomic position, inflammation, and cardiovascular health in childhood is poorly understood. Identifying possible biological mechanisms in childhood contributing to the development of later CVD may open up new opportunities of earlier identification of those most at -risk, and potentially earlier intervent ion. We hypothesise that relative soci oeconomic disadvantage in childhood is associated with greater inflammation burden, and that inflammation burden in turn is associated with adverse childhood cardiovascular measures. To investigate this, we will ex plore the relationship between measures of socioeconomic position, blood -based inflammation markers, and non -invasive cardiovascular measures. All these data have already been collected; the project focuses on analyses of the relationships between socioeco nomic position, inflammation and cardiovas cular risk. We will also consider how heightened inflammation associated with socioeconomic disadvantage might mediate these relationships. This project is appropriate for students with an interest in biostati stics and epidemiology. It is suitable for an Honours or Master project and potentially may form the basis for a PhD.

Socioeconomic position and metabolomic risk profiles Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and many other non -communicable diseases disproportionally impact those with greater levels of socioeconomic disadvantage. This 'social gradient' of CVD may begin even prior to conception, and growing evidence supports that acc umulation of CVD risk begins from early in life. Socioeconomic position may contribute to this through metabolic differences that promote the accumulation of CVD. In adults, assessment of metabolic profile, using modern techniques such as nuclear magneti c resonance (NMR) 'metabolomic' platforms that measure a large number of metabolites, h ave revealed metabolic profiles that reflect a higher risk of CVD and metabolic conditions, and similar evidence in older children and young adults have linked metabolic profiles to increased atherosclerosis, a key process in the development of CVD. The re lationship of socioeconomic position to metabolomic profiles is poorly characterised, particularly in early life. Identifying possible biological mechanisms in childhood contributing to the development of later CVD may open up new opportunities of earlier identification of those most at -risk, and potentially earlier intervention. We hypothesise that relative socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with metabolomic di fferences in infancy and childhood that reflect pro -atherogenic metabolic profiles prev iously reported in later life. To investigate this, we will explore the relationship between measures of socioeconomic position and plasma NMR metabolomics. We will also consider how anthropometry and health measures associated with socioeconomic disadvant age might influence these relationships.

Statewide outcomes for babies in spe cial care nurseries - a pilot study Project description Newborn babies who require specialist care account for substantial immediate and lasting burden of disease. More than 10% of newborns are admitted to special care nurseries (SCN), many experiencing l ifelong adverse outcomes. Despite de cades of research, deficiencies remaining in knowledge of risks and outcomes pertaining to babies. To rapidly improve care for babies, comprehensive knowledge of incidence, health/developmental outcomes, risk factors and care pathways, coupled with a unifo rm whole -of-population approach, is urgently needed. The 'Generation Victoria' cohort is targeting all 160,000 Victorian births over two years commencing Dec- 2020 for Joan Kirner. Within GenV, we are establishing a depth data collection for all newbor ns admitted to Victoria's 40 SCNs, covering important events during pregnancy and the postnatal admission. These unique whole -state data will complement data already available for the 5 neonatal ICUs and build a statewid e evidence base for better physical, mental and developmental outcomes for these vulnerable babies. Project objective: For the expected 200 babies admitted to Joan Kirner hospital in Dec 2020 to 2021 (pilot study), we aim to determine the population in cidence of morbidities (eg respirato ry distress, hypoglycaemia, infection, jaundice, and feeding difficulties) in the neonatal period, and the characteristics of the babies who experience them. Working with the GenV and the SCN study team, the student will learn how registries are set up , assist with data extraction and develop definitions, coding and recording of morbidities and characteristics before proceeding to quantitative analyses to address the study objective.

How do rare neurogenetic disorders impact gait patterns in childr en? It has long been assumed that different genetic conditions impact a person's gait in unique and important ways. Sometimes this leads to severe gait difficulties as in the neurogenetic disorder Angelman syndrome, while at o ther times it leads to more su btle differences in gait, as in neurogenetic disorders linked to autism spectrum disorder, such as Fragile X syndrome. Quantitative gait analysis with wearable sensors offers a potentially useful approach to measure and compar e gait patterns across groups. In this project the student will join the Diagnosis and Development Laboratory at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute. The group comprises a dynamic team of researchers and diagnostic staff that interact to solve p roblems of both genetic and cl inical nature.

We have previously studied the prevalence of fatigue and sleep disturbance in children with MS. Aims To further investigate sleep a nd fatigue in children with MS attending RCH, this study aims to: evalu ate sleep patterns with actigraphy (a movement sensor) and a sleep di ary evaluate physical activity levels with actigraphy and correlate these findings with phys ical activity questi onnaires evaluate sleep habits and sleep h ygiene (questionnaire based) evaluate the relationship between sleep patterns and physical activity (as measured by actigraphy) with mood, fatigue, family functioning, sleep habits/hygiene, quality of life, and MS disease activity. Methods All children with POMS attending RCH will be included. Participants and their parents/carers will complete sleep, fatigue, physical activity, mood, quality of life, and family functioning questionnaires. Children will a lso wear an actigraph for a period of 7 days to evaluate sleep patterns a nd levels of physical activity when awake. The data collected will be collated and analysed by the student. Clinical implications Poor sleep quality and fatigue impact quality of life and physical, cognitive and social functioning in children with MS. A better understanding of sleep patterns, factors impacting fatigue and poor sleep quality, and their relationship to physical activity, mood, family functioning, and quality of lif e will optimise medical management of children with MS.

Our team is developing a new CP Flagship Program that aims to improve the healthcare of children with CP. This will be achieved by working with families to implement evidence -based care, facilitate c are coordination, and to introduce consistent assessments and rigorous data collectio n, where these processes are not in place. This honours project is a pilot project for the CP Flagship and will be based within the Neurodisability and Rehabilitation Group at MCRI. The project will involve the study of children with CP who attend the Co mplex Care Hub at the Royal Children's Hospital. The Complex Care Hub delivers a range of services to meet the needs of patients, and partners with families and community providers to deliver the best care closest to home. The student will study the char acteristics of children with CP attending the Complex Care Hub (approximately 70 children) to determine factors including health status, disability (level of functional impairment) and socio -demographic profile (age, geographical background etc) and compar e these characteristics with a similar group of children with CP who do not attend the Complex Care Hub. For example, differences in rates of hospital admission and outpat ient appointments will be compared for the two groups. Once this baseline informati on is obtained, the student will interview selected families to determine the benefits of the Complex Care Hub, and areas where the program could be improved. Families wil l also be invited to share their thoughts about research priorities for the CP Flagsh ip moving forwards. This project will provide important information to guide the development of the CP Flagship and in turn, enhance care for children with CP and their families.

Reducing the burden of radiation exposure to neonates needing intubation The placement of an endotracheal tube (intubation) to support breathing is often required in critical care medicine. In neonates it is easy for the tube to be p laced too far into the lungs, which can be dangerous. Consequently an X -Ray is usually performed after intubation. T his project will evaluate whether a new, faster and radiation -free method of lung imaging called EIT can guide correct tube position better than X -Ray. Students will work with Clinicians and Scientists in the MCRI Neonatal Research group to perform an obse rvational study involving newborn babies needing Intensive Care. Students will gain skills in clinical research, lung imaging, data analysis and governance. A/Prof David Projects: Yes Cell Biology Non -Laboratory based research 35 46. Trends in haemodynamic support following major non -cardiac surgery in neonates Following surgery, babies require intensive care support during their recovery. It is essential to provide strong cardiovascular support with IV fluid and medications. I n this clinical project, the student will quantify the amount of haemodynamic support required using a val idated scoring system, to help us better understand how we support babies in the post -operative period. Students will work with Clinicians and Scienti sts in the MCRI Neonatal Research group and the RCH Neonatal Intensive Care Unit to gain skills in clinica l research, data analysis and governance.

Differences in pre - and post -operative cerebral blood flow markers using ultrasound in neonates undergoing major non -cardiac surgery Surgery is a high risk time for newborns, because any clinical instability around this time may result in brain injury and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. This project will record simple ultrasound Doppler studies of arteries in the brain prior to surgery, then at multiple time poi nts after the procedure, to help us understand peri -operative changes in cerebral blood flow and see if there is a correlation with important clinical ou tcomes. Students will work with Clinicians and Scientists in the MCRI Neonatal Research group to perfor m an observational study involving newborn babies needing Intensive Care. Students will gain skills in clinical research, ultrasound, data analysis and g overnance. This study may pave the way for future interventional studies in this area of neonatal inten sive care.

Newborn infants needi ng surgery often experience haemodynamic instability that requires escalating intensive and risks post -operative recovery, as well as risk of longterm organ damage. Near -infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a NICU technology that monitors b rain and other organ oxygen delivery. This Cell Biology Non -Laboratory based research 36 offers the potential to identify poor oxygenation before problems occur. This observational clinical project will compare NIRS data during the first 48 hours post -operatively with clinical outcomes and pre - operati ve NIRS in neonates n eeding surgery at the RCH Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.

Social media and decision -making in the neonatal intensive care u nit Social media has influenced the way in which parents engage with the healthcare system and receive health information. This project will explore how social media influences parental decision -making for critically unwell babies with rare diseases using novel qualitative methodology. The student will have the opportunity to learn qualitative methodologies including thematic analysis, ethical enquiry and gain exposure to activities of the Children's Bioethics Centre and the neonatal intensive care unit. Th e student will be supported by a team of neonatal intensivists and clinical ethicists with the opportunity to develop a paper and present at conferences.

The influence of siblings in end -of-life decision -making Parents of critically ill babies are sometimes faced with di fficult decisions in which they must consider what management plan will best serve the interests of their newborn baby. Sometimes the interests of the patient may be in tension with the interests of the broader family including siblings. This project will seek to understand how siblings influence decision -making from the perspective of parents of critically ill babies admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit through web -based surveys.

Are Neo natal Sepsis Calculators useful in a surgical neonatal population? Neonatal infection is common and impacts short and long -term risk factors and often prolongs NICU admission. But diagnosing infection is difficult. As a consequence, clinicians have to bala nce risks of infection against potentially unnecessary antibiotic use. Recently validated online calculators to determine the risk of neonatal sepsis have become available for term infants. It is not known whether these calculators are applicable in neonat es that need surgery, where alternative sources of inflammation may occur. In this project students will compare the utility and validity of available Neonatal Sepsis Calculators i n babies that require surgery at the RCH NICU. Students will work closely with Clinicians and Scientists in the MCRI Neonatal Research group and gain skills in clinical research, data analysis and governance. This research provides the potential to develop tools to reduce the burden of infection in sick neonates. Dr Ruth Armstrong A/Prof David T:393455008 Available as Masters Projects: Yes 52. Sleep quality and fatigue in children with Charcot -Marie -Tooth disease Introduction: Charcot -Marie -Tooth disease (CMT) refers to a group of inherited genetic neuropathies. It is the most common chronic peripheral neuropathy of childhood, affecting 1 in 5000 children. Symptoms often begin in childhood, and include limb weakness, mobility impairment and foot deformity. Fatigue is also common and affects quality of life. An increased prevalence of sleep disorders has been described in adults with CMT. We hypothesise that sleep disturba nce is under -recognised, and represents a modifiable co ntributor to fatigue in children with CMT. Manifestations of sleep disturbance and fatigue are expected to have considerable impact on mental health, academic performance, social interaction and ultima tely quality of life in children with CMT. There are n o studies evaluating sleep and fatigue in Australian children with CMT and no studies examining the impact of sleep disturbance. The Department of Neurology, RCH hosts a statewide neuromuscular clinica l service, and the RCH has a tertiary sleep service. Aims: In the current population of children with CMT attending the RCH: to determine the prevalence of fatigue and evaluate sleep quality (objective and subjective) to assess the relationsh ip between fatigue and sleep quality to evaluate th e impact of fatigue and sleep disturbance on HRQOL, mood and physical activity. Methods: All children with CMT attending RCH will be offered participation in this study. Participants and their par ents/carer will be asked to complete sleep, fatigue, HR QOL, physical activity and mood questionnaires and referred for overnight sleep study (PSG). The data collected will be collated and analysed by the student. Clinical implications: Sleep disrupt ion may significantly impair health -related quality of life, physical activity, and exacerbate fatigue and mental health problems in children with Cell Biology Non -Laboratory based research 38 CMT. In order to optimise the medical management of children with CMT, it is important to understand the magn itude of sleep disorders and their impact in this Masters Projects: No 53. What are parent's experiences of the multidisciplinary scoliosis service for children undergoing growth friendly non -fusion spina l scoliosis surgery? Children with cerebral palsy (CP) have an increased risk of developing scoliosis with an incidence of between 20% and 25%. The definitive treatment for progressive scoliosis in this group is surgical intervention with the aim to halt c urve progression. Th e complication rate of traditional spinal fusion in children with CP has remained relatively high (38%), however despite complications retrospective studies have consistently demonstrated a high satisfaction rate among caregivers. Sc oliosis surgery using a new growth friendly non -fusion spinal instrumentation (NFSI) involves a minimally invasive technique and has become the primary surgical technique for children with neuromuscular scoliosis at RCH since June 2017, however there is mi nimal evidence regar ding family satisfaction following this procedure. The RCH delivers a multidisciplinary scoliosis service for children undergoing scoliosis surgery and to date has performed 145 NFSI surgeries. The aim of this study is to eval uate parent/carer satisfaction following bipolar scoliosis surgery and to report parent's experience of the multidisciplinary scoliosis service. Methods: Families participating in the multidisciplinary scoliosis service whose child has unde rgone NFSI surgery in since June 2017 will be asked to provide data on satisfaction overall, care processes and expected changes in health and function. Content analysis of responses to open -ended questions will be conducted. Significance: Family satis faction is an important outcome within a patient -centred quality of care framework. We expect our findings will promote strategies to inform the delivery of care in relation to NFSI surgery. Projects: No Cell Biology Non -Laboratory based research 39 54. Use of new devices to assess a baby's heart rate immediately after birth Assessment of the newborn's heart rate immediately after birth is of extreme importance when there are concerns that the baby might be unwell and requir e resuscitation. An accurate, quick and reliable assessment of the heart rate is important and can be difficult to obtain by auscultation or pulse oximetry. ECG would be ben eficial but the application of standard clinical ECG dot electrodes can be difficul t in newborns who are moist and covered with vernix. Use of adhesive electrodes can injure the skin of the extremely preterm babies. Several new devices will be tested by th e student, initially in the setting of more stable babies in our neonatal intensive and special care nursery and then also in the delivery room context. These devices consist of (1) a system of a modified oximetry probe combined with boot -like ECG electrod es at both feet, (2) an array of three gel covered metal disks in a holder that can be gently held to the baby's chest, and (3) a mat with integrated contact zones to detect the ECG signal. as Masters Projects: Yes 55. disease control and disordered sleep patterns in childre n with hepatic glycogen storage disorders (GSDs). The hepatic glycogen storage disorders (GSD) are a rare group of inherited disorders resulting from deficiency of an enzyme involved in carbohydrate metabolism and the utilisation of glycogen when fasting. Children affected by these disorders are at risk of life threatening hypoglycaemia with minimal fasting. The management of GSDs involves lifelong intensive die tary modifications including either intermittent or continuous overnight feeding to prevent hypo glycaemia. Recent studies in type 1 diabetic populations have explored links between hypoglycaemia and impacts on sleep. One study in a paediatric population in dicated the time spent in hypoglycemia to be associated with more nocturnal awakenings and long wake after sleep onset in children with type 1 diabetes. There is currently minimal data available exploring association between disordered sleep and disease co ntrol in the GSD population. The Royal Children's Hospital provides a state -wide service manag ing all paediatric hepatic GSD patients within Victoria and Tasmania, from birth to 18 years of age. Currently patients are monitored with regular blood glucose finger prick testing and dietary modification based upon these and other biochemical results. R ecently continuous glucose monitoring has become available in the diabetic population to assess hypo and hyperglycaemic events. Such monitoring has the potentia l to better detect unrecognized and asymptomatic periods of hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia all owing for improved disease management in GSD patients. This study aims to examine associations and interactions between glycaemic control (both hypo and hyper g lycaemia) using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), dietary management (continuous versus inter mittent overnight feeding), quality of Cell Biology Non -Laboratory based research 40 life , and disordered sleep (using sleep questionnaires and actigraphy measurement concurrently with CGM monitoring) in a well defined population of hepatic GSD patients. This study will define 1. glycaemic cont rol 2. sleep quality and identify disordered sleep patterns in paediatric GSD population 3. quality of life in this population. Mixed models will then be used to examine associations between these parameters. Ultimately this information will inform decisions around optimizing disease control in this patient population to improve long term outcomes for paeditric patients. This study will be undertaken in the departments of metabolic medicine and respiratory medicine at the RCH and includes superviso rs with required expertise from both departments.

Audit of early death post diagnosis of DMG Diffuse midline glioma is the deadliest disease of childhood with surviv al near 0% at 5 years and a median progression free survival of 9 months. Radiation remains the only therapeutic option to extend and maintain quality of life for a period. Early deaths are rare, but have occurred. We intend to look for patterns predicting early death in presentation, imaging and symptoms at diagnosis in our cohort at the RCH and with time, through our collaborators at the DIPG Registry.
