If your horse has occasional loose stool, or is a senior horse, a probiotic can be given to help support healthy digestive function and immune health. Horses that have difficulty maintaining a healthy weight or are susceptible to hindgut issues may also benefit from a probiotic. Platinum Balance is a daily probiotic formula that also includes prebiotics, which nourish the beneficial bacteria in your horse's gut, and supports the digestion of fiber. Probiotics are key to helping your horse make the most of the ingredients you feed.

Platinum Performance\u00ae client since 2008 \"Radar was diagnosed with hind gut issues and had been doing generally well, until he started dropping weight at an alarming rate. He had always gotten Platinum Performance Equine, but at the suggestion of my vet, I added Platinum Gastric Support as an emergency measure, then added Platinum Balance and Healthy Weight. Radar gained 100lbs in about 2 months.\" \u2014 Charlotte T. Platinum Performance\u00ae client since 2013 \"The vet diagnosed my mare with gastric health issues after palpating known trigger points. I gave her Platinum Performance and Gastric Support. Within the month, she was doing so much better and after three months of just the Platinum supplements, all her issues were gone.
