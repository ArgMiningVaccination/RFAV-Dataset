According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, more than [40 million adult Americans](https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics) live with an anxiety disorder. [Symptoms of anxiety](/health/physical-symptoms-of-anxiety) can include nervousness, fear, and worry.

These natural remedies for anxiety may be your ticket to finding some calm in your stress storm.
