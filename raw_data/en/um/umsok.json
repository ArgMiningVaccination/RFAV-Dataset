I'm Carly Your Ayurveda Health Counselor Thanks to the simple wisdom of Ayurveda I went from barely getting by, dragging myself out of bed, overweight, depressed and in too much pain to stay motivated to literally bouncing out of bed every day, excited to get at life. As an Ayurveda Health Counselor, every day women ask me: \"Why am I so tired?\" \"How can I feel stressed?\" \"Why can't I get a good night's sleep?\" I've been there. And this. Right. Here. is the start of your path to feeling so much better. Why this detox is different? Forget that \"detox in a box\" ....this is not that! Panchakarma is a treatment program for the body, mind and consciousness, that cleanses and rejuvenates. You don't need a bunch of supplements or pasty shakes, or some kind of starvation approach. This kind of detox does NOT give you better eating habits long term, and can perpetuate disordered eating patterns. Ayurveda teaches us that FOOD IS MEDICINE . I want to show you what's likely already in your home with the power to bring back your vibrancy, rather than sending you for hundreds of dollars in supplements. [Click here to see what you'll be eating](https://thehabit.net/more-details-self-guided-detox) \"Before I began my initial detox with The Habit and Carly, I was run down, low on energy and mental clarity. I needed to hit reset. This program was exactly what I needed. What I didn't expect, was the super side effects of the detox and the emotional support that the facebook group would provide. I was able to overcome my fear of success and constant self sabotage by voicing my truth only to receive the feedback and love that I needed so that I was able to overcome this common struggle. I can proudly say that aside from being so much healthier, losing weight and being more at peace with my body, I am also now working at my peak with excitement and determination to break through my past goals and reach higher and deeper. I am so grateful to Carly, Manz and the entire support group of members for this priceless and unexpected gift.\" - Arpana Vora Start Today Join the 10 Day Ayurvedic Detox $97 Just $47! FAQ What will I be eating? The cleanse guide includes clarifying, vibrant, and energy boosting recipes for spring and summer, and warm, spiced, immunity boosting recipes for fall & winter. We'll incorporate apples as a prebiotic to help build a healthy gut microbiome, root vegetables, sprouts and leafy greens cleanse the liver, and a nutritionally complete Indian stew called \"kitchari\" to assist in moving toxins from the body. Plus tons of delicious beverages, soups, salads, juices and smoothies and even treats. You're going to love it! Have you got food allergies? No problem I'll help you work around them. Vegan? That's allowed! Options for vegans are included. Gluten free? You won't find any gluten in this recipe guide. Do I have to make separate meals for my family? Though chances are pretty high your family is going to be super supportive of you doing a cleanse, chances are also pretty high that they don't really want to do it with you. Inside the detox guide you will find tons of delicious recipes that the whole family will really enjoy, and others that may not be everyone's favorite but are really quick to make for yourself while the kids chow down on Annie's Mac n' Cheese. (it's all about balance). Do I have lifetime access to this program? Yes! You'll have lifetime access to the course content and all updates. At the Habit we sometimes run LIVE versions of the cleanse, including support calls, accountability and prizes. As a member of the self-led cleanse program you'll have access to these at a reduced rate :) How much of my time is this going to take? You have an opportunity to CUSTOMIZE your cleanse according to what you need, and how much time you've got. For example, you might be an early retiree, living in that beach community with 11 hours a day to sit in meditation and move slowly and live on bone broth and oxygen for a week. And for others.... You might have full time jobs or kids or businesses to run or all of the above and still need fuel. (one day I will be that retired lady with the 11 hours and it will be glorious). If you don't have room to take a day off and sip lemon water, it's all good. most of us don't. There are many many many recipes in the 10 day cleanse guide for juices, smoothies, soups, salads and entrees of all tastes, shapes and sizes to choose from. You will learn about the traditional spices, herbs, and medicinal foods of Ayurvedic tradition. You will learn a number of tools for using spices at certain times of day to boost your digestion and improve gut health long term. But you don't have to do all of it. You only have to do what you're ready for. You get to assess where you're starting from, and decide what's going to ACTUALLY WORK FOR YOU, vs. what will be too much to commit to or what you don't have the energy for.
