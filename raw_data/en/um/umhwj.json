I LEADING WITH SOLUTIONS 2 Spring/Summer 2016 Director's Message From the Desk of Michael Trailor wise man once said, \"I've learned to embrace change because it's something I can always depend on.\" As a result of this year's legislative session, the AZ Housing Finance Authority is moving to the new AZ Office of Economic Opportunity and the Office of Manufactured Housing is moving to ADOH. A few years ago, the Finance Authority mo rtgage business was producing approximately $20M in mortgages per year and cost the state approximately $2M per year. This year, our mortgage business will produce over $500M in mortgages at no cost to our state. Further, the proceeds from the mortgages pr ovide approximately $2M annually to the state housing trust fund which is invested in providing housing solutions to end homelessness. Currently, ADOH has rapid rehousing funds in Maricopa County and balance of state. We will soon be launching rapid rehous ing in Pima County. ADOH continuously seeks to maximize our resources to provide the greatest benefit to our citizens. Dirk Swift, AzHFA's Homeownership Programs Administrator, continues to increase our business though the deployment of mortgage programs that are tailored to our customers' needs, \"hands on \"management that is responsive to our lender, realtor and title partners and targeted marketing that increases awareness of our mortgage programs. We are sad to lose Dirk to the new Office of Economic Op portunity but happy he will continue to manage and guide the state's mortgage programs. We are excited to welcome the Office of Manufactured Housing to ADOH, strengthening the agencies continuum of housing to serve our state. We've been working with Debra Blake and her team at Manufactured Housing over the past few months preparing for the reorganization. They have a talented team and will fit well in our culture of continuous improvement and customer service. If you haven't heard, we've moved. Same buil ding, same FREE covered parking, but now in suite 280. Our team, headed by Carol Ditmore, did a great job designing the interior space of suite 280 so that all departments are grouped together for efficiency and easy communication and we are all in the sa me office. We're getting the finishing touches completed and look forward to showing you our new space. We've learned what's important to employees from various surveys --#1 is the culture of the company and #2 is the environment they work in. We're thankfu l for our great new work environment. Last year we got lucky and hired Jake Argon from the Senate to be our Legislative Liaison/PIO. During his time at the department Jake has done a great job. Well, the Senate gave Jake an offer he couldn't refuse and h e's heading back to the Senate to head up their research team. We wish Jake all the best and appreciate his contribution to the department. We are on the hunt for a new Legislative Liaison/PIO. If you know of a qualified person, please send them our way. We are embracing change at ADOH and looking forward to what lies ahead. A LEADING WITH SOLUTIONS 3 Spring/Summer 2016 AzHFA Activities Offering a Pathway to Homeownership uyers who use down payment assistance programs are saving an average of $17,766 over the life of the mortgage, according to a report released in June 2016 by RealtyTrac, a source for comprehensive housing data and Down Payment Resource, a web -based software company with a mission to connect people with hard -to-find financial resources. \"Homeownership programs not only help buye rs overcome the initial cost of purchasing a home, but also produce a compounding positive impact on the homeowner's saving and wealth- building capability,\" Down Payment Resource CEO Robert Chrane said. \"Saving for a down payment can be difficult for pros pective first -time homebuyers given the absence of substantial wage growth in recent years ... even just a 3% down payment requires 14% of the annual wages on average across the 513 counties we analyzed,\" RealtyTrac Senior Vice President Daren Blomquist said . The HOME Plus Home Loan Program seeks to eliminates this hurdle, offering a pathway to homeownership by giving creditworthy renters who can qualify for a mortgage, but cannot afford the down payment, the funds to move forward. For the second quarter 20 16, 989 new homebuyers have entered the HOME Plus program, with an average of $8,800 in down payment assistance made available to each homebuyer. AzHFA raises funds for our initiative in the national capital markets and forms partnerships with banking and lending institutions to facilitate our HOME Plus Home Loan Program throughout the State of Arizona. NO taxpayer funds are used for this program. ith the passage and signing of H. B. 2666 the AzHFA Board will sunset at the end of this calendar year.
