Ancient traditions like Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic healing have used medicinal herbs to treat illnesses including viruses for centuries, according to [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/antiviral-herbs). Today, many of these same herbs are probably already in your pantry. Globalization has played a major impact in the spread of viruses, reported [Eco Watch](https://www.ecowatch.com/antiviral-herbs.html). That's why eating healthy food full of essential vitamins and minerals is so important. Adding herbs with immunity boosting properties should also be a part of a healthy diet. Tap into these seven [ healing herbs](/articles/9-healing-herbs-to-use-for-wellness) that have stood the test of time to increase your resilience. Sage [Sage](/articles/cleansing-herbs-for-each-chakra) is a member of the mint family and has been used in traditional medicine to treat many illnesses including ulcers, inflammation, rheumatism, and seizures. Scientists have been studying sage for years to find out why it is such an effective natural healer. That's because the flowers, leaves, and stems of this fragrant herb contain healing phytochemicals including curcumins and flavonoids (antioxidants). A [2017 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5634728/) published in the Journal of Traditional and Complementary Medicine found that sage contains antiviral and antimicrobial properties and could play an important healing role for other illnesses. Garlic Garlic is a member of the allium family and is related to onions, chives, and leeks. [Garlic](/articles/5-proven-healthy-garlic-benefits) has been used for healing since ancient times and contains a host of medicinal properties. This tasty plant may actually boost your immune system and help prevent colds and flu. A randomly controlled [clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22280901/) found that compounds in garlic helped to reduce the severity of cold and flu symptoms by enhancing immune cell function. Echinacea This popular herb is found in many natural remedies due to its health-promoting properties according to Healthline. In fact, many parts of the plant including its roots, leaves, and flowers are used for healing. You can find herbal preparations of echinacea in supplements, lozenges, [teas](/articles/5-teas-to-warm-up-your-winter-leave-you-feeling-healthy), and tinctures. One variety, echinacea purpurea, was used by Native Americans to treat a variety of ailments including viral infections. A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4058675/) published in Pharmaceuticals found that the bioactivities found in echinacea may be an effective way to treat respiratory infections, HSV, influenza and rhinovirus. Ginger [Ginger](/articles/9-healing-ginger-benefits) also has antiviral properties because it contains potent plant compounds. It has been a mainstay of [Ayurvedic medicine](/articles/short-intro-to-ayurvedic-medicine) for centuries. Healing ginger products include teas, lozenges, and elixirs but you can purchase fresh or dried ginger in any supermarket. A [2011 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29039335/) found that the compounds gingerols and zingerone in ginger inhibits viral replication and could prevent viruses from entering host cells. Fennel Fennel, a member of the carrot family - and the bulb and seeds tastes like licorice - contains antiviral properties according to Eco Watch. In fact, [fennel](/articles/10-medicinal-plants-herbs-you-should-know) is effective against specific viruses due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunity boosting properties. A [2015 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4342739/) published in The Korean Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology found that fennel effectively blocked LPS-induced inflammation and suggested that the herb could mitigate this condition and the chronic diseases caused by inflammation. This in turn helps to boost the immune system and this will help fight off viral infections. Basil Some varieties of basil - holy and sweet - are known for combating viral infections stressed Eco Watch. Holy basil, also known as tulsi contains the compound eugenol that is responsible for increasing the immune response. Sweet basil contains the compounds ursolic acid and apigenin that have exhibited powerful antiviral effects in a [comparative study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16173941/) published in Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology & Physiology. Ginseng Ginseng has long been used in [traditional Chinese medicine](/articles/5-healthy-habits-from-traditional-chinese-medicine) and has been utilized to treat viruses and other illnesses, reported Eco Watch. The plant compound ginsenosides in ginseng was found in a [2016 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5052424/) to be effective against hepatitis B, norovirus, coxsackieviruses, and meningoencephalitis (a brain virus). The study suggested that further research should be done on ginseng to discover the antiviral components so that they can be used in new antiviral agents. "}
