You requested general information about whether amounts paid for cayenne pepper, recommended by a naturopathicphysician as a treatment for Raynaud's disease, qualify as an expense for medical careunder \u00a7 213 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 213(a) allows as a deduction the expenses paid during the taxable year for medical care of the taxpayer, spouse, or dependent. Under \u00a7 213(d)(1)(A), an expenseis for \"medical care\" if its primary purpose is the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment,or prevention of disease. The Income Tax Regulations state that the deduction for medical care expenses will be confined strictly to expenses incurred primarily for the prevention or alleviation of aphysical or mental defect or illness. An expense that is merely beneficial to the generalhealth of an individual is not an expense for medical care. Section 1.213-1(e)(1)(ii). A taxpayer who claims that an expense of a peculiarly personal nature is primarily for medical care must establish that fact. Among the objective factors that indicate that anotherwise personal expense is for medical care are the taxpayer's motive or purpose,recommendation by a physician, linkage between the treatment and the illness,treatment effectiveness, and proximity in time to the onset or recurrence of a disease.Havey v. Commissioner , 12 T.C. 409 (1949). The taxpayer must also establish that the expenses would not have been incurred \"but for\" the disease or illness. Commissioner v. Jacobs, 62 T.C. 813, 818 (1974) (legal costs related to taxpayer's divorce, claimed as treatment for depression, disallowed); Altman v. Commissioner , 53 T.C. 487 (1969) (medical deduction denied for golf expenses of taxpayer who had been playing golf for 30 years before incurring an illness). While diagnosis of a medical condition by a doctor may be helpful or necessary to establish that an amount paid is for medical care and not some other purpose, there isno requirement that treatment must be provided by a doctor or other traditional health professional. Accordingly, in Dickie v. Commissioner , T.C. Memo 1999-138, the Court held that treatments directed by a naturopathic doctor may qualify as medical care. See also, Crain v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1986-138 (holistic healing center); Tso v. Commissioner , T.C. Memo 1980-399 (Native American Rul. 70-170, 1970-1 C.B. 51 (\"patterning\" exercises administered to a mentally retarded child by a non-professional individual). Finally, the cost of food is not an expense for medical care to the extent the foodconstitutes a substitute for food that an individual would normally consume to meetnutritional requirements. Rev. Rul. 55-261, 1955-1 C.B. 307; Harris v. Commissioner , 46 T.C. 672 (1966). Applying these principles, the cost of cayenne pepper may qualify as an expense for medical care if the taxpayer can substantiate all of the following circumstances: (1) The taxpayer (or a spouse or dependent) has a medical condition (disease, illness, orinjury); (2) the taxpayer's purpose in purchasing the cayenne pepper is to treat oralleviate the medical condition; (3) the taxpayer would not have purchased the cayennepepper \"but for\" the medical condition; and (4) the taxpayer is not consuming thecayenne pepper to satisfy normal nutritional requirements.
