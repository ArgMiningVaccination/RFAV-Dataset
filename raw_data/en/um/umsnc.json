Introduction In several countries, the Long ny e l l o w t a i l Seriola rivoliana (Carangidae) is considered as one of the sh with the greatest potential for intensive aquaculture because of its fast growth, high meat quality and adaptability to intensive farming con-ditions.1,2Studies have been performed in of broodstock, and embryo toxicology, among others.1,3-7Nonetheless, little information is available related to the immune and antioxidant defense system, which could provide fundamental information forKeywords aquacultural homeopathy cytokines piscidin MyD88 Seriola rivolianaAbstract Background This research aimed to observe the effect of homeopathic treatments prepared from Vibrio parahaemolyticus and V. commercial homeopathic medication Phosphoricum acidum and Silicea terra (H2) on the immune and antioxidant response in Seriola rivoliana juveniles under usual culture conditions and challenged with V. parahaemolyticus . Materials and Methods Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to study changes in the expression of key genes related to immune response, cytokines(interleukin-1 [IL-1]), adapter protein for cytokine release (MyD88) and piscidin and spectrophotometric techniques to analyze the activity of antioxidant superoxidedismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzymes in Seriola rivoliana juveniles at 30 (weaning stage [WS]) and 60 (early juveniles [EJ]) days post-hatching. Results The H1 treatment led to over-expression of the IL-1 and MyD88 genes in sh at WS and EJ with respect to control, contrary to the H2 treatment that led to under-expression of the IL-1 , MyD88 and piscidin genes at the EJ stage. In sh challenged with V. parahaemolyticus , both H1 and H2 led to over-expression of IL-1 and MyD88; H2 caused an over-expression of piscidin. The SOD activity was higher in H1 with respect toH2 and the control group. CAT remained relatively stable with both H1 and H2treatments.Conclusions T h er e s u l t ss u g g e s tt h a tt h eo v e r a l le f f e c to fH 1w a sd u et ot h ep r e s e n c e of unknown antigens in low concentrations, while the response to H2 \u2014speci cally during challenge \u2014may have been due to a stimulating effect of nano-structures, prevailing from mother tincture after sequential dilution/succussion, in a pathwaysimilar to that attributed to nano-vaccines. received April 5, 2018accepted after revision August 22, 2018 published online November 20, 2018Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Faculty of HomeopathyDOI https://doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0038-1672197.ISSN 1475-4916.Original Research Article 43 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Problems caused by bacteria, viruses and parasiteshave been reported as limiting factors in culture of several species including Seriola spp. 8Currently, the effort to under- stand the immune system of these species continues toincrease although few characterized genes have been attrib- uted to the immune system for Seriola spp. 8,9 The innate immune system represents the rst line of protection against external pathogens, and it is considered a fundamental mechanism to maintain sh homeostasis.9,10 Innate responses act against invading organisms and foreign substances, including a complex network of cells, cell pro- ducts and molecules that operate to eliminate and/or inacti- vate the pathogen. Cells involved mononuclear phagocytes, polymor- phonuclear leukocytes, antibacterial peptides, lysozymes, cytokines,toll-like receptors (TLRs), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), among others. 11 In aquaculture, super-intensive production generally causes physiological stress which, depending on its intensity, entails several negative effects (i.e. low productive para- meters or increased sensitivity to diseases caused by oppor-tunistic organisms). 10Antibiotics, vaccines and other chemicals have been used to control the negative effects of stress, but they involve drawbacks, including suppression ofthe aquatic animal immune system, environmental hazards and food safety as human health problems. 12For this reason, the addition of immune-stimulants to sh diets has been suggested as an alternative for prophylactic treatment against disease outbreaks.12,13In this context, homeopathic medicines are offered as a safe alternative for improvementin growth and survival and stimulation of the immune system in sh, molluscs and crustaceans. 14,15Different studies have suggested that homeopathic preparations, such as Canova (Parana, CU, Brazil), can activate macro- phages, stimulate the production of ROS and positively affectsome cytokines that play an important role in in flammatory processes. 16-21 The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of homeopathic preparations with pathogenic strains of Vibrio , Phosphoricum acidum Silicea (IL-1), MyD88 and genes and the antioxidant (SOD) Previous studies have shown that Phosphoricum acidum and Silicea terra improved survival and SOD activity Argopecten ventricosus juveniles after challenge with Phosphoricum acidum and Silicea terra enhanced protection and stimulated the immune system.22It is important to note that phosphorus is considered an important mineral for immune system func-tion; 23furthermore, silica nanostructures have an ample role in aspects related to immune functions, mainly with those associated with pro-in flammatory cytokines.24The relevance of these chosen indicators is that Myd88 functions as a key downstream adapter protein for cytokinerelease; 25,26IL-1is a cytokine that regulates a variety of biological processes, associated with in flammation, immune response, leukocyte chemo-attractance;27,28and piscidin is a powerful antimicrobial peptide.29The activities of SOD and CAT can be classi ed as indirect indicators of the immune response since they neutralise the ROS that release macro-phages in the presence of pathogens or xenobiotics. 30,31 Materials and Methods Experimental Design and Culture Conditions Larviculture of S. rivoliana was developed according to Centro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas del Noroeste (CIBNOR), La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico. The experi- mental design involved two tests. Test no. 1 used 180 sh at initial weaning stage (WS, i.e., 30 dph) which were initially distributed in four 80-Liter berglass tanks (45 sh/tank). The experimental design included two tanks without homeopathic treatment (positive and negative control groups), and two tanks with homeopathic treatment. The positive control tank was named that way at rst; how- ever, at this stage the sh from that tank were not infected, until the bacterial challenge. Then, the positive control group was separated, so that density and water quality were notdifferent from the negative control. After 15 days of treatment with homeopathic medication (see next item for details), 21 sh from each tank were transferred to three experimental units (10 L), which allocated seven sh/unit for a bacterial challenge with V. parahaemolyticus . Test no. 2 used sh that were allowed to grow to juvenile stage (EJ, i.e., 60 dph). The sh were distributed in three 80-L berglass tanks (30 sh/tank) corresponding to one control and treatment tanks: Treatment (see next section). During both bioassays, environmental conditions were maintained at 24.0 /C61\u00b0C L/min. The WS sh were fed ad libitum twice daily with a commercial diet of OTOHIME B1 and B2 (Reed Mariculture Inc. Campbell, California, United proteins 51.0%, lipids 11.0%, ashes 15.0%, and carbohy-drates 3.0%). Once the sh were transferred to the 10-L bottles, they were fed once a day ( /C201% of the biomass) to avoid excess toxiccompounds inthewater (NH 3,N O 2) commonlyassociated with closed systems. The EJ sh were initially fed the diet C2 Treatment H1 (ViP 7c \u00feViA Biol\u00f3gicas del Homeopathy Longfin Yellowtai l to Homeopathic Treatments Maz\u00f3n-Su\u00e1stegui et al. 44 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Mother tincture (MT) of each bacterial strain was produced from bacterial cultures at 108CFU/mL through application of basic principles from the Mexican homeopathic pharmacopeia, using ethanol as dilution and succussion vehicle, at CIBNOR in a certi ed microbiology laboratory. Brie fly, bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation (8,000 g, 4\u00b0C, 20 minutes) from 15 mL of bacterial culture and washed twice. The corresponding pellets were diluted in 7.5 mL of MilliQ water;inactivated through three freezing-thawing cycles ( /C080\u00b0C and and sonicated eight times for 30 sec- onds each time to disrupt the cell wall and intracellularorganelles. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation (3,000 g, 4\u00b0C, 20 minutes). The resultant City,Mexico) and vortexed at 3,200 RPM (BenchMixer, Edison, New Jersey, United States) for 2 minutes to obtain 15 mL of MT from each bacterial strain. Finally, ViP 7c and ViA 7c wereobtained through dynamization (6c) with distilled water as a nal dilution and succussion vehicle. Treatment H2 (PhA 7c \u00feSiT 7c), on the other hand, was made of centesimal homeopathic dynamizations from the commercial Mexico). Dynamization (6c) was performed with distilled water as a nal dilution and succus- sion vehicle. The homeopathic preparations (6c and 7c) were stored at room temperature and protected from direct sunlight. In both tests (WS and EJ), 7c in-water dynamizations wereapplied daily directly to seawater of the experimental units f o r1 5d a y s .T h u s ,i nt h ec a s eo fH 1 ,2 5 Lo fV i P7 c / Lw a s added daily in the morning and 25 L of ViA 7c/L in the afternoon, and 25 L of PhA 7c/L and 25 L of SiT 7c/L in the morning and in the afternoon, respectively. The negativecontrol group (no homeopathic treatment) did not receive any treatment, only distilled water. The homeopathic dyna- mizations 7c and control samples were succussed in vortex at3,200 RPM (BenchMixer, Edison) for 3 minutes before being added directly into seawater of the experimental units just before feeding. In previous works, 32-35vortexing was used as succussion mechanism. We respect the homeopathic phar- macopeia, but it is necessary to have a reproducible succus- sion mechanism that can be used in any laboratory/experiment to obtain comparable results. The water flow was then closed for 1 hour, and aeration was increased to homogenize the liquid medium in the experimental units.After that time, water -airflow was restored. Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Challenge The strain of V. parahaemolyticus was obtained from CIBNOR bacterial collection (strain code A01; isolated from the digestive tract of Lutjanus guttatus with vibriosis symptoms). This bacterium was grown in TBS liquid medium (tryptic soy broth, BD catalog, 211825, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, New United States) supplementedwith 2.5% NaCl and incubated at 35\u00b0C for 24 hours. The bacteria were harvested in nal exponential phase (retarda- tion) by centrifugation at 8,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 20 minutes and then washed with sterile PBS. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in sterile seawater. Subse-quently, the bacterial suspension was adjusted using a spectrophotometer (Jenway 6505, Felsted, United Kingdom) at an optical density from 1 nm to 600 nm (OD 600\u00bc1) equivalent to 107CFU/mL. For the bacterial challenge, the equivalent of 105CFU/mL was added to the experimental units of 10 L and conducted for 3 days with a positive controlthat consisted of challenging sh without homeopathic medication. Collection of Fish Samples Animal Research Ethics The experiment complied with the Guidelines of the Eur- opean Union Council (2010/63/EU) and the Mexican Govern- ment (NOM-062 \u2014ZOO-1999) for the production, care, and use of experimental animals, and with the ARRIVE guidelines. All the experimental protocols and procedures were care- fully revised and approved by an internal committee atCIBNOR ( Supplementary File 1 [available in online version only]). A completed ARRIVE Guidelines Checklist is provided asSupplementary File 2 (available in online version only). The Long n yellowtails ( Seriola rivoliana ) were main- tained, by trained staff, under standard conditions in terms of temperature, salinity, oxygen supply, and appropriatephotoperiod according to the age for this species. Water- quality parameters were checked and controlled early every morning before food administration; the resulting waterquality measurements complied with the standard require- ments for this species. In accordance with the EU Directive, our research was developed following the principles of the '3Rs '(Replacement, Reduction and Re nement). This investigation required us to use live sh to know the effects on growth, immune and antioxidant response in whole animals, so they could not be replaced. The lowest number of experimental animals wasused based on the need to obtain information of a given amount and precision, considering the minimum numbers of individuals to perform robust statistical analysis and thusobtain meaningful results. The state-of-the-art nature of our laboratory analytical methods ensured the technical preci- sion needed to ensure minimum sample size. Regardingrenement, any distress or physical harm to the animals was contained to an absolute minimum by our use of efcient euthanasia at the time of tissue sampling at the experimental end-point: each sampled sh was euthanized with an overdose of 2-phenoxyethanol (56753 Sigma- Aldrich, Missouri, United States). It was then dissected ona frozen glass to avoid wastage through enzyme denatura- tion, and to separate and weigh the organs of our interest. Anticipating these experimental methods, it was judgedprospectively that these minimized harmful effects on the living animals would be outweighed by signi cant scienti c discovery likely to result from the work.

Sample Collection At the end of the 15-day bioassay with homeopathic and control treatments (before challenge), 18 sh were randomly taken from each experimental unit to perform the analyses contemplated in this study. After removal of intestines, totalribonucleic acid (RNA) was isolated and gene expression was performed from the IL-1 , MyD88 and piscidin CT activities ( n\u00bc9) were also performed. Subsequently, after the challenge (3 days), three sh were taken per replicate ( n\u00bc9) to observe the expression of the mentionedgenes. In addition, intestine and liver samples werecollected to determine SOD and CAT activities. The intestine was used not only because it is the part where the digestive functions take place but it also acts as a microbial barrier andsynthesizes immune-related molecules. 8The liver was selected as the main metabolic organ where antioxidant reactions take place, such as those performed by the SOD,CAT and glutathione peroxidase enzymes and others. Finally, in test no. 2, the sample collection was performed in a similar way as before the challenge. Samples for gene expression wereimmersed in Eppendorf tubes with RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scienti c, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States) solution and placed at 4\u00b0C for 24 hours and then stored at /C080\u00b0C. For enzymatic activity, the samples were immersed in a buffer solution (Tris-HCl 50 mmol, and CaCl 220 mmol pH 7.5) in a 1:5 (w:v) proportion and stored at /C080\u00b0C until processing. RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis, and qPCR For the extraction of total RNA from the intestines, TRIzol RNA Isolation Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scienti c, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States) and a tissue homogeniser (FastPrep-24 5G, M.P. Biomedicals, Santa Ana, California,United States) were used according to the manufacturer 's instructions. Subsequently, a DNase treatment with RQ1 RNase-Free DNase kit (Promega, Madison, United States) was performed. The concentration and purity of the RNA were determined with NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo FisherScienti c, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States) and RNA quality was observed on agarose gel (1.5%) with Sybr Safe DNA Gel Stain (Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom).Finally, the Improm II kit (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States) was used for cDNA synthesis following the manufacturer 's instructions. The reaction was performedwith 2.5 g of total RNA in iCycler thermocycler (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, California, United States). The primers used for IL-1, MyD88, and piscidin, which were speci cf o r S. rivoliana , were obtained from the GeneBank database. Table 1 details the sequences of the primers used for qPCR analyses. The qPCR performed using a Bio-Rad CFX 96 thermo- cycler (BioRad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, to analyzethe expression of IL-1 , MyD88, piscidin, and 18S genes. The latter was taken as the reference gene. A standard curve was used to choose the working dilution according to the highest ef ciency (% E). The qPCR assay was performed in triplicate for each sample, taking a total volume of 10 L containing 2- L cDNA, 0.20 L primers (50 M), 5- L SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules,California, United States) and 2.8 L of sterile water. A negative control (NTC -no template control) was included for each of the reaction sets on each plate (96-well plate). The reactionswere incubated using the following conditions: one cycle at 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes; 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds; 60\u00b0C for 30 seconds. To perform the analysis, the normalized relativeexpression to the control group was taken into account. Biochemical Analyses Samples (intestine and liver) for this test were processed into their preservation buffer using a tissue homogenizer (Fas- tPrep-24 5G, MP Biomedicals, were then centrifuged (Eppendorf 5430R, Hamburg, Germany) at 13,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes; the supernatant was used for the biochemical assays: Superoxide Dismutase and Catalase Activities Superoxide using colori-metric kit catalog 19160 (SOD determination kit, Sigma- Aldrich, Missouri, United States) according to the manufac- turer 's instructions. Expressing the SOD activity in U mg of protein (U SOD/mg protein), the concentration of soluble microplate proteins was determined previously using theBradford 36method and bovine serum albumin as standard in Varioskan (Thermo Scienti c, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States) similar to that proposed by Eyckmans et al.37 The CT activity was studied with the Clairborne38method, where the decrease in H 2O2absorbance was measured at 240 nm.

Statistical Analysis All tests corresponded to a completely randomized design.Before and after challenge, 18 individuals were selected from each treatment to take measurements, gene expression, and antioxidant activity. RNA extractions and homogenates wereperformed for this effect by pooling three individuals, and expression and activity data were presented as mean /C6 standard error (SE). For the challenge, from each replicate,three individuals were taken to make the analyses. All gene expression analyses were performed using the Cq method with the Bio-Rad CFX Manager 3.1 Gene Study software (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, California, United States) using the ef ciency- corrected values of Cq. 39The qPCR data were normalized to the geometric mean of the expression ef ciency-corrected data for 18S. The expression difference between treated and control sh was tested by signi cant differences in Bio-Rad CFX Manager 3.1 UnitedStates), t-test. 40Differences were considered statistically signi cant if p<0.05.For the analysis of antioxidant enzymes, the sampling procedure was similar to that described previously in thissection. Antioxidant activity data were presented for SOD and CAT as mean /C6SD of U SOD mg/protein and nmol/min/ mL, respectively. For the challenge, three sh were also taken per replicate. The photometric readings for each sample were done in triplicate. All comparisons were made between individuals of the same stage, using a one-way ANOVA,followed by Tukey 's multiple range analysis if signi cant differences were found. Statistical analyses were performed with a signi cance level of 5% ( \u00bc0.05) using the software Statistica 10 (StatSoft, Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States).

In H2- treated sh, the IL-1 and MyD88 genes showed similar expression to that of the control, whereas the piscidin gene showed under-expression. In EJ sh, the H1 treatment to over-expression of the IL-1 , MyD88, and piscidin genes with respect to control, contrary to the H2 treatment that led to under-expression of all evaluated genes ( Fig. 1B ). In WS and EJsh treated with H1, a common pattern was observed, which was a greater expression of IL-1 and MyD88 with respect to the control ( Fig. 1 A, B). Antioxidant Activities of Superoxide dismutase and Catalase Superoxide dismutase activity before challenge in WS sh can be observed in Fig. 2A ; in all cases, the SOD activity in intestine was higher than 40 U SOD/mg of protein. The SOD activity was higher in H1 relative to control and in H2 lower than that observed in weaned larvae ( Fig. 2C ). Once more, SOD activity was higher with H1 relative to H2 and control. The activity pattern of thisenzyme in this organ was similar to that obtained in WS sh. Furthermore, no differences in SOD activity were observed inthe liver of these sh ( Fig. 2C ). Catalase activity in intestine in WSsh ranged from 4.33 to 6.52 nmol/min/mL. The highest average CAT activity was that of the control, and it was signicantly different from that of H2 ( Fig. 3A ). The H1 treatment showed an intermediate CAT activity between thetwo groups (control and H2). In the EJ intestine, no signi cant differences were observed for this enzyme ( Fig. 3C ). In the liver of the sh treated with H1, CAT activity was greater than that of the control group, and H2 had an intermediate activity between the control and H1 ( Fig. 3C ).

On the other hand, H1 and H2 induced a greater relative gene expression than the control groups (positive and negative) in IL-1 and MyD88; additionally, H2 produced a greater expression in piscidin with respect to the positive and negative control groups.

In all treatments, the activity of this enzyme was signi cantly higher than that of the negative control treatment ( Fig. 2B ). The positive control and H2 showed similar SOD activity with 24.29 and 25.13 U SOD/mg of protein, respectively. The highest activity of SOD wasrecorded with the H1 treatment ( Fig. 2B ). Catalase activity in challenged sh ranged from 3.02 to 5.46 nmol/min/mL (Fig. 3B ). The average activity of the control groups (nega- tive, positive) and H2 was statistically similar and lower than that of H1 ( Fig. 2B ). Discussion In intensive aquaculture, factors such as high organic content, low dissolved oxygen and high planting density, among others, can cause physiological alterations that contribute to the increase in susceptibility of sh to stress and infections. Infectious diseases of bacterial origin are perhaps the most signicant factors affecting aquaculture.30,41One of the major diseases affecting a wide variety of sh, molluscs, and crusta- ceans is vibriosis produced by V. parahaemolyticus .42Recently, researchers have made efforts to develop alternatives to increase resistance to vibriosis by strengthening the immuneresponse (i.e., immunotherapy, probiotics). 42,43 Our study has explored the effect of two homeopathic treatments on the innate and antioxidant immune response,mainly in the intestine of juveniles of S. rivoliana since the intestinal tissue constitutes the most extensive and complex part of the immune system of teleost sh; 44thus, the challenges were conducted with V. parahaemolyticus that affects this organ mainly.45,46Our results indicated that the application of H1 led to increased expressions in the MyD88 and IL-1 genes in WS sh. In EJ, additional expression of these two genes was also detected, as well as over-expressionof the piscidin gene. Attenuated pathogenic bacteria or microorganisms or their diluted and succussed components, in accordance withhomeopathic pharmacopeia, have been used to stimulate immune responses. The preparation of homeopathic bacteria, fungi, viruses or parasites (i.e., nosodes) 47has shown to have bacteriostatic,48anti-cancer,49and anti-parasitic activities50 and in flammatory response.51,52In a recent study, Reyes-Becerril et al43evaluated infection with the samelivebacterium. In the particularcaseof the IL-1 gene, they observed over-expression in four tissues (including intes- tine) relative to the control group when the sh were stimu- lated with lysate-vp. Subsequently, Reyes-Becerril et al44found that lysate-vp stimulated the expression of the TLR5 gene in intestine and also regulated the expression of the genes involved in protection against bacteria, such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-17. Though the methods for preparation and administration of lysate-vp and H1 were different, our results were similarto those reported by these researchers. This type of response can be attributed to the fact that lysates havedifferent antigens ( flagellin, lipopolysaccharides, exopoly- saccharides, and outer membrane proteins, among others) that have been shown to have immunogenic properties.Apparently in our experiment, the antigens (despite being diluted) could transfer some speci cs i g n a l st h a tw e r ea b l e to promote and modulate th e immune response in the host organism. 14,53,54 Taking into account that the dilution used in this work, which did not exceed the Avogadro limit ( <12c), we considered that the regulation of expression was consistent with the proposal by Khuda-Bukhsh55that homeopathic medications carry speci c\"signals \"that can be identi ed by speci c receptors and may activate or deactivate some genes in response to a stimulus. For this reason, the gene expression response under the H1 treatment seemed toindicate the initiation of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) recognition by a TLR receptor, which sent activation signals to MyD88 and TRAF6 and translocation toNF-kB to the nucleus of the cells of the intestinal tissue, inducing the expression of pro-in flammatory cytokines such as IL-1 . 26,43The above was related to the high expression of the MyD88 and IL-1 genes observed. How- ever, a high expression of MyD88 could also have been responsible for the expression of other pro-in flammatory cytokines (i.e., tumour necrosis factor- [TNF]).44,56 In our study with the H1 treatment, a greater expression of piscidin gene than that of the control group was observed in EJ,but in newly WS sh the expression level was similar to that of the control group. This behavior may have been related to the stimulatory effect of PAMPs on phagocytic cells responsible forproducing peptides such as piscidin. The expression of the piscidin gene showed high inter- and intra-species variation, which had been observed to increase with age or degree of development of the organism. 57Future studies, such as immune-related transcriptomic analyses, are necessary toknow the ontogeny of the genes associated with immune response in S. rivoliana to avoid under- or over-estimating the real effects of the treatments in both developmental stagesand under an immunosuppressor. At present, antimicrobial peptides, such as piscidins, have received more attention at the biotechnological level. They are small peptides (18 to 26 aminoacids), highly conserved at the amino terminus, rich in histi- dine and phenylalanine, 29,58possessing activity against bac- teria, fungi, and some parasites.59,60They are distributed in different tissues of teleost sh and show diverse mechanisms of action that have been previously described.61 In recent years the uses of molecular tools, such as microarrays and RNAseq, have made it possible to know that some homeopathic medicines generate changes in the expression of different genes. For example, de Oliveira et al17 observed that using Canova less than 1% ethanol in distilled water) induced a decrease in IL-2 and IL-4 expression and a differential expression of 147 genes with respect to the control group in rodent cells.

At transcriptome level, the authors indicated that Canova generated alterations in the pro le of gene expres- sion, related to the activation of the macrophages. Forexample, Bigagli et al 62observed 3c, 5c, 7c caused modulation of several genes in the RWPE-1 cell line, many of them related to in flammatory processes and oxidative stress. Similar studies with RNA microarrays have been reported by Bellavite et al63and Saha et al,53 indicating that certain homeopathic medications can mod- ulate gene expression in various cell types, making regula- tory changes in multiple variables at once and activating biological signaling cascades. In addition, other studies havedocumented the ability of homeopathic treatments to mod- ulate heat shock protein patterns and release cytokines, macrophages and lymphocyte activation. 64 In regard to antioxidant activity, the H1 treatment caused greater SOD activity in the intestine of WS and EJ. CAT activity remained similar to that of the control in H1, although suchactivity was lower in H2-treated WS sh. Similar results have been reported with the administration of some probiotics in sh. 65In vertebrates, phagocytosis has been associated with the production of ROS, such as superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical, which are highly toxic to bacteria.30The SOD is the rst line of defense to remove superoxide anion, while CAT removes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from the previous reaction.37,66The recording of SOD and CAT activities can be classi ed as an indirect measurement of the action of leukocyte effector molecules (ROS) to eliminate microorganisms.30The increased activity of SOD with H1 may have been directly related to IL-1 gene expression under the same treatment. as IL-1 , TNF-and interferon- , shown to induce ROS production via the NADPH oxidase pathway in different cell types.67de Oliveira et al16observed that the use of Canova stimulated the production of ROS and NO (nitric oxide) inmacrophages, increasing NADPH oxidase activity and induc- synthase respectively. Despite increased SOD activity in H1-treated sh, CAT activity was not higher than that of the control (except for liver in EJ). Higher SOD activity may suggest higher catalyzing superoxide anion to H 2O2, which could also mean more substrate action for CAT (to transform H 2O2into water and molecular oxygen). However, different investigations have not reported such reciprocal behavior (direct relationship). Forexample, in several experiments with xenobiotics in sh, it has been observed that certain conditions have given rise to high SOD and low CAT activities, and vice versa. 68,69Guzm\u00e1n- Villanueva et al70observed an increase in SOD activity peru supplemented with 0.1% -1,3/1,6- glucan, whereas no signi cant changes of CAT activity were observed; something similar to that was observed in the intestine of WS and EJ sh treated with H1. In the samespecies, Reyes-Becerril et al43observed that sh immunized with V. parahaemolyticus toxin ToxA-Vp exhibited higher CAT activity than the control group without direct proportional changes in SOD activity. Therefore, no single activity pattern for SOD andCAT has been observed, since physiological, experimental or developmental state conditions may vary and induce suchdifferences. It is also important to mention that the catalysis developed by CAT can also be ful lled by glutathione perox- idase. 71For this reason, future investigations should include this last enzyme for better understanding of the enzymatic antioxidant process. Currently, three main types of hypothetical mechanisms of action for homeopathic medicines are under considera- tion: nanobubbles-related hormesis, vehicle-related electric resonance, and quantum non-locality.72Nonetheless, further studies are needed to corroborate whether and which of these hypotheses may be related to potential cellular effects of homeopathic preparations.73In our experience, rather than using physical-chemical methods to corroborate or prove any of these hypotheses, selective gene expression can be used instead to demonstrate the effect of homeo-pathic medication at transcriptomic and functional levels. In the effect of treatments with sh challenged with V. para- haemolyticus, H1 elicited an over-expression of IL-1 and MyD88 during the challenge, whereas H2 caused an over- expression of all the genes analyzed with respect to the unchallenged control. The H2 treatment contained Phos- phoricum acidum and Silicea terra . Various investigations have indicated that nanoparticles (NPs) are formed during the dilution and succussion process, to which the biologicaleffects of certain ultra-diluted substances have been largely attributed. 48,64,71,74 Chikramane et al74mentioned that silver grinding with lactose and subsequent successive dilution and succussion up to 7c can be achieved to obtain 200 ng/mL of silver NPs. In our research, the biological effect of H2 during the challengecould have been due to the NPs that might be formed from Phosphoricum acidum and Silicea terra MTs during the dilu- tion -succussion process up to 7c. Several investigations have mentioned the potential of certain NPs to stimulate the immune system: mainly silica, gold and silver. 75In this regard, homeopathic medications containing Phosphoricum acidum and Silicea terra have biological and functional effects, such as improved growth (height and weight), aswell as survival and enhancement of immune response against V. alginolyticus in juvenile Catarina scallop A. ven- tricosus . 14Nevertheless, the reason that a greater relative expression of the evaluated genes was not provoked in unchallenged WS and EJ may be that the NPs that could be formed (dilution-succussion) by themselves did not cause astimulating effect. The opposite effect observed before and after challenge was a marked feature of the homeopathy (H2: PhA 7c \u00feSiT 7c) used in this work because H2-treated sh showed a gene over-expression after challenge. In our case, the challenge with V. parahaemolyticus could be classi ed as a stressor, which may be the reason that sh subjected to the H2 treatment have responded with a greater expression of the genes evaluated in response to such stimuli. As discussed before, we are not sure that NPs were genera- ted by the succussion process; nonetheless, vast information exists concerning the biological effect of silica NPs. Compared with other NPs, nanosilica has a well-documented ability to Homeopathy Vol. 108 No. 1/2019Responses of Longfin Yellowtai l to Homeopathic Treatments Maz\u00f3n-Su\u00e1stegui et al. 50 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

The stimulatory potential of NPs has been reported to be closely linked to the size and shape of the particles.76,77 There is a discussion concerning particle sizes and their effects on cytokine stimulation because highly variable and contradictory results -and even null cases -have been observed.78-80Some evidence has been reported that under certain conditions some NPs by themselves do not cause inflammation and require synergistic effects: for example, with other NPs to induce in flammatory responses in macro- phages81or any type of immunosuppression.82This last reason allows us to suggest a pathway by which H2 could stimulate the expression of IL-1 challenged with V. para- haemolyticus , which has been described as having NPs as adjuvants (nano-vaccines) by Boraschi and Italiani81based on the principles of vaccines. In this potential scenario, thebacterial stimulus (PAMPs) would trigger activation via TLR- MyD88-NF-kB causing expression of IL-1 ; furthermore, H2 would increase IL-1 expression through induced in flamma- some activation by a slight stimulus of NPs of Phosphoricum acidum and Silicea terra recognized as damage associated with molecular patterns. On the other hand, over-expressionof piscidin with H2 may have a direct relationship with over- expression of IL-1 rather than a possible stimulation per se of H2; as this cytokine promotes the recruitment of phago-cytes and a greater number of cells stimulated by pathogens, its expression in the tissue may tend to be higher. 82 Besides the activity pattern of antioxidant enzymes dur- ing challenge, we hypothesize that the increased SOD activity of phagocytes could have been induced because of the ability of IL-1 to enhance superoxide production to eliminate bacteria during the phagocytosis process. One of the main roles of this enzyme is to avoid oxidation of cell structures and thus oxidative stress. Conclusion This investigation observed that the homeopathic treat-ments used caused an effect that could be detected andevaluated at the molecular and enzymatic levels. Our results and recent literature have indicated that the cells have the capacity to receive these signals and translate them tomaintain physiological balance. In many cases, the non-expected responses in relation to homeopathic experimentation may have been due to differ-ences in experimental methods between studies or forms and preparation of these medications ( i.e., succussion mechanism). In our case, the use of tools such as omics (i.e., transcrip- tomics, proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics and inter- actomics) may continue to elucidate the possible routes ofaction of these compounds. Finally, we consider that the homeopathic medications used in this study in S. rivoliana can be used for preventive purposes which, together with anappropriate diet and good management practices, can improve welfare conditions of cultivated organisms at dif- ferent levels of their development.Highlights \u0081Effect of two homeopathic treatments on immune and antioxidant response in Seriola rivoliana was evaluated. \u0081Homeopathy generated from Vibrio pathogenic strains caused stimulation of immune system in Seriola rivoliana . \u0081The expression of MyD88 and IL-1 by nosode seems to initiate a cascade of intracellular signaling initiated bythe recognition of a PAMP by the TLR-like receptor.
