Well, maybe you don't have to. I am a naturopathic doctor specialized in treating chronic and difficult cases. I believe that there is a root cause of every health complaint and when that root cause is uncovered, health may be restored. Be it a stubborn migraine headache, or complicated systemic lupus, I will do my best to help you in identifying and correcting the imbalance of the body and relieve your suffering. Being a board-certified naturopathic physician, I practice integrative medicine, which combines conventional Western medicine with acupuncture, Chinese herbs, homeopathy, and nutritional supplements. I call myself a health detective and my goal with patients is to figure out underlying causes of their conditions and to lead them to health with the most effective and safest treatment. I especially enjoy helping people with immune disorders, such as allergies, asthma, various autoimmune conditions, cancer prevention and adjunct supportive care during cancer chemotherapy. Being a female myself, I am also passionate about helping women with menstrual disorders, infertility, and menopause. I hold a doctorate of Naturopathic Medicine from Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine, where I graduated with the Highest Academic Achievement Award. I also hold a Master of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Delaware. In 2004, I decided to change my well-established career in computer engineering to naturopathic medicine after experiencing the wonderful healing power of a simple homeopathic remedy. It has been such a blessing for me to have discovered naturopathic medicine and to be able to help others to achieve health. "}
