Autism, also called ASD, is usually characterized by a lack of social awareness, social skills or communication difficulties. ASD presents in different ways in different individuals.

Resources for Adults and Adolescents The Adult Diagnostic Clinic at OSF HealthCare Saint Francis Medical Center evaluates adolescents age 14 and up and adults of all ages. While many people with ASD are diagnosed in childhood, some adults may have an autism spectrum condition that has never been diagnosed - especially in those who grew up before autism was recognized as a neurological condition. A diagnosis is important because it: - Helps individuals understand their situation and gives them a sense of self - Avoids inappropriate labels such as lazy, unmotivated or stubborn - May help qualify an individual for appropriate community assistance Evaluation and diagnosis Each appointment is tailored to fit each person's unique needs, but in general you can expect your first appointment to last longer than a normal doctor's appointment. These evaluations typically begin in the morning and last into the early afternoon. During your appointment, you will meet with a neuropsychologist - a psychologist who is specially trained to understand the relationship between the brain and behavior. The neuropsychologist will do some testing to determine if a person's behavior meets the criteria for a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. You may be asked to schedule additional appointments to help assess your strengths and weaknesses in areas such as thinking skills and academic abilities. After your evaluation, you will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment, where your provider will explain the results of your evaluation and make recommendations for treatment or other resources. Request an appointment To request an autism evaluation, ask your doctor for a referral to the Adult Diagnostic Clinic at OSF Saint Francis. After we've received a referral from your provider, we will call you to schedule your appointment. Referring providers can call (309) 655-7378 for further instructions. "}
