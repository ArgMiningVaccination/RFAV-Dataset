In recent years, digitally delivered complimentary therapies, such as meditation, 34 have gained attention in cancer research and advocacy communities for improving quality of life. 35 However, most digital meditation resources are commercially available and are not tailored to 36 the unique needs of cancer patients (addressing fears of recurrence). As such, this study lays the 37 foundation to co-design a publicly available digital meditation program called iCANmeditate that 38 contains cancer-specific meditation content. 39Aims 40 41 To understand: (1) cancer patients' perceptions and practices of meditation, as well as their needs 42 in addressing the stress that accompanies their cancer diagnosis and (2) current knowledge of 43 meditation and prescribing trends amongst oncologists in Canada. 44Methods and analysis 45 46 A mixed-methods design comprised of online patient and oncologist surveys and a series of 47 patient focus groups will be used. Survey data analysis will use multivariate logistic regressions 48 to examine predictors of: (1) interest in using a meditation app among patients and (2) 49 prescribing meditation among oncologists. Patient focus groups will gather insights about the .

Once the program has been finalized in partnership with cancer patient participants, 58 a usability and pilot study will follow to test the functionality and efficacy of the tool. Results 59 from the oncologist survey will form the basis of knowledge mobilization efforts to facilitate 60 clinical buy-in and awareness of the benefits of meditation to cancer patients. 61Introduction 62 63 Most people with cancer experience heightened levels of stress, which can continue post- 64 recovery for many.(1, 2) This stress can take several forms including psychological and physical 65 stress, as well as stress that accompanies patients' fears of uncertainty about the future.(3) Such 66 stressors have been associated with changes in immune system function, negative mental health 67 outcomes, and reduced quality of life.(4) Moreover, some of the core symptoms that have been 68 identified as requiring improved management strategies among cancer patients go hand-in-hand 69 with stress such as: anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain, and insomnia.(5) Although several 70 medications can assist with the management of these symptoms, cancer patients have 71 increasingly become interested in using complementary therapies due to their perceived safety, 72 potential for reducing side effects, and improving overall well-being.(6, 7) .

As a whole, 76 meditation can refer to several different techniques (e.g., body-centered, mindful, or 77 contemplative) and relies on different bodily mechanisms to focus one's attention (e.g., breath, 78 sounds, visualizations).(10) With its roots in Eastern spiritual traditions, it has gained widespread 79 appeal in healthcare and clinical practice guidelines as an evidence-based therapy for improving 80 mental health (i.e., anxiety, depression, psychological distress), physical health (e.g., sleep, 81 fatigue, pain, feeling sick), and overall quality of life in those affected by cancer.(11, 12) 82 The uptake of meditation in cancer populations is also rising, marked by surveys 83 demonstrating over one third of patients use it as a form of complementary therapy,(6) and via 84 the growing number of studies examining its efficacy across different types and stages of 85 cancer.(13-17) Moreover, a general shift towards offering meditation as a digital resource has 86 been observed within the last decade, as compared to traditional in-person sessions. Many 87 scholars argue that online or smartphone-based meditation apps offer cancer patients greater 88 flexibility and access to care, by removing some of the reported challenges of attending face-to- 89 face classes such as: lack of nearby services, competing interests for time (e.g., appointments, 90 caregiver availability, childcare), and committing to travel and lengthy sessions when distressed 91 and fatigued.(18-20) In addition, recent findings have also shown a preference among cancer 92 patients for using smartphone applications to learn about support care services, particularly 93 among younger and non-white patients thereby making digital meditation a potentially viable 94 support service.(21) .

We will be conducting this 110 study with the guidance of one of the authors, Dr. Punam Rana who is a medical oncologist and 111 certified meditation teacher (https://drpunamrana.com/). However, to accomplish this our team 112 must first understand: (1) patient perceptions and practices of meditation as well as the needs and 113 concerns of cancer patients' experiences with stress and coping with their diagnosis and (2) 114 current knowledge of meditation and prescribing trends amongst oncologists. To date, only one 115 study has examined the knowledge and perceptions of meditation among cancer patients in 116 preparation for designing a tool.(27) Overall, this study found that while the benefits of 117 meditation were generally understood by cancer patients, one of the main barriers to engaging .

In addition, these scholars found that 119 experience with meditation use seemed to vary by gender, age, and education level, however, 120 interest in a digital resource was highly correlated with reporting a higher level of stress.(27) 121 Although these findings are important for understanding the characteristics of cancer patients 122 who may be more likely to use and benefit from a digital meditation tool, this study was limited 123 to melanoma patients and is not generalizable to all cancer types and stages. 124 125 Aim of the study 126 127 We propose to conduct a survey and in-depth focus groups on patient knowledge, prior 128 use, and attitudes towards meditation as it relates to their experiences of stress and coping with 129 their diagnosis. In addition, we also propose to survey Canadian oncologists on their current 130 knowledge and attitudes towards meditation, as no study to date has been conducted in this area 131 to our knowledge. The survey will ask oncologists about their awareness of different digital 132 meditation resources and clinical practice guidelines, as well as current practices in prescribing 133 meditation to their patients. As this study is exploratory in nature, no a priori hypotheses were 134 made. 135 Methods 136 137 Participants 138 Patients .

Individuals will not be excluded based 144 on type or stage of cancer, however those with cognitive impairments, psychiatric illness, or are 145 too distressed to participate as identified by clinicians will be excluded. The following types of 146 cancer will be excluded from the sample as they are not currently treated at the clinic: head, 147 neck, sarcoma, skin, melanoma, gynecological cancers. 148 149 Oncologists 150 Members of the Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists (CAMO) will be invited to 151 take part in a brief online survey about their perspectives on prescribing meditation to improve 152 quality of life in cancer patients. CAMO is comprised of over 350 members that include: medical 153 oncologists, residents, fellow, and associates. Eligibility criteria will consist of being 18 years of 154 age or older, having completed their fellowship, and practicing medical oncology. 155 Study Design and Procedures 156 Patient Survey and Focus Groups 157 Eligible participants will be identified through Humber River Health's Cancer Clinic 158 outpatient treatment appointment lists, and clinical eligibility will be determined in consultation 159 with a clinical nurse coordinator.

Patients will be invited to participate in a survey about 163 cancer patient's well-being, including experiences of stress, anxiety, and quality of life. To 164 ensure that patients in the clinic understand research activities are not a part of standard clinical 165 care, posters will be placed in the cancer clinic waiting room. To reduce self-selection biases 166 (i.e., recruiting only participants who are interested in meditation), and capture a wide range of 167 patients' perceptions and barriers towards meditation, participants will be blinded to the purpose 168 of the survey. Consent forms and recruitment scripts will not include any mention of meditation. 169 Interested potential participants will be directed to an online consent form by research staff on 170 their individual integrated bedside terminal (i.e., tablet); this is a confidential and private tablet 171 available to each patient receiving treatment in the cancer clinic. Informed consent will include 172 an optional consent to be contacted for future studies and anonymous data sharing (i.e., open 173 science). To ensure consent is informed, potential participants will be provided with the 174 opportunity to ask questions and express concerns to research staff, with teach-back strategies 175 being used as needed.(28) Those who complete the consent form will be redirected to an online 176 survey. Upon survey completion participants will be debriefed about the true aims of the study 177 (i.e., to understand patient perspectives and experience with meditation in preparation of 178 developing a digital meditation tool) and will be provided with a patient resource about 179 meditation. If participants feel some discomfort in reflecting about their wellbeing and quality of 180 life even after they complete the survey, there is a distress centre phone number indicated on the 181 consent form. In addition, all participants who complete the survey will be provided with a $5 182 physical gift card as a token of appreciation. 183 Participants who indicate on the survey that they would be interested in using a digital 184 meditation resource and participating in online focus groups to help develop a cancer-specific .

Participant 186 characteristics and experience with meditation will be used to guide the selection of participants; 187 a maximum of 15 participants will be recruited for two independent focus groups. This will be a 188 purposive, homogeneous sample of approximately six to eight participants per focus group, with 189 a cancer diagnosis, and some experience with meditation. Focus groups with an overarching 190 homogeneous composition can be desirable to create a comfortable environment for self- 191 expression amongst participants who have a shared experience.(29, 30) Participants who are 192 selected for participation will be emailed a consent form outlining the study in greater detail. To 193 ensure consent is informed, participants will be encouraged to discuss questions and concerns 194 with research staff via email or phone calls prior to consenting to participate; again teach-back 195 strategies will be used when appropriate.(28) Those who complete the consent form will be 196 invited to attend up to four online focus groups. All participants who engage in focus groups will 197 be compensated with the equivalent of $25/hour in the form of an electronic gift card (maximum 198 compensation of $200 if participants attend 4 focus group sessions). All focus group sessions 199 will be video, and audio recorded as well as transcribed verbatim. The video files will be 200 permanently deleted, and the audio files will be kept for analysis. Risks of participating in focus 201 groups may be momentarily discomfort of talking about their cancer experiences or hearing 202 others' experiences; if participants still feel distress after the focus group sessions, they may refer 203 to the Distress Centres of Greater Toronto phone number indicated on the consent form as a way 204 to seek professional help. All identifying information from audio transcripts will be removed. 205 Oncologist Survey 206 Medical oncologists who are members of CAMO will be invited to complete a survey 207 about their perspectives and knowledge of meditation for improving quality of life in cancer .

To promote recruitment efforts, up to two reminders will be 209 sent 1-week post-initial survey email blast, and first reminder, respectively. Those who are 210 interested in completing the survey will be directed to an electronic consent form via a link 211 contained in the invitation email. Potential participants who complete the electronic consent will 212 be automatically directed to the survey on their browser. Upon completion of the survey, 213 oncologists will be provided with a meditation resource that they can view and download. 214 Participants will be compensated with a $5 electronic gift card. 215 216 Meditation Resources 217 All meditation resources in this study provide a plain-language overview of meditation 218 and draw on existing meditation resources provided by the Canadian Cancer Society, the 219 National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering 220 Cancer Centre. All materials have been reviewed for accuracy by the clinical subject matter lead 221 for meditation. 222 Patient Meditation Resource 223 Following the completion of the patient survey, participants will be offered a tri-fold 224 brochure that provides a plain-language overview of what meditation is and how it has been 225 shown to benefit cancer patients. The brochure will also provide them with a link and QR code to 226 Dr. Punam Rana's website, where they will have access to additional resources and information. 227 Oncologist Meditation Resource 228 A one-page document will also be made available at the end of the survey to oncologists 229 who express interest in learning more about meditation (i.e., respond \"yes\" to survey item asking 230 about interest in meditation resources).

In 238 addition, clinical characteristics such as cancer diagnosis details (i.e., type, stage, date of 239 diagnosis) and mental health outcomes will also be assessed.(31, 32) 240 Mindfulness. Everyday mindfulness will be measured using the Cognitive and Affective 241 Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), which measures the following aspects of mindfulness: 242 present-focused attention, awareness, and nonjudgmental acceptance of thoughts and 243 emotions.(33) This tool has been shown to be suitable for use in meditating as well as non- 244 meditating samples, and is commonly used in cancer patient samples to assess individual 245 differences in dispositional mindfulness.(27) This study will use the brief 10-item version of the 246 tool, where scores range from 10 to 40,with higher scores representing greater self-reported 247 mindfulness. 248 Experience With Meditation. A series of questions have been developed by the team, in 249 consultation with a meditation expert (Dr. Punam Rana), to assess patients' practice of 250 meditation. In particular, participants will be asked about: type of meditation practiced (e.g., 251 mindful, transcendental); resources used (e.g., apps, books, websites); tools to assist in 252 meditating (e.g., incense, mat, bells); duration and frequency of practice (months/years, 253 daily/weekly/monthly); and changes in meditation since their cancer diagnosis (decision to .

In addition, participants will also be asked about current interest in learning 255 more about meditation, continuing their current practice, and the extent to which they feel their 256 practice of meditation is helpful. 257 Barriers to Meditation. Perceived barriers for meditating among cancer patients who currently 258 meditate, versus those who do not practice meditation will be assessed using the Determinants of 259 Meditation Practice Inventory - Revised (DMPI-R).(34) This briefer version of the full 260 DMPI,(35) is a psychometrically validated 12-item self-report tool that measures 4 subscales of 261 barriers to meditating: low perceived benefit, perceived inadequate knowledge, perceived 262 pragmatic barriers, and perceived socio-cultural conflict. Each subscale is comprised of 2 - 4 263 items that are scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale, with higher scores indicating a higher 264 perception of that perceived group of barriers. 265 Knowledge of Meditation. Patient knowledge of meditation will be assessed using a series of 266 questions that gauge general perceptions of meditation. A set of 10 items have been developed 267 by Russell et al.(27) to assess knowledge of meditation. Survey respondents are asked to rate 268 their agreement with 10 statements (i.e., seven facts and three misconceptions that are reverse 269 scored), using the response options 1 \"Agree\", 0 \"Don't know\" or -1 \"Disagree. Overall, higher 270 total scores indicate greater knowledge of meditation. 271 Focus Groups 272 The purpose of the focus groups will be to explore participants' (1) experiences, 273 perceptions, and preferences regarding meditation and (2) how and under what contexts their 274 practice of meditation has (or has not) helped the cope with their cancer diagnosis. The focus 275 group guide is structured based on focus group question route methodology; general questions 276 will be asked first followed by more specific key questions directly related to the research topic .

Additionally, a notetaker and technical support person will be present with 281 their cameras off. The notetaker will capture non-verbal interactions amongst participants and 282 any other data which would add to a fuller picture of the focus group event. The technical 283 support person will be available to troubleshoot any issues with the Zoom platform that 284 participants may have, as well as monitor the chat function. 285 To capture the majority of themes, it is preferable to build in more than one focus 286 group.(38) Thus, after the first focus group session, we will invite participants to return for a 287 second, third, or fourth focus group session until data saturation has been reached. Depending on 288 availability, we will invite the same participants to all focus groups; however, if there is a 289 demand for focus group participation, we may conduct further focus groups with different 290 participants from the survey participant pool. 291 Oncologist Survey Measures 292 The survey will assess demographic characteristics such as participant age and sex as 293 well as professional practice characteristics including main place of work, years and province of 294 practice, and area of oncology specialty. To determine current practices around recommending 295 alterative and complementary therapies for alleviating stress and anxiety among cancer patients, 296 participants will be asked to identify any therapies they currently recommend from a pre- 297 specified list of the most common forms (e.g., music therapy, meditation, acupuncture); an open- 298 ended user option will also be included to capture therapy forms not listed. 299 .

To assess the proportion of survey completers who 301 specifically recommend meditation, an additional yes/no question will be asked to those who do 302 not select meditation from the aforementioned list (i.e., \"Have you ever recommended 303 meditation to your patients?\"). In addition, for those who respond that they do or have 304 recommended meditation, further questions will assess the forms of meditation that have been 305 recommended (i.e., types of meditation vs. delivery format), and how the recommendation was 306 made. In order to better understand how oncologists recommend meditation to their patients, an 307 item was developed to assess the physicians' level of engagement in providing information and 308 resources about meditation. This item will ask \"Which statement best describes how you 309 recommend meditation to your patients?\" and provide the following response options: (a) I 310 suggest meditating to help with stress and anxiety, (b) I recommend meditation to my patients 311 and provide them with resources to help them learn and understand how to meditate, and (c) I 312 explain the benefits of meditation to my patients and provide them with resources to help them 313 learn and understand how to meditate. 314 Knowledge of Meditation. The survey will also aim to understand oncologists' attitudes and 315 knowledge of meditation, by asking the same series of questions outlined for patient participants; 316 see above.(27) 317 Awareness of Practice Guidelines Endorsing Meditation. The last component of the survey aims 318 to understand oncologists' general awareness for guidelines that currently recommend meditation 319 to cancer patients. In 2018, the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO), endorsed 320 guidelines put forth by the Society for Integrative Oncology (SIO), recommending music 321 therapy, meditation, stress management, and yoga for anxiety and stress reduction among breast 322 cancer patients.

Survey responses on Qualtrics are protected by 333 Qualtrics' Web Application Firewalls and their detection system that monitors for unauthorized 334 users. Data will not be linked from other sources and will only be used for purposes outlined in 335 the consent documentation. Patient and oncologist digital survey data will be stored in a secure 336 computer file and will be deleted upon the completion of the study. A Master Linking Log that 337 contains patients' Study IDs and personal identifying information will be kept as a password 338 protected file, accessible to the research team during the recruitment process only. Focus group 339 audio files will be sent to a transcription service using secure file transfer; transcripts and 340 fieldnotes will be anonymized and stored both in a locked office (if they are printed as paper 341 copies) as well as digitally as password protected digital files. All study data (i.e., survey data 342 /focus group transcripts) will be stored securely for at least five years on Humber River Health's 343 encrypted cloud storage, after which the de-identified data will be deposited into Humber River 344 Health's Institutional Repository for a period of 10 years. The de-identified data will not be sold 345 and will only be accessible to the study team. .

The covariates 350 include age, anxiety level, perceived stress, and perceived mindfulness while the factors include 351 sex and whether the patient uses alternate methods of stress management. In secondary analyses, 352 we will use bivariate statistical analyses to identify relationships, interactions, or differences 353 between the covariates/factors using T-tests and Spearman correlations. Based on the number of 354 covariates/factors (k=6), and a lower estimate of the proportion of the positive outcome variable 355 (40%; v=0.4 ), the minimum number of cases required is calculated by the formula (N=10k/v), as 356 determined by Peduzzi, et al.(39) This results in a calculated sample size of 150 for a meaningful 357 logistic regression analysis. 358 Patient focus group data analysis 359 Analysis of focus groups will require a dynamic, non-linear, and iterative engagement 360 with the following data items: transcripts, fieldnotes, selective listening of audio, photos of any 361 activities captured during the recording of the online focus group such as: Poll Everywhere, 362 Zoom Whiteboard notes in the chat etc. The moderator team will meet to debrief immediately 363 after the focus group to discuss particular moments in the session that are noteworthy or that may 364 require special attention during analysis. 365 All data forms listed above will be uploaded into NVivo 12 qualitative analysis software 366 program as the majority of the analysis steps will be conducted in this program. To ensure that 367 analysis is trustworthy, focus group data will be analyzed by the qualitative lead in the research .

The approach to analysis will be iterative and performed in sequence; when each focus 369 group is complete, data analysis will begin prior to the next scheduled focus group. This will 370 allow time for theoretical sampling to take place for the subsequent focus group, in the event that 371 a particular theme or topic requires refining. As each focus group is completed, data will be 372 analyzed using the constant comparison method which includes (1) coding the data into small 373 units and attaching a descriptor or 'code' to each unit, (2), grouping the codes into larger 374 categories (axial coding), and (3) developing broader themes from larger categories.(40, 41) 375 The lead analyst will work with the note-taker to discuss codes and themes that are under 376 construction during the analysis process. The purpose of these discussions is twofold: (1) to 377 achieve consensus regarding the meanings and definitions of codes as well as resulting themes to 378 resolving and (2) to incorporate any non-verbal communicative data from the recording as well 379 as other dynamic moments of interaction captured via notes rather than solely the transcript. In 380 doing so, we will eliminate as much as possible, the potential misleading interpretations of 381 participants' voices analyzed as words on the transcript only. 382 Oncologist survey data analysis and sample calculation 383 The primary analysis will be a prediction of who prescribes meditation using multivariate 384 Logistic Regression with two-sided p<0.05 as critical value. The covariates include age while the 385 factors include sex and whether alternate therapies are recommended. In secondary analyses, we 386 will use multiple regression to determine relationships between the covariates/factors. We will 387 also test for interactions, particularly between whether alternate therapies are recommended and 388 who prescribes meditation. Based on the number of covariates/factors (k=3), and a lower 389 estimate of the proportion of the positive outcome variable (20%; v=0.2 ), the minimum number 390 of cases required is calculated by the formula (N=10k/v), where 10 is the minimum number of .

As a result, all oncologists belonging to the 393 Canadian Institution of Medical Oncologists (CAMO) will be given the survey. 394 Discussion 395 Significance of the proposed study 396 397 The study outlined in this protocol aligns with recent research in healthcare interventions 398 and delivery that empowers patients to engage with digital solutions to manage their symptoms 399 and enhance their wellbeing.(42, 43) Cancer patients in particular experience stress, pain, and 400 decreased quality of life as a consequence of their diagnosis; some patients would therefore 401 benefit greatly from a digital tool for symptom management. Thus, this study responds to the 402 most recent call for online meditation programs for cancer to be tailor-made for cancer patients 403 as opposed to standard meditation digital applications.(8, 26) 404 This study protocol serves as the first step to address this gap; it outlines the rationale and 405 procedures for understanding cancer patients' perceptions and practices of meditation as well as 406 their experiences of how meditation may have benefited them. In tandem with the quantitative 407 and qualitative patient data, the survey results of practicing oncologists in Canada will aid in our 408 understanding of their prescribing practices and state of meditation knowledge. Taken together, 409 the patient and oncologist datasets will prepare the infrastructure needed for the next phase of the 410 broader research goal\u2014to co-design and pilot test an online meditation program called 411 iCANmeditate. 412 The co-design process will be informed by vignettes generated from patient focus group 413 data. Vignettes are fictional representations or \"personas\" of individuals' experiences of the 414 topic under study and have practical applications in healthcare in co-design or participatory .

Co-design workshops will be run iteratively with feedback incorporated by 419 participants until iCANmeditate is complete. A pilot study will follow the development of 420 iCANmeditate to measure the tool's efficacy. 421 Strengths and Limitations 422 One key strength of this study is our engagement with oncologists in Canada; there is a 423 paucity of research that demonstrates the level of knowledge and prescribing behaviours of 424 meditation as a complimentary integrative therapy from oncologists despite the fact that 425 meditation is included in some clinical guidelines.(11, 45) Consequently, a long-term goal for 426 the meditation program is to convey the value of meditation by involving oncologists so that 427 meditation does not continue to be a \"fringe\" therapy with little clinical endorsement. 428 Possible limitations of this foundational study can be pinpointed. One limitation is that 429 the patient population drawn from the hospital study site may not be representative of patients 430 with cancer at a national or provincial level. For instance, the patient survey excludes 431 participants whose command of English is weak and as such, survey results will only reveal data 432 from an English-speaking group. Secondly, the hospital study site does not treat all types of 433 cancer and thus, a comprehensive understanding of patients' knowledge of meditation will 434 exclude patients with head, neck, sarcoma, gynecological, skin and melanoma cancers. In a 435 similar vein, the target population for the patient survey is patients who are actively in treatment 436 and not patients who were recently diagnosed. Our rationale for excluding this group was to 437 avoid adding an emotional burden to patients who may still be coming to terms with their cancer .

Finally, our patient sample will not include individuals who may identify as 439 \"survivors\"; the concept of survivorship in cancer is an emerging field of study and 440 consequently, outside the scope of this investigation of cancer patients currently in treatment. 441 In conclusion, this protocol outlines the research activities required to move to our next 442 phase of research where continuous engagement with cancer patients during the co-design phase 443 will produce a unique and meaningful meditation program that incorporates the specific needs of 444 people with cancer.
