People often praise chickpeas (also known as garbanzo beans) for their high protein content of 15 grams per cooked cup. But in many ways, it's their impressive amount of fiber - 12 grams per cooked cup, or nearly half of the recommended daily value (DV) for women and nearly one-third of the recommended DV for men) - that is linked to most of its health benefits. Because most of this fiber is in the insoluble form, studies have shown chickpeas help lower the more harmful form of LDL cholesterol, reduce risk of heart disease and help balance blood sugar level. A broad set of vitamins and minerals, including calcium, vitamin K, magnesium and zinc, also means chickpeas help promote strong bones. More Uses for Chickpeas: Chickpeas make a hearty addition to pilafs, grain dishes and salads. Pur\u00e9eing them creates a base for dips like [ hummus](https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/slideshow/how-to-make-your-own-hummus/), and adding chickpea flour to baked goods adds fiber and protein (plus, it's gluten-free). If you're using canned chickpeas or soaking dry ones, don't waste the liquid: Also known as [aquafaba](https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/food-health/food-and-health-news/how-aquafaba-is-transforming-vegan-cooking/), the liquid can mimic proteins in egg whites and can be used similarly to create a whipped effect in baked treats like meringue.

Don't let their small size fool you - hemp hearts (also known as shelled hemp seeds) are nutritional heavyweights. A North American crop, hemp hearts are a fine source of plant-based protein (5 grams per 2-tablespoon serving). They are also composed of 30% healthy fat, which is largely made up of essential fatty acids (EFAs) in the optimal ratio for human health, including gamma-linolenic-acid (GLA), an omega-6 fat used to fight inflammatory conditions. Hemp contains pH-balancing chlorophyll (yes, the same chlorophyll that gives leafy greens their pigment). Add in an impressive supply of minerals (like iron) plus a dose of fiber, and it's easy to see why hemp is revered. More Uses for Hemp Seeds: With a soft texture and nutty taste, hemp seeds can be used in sweet and savory dishes. Try them folded into pasta, mixed into [pancake batter](https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/recipes/protein-pancakes-with-berry-coulis/) or sprinkled on a [smoothie bowl](https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/slideshow/5-superfood-smoothie-bowls-bonus-bowls-from-backyard-bowls-kitchen/).

A quick saut\u00e9 in a hot pan is all they need to enhance their flavor and succulent texture while still retaining beneficial nutrients. Dried versions of these mushrooms are also available; they need to be rehydrated by soaking in hot water and can then be used in the same way. A trick to add deep flavor to your dishes: Soak your dried mushrooms in hot water, then use the soaking liquid as a broth, and chop and use the mushrooms in your cooking for a double dose of umami flavor.

Thanks to a high content of lutein and beta-carotene, regular watercress consumption has also been linked to lower incidence of eye disorders, including cataracts and age-related macular degeneration.

These anthocyanins are behind the growing interest in maqui among the medical community, particularly with regard to the berry's link to enhanced respiratory and cardiovascular health. Combined with its wealth of vitamin C, maqui is an extremely effective tool for skin rejuvenation, collagen production and overall healthy, graceful aging. More Uses for Maqui Berry: In North America, maqui is most often found in powdered form, and it can be used in all types of uncooked applications, from [smoothies](https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/slideshow/5-juices-smoothies-to-try-now/) to sauces to [frozen desserts](https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/uncategorized/fresh-summer-treat-acai-popsicles/).

A brown seaweed, wakame contains a wealth of naturally occurring electrolytes such as calcium and magnesium, and other minerals such as manganese and iron. Wakame is also a very rich source of iodine, a mineral that's essential for a healthy thyroid gland, which produces hormones that regulate many important functions including metabolism. In addition, it boasts anticancer, antibacterial, antiviral and antiparasitic properties. These qualities are largely due to its high concentration of fucoidan, a polysaccharide that fights inflammation, infection, high blood pressure and allergies. More Uses for Wakame: Wakame can be cooked into soups, stews and bean dishes, where it imparts a slightly salty flavor. It can also be briefly soaked to soften, then chopped and added to grain and rice dishes.

This amazing quality is mostly due to low-calorie yacon's impressive concentration of fructooligosaccharides (FOS), which are indigestible carbohydrates that pass through the body unabsorbed. Not only is it beneficial for diabetic diets as well as for weight loss, FOS is also considered a prebiotic, helping to promote the growth of probiotics, thereby improving gut health. In addition to a syrup, yacon can also be purchased as whole dehydrated slices, which have the benefit of offering additional fiber. Fresh yacon root can be found in specialty grocery stores. More Uses for Yacon: Yacon syrup can be used similarly to maple syrup or honey.

Brazil nuts are so rich in selenium that eating just one a day will meet your requirements. More Uses for Brazil Nuts: Brazil nuts are a delicious snack alone or as part of a trail mix. They can be chopped and used as a crunchy topping for grain bowls and salads, cooked into stews, or ground and added to veggie patties or burgers.
