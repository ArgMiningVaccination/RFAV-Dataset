Desire\" Vs. \"Resolution\" As I ponder the coming new year, I realize that not only am I bored with list-making but my soul seeks something deeper for myself in 2016. When we think of the start of a new calendar year we talk in terms of \"New Year's Resolutions.\" According to Wikipedia, a New Year's Resolution is a tradition, most common in the Western Hemisphere but also found in the Eastern Hemisphere, in which a person makes a promise to do an act of self-improvement. Friends usually make at least one if not two major pronouncements for self-improvement, each requiring commitment. Why do so many resolutions fail, I wonder? In a class I'm currently taking we are discussing \"desire.\" We are asked to sit and think about that which our souls desire. I know it's not the material things. I wonder if the reasons our resolutions fail is due to a deeper longing for an abundant spiritual well. This December, I am eager for the beginning of a new year. I plan to ditch the short list of self-improvement activities and to start a pilgrimage to my inner sacred spaces. As I keep asking myself the same question each day I keep coming back to this for myself: \"My desire is to create simplicity, peace and love in daily presence, with myself and others.\" How will I accomplish this? I'm hoping that with daily awareness and practice I will be with life flow and know that this is a journey. Peace and good health. How to have MORE money, LESS stress and MORE fun this holiday season! Experience Vs. \"Things\"\u2014 Your presence is the present! Yesterday, I was sitting next to a lovely thirty-something mother at the nail salon. The conversation turned to the holidays; with a sigh and slumped shoulders, she proceeded to lament the burden of holiday shopping. Her annual shopping experience that not only includes her family also includes her circle of friends, all of whom she adores. I suggested that perhaps her group of girlfriends might celebrate their friendship AND the holidays together at a favorite restaurant instead of buying material gifts. It's a \"win-win\" from a time and expense perspective. And moreover, it cements relationships with time spent together, rather than time spent in a mall or shopping online. I am going to share another idea that a dear friend mentioned many years ago. Her large family skipped the \"gift giving\" and instead everyone over the age of 18 contributed a certain dollar amount to a fund every year. This fund was invested and the entire family enjoyed a family cruise five years later. No stuff, but incredible memories for everyone! This year, I am committing to the time vs. the stuff.

My Holiday \"Not-To-Do\" List Seems like so many of us live by lists and when one is finished, we create (yes, we do have choices) another. Certainly there are priorities in our respective lives but in looking at this habit/activity, how many of us could benefit from the culling of the list. And the holiday list... Oh my!

I can't tell you how many people I meet each week who talk about their upcoming plans for self-improvement. They're all real and exciting! What I don't often hear is the recognition of our accomplishments. We hardly give ourselves time to bask in making positive changes in our lives, small or large before charging forward to the next goal. Many of us are trying hard everyday to live healthy lives, lives that impact ourselves, our families, friends and our Mother Earth. How many of us are also trying to deepen our spiritual connections?
