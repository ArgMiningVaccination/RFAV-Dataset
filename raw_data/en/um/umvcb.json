See Appendix U. May 1 , 2017 Dear Committee Members and Education Stakeholders: Today , the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction (NDDPI) submits the final draft of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) State Plan . This plan is the result of ten months of planning with our established State ESSA P lanning Committee and other stakeholder groups. The overarching objective of North Dakota's State ESSA Plan is to ensure e very school's graduation rate matches its Choice Ready rate, thus eliminating the honesty gap , so students, parents and the state are able to confidently place high value on the diplomas received. In partnership with a broad and diverse group of stakeholde rs, the NDDPI has created a new vision for education in North Dakota as part of the ESSA planning process which reads \"All students will graduate choice ready with the knowledge, skills and disposition to be successful in whatever they choose to do, whethe r they pursue a post -secondary degree, enroll in a technical college, enter the workforce, or join the military.\" NDDPI is committed to leading an inclusive and collaborative process of stakeholder engagement to design and develop a continuous improvement focused education system that is key to improving education for all learners. This vision has been embedded in all of our work on the writing and future implementation of North Dakota ESSA plan. The State ESSA plan and feedback form is available on our ESSA website . Feedback and questions can also be sent to dpiessa@nd.gov You also can reach out to one of our many members on the State ESSA Planning Committee to provide input. The ESSA law brings a new opportunity to states, districts, and schools for increased flexibility to promote innovation. Working together, we can continue to improve education in North Dakota and prepare our youth for their future.

This vision reads: \"All students will graduate cho ice ready with the knowledge, skills, and disposition to be successful in whatever they choose to do, whether they pursue a post -secondary degree, enroll in a technical college, enter the workforce, or join the military.\" Sharing statewide ownership of and commitment to the vision and education system is key to improving education for all learners. This vision will be embedded in all of the work on the implementation of the North Dakota State ESSA Plan. The State Superintendent has set five priority areas that guide the agency's work in assisting students in achieving the state's vision of being choice ready. These priorities include: Support Great Teachers/Leaders - Professional Development/Mentors, ESPB Licensure, Professional Learning Partnerships with NDREAs, NDLEAD, NDUnited Engage in Continuous Improvement - Increase Academic Proficiency, AdvancED, School Improvement Process, NDMTSS Ensure Equity - Fiscal Equity, Teacher Equity, and Opportunities for Equitable Access and Participation for Students Promote Local Educational Opportunities - Well Rounded Education, Student Engagement, School Culture/Climate, Waivers, Innovative Learning Invest in Early Childhood Education - Office of Early Learning, Preschool Funding and Transition Supports, Pre -kinde rgarten Content Standards, Kindergarten Entry Assessment Superintendent Baesler formed a State ESSA Planning Committee in the spring of 2016. The committee members represent a multitude of stakeholder groups. The NDDPI is committed to leading an inclusive and collaborative process of stakeholder engagement to design and develop a continuous improvement -focused education system to achieve this vision. The State ESSA Planning Committee has convened monthly to prepare the state's application for a comprehensi ve plan. The State ESSA Planning Committee also formed three (3) subcommittees that represent stakeholders from the large committee to make final recommendations in the areas of Teacher/Leader Effectiveness; Standards, Assessment, Accountability and Repo rting; and Continuous Improvement. Subcommittees are also meeting once or twice a month depending upon need. 10 ESSA also requires states to engage in Meaningful Consultation with Tribes in the development of the state's plan to meet the needs of Native Am erican students. ESSA promotes tribal self -determination in the education of Native American students by authorizing coordination and collaboration of tribal stakeholders with state education agencies (SEAs) to meet the unique culturally related academic n eeds of our Native American students. North Dakota ESSA Tribal Consultation meetings are continuously being held to foster collaboration. The State ESSA Planning Committee has met monthly over the past nine months. At the beginning of each meeting, the committee participates in small group discussion sharing how they have communicated the State ESSA Planning Committee's work to their peers and stakeholders in their local community and how they have solicited and gathered information and feedback from the ir stakeholders. Each subcommittee then reports out the results of their most recent discussion to the entire committee. This information is reflected in meeting minutes for public review and transparency. Accountability and Support Systems : The purpose of our accountability system is to provide statewide responsibility of all stakeholders to pursue our North Dakota vision. Through this accountability framework, North Dakota will: Provide transparency and public reporting of key performance and improveme nt indicators for all schools, districts, and the state; Ensure all schools and districts are engaged in a process of continuous improvement; Identify when and where desired results are not being achieved, and prioritize which schools are most in need of support; and Allocate resources and support services, increase oversight and engagement, and elevate accountability for those schools most in need of support. North Dakota's accountability system will provide a framework upon which we consistently, cont inuously, and holistically evaluate the ability of our state's education system to achieve desired outcomes. North Dakota is writing a plan focused around a continuous improvement theme. North Dakota's discussions with its State ESSA Planning Committee hav e focused on the use of a dashboard for all schools, which would allow multiple factors to be used when outlining a school's measure of quality. North Dakota is collaborating with AdvancED on many elements addressing continuous improvement and on the development of an index model for incorporating growth within each school's dashboard. North Dakota intends to apply a composite growth model within its accountability system under ESSA. Any academic achievement goals, either long -term or interim, would apply to composite and subgroup academic achievement for schools, districts, and the state. Currently, North Dakota uses AdvancED statewide for approval and as a system of improvement of all public schools. First and foremost, all schools will participate in c ontinuous school improvement through the AdvancED process. The second action will entail the targeted school system of support, and the third action will entail the comprehensive system of support. 11 Supporting Excellent Educators : We believe every student needs and deserves a strong teacher. North Dakota's education workforce initiatives focus on supporting teachers and supporting strong leadership: priorities include enhancing and improving the state's Principal Teacher Evaluation Support System (PTESS), Leadership Academies, and Principal Mentoring. The State ESSA Planning Committee has determined that teacher evaluation is a logical tool to use to determine ineffective teaching strategies. The North Dakota Teacher Evaluation Guidelines assure evaluation s are aligned to the InTASC teaching standards. These standards outline what teachers should know and be able to do to ensure every K -12 student graduates choice ready. North Dakota schools use one of four models - Danielson, Marshall, Marzano, and McREL. The ESSA subcommittee working on this piece has recommended that an \"ineffective teaching strategy\" equivalent be defined as level 1 on the teacher evaluation models. In determining the number of students being taught by ineffective teachers, the subcommit tee has recommended a process that uses several data points to include number of students in the school, number of teachers evaluated, number of elements/components rated during the year, and number of elements/components on the evaluation model scored at level 1. Using these data points, an ineffective teacher equivalent will be calculated. The NDDPI is committed to ensuring that every student in a North Dakota school is taught by an excellent teacher. The North Dakota State Plan to Ensure Equitable Access to Excellent Educators (August 2015) identifies key gaps and outlines strategies to reduce the gaps. The NDDPI collaborates internally and externally to ensure that all of the many components within our ESSA plan are connected. Internally our office staf f meet often to assure a comprehensive support system. Externally, the NDDPI works with local and regional education agencies (REA)s and community partners to provide training and support aligned to district needs identified by local needs assessments and continuous improvement plans. Providing evidence -based practices for districts and schools will increase opportunities to differentiate professional learning based on local needs. Additionally, leveraging federal, state, and local funds in alignment with established partnerships will enhance support in the dissemination of best practices and resources. The NDDPI has enhanced the continuous improvement process and strengthened the connection between professional learning and developing skills to provide in struction to students with specific learning needs. Support is also provided in conjunction with other partners, including REAs, ND Council of Educational Leaders, NDLEAD, NDUnited, ND School Boards Association, and others. Supporting All Students : ESSA's focus on well -rounded educational opportunities ensures that all children receive fair, equitable, and high quality education by addressing the academic and non -academic needs of students and students within subgroups. North Dakota believes all students s hould have equitable access to equitable academic opportunities. These programs may include: preschool programming; advanced coursework; Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM) education programming; physical education promoting healthy li festyles; career and technology education; 21st century skills; competency based learning; as well as personal learning opportunities. North Dakota recognizes all students deserve access to a curriculum that is broad and rich in content. Research shows th at students - particularly historically underserved students - engage more deeply in learning when they are exposed to a variety of topics and can better connect what they are learning in the classroom with the world outside of school. 12 Ongoing Reflection and Refinement : North Dakota is adding a \"choice ready\" component to its accountability system for high schools. This new element is designed to ensure that students are equipped to pursue the option of their choice upon graduating from high school. This element will help advance college , career and military ready outcomes over time using a growth model. North Dakota's established State ESSA Planning Committee will remain intact even after our state plan is submitted to the U.S. Department of Education to assist the NDDPI during the implementation phase of ou r state plan to continually review, revise and make improvements to the North Dakota education system. The NDDPI strongly believes the North Dakota State ESSA Plan will be a living document that is frequently updated as changes are recommended through the continuous review process. Both the NDDPI and the North Dakota school systems will periodically review and monitor achievement toward the goals within the established, continuous school improvement system.

Long -Term Goals and Measurement of Interim Progress 2. Consultation and Coordination 3. Challenging Academic Standards and Academic Assessments 4. Accountability, Support and Improvement 5. Supporting Excellent Educators 6. Supporting All Stud ents Goals & Progress Supporting Excellent Educators Consultation & Coordination Support All Students Accountability, Support & Improvement Academic Standards & Assessments 14 Section 1: Long -term Goals Instructions : Each SEA must provide baseline data (i.e., starting point data), measurements of interim progress, and long -term goals for academic achievement, graduation rates, and English language proficiency . For each g oal, the SEA must describe how it established its long -term goals, including its State -determined timeline for attaining such goals , consistent with the requirements in section 1111(c)(2) of the ESEA and 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.13 . Each SEA must provide goals and measurements of interim progress for the all students group and separately for each subgroup of students , consistent with the State's minimum number of students . In the tables below, identify the baseline (data and year) and long -term goal (data and year) . If the tables do not accommodate this information, an SEA may create a new table or text box (es) within this template . Each SEA must include measurements of interim progress for academic achievement, graduation rates, and English language proficien cy in Appendix H. A. Academic Achievement . i. Description. Describe how the SEA established its ambitious long-term goals and measurements of interim progress for improved academic achievement , including how the SEA established its State -determined timeline for attaining such goals . The State ESSA Committee has adopted six -year state achievement goals for both English language arts/literacy and mathematics, based on composite and subgroup achievement results reported from the 2015 -2016 administratio n of the North Dakota State Assessments (NDSA) and North Dakota Alternate Assessments (NDAA). The attached table ( Appendix N) presents achievement goals for each composite and subgroup category, including the 2015 -2016 base rate, an annualized rate, and si x interim achievement rates spanning 2018 -2019 to 2023 -2024 school years. The sixth interim achievement rate constitutes the final, six -year achievement goal. The State ESSA Committee has adopted a goal of reducing the number of non -proficient students for all students and for each subgroup of students by 33 percent within six years. Annualized rates are calculated by dividing each respective achievement goal by six years. Each category's interim achievement rate is determined by adding the annualized rate to the category's previous year's base rate. This metric is applied to all public schools and students in the state, with an exception of those students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. Should the NDSA/NDAA change, these goals would be r ecalibrated accordingly. North Dakota's State ESSA Plan is a living document that will be continually reviewed and updated . We will continue to review our data to ensure our goals are rigorous and drive improvement. 15 ii. Provide the baseline and long-term goals in the table below. Subgroups Reading/ Language Arts: Baseline Data and Year Reading/ Language Arts: Long - term Goal Mathematics : Baseline Data and Year Mathematics : Long -term Goal All students 50.8% 67.04% 41.37% 60.67% Economically B. Graduation Rate . i. Description. Describe how the SEA established its ambitious long-term goals and measurements of interim progress for improved four-year adjusted cohort graduation rates, including how the SEA established its State -determined timeline for attaining such goals . The state established its ambitious long -term graduation goals and measurements of interim progress for its four -year adjusted cohort graduation rate and extended -year adjusted cohort graduation rate, based on the state's long -standing graduation rate dete rmination rules, following the deliberation and recommendation of the State ESSA Planning Committee and final approval by the state superintendent. The state will continue its practice of reporting graduates, retentions, and dropouts, within cohorts, in th e aggregate and disaggregated by subgroups, according to graduation cohort definition and calculation rules established under the state's adoption of 2008 federal regulations. The State ESSA Planning Committee endorses a means of calculating and reporting graduation rates to support stability and continuity in measurements. The attached table (Appendix N) presents ambitious long -term graduation rate achievement goals for each composite and subgroup category, including the 2015 -2016 base rate, an annualized rate, and six 16 interim achievement rates spanning 2018 -2019 to 2023 -2024 school years. The sixth interim rate constitutes the final, six -year goal. State law states that a regular diploma is issued by the local school district certifying the completion of local high school graduation requirements. Prior to a student being issued a standard diploma by the local school district certifying the completion of local high school graduation requirements, the student must have successfully completed at least twenty -two units of high school coursework from the minimum required curriculum offerings established b y section NDCC 15.1 -21-02. The S tate ESSA Planning Committee recommended tha t the state retain its current 90% graduation goal and its primary growth criteri a for determining sufficient graduation rate achievement. The state will establish unique targets each of the respective years: the four -year cohort graduation rate will use the currently established 10% growth target; the five -year extended cohort graduat ion rate will use a 12.5% growth target (a 25% increase in expectation from the four -year target base); and the six -year extended coh ort graduation rate will use a 21 % growth target (a 50% increase in expectation from the four -year target base). The target is measured as the percent reduction of non -graduates from the preceding year against the 90 % goal. The State will first examine whether a school or district has met the goal ( 90%) or the target (10 percent reduction in n on-graduates against the goal ( 90%) from the previous year's rate) for the four -year graduation rate. If it did not, the state would then determine whether the school or district had met the five -year extended year graduation rate target (12.5% percent reduction in non-graduates against th e goa l (90%) from the previous year's rate). If it did no t meet the five - year rate, the s tate would then determine whether the school or district had met the six -year extende d year graduation rate target (21 % percent reduction in non -graduates against the goal (90%) from the previous year's rate. Meeting the goal or the targets for any of the four -year, five - year extended, or six -year extended graduation rates would mean that the school or district had met its absolute or growth goal. ii. Provide the baseline and long -term goals for the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate in the table below. Subgroup Baseline (Data and Year) Long -term Goal (Data and Year) All students 86.3% 90.0% Economically disadvantaged students 70.0% or Alaska Native 59.7% 90.0% Asian or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander 77.7% 90.0% 17 Subgroup Baseline (Data and Year) Long -term Goal (Data and Year) Hispanic or Latino 74.7% 90.0% White 90.5% 90.0% iii. If applicable, provide the baseline and long -term goals for each extended -year cohort graduation rate(s) and describe how the SEA established its ambitious long -term goals and measurements for such an extended -year rate or rates that are more rigorous as comp ared to the long -term goals and measurements of interim progress than the four -year adjusted cohort rate , including how the SEA established its State -determined timeline for attaining such goals . The state will provide for a four -year, five -year, and six-year extended cohort graduation rate reporting model, consistent with the state's long -standing graduation rate reporting efforts. The state will report school, district, and state graduation rate reports, in the aggregate and disaggregated by subgroup , based on four -year, five -year, and six -year extended cohort graduation data, to support communication to schools and the public. The attached table (Appendix N) presents extended -year cohort graduation rate goals for each composite and subgroup categor y, including the 2015 -2016 base rate, an annualized rate, and six interim achievement rates spanning 2018 -2019 to 2023 -2024 school years. The sixth interim rate constitutes the final, six -year goal. 5-year Extended Cohort Graduation Rate Goal Over a 6 year Period Subgroup Baseline (Data and Year) Long -term Goal (Data and Year) All students 88.0% 92.0% Economically disadvantaged students 73.5% or Alaska Native 63.4% 92.0% Asian or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander Latino 77.0% 92.0% White 91.6% 92.0% 6-year Extended Cohort Graduation Rate Goal Over a 6 year Period Subgroup Baseline (Data and Year) Long -term Goal (Data and Year) All students 89.1% 93.0% Economically disadvantaged students 74.2% 93.0% 18 Subgroup Baseline (Data and Year) Long -term Goal (Data and Year) Children with disabilities 76.6% 93.0% English learners 67.6% 93.0% African or Alaska Native 65.3% 93.0% Asian or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander or Latino 81.5% 93.0% White 91.9% 93.0% C. English Language Proficiency. i. Description. Describe the State's uniform procedure, applied consistently to all English learners in the State, to establish research -based student -level targets on which the goals and measurements of interim progress are based. The description must include: 1. How the S tate considers a student's English language proficiency level at the time of identification and, if applicable, any other student characteristics that the State takes into account ( i.e., time in language instruction programs, grade level, age, Native langu age proficiency level, or limited or interrupted formal education, if any). 2. The applicable timelines over which English learners sharing particular characteristics would be expected to attain ELP within a State -determined maximum number of years and a rat ionale for that State -determined maximum. 3. How the student -level targets expect all English learners to make annual progress toward attaining English language proficiency within the applicable timelines. North Dakota districts will use growth as the uniform progress measure of English Language Proficiency (ELP). Growth will be measured for all EL students in K -12 by using the growth to target method. Students start on the growth trajectory at the composite proficiency level (PL) of their first annual ELP assessment in North Dakota (currently ACCESS 2.0). This first score is considered year 0 or base score. Year one growth is determined after the second annual ELP assessment the following year. Districts wil l use the student's most recent ELP assessment if they are coming from another WIDA state. Years are cumulative (If student leaves North Dakota and returns, they pick up where they left off). The students' trajectories will be constructed from the starting point proficiency level to the 5.0 target proficiency level over a period of years according to the table below. Proficiency Level Years to Attain PL (exit) 1.0-1.9 6 years 2.0-2.9 5 years 3.0-3.9 4 years 4.0-4.9 3 years 5.0-6.0 2 years North Dakota does not currently gather data on students with limited formal education (SLIFE) This data will begin to be collected in the 2017 -18 school year to determine whether additional time in the trajectory for SLIFE would be appropriate. North Dakota will be better able to 19 determine the extent to which another year would benefit SLIFE students after identification and analyzing growth compared to other ELs after the 2018 -19 annual ELP assessment. ii. Describe how the SEA established ambitious State -designed l ong-term goals and measurements of interim progress for increases in the percentage of all English learners in the State making annual progress toward attaining English language proficiency based on 1.C.i. and provide the State -designed long -term goals and measurements of interim progress for English language proficiency. The NDDPI has received technical assistance from CCSSO, WIDA, and the USDE regarding the options for determining growth in English proficiency. The English Language Program Advisory Commi ttee (ELPAC) reviewed various growth models and determined the growth to target would best fit the English learner population and be the most understandable to parents. This recommendation was approved by the ESSA Accountability and Standards Subcommittee, as well as the state ESSA committee. The ELPAC has reviewed historical North Dakota ELP growth data to determine the appropriate long-term goals and interim progress. Students : Long -term goal: North Dakota English learners will attain proficiency (ex it the program) by receiving a 3.5 proficiency level in each domain of listening, speaking, reading and writing and a 5.0 composite proficiency level within the expected timeline below. Interim Progress Goal: North Dakota English learners will annually inc rease their composite language proficiency level based on the annual ELP assessment and remain at or above their established trajectory growth line. Proficiency Level Years to Attain PL (exit) 1.0-1.9 6 years 2.0-2.9 5 years 3.0-3.9 4 years 4.0-4.9 3 years 5.0-6.0 2 years Schools : Long -term goal: North Dakota schools with English learners will ensure a minimum of 72% of the English learners will meet interim progress goals within six (6) years. Interim Progress Goal: North Dakota schools with English learners will ensure a minimum of 60% of English learners will annually increase their composite language proficiency level based on the annual ELP assessment and remain at or above their established trajectory growth line. The expected percentage will increase 2% annually. State : Long -term goal: North Dakota currently has 58% of its English learners meeting interim progress goals. The goal for North Dakota is to ensure a minimum of 72% of the Englis h learners will mee t interim progress goals within six (6) years. The State ESSA Committee has adopted a six -year state English language proficiency (ELP) growth goal for English learners, based on cur rent trajectories of student growth from historical 20 results reported from the annual English language proficiency assessment. The attached table (APPENDIX N) presents ELP growth goals including the base rate, an annualized rate, and six interim growth rates spanning 2018 -2019 to 2023 -2024 school years. The sixth year interim growth rate constitutes the final, six -year growth goal. The goal is summarized below: Appendix N Baseline and Long Term Goals - English Language Proficiency (ELP) Annualized Growth Rates Distributed Over 6 Years North Dakota is seeking 72% of the EL students will meet their interim progress goal. Group ESSA Base: ELP (2015 - 2016) Interim Growth Steps Growth met Growth not met 6 Year ELP Goal Annualized Increases Year 1: 2018 - 2019 Year 2: 2019 - 2020 Year 3: 2020 - 2021 Year 4: 2021 - 2022 Year 5: 2022 - recognizes North Dakota currently has 58% of its ELs meeting interim progress goals. North Dakota set a long -term goal of 72% of EL students will meet their interim progress goal in six years. The interim growth rate is determined by adding the annualized rate to the previous year's rate. The six year goal is the expected growth rate. The percentage of EL students who have not met growth is provided for transparency purpos es. SEA Support for English learner Progress : The NDDPI has provided support for schools to assist in the instruction and profi ciency attainment of English learners. The state will continue to support schools in meeting their long - term EL goals, interim progress, and the challenging State academic standards. The NDDPI provides a weighted factor of state funds for schools with Eng lish learners at levels 1-3. These funds assist schools to establish, implement, and maintain their language instruction education programs. The NDDPI also administers Title III funds and sub grant funds to LEAs or consortia with English learners who meet the number minimums and apply for funds. The NDDPI provides technical support to schools through one on one guidance, a monthly newsletter, and periodic memos and resources sent to EL professionals. The state also provides EL professional development through conferences and trainings, as well as written guidance and resources. Monitoring: The NDDPI will monitor the progress of all schools of enrolled English learners through the use of the STARS data reports. These reports will be reviewed annually to determine which schools are successfully meeting the goals and interim progress measures for English learners. Those schools not meeting the goals will be notified and provided with technical assistance and suggestions for improvement. 21 The NDDPI is workin g toward a consolidated monitoring system to monitor the Federal Title Programs such as Title I, Title II, and Title III. We are working to consolidate the current Title III monitoring practices with the Title I and Title II procedures. Title III monitorin g consists of a team of professionals who visit the schools to observe the language instruction education program and ensure it is effective. The team spends time visiting with staff, students, parents, and administration, as well as observing EL instructi on. The team utilizes the NDDPI Monitoring tool to ensure each indicator is in place according to state and federal law. The team includes the State EL Administrator who is responsible for monitoring the fiscal procedures and requirements of the schools/di stricts. Each district is on a rotation and monitored every 3 -5 years. With the implementation of ESSA, North Dakota will have additional schools to monitor due to the inclusion of all schools with ELs and not just those receiving Title III funds. This wi ll require the addition of a paper, self - monitoring process beginning July 1, 2017. The smaller schools will rotate in the self -monitoring process and be monitored also every 3 -5 years, but at least one will also have an on -site visit along with the monito ring of the other Federal Title Programs. Through the monitoring process the NDDPI conducts an exit interview with the EL and administrative teams of the district. This meeting provides information and resources to the district regarding the indicators th at need to be addressed and general recommendations to help improve the program. In this meeting the team will also discuss the school goals and provide recommendations to help the schools meet their EL proficiency goals. The monitoring team may also send further resources and suggestions after the monitoring visit if necessary. 22 Section 2: Consultation and Performance Management Stakeholder Engagement 2.1 Consultation. Each SEA must meet the requirements in 34 C.F.R . \u00a7 200.21(b)(1) -(3) to provide information that is: 1. Be in an understandable and uniform format; 2. Be, to the extent practicable, written in a language that parents can understand or, if it is not practicable to provide written translations to a parent with limited English proficiency, be orally translated for such parent; and 3. Be, upon request by a parent who is an individual with a disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. 12102, provided in an alternative format accessible to that parent. State Superintendent Kirsten Baesler formed a State Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Planning Committee in the early onset of 2016. The State ESSA Planning Committee represents a multitude of stakeholder groups from across the state (Appendix M). The State ESS A Planning Committee is responsible for gathering feedback from stakeholders across the state and developing our consolidated state plan. Below is a general listing of State ESSA Planning Committee members: (1) An appointed official from the North Dakota Governor's office (2) A Senate and House of Representative member from the North Dakota Legislature (3) Teachers, Principals, Administrators and Specialized Instructional Personnel from Public, Private, Native American, large, mid -sized and small school d istricts from across North Dakota 23 (4) Parents and parent groups (5) Parent -Teacher Organizations (6) Business leaders (7) Indian Affairs Commission (8) Public, Private and Native American Colleges and Universities (9) Members from a vast array of student g roups such as English Language Learners, Gifted and Talented, Students with disabilities and economically disadvantaged. (10) Public employee s (11) School Boards Association (12) Educational organizations The State ESSA Planning Committee includes individu al representatives consistent with subsection 299.13 (b) and 299.15 (a), and the full category listing of the State ESSA Planning Committee Members is included in our plan, please see (Appendix A). To date, this State ESSA Planning Committee has met six ti mes to review essential components of a state ESSA plan and to gather and provide input from the committee's outreach. The State ESSA Planning Committee accomplished communication, gathering feedback and research by disaggregating into three separate subco mmittees: Teacher/Leader Effectiveness Standards, Assessment, Accountability and Reporting Continuous Improvement These subcommittees have met one to two times per month since September 2016 through February 2017. A subcommittee designee would share gat hered feedback during the first hour of a full State ESSA Planning Committee meeting. A subcommittee member listing is available in (Appendix B). ESSA requires states to engage in Meaningful Consultation with Tribes in the development of the state's plan to meet the needs of Native American students. To date there have been two North Dakota Tribal Stakeholder Planning Meetings plus individual consultation with the four tribal councils. These meetings between the two governments will continue as the two e ntities work to develop North Dakota policy regarding tribal consultation for both the state and local education agencies. At the forefront of the collaboration is the discussion of what is best for students, good communication and commitment to seeing th e entire process through until policy and guidance is documented into an effective state plan. A. Public Notice . Provide evidence that the SEA met the public notice requirements , under 34 C.F.R . \u00a7 299.13(b) , relating to the SEA's processes and procedures for developing and adopting its consolidated State plan. The North Dakota Department of Public Instruction (NDDPI) is working diligently to ensure it meets subsection 200.21 (b) (1) - (3). In the interim, NDDPI has used webinars, regional meetings, listening tours, media releases, radio, television, social media, email list serv, and accessing members of its State ESSA Planning Committee's communication to keep the public informed on the work of the consol idated state plan (NDDPI's ESSA Communication Plan & Timeline, Appendix C). The NDDPI continues to post notifications of its meetings and subcommittee meetings on the North Dakota Secretary of State's 24 website at https://intranetapps.nd.gov/sos/ndpmn/meetings/searchMeetings.htm and outside of the door at relevant meeting. The NDDPI will continue to use mass communication to provide transparent timely notification. NDDPI intends to post our draft state ESSA plan for official public comment beginning February 16, 2017. The following is the timeline for the public meetings participated in by the State ESSA Planning Committee: May 17, 2016 July 25, 2016 August 30, 2016 September 30, 2016 October 25, 2016 December 20, 2016 February 8, 2017 March 22, 2017 B. Outreach and Input . For the components of the consolidated State plan including Challenging Academic Assessments; Accountability, Support, and Improvement for Schools; Supporting Excellent Educators; and Supporting All Students, describe how t he SEA: i. Conducted outreach to and solicited input from the individuals and entities listed above , consistent with 34 C.F.R . \u00a7 299.13(b), during the design and development of the SEA 's plans to implement the programs that the SEA has indicated it will include in its consolidated State plan; and following the completion of its initial consolidated State plan by making the plan available for public comment for a period of not less than 30 days prior to submitting the consolidated State plan to the Department for review and approval. As part of outreach and input, Superintendent Baesler solicited responses from a vast array of teachers, parents, legislators and administrators during an eleven city in thirteen -day listening tour May 9 through 25th, 2016. The Superintendent received feedback into the process of standards revision of English and mathematics, insights into a state ESSA plan, and input into procurement of a new state assessm ent. In continuance of solicitation into our North Dakot a state consolidated plan; our S tate ESSA Planning Committee members have sought feedback from the stakeholder groups they represent. This information gathered through electronic surveys to all edu cators, is a main topic of discussion during a vast array of professional education conferences held across North Dakota from June 2016 until present. Any information the State ESSA Planning Committee gathers electronically is shared during the first hour of each of the state meetings and recorded in the meeting minutes (Appendix D) as the committee continues its work in developing North Dakota's ESSA plan. The initial draft of the North Dakota Every Student Succeeds Act accountability plan was released for public input on January 12, 2017. The intent is to gather further statewide feedback and revisions from stakeholders and use this response to create an official consolidated state plan available for public comment for thirty days. The date for release of the official draft is on or before February 16, 2017. North Dakota is on target to submit our plan by April 3, 2017. On-Going Stakeholder Engagement Once the North Dakota State ESSA Plan was submitted to the USDE on May 5, 2017, the NDDPI, with the assistance of the State ESSA Planning Committee, began the ESSA 25 Implementation phase. In preparation of the work that needs to be done in the implementation phase, NDDPI created nine subcommittees. These subcommittees are comprised of NDDPI personnel and ESSA Planning Committee members who have expertise in each topic or an interest in being part of the committee. These ESSA Planning Committee members have agreed to shoulder the responsibility of providing ongoing, two -way feedback with the stakeholder gro up they represent across the state throughout the implementation process. The following nine implementation committees have been established to facilitate this work: School Dashboard Student Engagement Graduation Rate Student Growth Choice R eady School Improvement Effective Teachers & Leaders Financial Transparency Innovative Learning The ESSA Implementation phase will allow the state to continue to gather feedback and support from stakeholders across the state as we move forward to implement the new ESSA law and work out the details that are still to be dete rmined. In addition to these nin e committees, the NDDPI has also established various work groups to assist with the ESSA implementation. The NDDPI is working with North Dakota's Information Technology Department and Otis Education regarding data needs. They will help NDDPI create report cards and dashboards under ESSA. This will allow the state to continuously review and use data to support activities under Titles I, II, III, IV, and V. These work groups collaborate closely with the Implementation committees to incorporate the use of data within our work and ensure we are consulting regularly with various stakeholders across the state. Ongoing tribal consultations will oc cur during implementation between tribal chairmen, tribal council members, local tribal and public school leaders serving Native American students and the State Superintendent and NDDPI staff on tribal reservations to receive ongoing feedback on the ESSA i mplementation process. This consultation will be important as the state monitors the impact of the ESSA plan and looks to make any adjustments and improvements to the plan in the future. NDDPI will continue to provide technical assistance and meeting suppo rt for tribal consultations that must occur among local education agencies and local tribal members. The State Superintendent's Student Cabinet members will continue to advise her and NDDPI on the implementation of the ESSA plan during their quarterly pol icy meetings held at the Capitol. This 20 member Cabinet is comprised of students ranging from 4th grade to college freshman from large, medium, and small sized LEAs and from every region of the state. Their ongoing feedback will provide vital information on ESSA implementation and its impact from a student's perspective. ii. Took into account the input obtained through consultation and public comment. The response must include both how the SEA addressed the concerns and issues raised through consultation and public comment and any changes the SEA made as a result of consultation and public comment for all components of the consolidated State plan. a. Challenging Academic Standards and Academic Assessments North Dakota is revising its English language arts and math standards simultaneously as it is in the process of drafting its state ESSA plan. The task of updating the North Dakota ELA and math standards was initially, not looked upon favorably by North Dakota educators, 26 because of this sentiment, Superintende nt Baesler began a listen and learn tour across the state to hear concerns and acknowledge comments about the proposed standards revision. Some state educators felt the English language arts and math standards were rigorous and did not want to rewrite t hem while other educators felt it was important to evaluate and consider narrowing the amount of standards for English Language Arts. Other educators noted the math standards needed clarity in their descriptions and a need to consider having integrated ma th at the high school level. Currently, the writing committee is comprised of 33-37 teachers per content area respectively for 70 members. It is worth noting that content specialists from higher education help comprise both the ELA and Math standard writin g committees. The North Dakota English Language Arts Content Standards Writing Committee and the North Dakota Math Content Standards Writing Committee have met, made revisions and are working to adhere to the following timeline: July 21 -22, 2016 North Dakota Mathematics Content Standards Development Committee meets. July 28 -29, 2016 North Dakota English and Mathematics Content Development Committees meet. September 2016 First Draft of Revised N orth Dakota English and Mathematics Standards available for p ublic comment October 12, 2016 North Dakota Math and English Content Standards Review Committee meets. This committee is asked to look at the standards from another perspective and comprised of elected leaders, representatives from business and industry, and parents and citizens. November 3 -4, 201 6 North Dakota Mathematics and English Content Standards Development Committees meet to read recommendations December 2, 2016 North Dakota Mathematics Content Standards Development Committee meets to make recommended revisions. The final draft of the North Dakota State Standards in English language arts and math is to be complete the first quarter of 2017, and North Dakota plans to adopt the standards in July of 2017 and begin implementation of the updated academic standards in t he 2017 -2018 school year. The state will select new general assessments, aligned to the state's newly adopted content standards and based on an approved Request for Proposal selection process by 2017. The design parameters for the state's new assessmen t system will be based, in part, on recommendations generated by a statewide assessment task force, which conducted its study from 2015 -2016. A full listing of Assessment Task Force members is included in (Appendix E). Any final general assessments must m eet all validity and reliability specified in law and validated by the federal assessment review process. 27 The North Dakota Every Student Succeeds Act Consolidated Plan developed by stakeholders from across the state and the State ESSA Planning Committee i s gathering and disseminating the information and taking all suggestions and comments into consideration, and at times, debate. North Dakota is contemplating invoking the flexibility provided within ESSA, allowing high schools to administer a locally sel ected, nationally recognized high school assessment, instead of the North Dakota State Assessment for reporting purpose s. As part of their work, the Standards, Assessment, Accountability and Reporting subcommittee had much discussion and debate as to when using a growth model, what grade to assess nine, ten, or eleven. Should ACT be an option as it would not show growth? To resolve this debate, a PowerPoint was sent to North Dakota Principals, providing information and options in determining if at grade 11, they would like to use ACT for the state assessment or continue to take the North Dakota State Assessment. The questionnaire also asked if the administrators would be in favor of moving the state assessment to grade 10 and what time of the year the te st be given . b. Accountability and Support for Schools The State ESSA Planning Committee is working to establish rigorous long term and interim student achievement goals. These goals will be applied and adopted to ensure student academic growth, continuous school improvement, and include state achievement measures such as the use of the North Dakota State Assessment, adopted alternative high school assessments, valid and compatible interim assessment measures, and possible alternate combined metrics. Any a cademic achievement goals, either long -term or interim, would apply to composite and student subgroup achievement and focus on growth for all schools, local school districts, and the state. The State ESSA Planning Committee and subcommittees continue to solicit feedback from stakeholders and come to a consensus on what is best for all schools in North Dakota. An example of gathering and wanting this input is a letter received on behalf of the schools on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in support of a proposal to include General Education Development (GED) graduates into the state graduation rate instead of in the dropout rate. The letter states how incorporating this proposed action would support all students and schools while providing accountabili ty (Appendix F ). c. Supporting Excellent Educators The North Dakota Teacher and Leader Effectiveness subcommittee continues to meet on a monthly basis and report to the State ESSA Planning Committee in the first hour of each state meeting. The subcommittee formed to ensure North Dakota educators receive support in their teaching efforts and is led by personnel from the North Dakota LEAD Center, North Dakota Higher Education, and the ESPB . Together with the rest of the subcommittee members, they have decided to focus their work in three main areas: teacher and principal leadership academies, developing a statewide definition of highly effective teaching, and 28 recruitment/retention of educators. The Teacher and Leader Effectiveness subcommittee understands t here is a need to create a greater understanding of how important our state's teacher and principal mentorship programs are in helping facilitate a strong state education system. The subcommittee continues to work toward a multi -tiered leadership academy to support mentorship, career ladders, and academics for principals and teachers. The Teacher and Leader Effectiveness subcommittee recently reported to the State ESSA Planning Committee, their work on highly effective teacher definition. The subcommitte e looked at collected survey data and determined several themes: keeping the kindergarten endorsement, further discussion on grade seven and eight qualifications and redefining licensure to (K -8) and (5 -12). The committee also discussed incorporating min or areas of instruction for educators, keeping requirements for special education, adding alternative licensure, consideration of composite science and social studies, and working more with Career and Technical education. Regarding recruitment and retain ing educators in the state of North Dakota, the subcommittee is looking at criteria for statewide loan forgiveness for all educators, giving scholarships for higher education students pursuing a degree in teaching, and increasing statewide loan forgiveness for new teachers who teach in rural school districts or a critical needs subject area. d. Supporting All Students The State ESSA Planning Committee has had in -depth discussion on the additional school quality indicators. The state committee originally had twenty -five indicators and through a poll, narrowed that number to ten. There was much discussion and ideas on h ow to meet the element of the ESSA law in measurability, however, most of the remaining school quality indicators could be embedded in a continuous school improvement model and through consensus, the State ESSA Planning Committee chose school climate and s tudent engagement as their dashboard indicators. The law requires indicators be able to be disaggregated and differentiated. The Standards, Assessment, Accountability and Reporting subcommittee has done additional work on this requirement and recommends going forward with two additional school evaluating indicators in our state accountability plan. The two indicators are climate/culture and student engagement. To continue to support all students, North Dakota will include the required subgroups in its ac countability system: economically disadvantaged, race/ethnicity, students with disabilities, English learners, foster students, and students with parent (s) in the military. In addition, the state is discussing the idea of an advanced/gifted and talented subgroup. A challenge in creating the latter subgroup is forming a definition and criteria in which to qualify. In an effort to do what is best for all students, the State ESSA Planning Committee received a letter of support from the North Dakota Counci l of the Arts. The letter advocates stating the \"arts\" by discipline in the state ESSA plan, and using the \"arts\" as a school quality indicator. This letter was submitted two months after the full state planning committee reached consensus about using sch ool climate and student engagement as the two school quality indicators for the dashboard. The SEA and committee participants recognize that the fine arts are a part of a student's well -rounded education. Because of this point, the North 29 Dakota ESSA Plan will provide a framework for districts and schools allowing them to articulate their unique needs for Title 1 school wide programming. The guidance of our state ESSA plan will include the importance of the arts in school wide reform strategy; however, it will be a school district's local decision on what strategies a school will use and outline in their individual plan. (Appendix G). North Dakota is a local control state and each school district will have the opportunity to address well -rounded education including the arts. In addition to the many State ESSA Planning Committee and subcommittee meetings, Superintendent Baesler and members from the NNDDPI have traveled across North Dakota to hold ESSA Tribal Consultation and Tribal Stakeholder Engagement Me etings. There were four key points that arose from our Tribal Consultation meetings on the four reservations in North Dakota. Many Tribal members from the surrounding communities and Tribal Councils commended the NDDPI staff on their effort to meet wit h the Tribes. However, each Tribal chair did mention these consultation meetings and communication must continue as the council members see ongoing consultation as a necessity for the success and outcome of Native children and people. The Turtle Mountain , Standing Rock and Three Affiliated Tribes Council and community members brought up a second key point. In the North Dakota ESSA plan, there must be the commitment to local Tribal culture and language. Members from the Standing Rock Sioux and Three Affi liated Tribes presented details on how being immersed in the native language is a direct link to preserving their natural heritage and culture and the compelling argument that the two are interconnected. This point was also brought forth at Tribal Council meetings at Turtle Mountain. Our state's initial response to this concern was to create the North Dakota Native American Essential Understandings Project and to ensure all students and schools can have access to this working document. Our state's next res ponse was to create a legislative bill for an Innovative Pilot Program. North Dakota Senate Bill 2186 gives the superintendent of public instruction the authority to approve school applications for one -year pilot innovation programs to improve student edu cational performance. If this bill passes, native schools will be able to submit a detailed plan to pilot language immersion for improved student performance. There are also new grant programs under National Activities that can be used for Native language programs with goals to \"increase fluency in a Native American Language along with proficiency in other core subjects. This is section 6133 of ESSA. In addition, a New Immersion Language Study authorizes a grant review of best practices of Native language immersion schools. This is section 6005 of ESSA. The third point came from North Dakota Tribal Stakeholder Engagement Meetings \u2014a concern for communication and alignment of plans for the different types of schools serving Native American students --(BIE), grant schools, and public schools. There is a need to have the different reporting systems work efficiently and share information to avoid redundant work. Because of this concern, a cross walk must be completed between NDMILE (North Dakota state reporting version) Native Star (Bureau of Indian Education version) and AdvancED. The work on this crosswalk will begin in the next quarter. Our fourth key point is to reexamine North Dakota's graduation rate definition and find a way to include those students who attain their GED. Currently, GED is included in our state's dropout definition. Because of this concern, North Dakota will change our definition of graduation rate to include GED and implement this in our state plan. A student obtaining 30 their GED is a su ccess story and a step in the right direction for their future. Below is the dates of Tribal Stakeholder Meetings and Tribal Consultation: October 21, 2016 North Dakota ESSA Tribal Stakeholder Planning Committee Mtg.#1 November 4, 2016 United Tribes Tech nical College Board of Directors Meeting.

February 16, 2017 North Dakota ESSA Tribal Stakeholder Planning Committee Mtg.#3 March 14, 2017 Leadership Summit on ESSA Tribal Local Education Association Consultation. The creation of a state accountability plan required an abundance of communication and strong, established relationship s. The North Dakota Department of Public Instruction appreciates the care and feedback it received and has committed, along with the State ESSA Planning Committee, to have ongoing collaborative consultation. NDDPI and stakeholders have pledged to meet mi nimally once per year to evaluate plan implementation and make any necessary changes. There is also a strong commitment from NDDPI to continue Tribal Consultation and Tribal stakeholder engagement on an annual basis. The North Dakota Department of Public Instruction is continuing to build relations by establishing focus groups to help construct guidance and framework for our state plan once approved. An invitation is extended to stakeholders from the Arts, Music, Special Education, School Counselors, and many other groups to participate in providing guidance to ensure students have the well -rounded education. C. Governor's consultation . Describe how the SEA consulted in a timely and meaningful manner with the Governor consistent with section 8540 of the ESEA , including whether officials from the SEA and the Governor's office met during the development of this plan and prior to the submission of this plan. The Governor's office has an appointed member on the State ESSA Planning Committee. Superintendent Baesler informs Levi Bachmeier, the Policy Advisor at the North Dakota Office of the Governor, on a weekly basis on all topics related to education. Mr. Bachmeier has been involved in the meetings and contributed to the development of the st ate plan. Superintendent Baesler has had many meetings with Governor Burgum answering questions and hearing his thoughts on education as he plans to move North Dakota forward in the twenty -first century. An executive summary personally delivered to Gove rnor Burgum on Monday, April 3, 2017 by North Dakota State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Kirsten Baesler and Assistant State Superintendent, 31 Laurie Matzke synthesized the highlights of our consolidated state plan. He and Mr. Bachmeier will have the opportunity to discuss, question and comment. Check one: The Governor signed this consolidated State plan. The Governor did not sign this consolidated State plan. 32 33 2.2 System of Performance Management. Instructions : In the text boxes below, e ach SEA must describe consistent with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 299.15 (b) its system of performance management of SEA and LEA plans across all programs included in this consolidated State plan. The description of an SEA's system of performance management must include i nformation on the SEA's review and approval of LEA plans, monitoring, continuous improvement, and technical assistance across the components of the consolidated State plan. A. Review and Approval of LEA Plans. Describe the SEA's process for supporting the development, review, and approval of LEA plans in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements . The description should include a discussion of how the SEA will determine if LEA activities align with : 1) the specific needs of the LEA , and 2) the SEA's consolidated State plan. The NDDPI administers all federal Title programs included under ESSA within the Student Support & Innovation Division (SS&I). The SS&I is made up of six offices including the following: Office of Federal Title Program s Office of Academic Support Office of Indian/Multicultural Education Office of School Approval & Opportunity Office of Assessment Office of Early Learning All division staff work collaboratively within the division and with other offices to ensure evidence -based strategies and a needs assessment is utilized when allocating state and federal funds to support federal Title programming. The approval of LEA plans for Titles I, II, III, and IV will be administered through the C onsolidated Application for Federal Title Funds where all program staff across the SS&I review program requirements, staff qualifications, strategies, activities, and allowable use of funds. Data is collected through an electronic statewide data system, the State Automated Reporting System (STARS) , which feeds into federally required reports in EDFacts and CSPR. The collection and use of information and data is utilized to assess the quality of implementation of strategies and measure student progress to report outcomes on the district repor t cards. North Dakota's Consolidated Application for Federal Title Funds allows school districts to submit one comprehensive application for funding for several federal programs. Each year, districts must submit this application to the NDDPI in order to r eceive federal funds. The district's application provides a plan for meeting federal program requirements based on a needs assessment and alignment with specific needs of the LEAs for improving student achievement. This application is completed and submitt ed electronically through the STARS and includes the following programs: Title I, Part A - Improving Basic Programs Title II, Part A - Supporting Effective Instruction Title III, Part A - English Language Acquisition English Learner Program Title IV, Part A - Student Support and Academic Enrichment 34 Each district's school board appoints an authorized representative for the programs funded in the consolidated application and approves the application prior to its submission to the NDDPI. The submitted consoli dated applications are reviewed by the NDDPI, who provides technical assistance as needed and approves the applications when information is correct and in compliance. The federal programs under ESSA that are not part of the consolidated application - 21st Century Community Learning Centers (C CLC ), McKinney Vento Homeless Assistance , Migrant Education, Neglected & Delinquent (N&D) - all have comprehensive, established inclusive application procedures to distribute the funding. All districts that receive Ti tle II funds are required to complete a needs assessment and upload their needs assessment within the AdvancED tool and complete the Title II program and budget section of the consolidated application. As an element of the continuous improvement process wi thin AdvancED, districts must complete an annual review of the needs assessment. The Title II section of the consolidated application provides an area where the district must indicate that a needs assessment is completed and the activities are supported by data. The district must document this process in a text box that provides a narrative description of the needs assessment. The district must outline the Title II activities in the budget section. The NDDPI has a rigorous, multi -tiered review process of the districts consolidated application by experienced, knowledgeable program staff within the Division of Student Support & Innovation. This review process includes a thorough cross -check of the districts' responses to ensure the activities align with the district's identified needs and are appropriate use of Title II funds. During the consolidated application review process and throughout the school year, the program staff use the needs assessment data and information provided in the consolidated applicati on to work collaboratively with district administration providing technical assistance and consultation to support Title II activities. The NDDPI provides updated guidance and regular regional trainings to support districts on Title II requirements. B. Monit oring . Describe the SEA's plan to monitor SEA and LEA implementation of the included programs to ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements . This description must include how the SEA will collect and use data and information which may i nclude input from stakeholders and data collected and reported on State and LEA report cards (under section 1111(h) of the ESEA and applicable regulations ), to assess the quality of SEA and LEA implementation of strategies and progress toward meeting the desired program outcomes. The NDDPI monitors SEA and LEA implementation in many different ways to ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements. The monitoring system includes on -site visitations, review of self - submissions, reviewing da ta submitted on North Dakota automated reporting system, fiscal reviews, desk audits, as well as our continuous school improvement process through AdvancED. The NDDPI is in the process of revising our current consolidated monitoring process (currently incl uding Title I, Title II, and McKinney Vento Homeless Assistance ) to also encompass Title III and Title IV. The 21st CCLC progra m, Migrant Education, and the N &D program all have individual comprehensive monitoring systems in place. 35 As per the requirement of 2 CFR 200.331, NDDPI staff perform the annual risk assessment for every LEA to determine the risk level and whether additional conditions will be placed on the grant award. The state agency evaluates each sub recipient's risk of noncompliance with feder al statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the sub award for purposes of determining the appropriate sub recipient monitoring. Under North Dakota's established Performance Management System, the state monitors LEAs using multiple measures a nd processes. The system includes multiple fiscal reviews, programmatic reviews, analysis of reporting, and monitoring of school improvement to ensure progress toward meeting desired program outcomes. Strategy Timeline Federal Title Programs Monitoring (Title s I, II, III, IV) November - March Individual Program Monitoring (Homeless, 21st CCLC, Migrant Education, N&D) November - March Annual Desk Audit November - January AdvancED School Improvement Process September - May The North Dakota English Learner (EL)/Title III program has multiple measures in place to monitor Title III grant recipients, as well as LEAs for requirements relating to the civil rights of English learners. The NDDPI uses the State Automated Reporting System (STARS) to retrieve data on English learners' progress, LEA/Title III consortium program plans, effective program models implemented, entrance and exit procedures, professional development plans, teacher credentials, etc. The NDDPI has validations set up to monitor these ite ms. These validations are reviewed two times per year to help the NDDPI determine where technical assistance and training are needed. The NDDPI has a monitoring cycle established for on -site monitoring visits to the Title III recipients. The goal is to en sure each Title III participating LEA or consortium is monitored every 3 -5 years. This process includes a team of professionals visiting the LEA or consortium districts to discuss program details with administration, observe instructional strategies in the mainstream/content classrooms, observe the English language development (ELD) instruction in the EL classrooms, conduct student, teacher and parent interviews, complete a fiscal review, and review policies and procedures implemented to ensure accordance w ith state and federal laws. With the implementation of ESSA these monitoring visits will continue and include a review of how the entities are meeting the student, school and district EL goals. The new monitoring cycle rotation will include all districts w ith English learners and not just Title III recipients. Schools will be monitored through either a self -monitoring paper submission process or an on - site visit. Upon each submission or visit, schools will receive a report from NDDPI describing the commende d practices, recommendations, and compliance issues. Schools have 30 -90 days to respond to compliance issues depending on the type of indicator according to the monitoring template. (Appendix S) 36 C. Continuous Improvement . Describe the SEA's plan to continuously improve SEA and LEA plans and implementation. This description must include how the SEA will collect and use data and information which may include input from stakeholders and data collected and reported on State and LEA report cards (under section 1111(h) of the ESEA and applicable regulations ), to assess the quality of SEA and LEA implementation of strategies and progress toward meeting the desired program outcomes. North Dakota uses AdvancED statewide for continu ous school improvement, as well as the approval and improvement of all schools in the state. First and foremost, all schools will participate in continuous school improvement through the AdvancED process as a first tier for school improvement. The second tier will entail the targeted system of improvement and support. The third tier will entail the comprehensive system of improvement and support. The NDDPI will support LEAs as they develop their plans through a continuous improvement process model. This pr ocess is driven by a local comprehensive needs assessment through the AdvancED system. LEA and school plans will be reviewed by all applicable NDDPI program areas to meet the necessary state and/or federal statutory and regulatory requirements while prog ressing towards the implementation of best practices. Technical assistance and support will be provided to help inform and improve local plans and systems from both NDDPI staff as well as through the AdvancED external review process. This comprehensive system allows LEAs to produce a consistent, consolidated model for reviewing data, documenting needs, identifying improvement areas, and tracking progress. Strategy Timeline AdvancED School Improvement Process Annually September - May AdvancED Title I Schoolwide Plan within AdvancED Annually July 1 - June 30 Targeted Support Plans within AdvancED January 2019 - June 30, 2019 D. Differentiated Technical Assistance . Describe the SEA's plan to provide differentiated technical assistance to LEAs and schools to support effective implementation of SEA, LEA, and other subgrantee strategies . North Dakota has a differentiated system of technical assistance based on a continuous improvement process. This statewide system of technical assistance applies to all public schools and includes multiple measures for supporting all schools with an emphasis on low performing schools. These details are outlined in Section 4.3. B. 37 Section 3: Academic Assessments Instructions : As applicable, provide the information regarding a State's academic assessments in the text boxes below. A. Advanced Mathematics Coursework. Does the State: 1) administer end -of-course mathematics assessments to high school students in order to meet the requirements under section 1111(b)(2)(B)(v)(I)(bb) of the ESEA; and 2) use the exception for students in eighth grade to take such assessments under section 1111(b)(2)(C) of the ESEA? Yes. If yes, describe the SEA's strategies to provide all students in the State the opportunity to be prepared for and to take advanced mathematics coursework in middle school consistent with section 1111(b)(2)(C) and 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.5(b)(4) . No. The State ESSA Planning Committee and the Standards, Assessment, Accountability and Reporting Subcommittee have had in -depth discussions on the topic of academic assessment throughout the development of our state ESSA plan and in our discussion s regarding future considerations fo r education programming in North Dakota. North Dakota will continue to administer its current state general English language arts/literacy and mathematics assessments, the general NDSA/NDAA, based on the Smarter Balanced assessment model, through the end of the 2016 -2017 school year. The state will select new general English language arts/literacy and mathematics assessments, aligned to the states newly adopted content standards and based on the approved Request for Proposal (RFP) selection process, by Au gust 2017. The design parameters for the state's new English language arts/literacy and mathematics assessment system will be based, in part, on recommendations generated by a statewide assessment task force, which conducted its study from 2015 to 2016. An y final general assessments must meet all validity and reliability requirements specified in law and validated by the federal assessment peer review process. North Dakota will be invoking the flexibility provided within ESSA, allowing high schools to admi nister a locally -selected, nationally -recognized high school assessment, in lieu of the NDSA/NDAA, for accountability reporting purposes. Any state -sanctioned, nationally -recognized high school assessment must evidence validity and reliability specificatio ns set form by the state, compliant with federal peer review specifications. When the state releases the RF P for a new state assessment, a significant change will be made at the high school level. The State ESSA Planning Committee has recommended that beg inning in the 2017 -2018 school year, the high school grade assessed will be changed from grade 1 1 to grade 1 0. This decision was made due to the amount of testing that occurs in grade 11. B. Languages other than English. Describe how the SEA is complying wit h the requirements in section 1111(b)(2)(F) of the ESEA and 34 C.F.R. \u00a7200. 6(f) in languages other than English. i. Provide the SEA's definition for \"languages other than English that are present to a significant extent in the participating student population,\" consistent with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7200. 6(f)(4), and identify the specific languages that meet that definition. The English Learner Program Advisory Committee (ELPAC) and the ESSA Planning Committee have discussed the definition of significant language and has determined \"s ignificant languages\" 38 to be any language spoken by an English learner population that is at or above 30% of the state English learner population or if there is no population 30% or greater, \"significant language\" is the language with the largest EL student population. . In the current school year there are no language populations at 30% or higher , but Spanish is very close at 28% of the state EL population and the language with the largest EL student population. Therefore Spanish is currently considered a \"significant language\" in North Dakota . ii. Identify any existing assessments in languages other t han English, and specify for which grades and content areas those assessments are available. North Dakota is currently utilizing Smarter Balanced for the state assessment, which offers stacked translations in Spanish. The stacked translations are availabl e for the Mathematics portion of the assessment and for the grades testing, which are grades three through eight and tenth grade. The stacked translations will be offered to Spanish speaking students. iii. Indicate the languages other than English identified i n B above for which yearly student academic assessments are not available and are needed. The North Dakota State Assessment is currently using Smarter Balance which offers stacked translations in Spanish. At this time Spanish is the onl y language close to 30% of the North Dakota definition of \"significant language.\" Therefore, Spanish is the only language other than English in which North Dakota will offer the state assessment at this time. In the future determination of offering assessments in other langu ages, the literacy rate of the students in their native language will also be taken into consideration. North Dakota will make assessments available in other languages as they become available through the test vendor . iv. Describe how the SEA will make every effort to develop assessments, at a minimum, in languages other than English that are present to a significant extent in the participating student population by providing : 1. The State's plan and timeline for developing such assessments, including a descript ion of how it met the requirements of 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200. 6(f)(4); The North Dakota State Assessment currently offers stacked translations in Spanish which is the only language meeting the definition of \"significant language\". The stacked translations are bet ter for English learners than solely in the native language because some ELs are not literate in their native language. The stacked translations will allow them to show what they know by using the language that is most helpful to them. As other languages b ecome more prevalent , reach 30%, and students of said language are literate in that language, the state will make assessments available in other languages as they become available through the vendor. The next prevalent language is Somali , which is currentl y 15% of the North Dakota EL population , but much lower percentage of students who are literate in the Somali language . 2. A description of t he process the State used to gather meaningful input on the need for assessments in languages other than English, collect and respond to public 39 comment, and consult with educators ; parents and families of English learners ; students, as appropriate; and other stakeholders; and North Dakota law requires the NDDPI to assemble a group of EL stakeholders each year to inf orm the state EL policies and procedures. This group is the English Learner Program Advisory Committee (ELPAC). The ELPAC is made up of a wide variety of stakeholders who have an interest in EL education. The members are selected from nominations in stakeh older categories including, but not limited to: teachers and administrators from the eastern and western part of the state, special education, post - secondary education, EL parents, data and technology, REAs , migrant education, colony schools, adult educati on, Native American ELs, and refugee students. The ELPAC has met on multiple occasions to discuss the ESSA law and how it applies to English learners. The group has reviewed the items for the state plan and made recommendations to the Standards and Accoun tability subcommittee. This subcommittee then reviewed and approved the recommendations , which were then taken to the entire State ESSA Planning Committee. All items needed approval by the entire committee before going to the Superintendent for final approval. The recommendations were then added to the state plan. The minutes of the ELPAC meetings are included as Appendix P . 3. As applicable, an explanation of the reasons the State has not been able to complete the development of such assessments despite making every effort. This is not applicable as the state has been successful in offering Spanish -English stacked translations for the NDSA/NDAA . 40 Section 4: Accountability, Support, and Improvement for Schools Instructions : Each SEA must describe its accountability, support, and improvement system consistent with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 200.12 -200.24 and section 1111(c) and (d) of the ESEA. Each SEA may include documentation (e.g., technical r eports or supporting evidence) that demonstrates compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. 4.1 Accountability System . A. Indicators . Describe the measure (s) included in each of the Academic Achievement, Academic Progress, Graduation Rate, Progress in Achieving English Language Proficiency, and School Quality or Student Success indicators and how those measures meet the requirements described in 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.14( a)-(b) and section 1111(c)(4)(B) of the ESEA . The description for each indicator should include how it is valid, reliable, and comparable across all LEAs in the State , as described in 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.14(c) . To meet the requirements described in 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.14(d), f or the measures included within the indicators of Academic Progress and School Quality or Student Success measure s, the description must also address how each measure within the indicators is supported by research that high performance or improvement on such measure is likely to increase student learning (e.g., grade point average, credit accumulation, perfor mance in advanced coursework). For measures within indicators of School Quality or Student Success that are unique to high school, the description must address how research shows that high performance or improvement on the indicator is likely to increase graduation rates , postsecondary enrollment, persistence, completion, or career readiness . To meet the requirement in 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.14(e), the descriptions fo r the Academic Progress and School Quality or Student Success indicators must include a demonstration of how each measure aids in the meaningful differentiation of schools under 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.18 by demonstrating varied results across schools in the Stat e. Elementary/Middle School Indicator Measure (s) Description i. Academic Achievement Proficiency in ELA Proficiency in Mathematics The statewide math ematics and ELA assessment (NDSA /NDAA ) ii.

Academic Achievement Proficiency in ELA Proficiency in Mathematics The statewide mathematics and ELA assessment (NDSA /NDSS ) ii. Graduation Rate 4-year Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate Graduation rates are calculated based on the number of students who earned a regular high school diploma divided by the total number of students in the cohort beginning in the ninth grade . An extended graduation rate of five years is included to recognize that some students need additional time to graduate. All graduation rates are reported for all students as well as separately for each subgroup of students iii. Progress in Achieving English Language Proficiency ACCESS 2.0 Growth Model iv. School Quality or Student Success Climate/Engagement The tool that will be utilized is a survey through the AdvancED platform. v. College & Career Ready North Dakota's Choice Ready Framework The Choice Ready framework will measure the percentage of students who are on track to graduate choice ready , which will include a growth factor Missing indicat or's weights would be proportionally redistributed among the remaining indicators so that relative weighting between indicators is preserved. 42 State Assessment Achievement Growth 30%Climate/Engagement 30% English Learner Proficiency 10%State Assessment Achievement Rate 16%GED Completion 8%Elementary High School North Dakota clearly demonstrates that the academic indicators are more heavily weighted than the additional indicators of school quality. Elementary - 70% weighted on academic indicators High School - 51% weighted on academic indicators North Dakota assures that our data wi ll be ready to make accountability determinations and identify schools for Comprehensive and Targeted Support by the beginning of the 2018 -2019 school year. 43 North Dakota Accountability System - Selected Indicators Elementary/Middle School Academic Achievement - The NDSA measures student acquisition of academic outcomes in English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics. Since the 2014 -2015 school year, the NDSA has included ELA and mathematics statewide assessments aligned to the State Standards, and based on the assessment model provided by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium. All elementary and middle school students in grades 3 through 8, with the exception of students with the most significant cognitive disabilities, participate in the NDSA. In 2016 -2017 North Dakota initiated a comprehensive standards review in ELA and mathematics, which concluded in April 2017 with the implementation of updated standards. North Dakota is in the procurement process to develop a new assessment system to be admi nistered for the first time in spring 2018. The new assessment system will serve as the academic achievement indicator for elementary and middle school students in grades 3 through 8. Academic Progress - North Dakota will be using a Student Learning Ind ex within our accountability system to measure student growth on the NDSA. The Student Learning Index provides a measuring and monitoring structure that is responsive to the starting point for each institution in its unique journey to improve student learn ing. North Dakota will calculate achievement and growth for each student based on statewide assessment scores in English language arts/literacy and mathematics. The state will set expected achievement and growth levels consistent at each grade level for s tatewide assessments. North Dakota will employ a Student Learning Index which will measure the degree to which each institution provides evidence of improving student performance on statewide assessments. Schools will be expected to demonstrate growth towa rds meeting and exceeding expected levels of achievement. Achievement levels will be set in six year intervals (See Appendix N). Institutions will be expected to demonstrate growth towards expected achievement levels. Growth will be measured for each stud ent based on a standard definition of one year of growth for one year of learning (See Appendix I). The Student Learning Index is constructed to promote and recognize positive progress towards meeting the expectations for student achievement as stated in t he state's vision. Every school has a different starting point in pursuit of the vision. The Student Learning Index is a tool that measures growth and achievement in a composite index. Because the learning index will identify high performing/no growth, hig h performing/recognizable growth, low performing/high growth, low performing/low or no growth it will provide clear and distinct differentiation among institutions for the purpose of accountability and will be used to evaluate the academic progress achieve d by each school. The basic structure expects schools with high achievement levels (top performing quartile) to maintain such levels while realizing minimal, bur recognizable, growth. Schools with low achievement (lowest performing quartile) have a much lo nger road to reach expected achievement levels. The Student Learning Index growth model is outlined in more detail in Appendix I. 44 North Dakota Accountability Index The North Dakota Accountability Index (NDAI) has a maximum composite value of 615 points. Schools earn points based on individual student performance results using the defined measures in the areas of achievement, student growth, student engagement, and English learner proficiency at the elementary leve l (achievement, choice ready, graduation rate, GED completion, student engagement, and English learner proficiency at the high school level). The basic formula provides point values for each student that meets or exceeds defined performance targets, parti al point values for nearly achieving defined performance targets, and negative point values for not meeting defined performance targets. The charts below define the performance targets for each measure in the North Dakota Accountability Index. ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVELS Student Achievement Levels . Point values for each student at each level are shown in parenthesis. North Dakota is in the process of selecting a new statewide assessment in ELA and Math that will be administered beginning in the spring of 2018. The scale score ranges for each achievement level will be determined once the assessment instrument is selected.

The composite score consists of an achievement measure (using the same scale as defined in Chart A above) and growth measure for each individual student. The basic formula prov ides point values for each student that meets or exceeds defined performance targets, partial point values for nearly achieving defined performance targets, and negative point values for not meeting defined performance targets. Schools will be 45 awarded to tal point values based on a formula that measures progress earned towards expected benchmarks. Point values for each student at each level are shown in parenthesis. The state assessment will provide growth achieved by each student based on prior year res ults. Every student will be expected to demonstrate at least one year's worth of growth for one year's worth of learning.

Growth will be measured for all EL students in K -12 by using the growth to target method. Students start on the growth trajectory at the composite proficiency level (PL) of their first annual ELP assessment in North Dakota (currently ACCESS 2.0). This is considered year 0 or base score. Year one growth is determined after the second annual ELP assessment. The students' trajectories will be constructed from the starting point proficiency level to the 5.0 target proficiency level over a period of years according to the table below. Proficiency Level Years to Attain PL (exit) 1.0-1.9 6 years 2.0-2.9 5 year s 3.0-3.9 4 years 4.0-4.9 3 years 5.0-6.0 2 years EL students in North Dakota will annually increase their composite language proficiency level of the annual ELP assessment and remain at or above their established trajectory line. This growth model will begin with the 2016 -17 annual ELP assessment scores as a baseline to provide for consistency in accountability due to the new assessment and the standard setting process complete. The annual percentages expected will be determined by the ELPAC. EL stu dents in North Dakota will attain English proficiency (exit the program) by receiving a 3.5 proficiency level in each domain of listening, speaking, reading and writing and a 5.0 composite proficiency level. The percentage of students meeting the growth ta rget for the school will then be converted based on the ten point or ten percent accountability for ELs. English Learner Proficiency Levels will be measured using growth as the uniform progress measure of English Language Proficiency (ELP). Growth will be measured for all EL students in K -12 by using the growth to target method. Students start on the growth trajectory at the composite proficiency level (PL) of their first annual ELP assessment in North Dakota (currently ACCESS 2.0). This is considered year 0 or base score. Year one growth is determined after the second annual ELP assessment. The students' trajectories will be constructed from the starting point proficiency level to the 5.0 target proficiency level over a period of years according to the ta ble below.

This growth model will begin with the 2016 -17 annual ELP assessment scores as a baseline to provide for consistency in accountability due to the new assessment and the standard setting process compl ete. EL students in North Dakota will attain English proficiency (exit the program) by receiving a 3.5 proficiency level in each domain of listening, speaking, reading and writing and a 5.0 composite proficiency level. The percentage of students meeting th e growth target for the school will then be converted based on the maximum 60 -point value (or 10% NDAI). CHART D - English Language Proficiency Levels (10% or 60 maximum point values) Sample Calculation Grade Number of EL Students Number of EL Students Meeting Expectations Percent Proficient School Index Value 3 32 19 59.4 35.63 4 41 26 63.4 38.05 5 15 44.00 School Total 88 56 63.64 38.18 *Formula ELP School Index Value = (%Proficient) (ELP Maximum Point Value) School Quality or Student Success - North Dakota has a selected Student Engagement as our additional school quality or student success indicator. A Student Engagement Survey w ill be used that was designed for the purpose of providing a valid reliable survey to measure student engagement that would glean valuable and actionable data for improvement, as well as a reliable and useful indicator for accountability. The Student Engagement Survey is designed to provide quick access to meaningful and actionable data at the school and district level to improve teaching and learning practices, while also providing valid and reliable results at the state level for purposes of statewide reporting and accounta bility From within the eProve survey platform within the AdvancED system , schools, districts and the states have access to an interactive reporting interface that allows for quick and easy access to survey results. Through this reporting tool, authorized users can monitor survey response rates, download raw survey response results and view survey response data (counts and percentages) in graphical format. In addition, AdvancED will work with the state to provide a comprehensive set of survey reports at the school, district and state level. These reports will incorporate an engagement profile score, which describes the state's performance for all three domains - cognitive, behavioral and emotional. This score is computed using student survey responses that are aligned to the above -defined quality of engagement categories. A subset of scores specific to each domain, referred to as component scores, will be combined to determine a comprehensive engagement profile score that can be reported at the school, system and state levels. From the profile scores, schools and districts will be able to access a subset of scores that reflect the percentage of students within each grade, grade span, school and district that are engaged by domain, level and category. The report will include the count and percentage of students falling into each quality of engagement category for each of the three engagement domains . 48 All scores will provide schools, districts and states with information about a school's performance rela tive to a benchmark. The benchmark will be established based on the pilot average of schools across the AdvancED network. Because there is a substantial difference between grade spans, high schools (Grades 9 - 12) will be compared to the benchmark high school average, middle schools (Grades 6 - 8) will be compared to the benchmark middle school average and elementary schools (Grades 3 - 5) will be compared to the benchmark elementary school average. (Appendix R ) North Dakota 's proce ss to calculate Student Engagement: The state is currently holding subcommittee meetings that address these issues directly. Here is an overview of the process. The Department of Public Instruction will hold monthly student engagement meetings that specifically involve student engagement processes and implementation. As of the writing of this document, the student engagement subcommittee has agreed to use the AdvancED Student Engagement Surveys that : Measure elementary, middle and high school studen t engagement through student opinions about their learning experiences. The 20 items are categorized under the three domains of engagement type (behavior, cognitive and emotional). These domains are then broken down further by three components of engagemen t quality - committed, compliant and disengaged. Finally, each component is aligned to two levels. Thus, the committed component has an \"invested\" or \"immersed\" level; the compliant component has a \"strategic\" or \"ritual\" level; and the disengaged componen t has a \"retreatism\" or \"rebellion\" level. (AdvancED, n.d., p. 1). The surveys have been field tested in a scientific valid pilot study that tested for validity and fidelity using statistically significant measurement processes such as Cronbach's Alpha. Th e study yielded results that are statistically significant ranking the High School and Middle School surveys \"adequate,\" with both scoring 7 and above; the elementary school survey scored \"good\" with a Cronbach Alpha of .67. Using these valid surveys, No rth Dakota will use the AdvancED web platform to electronically deliver surveys to students. The results will be stored by AdvancED and data will be securely transferred to the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction and, in turn, uploaded to the Sta tewide Longitudinal Data System (SL DS). S LDS will work with OtisEd to process data and deliver to the dashboard. The formula that will be used to calculate data is still being discussed and refined by the subcommittee. This conversation will go on for the next several months and will include researchers from the North Dakota University System. North Dakota will ensure it will be ready to use this student engagement data in the accountability determinations by the beginning of the 2018 -2019 school year. The state is already working with AdvancEd and stakeholders to develop a window to administer surveys. There are two windows currently feasible, November 2017 and January 2018. The 49 subcommittee must make decisions quickly regarding on what additional infor mation to include on the surveys to make the November window. Regardless of the window the surveys are administered, data will be available for presentation for the 2018 -2019 school year. References: AdvancED. (n.d.). Psychometric summary of AdvancED's student engagement survey. (Appendix W) Student Engagement Levels present in every school are determined by a research -based survey instrument. The instrument has been piloted in three state s and tested for reliability and validity. In addition to the survey, every school has access to a research -based student engagement observation tool that provides every school with greater insight as well as strategies to improve student engagement level s in every classroom. The instrument results will be disaggregated by defined subgroups to further the analysis of student engagement levels present in classrooms. The survey is designed to measure the quality of student engagement in three domains of Co gnitive Engagement; Behavioral Engagement; and Emotional (Affective) Engagement. For each school, the survey instrument will provide the presence of engagement in each of the domains based on three defined levels of engagement based on research: Committed (Authentic Engagement); Compliant; and Disengaged. The Student Engagement Survey was specifically designed to provide a useful summary of the detailed information represented in student responses and to provide information relative to a benchmark. There are 20 q uestions categorized under the three domains of engagement (behavior, cognitive and emotional). These domains are then broken down further by three components of engagement - committed, compliant and disengaged. Finally, each component is aligned to two levels. Thus, the committed component has an \"invested\" or \"immersed\" level; the compliant component has a \"strategic\" or \"ritual\" level; and the disengaged component has a \"retreatism\" or \"rebellion\" level. A student who finishes the survey will be labeled as Committed, Compliant, or Disengaged for each of the three domains. This label is based on which component of engagement the student answers the majority of the time within each factor. It should be noted that the Behavioral domain has six it ems which means it is possible that a respondent has an even number of responses across two or more components. In these cases, the student would be labeled as having a \"mixed\" engagement type. The percentage reported for each domain is calculated by cou nting the number of students in each domain out of the total number of students taking part in the survey. The percentage reported for each component of engagement is calculated in the same way.

Since the 2014 -2015 school year, the NDSA has included ELA and mathematics statewide assessments aligned to the State Standards, and based on the assessment model provided by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium. All high school students in grade 11, with the exception of students with the most significant cognitive disabilities, participate in the NDSA. In 2016 -2017 North Dakota initiated a comprehensive standards review in ELA and mathematics, which concluded in April 2017 with the implementation of updated standards. North Dakota is in the procurement process to develop a new assessment system to be administe red for the first time in spring 2018 to all students in grade 10. The new assessment system will serve as the academic achievement indicator for high school students. HIGH SCHOOL Student Achievement Levels . Point values for each student at each level are shown in parenthesis.

The scale score ranges for each achievement level will be determined once the assessment instrument is selected. A sample accountability index system for a high school is available in Appendix Y. Academic Progress - North Dakota will be using a Student Learning Index within our accountability system to measure student growth on the NDSA. The Student Learning Index provides a measuring and monitoring structure that is responsive to the starting point for each instit ution in its unique journey to improve student learning. The basic structure expects schools with high achievement levels (top performing quartile) to maintain such levels while realizing minimal, bur recognizable, growth. Schools with low achievement (lo west performing quartile) have a much longer road to reach expected achievement levels. The Student Learning Index growth model is outlined in more detail in Appendix I. Graduation Rate - North Dakota will retain its current growth criteria for determinin g sufficient graduation rate achievement. The state will establish unique targets each of the respective years: the four-year extended cohort graduation rate will use a 12.5% growth target (a 25% increase in expectation from the four -year target base); and the six -year extended coh ort graduation rate will use a 21% growth target (a 50% increase in expectation from the four -year target base). The target measured as the percent reduction of non -graduates from the preceding year against the 90% (10% reduction in non -graduates against the goal (90%) from the previous year's rate) for the four -year graduation rate. If it did not, the state would then determine whether the school or district had met the six-year extende d year graduation rate target (21 % reduction in non -graduates against the goal (90%) from the previous year's rate. Meeting the ta rgets for any of the four -year, five -year extended, or six - year extended graduation rates would mean that the school or district had met its absolute or growth goal. North Dakota's plan will also include the GED in our accountability system, separate from the graduation rate. A dropout who completes a North Dakota GED prior to the 22nd year will be credited to the home district as a graduate. GED graduates will account fo r up to 8% of the 21% goal in the high school accountability system . Graduation Rate - North Dakota will retain its current growth criteria for determining sufficient graduation rate achievement. The state will establish unique targets each of the respect ive years: the four-year extended cohort graduation rate will use a 12.5% growth target (a 25% increase in expectation from the four -year target base); and the six -year extended cohort graduation rate will use a 21% growth target (a 50% increase in expecta tion from the four -year target base). The target measured as the percent reduction of non -graduates from the preceding year against the 90% (10% reduction in non -graduates against the goal (90%) from the previous year's rate) for the four -year graduation r ate. If it did not, the state would then determine whether the school or district had met the six-year extended year graduation rate target (21% reduction in non -graduates against the goal (90%) from the previous year's rate. Meeting the targets for any of the four -year, five -year extended, or six - 52 year extended graduation rates would mean that the school or district had met its absolute or growth goal.

Growth will be measured for all EL students in K -12 by using the growth to target method. Students start on the growth trajectory at the composite proficie ncy level (PL) of their first annual ELP assessment in North Dakota (currently ACCESS 2.0). This is considered year 0 or base score. Year one growth is determined after the second annual ELP assessment. The students' trajectories will be constructed from t he starting point proficiency level to the 5.0 target proficiency level over a period of years according to the table below. Proficiency Level Years to Attain PL (exit) 1.0-1.9 6 years 2.0-2.9 5 years 3.0-3.9 4 years 4.0-4.9 3 years 5.0-6.0 2 years 53 EL students in North Dakota will annually increase their composite language proficiency level of the annual ELP assessment and remain at or above their established trajectory line. This growth model will begin with the 2016 -17 annual ELP assessment scor es as a baseline to provide for consistency in accountability due to the new assessment and the standard setting process complete. The annual percentages expected will be determined by the ELPAC. EL students in North Dakota will attain English proficiency (exit the program) by receiving a 3.5 proficiency level in each domain of listening, speaking, reading and writing and a 5.0 composite proficiency level. The percentage of students meeting the growth target for the school will then be converted to the ten point or ten percent allocated for EL growth in the accountability system for schools. English Learner Proficiency Levels will be measured using growth as the uniform progress measure of English Language Proficiency (ELP). Growth will be measured for all EL students in K -12 by using the growth to target method. Students start on the growth trajectory at the composite proficiency level (PL) of their first annual ELP assessment in North Dakota (currently ACCESS 2.0). This is considered year 0 or base score.

EL students in North Dakota will attain English proficiency (exit the program) by receiving a 3.5 proficiency level in each domain of listening, speaking, reading and writing and a 5.0 composite proficiency level. The percentage of students meeting the growth target for the school will then be converted based on the maximum 60 -point value (or 10% NDAI).

A Student Engagement Survey will be used that was designed for the purpose of providing a valid reliable survey to measure student engagement th at would glean valuable and actionable data for improvement, as well as a reliable and useful indicator for accountability. The Student Engagement Survey is designed to provide quick access to meaningful and actionable data at the school and district level to improve teaching and learning practices, while also providing valid and reliable results at the state level for purposes of statewide reporting and accountability From within the eProve survey platform within the AdvancED system, schools, districts and the states have access to an interactive reporting interface that allows for quick and easy access to survey results. Through this reporting tool, authorized users can monitor survey response rates, download raw survey response results and view survey response data (counts and percentages) in graphical format. In addition, AdvancED will work with the state to provide a comprehensive set of survey reports at the school, district and state level. These reports will incorporate an engagement profile score, which describes the state's performance for all three domains - cognitive, behavioral and emotional. This score is computed using student survey responses that are aligned to the above -defined quality of engagement categories. A subset of scores specific to each domain, referred to as component scores, will be combined to determine a comprehensive engagement profile score that can be reported at the school, system and state levels. From the profile scores, schools and districts will be able to access a subset of scores that reflect the percentage of students within each grade, grade span, school and district that are engaged by domain, level and category. The report will include the count and percentage of students falling into each quality of engagement category for each of the three engagement domains . All scores will provide schools, districts and states with information about a school's performance relative to a benchmark. The benchmark will be established based on the pilot average of schools across the AdvancED network. Because there is a substantial difference between grade spans, high schools (Grades 9 - 12) will be compared to the benchmark high school average, middle schools (Grades 6 - 8) will be compared to the benchmark middl e school average and elementary schools (Grades 3 - 5) will be compared to the benchmark elementary school average. (Appendix R) North Dakota ' process to calculate Student Engagement: The state is currently holding subcommittee meetings that address these issues directly. Here is an overview of the process. The Department of Public Instruction will hold monthly student engagement meetings that specifically involve student engagement pr ocesses and implementation. As of the writing of this document, the student engagement subcommittee has agreed to use the AdvancED Student Engagement Surveys that Measure elementary, middle and high school student engagement through student opinions about their learning experiences. The 20 items are categorized under the three domains of engagement type (behavior, cognitive and emotional). These 55 domains are then broken down further by three components of engagement quality - committed, compliant and diseng aged. Finally, each component is aligned to two levels. Thus, the committed component has an \"invested\" or \"immersed\" level; the compliant component has a \"strategic\" or \"ritual\" level; and the disengaged component has a \"retreatism\" or \"rebellion\" level. (AdvancED, n.d., p. 1). The surveys have been field tested in a scientific valid pilot study that tested for validity and fidelity using statistically significant measurement processes such as Cronbach's Alpha. The study yielded results that are statistica lly significant ranking the High School and Middle School surveys \"adequate,\" with both scoring 7 and above; the elementary school survey scored \"good\" with a Cronbach Alpha of .67. Using these valid surveys, North Dakota will use the AdvancED web platfo rm to electronically deliver surveys to students. The results will be stored by AdvancED and data will be securely transferred to the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction and, in turn, uploaded to the Statewide Longitudinal Data System ( SLDS ). SLD S will work with OtisEd to process data and deliver to the dashboard. The formula that will be used to calculate data is still being discussed and refinded by the subcommittee. This conversation will go on for the next several months and will include researchers from the North Dakota University System. North Dakota will ensure it will be ready to use this student engagement data in the accountability determi nations by the beginning of the 2018 -2019 school year. The state is already working with AdvancEd and stakeholders to develop a window to administer surveys. There are two windows currently feasible, November 2017 and January 2018. The subcommittee must make decisions quickly regarding on what additional information to include on the surveys to make the November window. Regardless of the window the surveys are administered, data will be available for presentation for the 2018 -2019 school year. Reference s: AdvancED. (n.d.). Psychometric summary of AdvancED's student engagement survey. (Appendix W) Student Engagement Levels present in every school are determined by a research -based survey instrument. The instrument has been piloted in three states and tes ted for reliability and validity. In addition to the survey, every school has access to a research -based student engagement observation tool that provides every school with greater insight as well as strategies to improve student engagement levels in ever y classroom. The instrument results will be disaggregated by defined subgroups to further the analysis of student engagement levels present in classrooms. The survey is designed to measure the quality of student engagement in three domains of Cognitive Engagement; Behavioral Engagement; and Emotional (Affective) Engagement. For each school, the 56 survey instrument will provide the presence of engagement in each of the domains based on three defined levels of engagement based on research: Committed (Authen tic Engagement); Compliant; and Disengaged. The Student Engagement Survey was specifically designed to provide a useful summary of the detailed information represented in student responses and to provide information relative to a benchmark. There are 20 q uestions categorized under the three domains of engagement (behavior, cognitive and emotional). These domains are then broken down further by three components of engagement - committed, compliant and disengaged. Finally, each component is aligned to two levels. Thus, the committed component has an \"invested\" or \"immersed\" level; the compliant component has a \"strategic\" or \"ritual\" level; and the disengaged component has a \"retreatism\" or \"rebellion\" level. A student who finishes the survey will be labe led as Committed, Compliant, or Disengaged for each of the three domains. This label is based on which component of engagement the student answers the majority of the time within each factor. It should be noted that the Behavioral domain has six items whic h means it is possible that a respondent has an even number of responses across two or more components. In these cases, the student would be labeled as having a \"mixed\" engagement type. The percentage reported for each domain is calculated by counting th e number of students in each domain out of the total number of students taking part in the survey. The percentage reported for each component of engagement is calculated in the same way. CHART F - Student Engagement (22% or 135 maximum point values) Engagement Levels of Engagement Student Engagement Level Domains Committed Compliant Disengaged Mixed Number Percent Number Percent Number Percent Number Percent Behavior 438 85 122 70 Cognitive 429 = 715 College and Career Ready - Choice Ready An emerging and exciting addition to the NDDPI ESSA State Plan is the innovative focus on a broad comprehensive set of indicators that truly embrace the philosophy of ESSA core components of 'well rounded\" education and state specific measurements. In a shift from NCLB, North Dakota stakeholders have adopted the frame work of Choice Ready as an indicator. This concept focuses on the culmination of academic growths and gains, in combination with specific indicators of success for post-secondary, career, and military readiness. The positive messaging behind the Choice Rea dy campaign is inclusive of all students and helps them identify career clusters and related skills which will prepare and enhance success in any or multiple areas beyond high school. 57 To meet the statewide vision for students, every student should graduate from high school ready for college or career; every student should have meaningful opportunities to choose from upon graduation from high school. Indicators that reflect the knowledge and skills needed for success will promote academic connectedness and s tudent engagement as well as promote a positive school climate. In collaboration with the other approved indicator measures, NDDPI and local school districts are strongly positioned to follow the lead of the federal leadership. Additionally, NDDPI supports the Choice Ready indicators as a tool which can contribute to rewarding progress and success; address persistent gaps in student academic achievement and graduation rates; meaningfully map college or career readiness; and, use progress and growth data in subjects other than English and math to equitably and accurately assess school needs and appropriate target strategies. The Choice Ready indicator supports the NDDPI mission: Students will graduate with the knowledge, skills, and disposition to be success ful in their choice of post -secondary, technical college, workforce, or military enlistment. Choice Ready categories include: College Ready Schools can support higher education and academia bound students who have demonstrated high academic proficiency an d meet additional criteria that support the rigor of post -secondary clusters and provide a solid academia for transition to college. Career Ready Schools can support students who desire to secure employment directly after high school graduation or enroll in a short -term technical program through identified sub indicators within this option. In addition to academic standards, criteria is identified which promote transition to either environment; the interchange of criteria broadens the opportunities for st udents who seek employment to also consider vocational technical programs. Military Ready Schools can support students who wish to enlist in the many military branches. Students are military ready if they have met the indicators and have participated in additional identified criteria. The goal is to assist with designing a career plan which best meets the student needs and desires. The Choice Ready indicators serve as the foundation of this initiative, which allow local school districts to help guide st udents to graduate choice ready with an intended plan, or multiple options available to them. The North Dakota model for Choice Ready captures the essence of this new indicator in an easily interpreted graphic format. See Appendix J. As a new component in the North Dakota accountability system, Choice Ready will measure whether our high schools produce students that are ready for success upon graduation. The metrics outlined within the Choice Ready initiative are intended to measure growth for North Dakot a high schools, as indicated by student readiness. The growth model for grades K -8 is student -based, however the Choice Ready initiative, which is our growth model at the high school, will measure school growth rather than student growth. Ideally, all students will graduate choice ready in all three areas; academic, military, career, however, within the accountability system, schools need to have students graduate choice ready in two of the three categories. The 2017 -2018 school year will set the baseline data for this initiative. The expectation is 58 for schools to increase the number of student's graduati ng choice ready each year so the choice ready rate matches the graduation rate. The choice ready metric provides an opportunity for: Schools to demonstrat e growth in accountability determinations Students to graduate high school choice ready for at least two of the three chosen paths Parents to have their students take credit bearing courses upon entering college or university , which saves students and parent's time and money. The details regarding how the behind the scenes mathematical calculations will occur and how the data will be collected are yet to be determined. The NDDPI created nine ESSA Implementation committees. Members and educational leaders serving on these committees will work on the details to roll out the various ESSA components. There is an ESSA Implementation committee on the Choice Ready initiative that will weigh in on these discussions.

Subgroups . i. List the subgroups of students from each major and racial ethnic group in the State , consistent with 34 C.F.R . \u00a7 200.16(a)(2) , and, as applicable, describe any additional subgroups of students used in the accountability system . North Dakota will include the required subgroups in its accountability system which includes: Economically disadvantaged students Children with disabilities English learners White American Indian or Alaska Native African American Asian or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander Hispanic or Latino The State will report on foster students, homeless students and students with par ent(s) in the military, however, these additional subgroups will not be a part of the accountability system. ii. If applicable, describe the statewide uniform procedure fo r including f ormer children with disabilities in the children with disabilities subgroup for purposes of calculating any indicator that uses data based on State assessment results under section 1111(b)(2)(B)(v)(I) of the ESEA and as described in 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.16(b) , including the number of years the State includes the results of former children with disabilities . Under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the Every Students Succeeds Act (ESEA), NDDPI will include former children with disabilities as a separate subgroup, but not include those students with the children with disabilities subgroup . North Dakota will use the minimum \"n\" size of 10 for this subgroup . iii. If applicable, describe the statewide uniform procedure for including former English learners in the English l earner subgroup for purposes of calculating any indicator that uses data based on State assessment results under section 1111(b)(2)(B)(v)(I) of the 60 ESEA and as described in 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.16(c)(1), including the number of years the State includes the resu lts of former English learners. North Dakota has a state automated reporting system that records student information such as attainment date. The attainment data is used to determine which ELs are in the \"former EL\" category and the number of years they a re considered former ELs. This is also used to determine which students are within the reporting timeframes required and allowed under ESSA. North Dakota requires districts to monitor ELs for two years after attainment of English proficiency, but allows di stricts to keep ELs on their monitoring caseload for up to four years. The state will include former ELs for two years in the accountability of academic achievement and graduation rate. iv. If applicable, c hoose one of the following options for recently arrived English learners in the State: Exception under 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.16(c)(3)(i) or Exception under 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.16(c)(3)(ii) or Exception under section 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.16( c)(4)(i)(B) . If selected, provide a description of the uniform procedure in the box below. C. Minimum Number of Students . i. Provide the minimum number of students for purposes of accountability that the State determines are necessary to be included in each of the subgroups of students consistent with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.17 (a). North Dakota has established the sample size of N>9 as the minimum number of students required in a school or subgroup for any public reporting or accountability determination to occur. If any current -year's achievement rates are based on a sample size less than this defined limit, then any accountability determination and reporting must revert to multiple - year calculations, until a sufficient sample size is achieved. This minimum sample size reflects long -standing state policy regarding the minimum sample size require d for the purposes of protecting individual students from possible identification, consistent with the Family Education Rights to Privacy Act. To establish a balanced concern for validity and reliability in public accountability and reporting set forth within ESSA, North Dakota has adopted a confidence interval determination, referenced to the binomial distribution with an alpha value set at 0.01, or a 99% confidence value. The use of the state's selected confidence interval replaces any single sample si ze reference (e.g., N<30 sample size) and reasserts the state's long -standing practice of applying a 99% confidence interval statistical test in providing for a fair, valid, and reliable means of public accountability and reporting. North Dakota' s establ ished minimum sample size of N>9 and the corresponding application of a 99% confidence interval statistical reliability test has been a longstanding provision of the state's accountability system. This sample size and reliability provision has been previou sly reviewed and approved by federal ESEA peer review . Stakeholder Engagement on N Size North Dakota historically has used the N size of 10 for accountability purposes. This issue was discussed at length within our State ESSA Planning Committee. 61 The Nort h Dakota Standards, Assessment, Accountability and Reporting subcommittee wanted to be thorough in creating our state plan and explored increasing the N size to 15 and reporting every year. They sought input from their constituents and determined if the s tate's accountability plan required school districts to report every year, a larger schools' factors are different from a smaller one. In addition, if the N size were to increase, then a smaller school district may never have enough students to report or would need to aggregate too many years. This scenario was unsatisfactory to the subcommittee, and they recommended to the full North Dakota State ESSA Planning Committee to keep the N size at 10 and for the smaller districts to aggregate two to possibly th ree years of data. After further dialogue, the North Dakota State ESSA Planning Committee agreed with the subcommittee's recommendation and voted to keep the accountability number size at 10. ii. If the State's minimum number of students for purposes of repor ting is lower than the minimum number of students for purposes of accountability, provide that number consistent with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.17(a)(2)(iv). Not Applicable iii. Describe h ow the State's minimum number of students meets the requirements in 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.17(a)(1 )-(2); Personal Identifiable Information. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) forbids the reporting of any information that might lead to the identification of an individual student. Historically, North Dakota has used an N<1 0 rule (i.e., sample size less than ten students) to govern the public identification or publication of student achievement rates. Thus, if a school's or a subgroup's sample size is fewer than 10 students in either one year or up to three years combined da ta, providing for a sufficient reportable sample size, then no achievement data would be reported for that school or specific subgroup. Although a decision hasn't been made, having a minimum number greater than ten would eliminate many of North Dakota's sm all rural school districts from its accountability system. North Dakota anticipates retaining this minimum N<10 sample size restriction, in compliance with FERPA regulations. Reliability Testing. Additionally, North Dakota anticipates retaining the use of confidence intervals to ensure the measured reporting of student achievement against any established achievement goals for schools or subgroups of varying sample size, consistent with established reliability measures. iv. Describe h ow other components of the statewide accountability system, such as the State's uniform procedure for averaging data under 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.20(a), interact with the minimum number of students to affect the statistical reliability and soundness of accountabi lity data and to ensure the maximum inclusion of all students and each subgroup of students under 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.16(a)(2) ; North Dakota will report school and state overall performance annually, according to established reporting procedures, ensuring re liability and the protection of student identifiable information. North Dakota will conduct school, district, and state accountability determinations, including composite and subgroup reporting, every three years. In compiling its three -year 62 determinatio n review, the state will employ a method that provides a reliable and fair means of referencing current -year or multi -year averaging of achievement data, across all state - established achievement goals. In general terms, school, district, and state determin ations for each achievement goal will proceed through a three -step determinations process. A. Multi -Year Accountability Determinations Step One: Calculating performance against a state -established achievement goal on current -year achievement data, Year One. 1. If a school's current -year (Year One) achievement rate is equal to or greater than the state's established achievement goal, then the school is selected as having met the established achievement goal. 2. If a school's current -year (Year One) achievemen t rate is less than the state's established achievement goal, then a statistical test is applied to determine a level of confidence in making the established state achievement goal. a. If it cannot be determined with greater than 99% confidence that the school's achievement rate is lower than the state's established achievement goal, then the school is selected as having met the established achievement goal, or b. If it can be determined with greater than 99% confidence that the school's achievement rate i s lower than the state's established achievement goal, then the school's review passes to the next step which involves a second statistical test based on combining the current -year data (Year One) with the previous -year's achievement data (Year Two). Step Two: Calculating performance against a state -established achievement goal on the combined achievement data of the current year (Year One) and the previous year (Year Two). If a school's achievement data from Year One is significantly lower than the state-established achievement goal as determined in Step One, then the school's achievement data from the current year (Year One) and the previous year (Year Two) will be combined and reviewed. 1. If a school's combined two -year achievement rate is equal to or greater than the state -established achievement goal, then the school is selected as having met the achievement goal. 2. If a school's combined two -year achievement rate is less than the state - established achievement goal, then a statistical test is applied to determine a level of confidence in making an accountability determination. a. If it cannot be determined with great er than 99% confidence that the school's combined two -year achievement rate is lower than the state - established achievement goal, then the school is identified as having met the achievement goal. b. If it can be determined with greater than 99% confidence that the school's two -year achievement rate is lower than the state - established achievement goal, then the school's review passes to the next step which involves a third statistical test based on combining the current -year data (Year One) with the previous two years achievement data (Year Two and Year Three). Step Three: Calculating performance against a state established achievement goal on the combined achievement data of the current year (Year One) and the two previous years (Year Two and Year Three). 63 If a school's achievement data from the combined review of Year One and Year Two is significantly lower than the state -established achievement goal as determined in Step Two, then the school's achievement data from Year One, Year Two, and Year Three will be combined and reviewed. 1. If a school's combined achievement rate is equal to or greater than the state - established achievement goal, then the school is selected as having met the achievement goal. 2. If a school's combined three -year achievement rate is l ess than the state - established achievement goal, then a statistical test is applied to determine a level of confidence in making an accountability determination. a. If it cannot be determined with greater than 99% confidence that the school's three -year achievement rate is lower than the state - established achievement goal, then the school is selected as having met the achievement goal. b. If it can be determined with greater than 99% confidence that the school's three -year achievement rate is lower than t he state - established achievement goal, then the school is selected as not having made the achievement goal. B. Accountability Reporting for Small Sample Size Schools and Subgroups In the event that a school's or any school's subgroup sample size does not meet a minimum reportable size (N>9), the state will combine previous years' data, using a three year rolling average , such that an accountability determination can be reported. Any unreportable achievement data, resulting from too few students in a school or subgroup in a given year, will be combined with achievement data in the follow ing year. If the combined data consists of a student sample greater than nine students, then it will be reported to determine accountability according to rules. This reporting fulfills the law's validity provision. North Dakota stipulates that all students must be included, either in the current year or in subsequent years, in determining accountability reports. If there are too few students to report out in a given year, then these students will be combined with students from up to three years so that they may be included in accountability determinations. No archival achievement data, already referenced or reported in a previous accountability determination, may be used again, e xcept in calculating multi -year calculations for purposes of rolling three year averages . If the current year has a sample size too small to report accountability against a state - established achievement goal, then up to two previous, unreported years' achievement data will be combined into the current year to allow for reporting. Only previously unreferenced, unreported data, combining up to three years of data, may be used to generate an accountability determination. If this combined data contains too fe w students (i.e., N<10) to produce an accountability determination, then the reported achievement results will state, \" Insufficient data to determine accountability status .\" C. Accountability Reporting Across Incremental Achievement Goals In the event that a school's accountability reporting straddles across incremental achievement goals and multiple years' achievement data are required to reach a reliable determination, North Dakota will employ a weighting method, combining the effects of the adjoining incremental goals. This weighting method will produce a 64 separate achievement rate, residing between the two state -established incremental goals, relative to the proportion of students covered within each respective incremental goal. The resul ting weighted achievement goal will constitute the school's expected achievement goal. Achievement weighting applies only as long as multi -year calculations are required in determining accountability reporting. If a school's previous accountability deter mination, in the aggregate or by subgroup, reported \" Insufficient data to determine accountability status\" across one or two - combined years, then the previous, unreported achievement data will be rolled in with the current -year's achievement data for calcu lations. Since the previous years' achievement data were calculated on the school's previous intermediate achievement goals, these data will be weighted proportionally. The three -years of combined data will be weighted based on the proportion of students w ithin each respective year and each respective year's intermediate goal. This weighting produces a single, composite, multi -year goal that the school. v. Describe t he strategies the State uses to protect the privacy of individual students for each purpose f or which disaggregated data is required, including reporting under section 1111(h) of the ESEA and the statewide accountability system under section 1111(c) of the ESEA ; North Dakota employs a four level procedure, described below, to eliminate the possibility of compromising student identification through an inadvertent publication of student achievement results. These procedures are designed to eliminate any violation of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). (1) Minimal N Value Rule. North Dakota employs an N<10 value, where any sample size value N less than 10 will prohibit the reporting of students within a selected population. Any population value N of 10 or greater wi ll allow the reporting of students within a selected subgroup. (2) Single -populated Level Rule. North Dakota employs a rule where if all students within a school or subgroup report at a certain achievement level and no other achievement levels record any stu dents, then the state will record a limited percentage of students, presented as an inequality, to serve as a representative finding. As such, if all students were to reside within a given level, for example \"achievement level A\", then reporting on that level will identify any and all students. This would be a violation. To remedy this situation, a representative inequality (e.g. <5% or >95%) will be recorded. (3) Total Population Below Proficient Rule. North Dakota employs a rule to allow for the proper iden tification of a school or district where all students' achievement scores fall below proficient (i.e., the combination of partially proficient and novice). It is in the interest of the public and students that any school or district with 100% below -profici ent achievement scores be selected for not making a state achievement goal. To eliminate the possibility of identifying any student, the reports for schools and districts with 100% below -proficient achievement scores will record an inequality to serve as a representative finding (e.g., <5% or >95%). This representative finding would eliminate any possible student identification and also allow for the proper identification of the school or district. In the absence of this rule, extremely low performing schoo ls would be exempt from a reporting finding, thereby violating the principle of validity. 65 (4) Distinguished Students Rule. North Dakota employs a rule to allow for the proper identification of a school or district where all students' achievement scores rest above proficient (i.e., the combination of proficient and advanced). It is in the interest of the public and students that any school or district with 100% above -proficient achievement scores be identified as achieving a selected goal. To eliminate the possibility of identifying any student, the reports for schools and districts with 100% above -proficient achievement results will record an inequality to serve as a representative finding (e.g., <5% or >95%). This representative finding would eliminate any possible student identification and also allow for the proper identification of the school or district. In the absence of this rule, hi gh performing schools would not be recognized for achieving a selected goal. vi. Provide i nformation regarding the number and percentage of all students and students in each subgroup described in 4.B.i above for whose results schools would not be held account able under the State 's system for annual meaningful differentiation of schools required by 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.18 ; This information is not currently available. vii. If an SEA proposes a minimum number of students that exceeds 30 , provide a justification that explains how a minimum number of students provided in 4.C above promotes sound, reliable accountability determinations, including data on the number and percentage of schools in the State that would not be held accountable in the syste m of annual meaningful differentiation under 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.18 for the results of students in each subgroup in 4.B.i above using the minimum number proposed by the State compared to the data on the number and percentage of schools in the State that would not be held accountable for the results of students in each subgroup if the minimum number of students is 30. This question, seeking rationale for the setting of a minimum sample size of N>30, does not apply to North Dakota's proposed accountability syst em. North Dakota has established the sample size of N>9 as the minimum number of students required in a school or subgroup for any public reporting or accountability determination to occur. If any current -year's achievement rates are based on a sample siz e less than this defined limit, then any accountability determination and reporting must revert to multiple - year calculations, until a sufficient sample size is achieved. This minimum sample size reflects long -standing state policy regarding the minimum sa mple size required for the purposes of protecting individual students from possible identification, consistent with the Family Education Rights to Privacy Act. To establish a balanced concern for validity and reliability in public accountability and reporting set forth within ESSA, North Dakota has adopted a confidence interval determination, referenced to the binomial distribution with an alpha value set at 0.01, or a 99% confidence value. The use of the state's selected confidence interval replaces any single sample size reference (e.g., N<30 sample size) and reasserts the state's long -standing practice of applying a 99% confidence interval statistical test in providing for a fair, valid, and reliable means of public accountability and reporting. 66 North Dakota 's established minimum sample size of N>9 and the corresponding application of a 99% confidence interval statistical reliability test has been a longstanding provision of the state's accountability system. This sample size and reliability provision h as been previously reviewed and approved by federal ESEA peer review. D. Annual Meaningful Differentiation . Describe t he State's system for annual meaningful differentiati on of all public schools in the State , including public charter schools, consistent wi th the requirements of section 1111(c)(4)(C) of the ESEA and 34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 200.12 and 200.18. North Dakota is moving towards the differentiation of schools in a way that can be easily communicated to LEA decision makers, teacher, parents and the public. T he reporting of results requires transparency and communication to inform as well as drive improvement for all students. State law defines any public school to include any educational institution supported through State funding and administered through a p ublic school board. North Dakota intends to create a dashboard for every public school that will allow multiple factors to be used when summarizing a school's measure of quality and assist the state in meaningful differentiation of school quality. This process of differentiating will occur on an annual basis for all public schools in the state and include all students and each subgroup of students. Describe the following information with respect to the State's system of annual meaningful different iation: i. The distinct and discrete levels of school performance , and how they are calculated, under 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.18(a )(2) on each indicator in the statewide accountability system ; The state's system of annual meaningful differentiation is based on all indicators in our state's accountability system. The distinct and discrete levels of school performance on each indicator in the statewide accountability system is different for elemen tary/middle schools verses high schools. Listed below in the charts are the indicators that will be used for each grade span. The third column contains the description of how each indicator will be calculated and the tool that will be utilized. Elementary /Middle School Indicator Measure(s) Description Academic Achievement Proficiency in ELA Proficiency in Mathematics The statewide mathematics and ELA assessment (NDSA) which currently is the Smarter Balanced Assessment Academic Progress Growth Academic progress on the NDSA measured by an index growth model which is outlined in detail within Appendix I Achievement in Achieving English Language Proficiency ACCESS 2.0 English proficiency achievement based on the ACCESS 2.0 School Quality or Student Success Climate/Engagement The tool that will be ut ilized is a survey through the AdvancED platform. 67 High School Indicator Measure(s) Description Academic Achievement Proficiency in ELA Proficiency in Mathematics The statewide mathematics and ELA assessment (NDSA) which currently is the Smarter Balanced Assessment Graduation Rate 4-year Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate Graduation rates are calculated based on the number of students who earned a regular high school diploma divided by the total number of students in the cohort beginning in the ninth grade. Graduation rates are reported for all students as well as separately for each subgroup of students Achievement in Achieving English Language Proficiency ACCESS 2.0 English proficiency achievement based on the ACCESS 2.0 School Quality or Student Success Climate/Engagement The tool that will be utilized is a survey through the AdvancED platform. College & Career Ready North Dakota's Choice Ready Framework The Choice Ready framework will measure the percentage of students who are on track to graduate choice ready, which will include a growth factor as indicated within Appendix J. Missing indicator's weights would be proportionally redistributed among the remai ning indicators so that relative weighting between indicators is preserved. ii. The weighting of each indicator , including how certain indicators receive substantial weight individually and much greater weight in the aggregate, consistent with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.18(b) and ( c)(1)-(2). North Dakota's i nclude the following indicators; achievement, progress/growth, English language proficiency, cohort graduation rate, GED completion, Choice Ready , and school quality/student success. 68 State Assessment Achievement Growth 30%Climate/Engagement 30% English Learner Proficiency 10%State Assessment Achievement Rate 16%GED Completion 8%Elementary High School North Dakota clearly demonstrates that the academic indicators are more heavily weighted than the additional indicators of school quality. Elementary - 70% weighted on academic indicators High School - 51% weighted on academic indicators Missing indicator's weights would be proportionally redistributed among the remaining indicators so that relative weighting between indicators is preserved. North Dakota assures that our data will be ready to make accountability determinations and identify schools for Comprehensive and Targeted Support by the beginning of the 2018 -2019 school year. 69 iii. The summative determination s, including how they are calculated, that are provided to schools under 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.18(a )(4). North Dakota's accountability system will provide a framework upon which we consistently, continuously, and holistically evaluate the ability of North Dakota's education system to achieve desired outcomes. North Dakota's discuss ions with its State ESSA Planning Committee have focused on the use of a public dashboard for all school, which would allow multiple factors to be used when outlining a school's measure of quality Within North Dakota 's System of Support , schools would fal l into one of three categories: General support Targeted support Comprehensive support Within North Dakota's accountability system, the NDDPI will make annual summative determinations. North Dakota will first select for Comprehensive Support, Title I s chools that are 5% of the lowest achieving of all Title I schools in the state including all public high schools failing to graduate at least 67% of enrolled students. Secondly , North Dakota will select for Targeted support, schools with low performing sub groups (5%) and schools with gaps in their subgroup performance (5%) . All remaining schools, not identified for comprehensive or targeted support will be selected for general support and improvement. 70 iv. How the system for meaningful differentiation and the methodology for identifying schools under 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.19 will ensure that schools with low performance on substantially weighted indicators are more likely to be identified for comprehensive support and improvement or targeted support and improvement, consistent with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.18(c)(3) and (d)(1)(ii) . North Dakota's methodology will select 5% of Title I schools that are lowes t performing based on all indicators within the accountability system as well as high schools with graduation rates below 67% for Comprehensive support. In addition, 10% of all public schools with significant gaps and low performance with in subgroup s will be selected for Targeted support. These percentages will select North Dakota schools that are most in need of support. Schools not selected for these two support systems will address their identified needs within the AdvancED school improvement process. A ll schools are required to focus resources to their identified areas based on their needs assessment, and will continue to receive statewide technical assistance through the embedded school improvement process within the General support category . E. Participa tion Rate . Describe h ow the State is factoring the requirement for 95 percent student participation in assessments into its system of annual meaningful differentiation of schools consistent with the requirements of 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.15 . The State ESSA Plan provides for the differentiated identification of any school or district, whose participation rate on the state's academic assessments in either or both English language arts/literacy and mathematics , in the composite or within any desi gnated subgroup. If a school or district were to evidence participation rates less than 95%, that school or district would be marked as demonstrating insufficient participation on the school's or district's public reports, indicating a reduction in program status, and requiring an improvement plan. Any improvement plan prepared by the school or district must include outreach efforts to parents, students, and the community, presenting the merits of participation in the state assessments and other activities, whose implementation provides heighten prospects for improved participation among students. F. Data Procedures . Describe the State's uniform procedure for averaging data , including combining data across school years , combining data across grades , or bot h, in a school as defined in 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.20(a), if applicable . North Dakota presents its uniform procedure for averaging data across school years and combining data across grades within the State ESSA Plan, section 4.1(C), inclusive. North Dakota will use multi - year achievement data to compile and report achievement rates for all state -established achievement goals for schools, districts, and the state, in the composite, by subgroup, and by grade. Three -year accountability determinations and all a nnual Report Cards will provide for a comprehensive accounting of all schools and districts, including subgroups and grades . G. Including All Public Schools in a State's Accountability System . If the States uses a different methodology for annual meaningf ul differentiation than the one described in D above for any of the following specific types of schools , describe how they are included , consistent with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.18(d)(1)(iii) : 71 i. Schools in which no grade level is assessed under the State's academic assessment system (e.g., P -2 schools), although the State is not required to administer a standardized assessment to meet this requirement ; North Dakota stipulates that all public schools, regardless of grade configuration or service population, will part icipate in the state accountability system. State law defines any public school to include any educational institution supported through State funding and administered through a public school board. Most schools within North Dakota minimally cover grade spans of K -6, 6-8, or 9 -12. However, a review of statewide student enrollments reveals 10 individual schools with student populations that do not fit within the typical grade span s observed statewide. The following data indicate the respective number and type of school grade spans that do not correspond to the general assessment grade spans. Type of School Organization (grade span) K K-1 K-2 K-3 6-7 9-10 Number of Schools 3 2 2 1 1 1 Students who attend any of the schools above will eventually graduate to a higher grade level in another designated school. As such, there is a clearly identified school that will receive each student from their school -of-origin listed above. Where schools -of-origin exist with grade spans that do not allow for the administration of the State Assessment, as are the cases above, student achievement reports from the receiving school will be forwarded to the school -of-origin by the State. No reports will be iss ued that might identify an individual student. All public schools in North Dakota will receive a n annual accountability rating. North Dakota will use a feeder method to determine accountability for very small schools or schools with untested grades by attributing scores based on the schools the students feed into. If there are multiple schools, a percentage will be determined for each school. North Dakota accountability system for schools with untested grades will attribute the academic performance, on a p ro-rated basis, to those schools where students either attended or will attend, depending on the grades served in the building. For example; a K -2 school, the achievement will be determined based on the school(s) the K -2 students will attend after leaving that school. A middle or high school, the achievement will be determined based on the school(s) that feed into that building. If multiple schools are involved, the achievement will be determined on a pro -rated basis by using the unique student identificati on numbers assigned to each public school student. Performance is aggregated to attribute an accountability determination for schools with non -assessed grades. Using this method, scores are attributed to or apportioned back to schools that provide ELA and mathematics instructional services. This process will allow all public schools in the state to be included in the accountability system. Non-Assessed Schools Linked to Feeder Schools 1. Naughton School 2. Agassiz Middle School 72 3. Eagle Kindergarten Center 4. Davenport Elementary School 5. Early Childhood Center 6. Griggs County Central Elementary School 7. Stevenson School 8. Zimmerman Elementary School 9. Central Campus School 10. New Kindergarten School ii. Schools with variant grade configurations (e.g., P-12 schools) ; North Dakota stipulates that all public schools, regardless of grade configuration or service population, will participate in the state accountability system. State law defines any public school to include any educational institution supported through Stat e funding and administered through a public school board. North Dakota's accountability system will include all public schools identified as K -12, all alternative public schools, the North Dakota School for the Deaf and the North Dakota State Youth Correct ional Center. Most schools within North Dakota minimally cover grade spans of K -6, 6-8, or 9 -12. However, a review of statewide student enrollments reveals 10 individual schools with student populations that do not fit within the typical grade span s obser ved statewide. The following data indicate the respective number and type of school grade spans that do not correspond to the general assessment grade spans. Type of School Organization (grade span) K K-1 K-2 K-3 6-7 9-10 Number of Schools 3 2 2 1 1 1 Students who attend any of the schools above will eventually graduate to a higher grade level in another designated school. As such, there is a clearly identified school that will receive each student from their school -of-origin listed above. Where schools -of-origin exist with grade spans that do not allow for the administration of the State Assessment, as are the cases above, student achievement reports from the receiving school will be forwarded to the school -of-origin by the State. No reports will be iss ued that might identify an individual student. All public schools in North Dakota will receive an annual accountability rating. North Dakota will use a feeder method to determine accountability for very small schools or schools with untested grades by attributing scores based on the schools the students feed into. If there are multiple schools, a percentage will be determined for each school. North Dakota accountability system for schools with untested grades will attribute the academic performance, on a p ro-rated basis, to those schools where students either attended or will attend, depending on the grades served in the building. For example; a K -2 school, the achievement will be determined based on the school(s) the K -2 students will attend after leaving that school. A middle or high school, the achievement will be determined based on the school(s) that feed into that building. If multiple schools are involved, the achievement will be determined on a pro -rated basis by using the unique student identificati on numbers assigned to 73 each public school student. Performance is aggregated to attribute an accountability determination for schools with non -assessed grades. Using this method, scores are attributed to or apportioned back to schools that provide ELA and mathematics instructional services. This process will allow all public schools in the state to be included in the accountability system. Non-Assessed Schools Linke d to Feeder Schools 1. Naughton School 2. Agassiz Middle School 3.

Small schools in which the total number of students who can be included in any indicator under 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.14 is less than the minimum number of students established by the State under 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.17(a)(1), consistent with a State's uniform procedures for averaging data under 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.20(a), if applicable ; Small schools in which the total number of students that can be included on any indicator under 200.14 is less than the minimum number of students established by the State under 200.17(a)(1), consistent with a State's uniform procedures for av eraging data under 200.20(a), if applicable. North Dakota stipulates that all public schools will be included in the state's accountability system, defined under the terms of 200.14 and consistent with accountability reporting rules regarding minimum numb er of students under 200.17(a)(1) and uniform procedures for averaging data under 200.20(a). In the event that any small school's student population falls below the state's adopted minimum reporting level (n>9), such that any public reporting of a specifie d accountability indicator would violate these reporting provisions, the state will ensure that no finding will be applied to or reported for such indicators within the small school. North Dakota will also specify why certain small school's accountability indicators cannot be publicly reported, under the terms of the state's reporting rules. In the absence of any public reporting of identified small school's accountability indicators, North Dakota stipulates that it will conduct a performance audit of each school's accountability indicators and engage the school's administration and staff regarding the school's implementation efforts and performance levels. Any performance audit findings or subsequent discussions will not be reported publicly, thereby ensuri ng student identity protections. iv. Schools that are designed to serve special populations (e.g., students receiving alternative programming in alternative educational settings; students living in local institutions for neglected or delinquent children, in cluding juvenile justice facilities; students enrolled in State public schools for the deaf or blind; and recently arrived English learners enrolled in public schools for newcomer students) ; and General rules for performance and participation. The follow ing general rules apply when determining the educational entity to which a student's performance and participation will be attributed. 74 1. If the student physically attends the public school, performance and participation are attributed to that school, the sch ool district, and the State. 2. If the public or private school or facility serves the student on a contract basis, the student's school district of residence is responsible; student performance and participation are attributed to the school district of resid ence. 3. If the student is served in a state facility, student performance and participation are attributed to the State. Beginning of the year definition. To identify the status of students within the Accountability System, North Dakota will employ a \"begin ning of the school year\" definition. The beginning of the school year is defined as 150 school days prior to the first day of the spring testing window. In subsequent years, the number of days will be defined as the number of school days preceding the first day of the testing window, as determined by the State. This will accommodate both the fall and spring testing windows. Specific rules for performance and participation. Students may attend school in other than the public school in their school distr ict of residence for either a brief or extended period of time due to (1) choice; (2) developmental or health concerns; or (3) behavior/discipline issues or adjudication. (1) Specific rules for performance and participation related to choice. If a student attends a school and school district other than his or her school or school district of residence and the serving school district claims pupil membership for the student, performance and participation are attributed to the serving school, school district, and State. This applies to: a. Job Corps students b. Air Force Base students c. Open enrolled students (2) Specific rules for performance and participation related to developmental and health concerns. a. If a student is served under contract to a public or private fa cility or to another public or private school or school district, performance and participation are attributed to the school district of residence and State. This applies to: i. Anne Carlsen Center ii. Life Skills and Transition Center iii. Adolescent Unit of Jamesto wn State Hospital iv. Students attending psychiatric treatment or mental health facilities v. Some students receiving special education services b. If a student is placed in a treatment facility out of North Dakota and the North Dakota school district of residence claims pupil membership, performance and participation are attributed to the school district and State. If a student is served at the North Dakota School for the Deaf (NDSD), performance and participation are attributed to NDSD and the State. (3) Specific rules for performance and participation related to behavior/discipline or adjudication issues. a. If a student is served at the Youth Correctional Center or State Penitentiary, performance and participation are attributed to the State. b. If a student is incarcerated and is claimed by the school district of residence for pupil membership, performance and participation are attributed to the school 75 district. However, if a student is incarcerated and is not claimed by the school district of residence for pupi l membership, performance and participation are attributed to the State. c. If a student is served at the Adolescent Unit at the North Dakota State Hospital, performance and participation are attributed to the State. d. If a student is served at Dakota Boys Ranc h (Minot and Fargo), performance and participation are attributed to the State. e. If a student is served at Home on the Range (Beach), performance and participation are attributed to the Beach school district. f. If the student who is less than 16 years of age is truant and the school district of residence claims pupil membership for the student, participation for that student is attributed to that school district of residence and the State. However, if the student who is less than 16 years of age is truant and the school district of residence does not claim pupil membership for the student, participation for that student is attributed to the State. g. If a student who is less than 16 years of age is suspended or expelled from school, as evidenced through appropriat e documentation, and who is claimed by the school district of residence for purposes of pupil membership, performance and participation are attributed to the school district of residence and the State according to the beginning of year rule. However, if a student who is less than 16 years of age is suspended or expelled from school and who is not claimed by the school district of residence for purposes of pupil membership, participation is attributed to the State. h. If a student is placed with foster parents who reside in a North Dakota school district, performance and participation are attributed to the serving school district and State. v. Newly opened schools that do not have multiple years of data, consistent with a State's uniform procedure for averaging da ta under 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.20(a), if applicable, for at least one indicator (e.g., a newly opened high school that has not yet graduated its first cohort for students) . North Dakota stipulates that all public schools, regardless of any operational or plann ed reorganization or consolidation, will receive a full and complete determination of school improvement status consistent with statewide provisions . The identification status of newly reorganized and/or consolidated school districts and schools will be ba sed on a comprehensive compilation of all historical student achievement data. The Department of Public Instruction combines available historical student achievement data (e.g., assessment data from previous years) for individual students) in newly reorgan ized and/or consolidated public school districts and schools to determine what decisions would have been in previous years for the newly reorganized and/or consolidated school districts and schools. Three years of historical student achievement data will be considered. The identification status of such a newly reorganized and/or consolidated school district or school will be based on determinations calculated for it using the three previous years' historical achievement data 76 4.2 Identification of Schools . Continuous Improvement for All North Dakota uses AdvancED statewide as an element for school approval as well as for improvement of all schools in the state. First and foremost, all schools will participate in continuous school improvement t hrough the AdvancED process as a first tier for school improvement. The North Dakota Department of Public Instruction collaborates with AdvancED to form a statewide school improvement process. This partnership provides one common method for reporting in e very school in the state, allows for a uniform comparison among school districts, as well as many other benefits. The State's partnership with AdvancED, the largest community of education professionals in the world, focuses on continuous improvement, stude nt performance, and stakeholder satisfaction. This process offers a framework and support system to help meet and exceed state and national requirements. The tools offered by AdvancED eliminates duplication and provides valuable information used to assess the status and progress of schools within the state. The data collected is used to assist schools in the area of Special Education, Title 1 Schoolwide programs and School Approval. By using an effective external review process based on continuous improvem ent, the method of reporting has shifted from compliance towards ways we can most positively improve each school. The Department of Public Instruction is a cohort member on each AdvancED site visit. Staff gain knowledge of each schools challenges, and are able to assist them in attaining their goals. This collaborative effort provides significant insight and is very beneficial for North Dakota schools. In North Dakota, we believe that every institution, regardless of where they are today, can be better tomorrow. As such, we ensure that all North Dakota schools and districts are engaged in a systemic and systematic process of continuous improvement and a ccreditation. In the same manner that educators are expected to understand the unique needs of every learner and tailor the education experience to drive student success, every school and district is expected to regularly diagnose areas of need and take ac tion to improve. Through partnership with AdvancED, all North Dakota institutions leverage a common research -based framework to map out and embrace their unique improvement journey. The AdvancED Continuous Improvement System (CIS), adopted by North Dak ota as our statewide continuous improvement framework, acknowledges the multifaceted factors at play in our complex education system. Instead of targeting silver bullet solutions, all schools and districts consistently, continuously, and holistically eval uate their policies, practices and conditions against research -based standards and factors of school and system quality in order to drive desired outcomes. The myriad of data and information gleaned through the statewide CIS is powerful. These data combin ed with externally validate data and information gleaned through the AdvancED Accreditation process, helps to focus local and statewide improvement efforts, prioritize resources, target evidence -based interventions and provide the best possible support ser vices for every North Dakota school and system. 77 The CIS provides an aligned suite of practical research -based tools, training, resources and professional support services that empower and motive institutions to move forward. As members of the AdvancED Im provement Network (AIN) all North Dakota schools and districts receive all elements of the AdvancED CIS as defined below. Research -based Framework The first element of the AdvancED CIS is the research -based framework upon which quality is assessed an d improved along each step of an institution's unique journey. This framework provides a common foundation and consistent thread throughout all components of the education system and its sub-systems (e.g., learning environment, school, district, state). It serves as a bridge creating shared ownership and expectations for education quality across the entire state, and enables powerful and unprecedented data based decision -making and analytics. Through this research -based framework, it's possible to make me aning of disparate data through a common lens, pinpoint root causes for school and system underperformance, and more readily identify evidence -based strategies in response to diagnosed issues. School and System Quality Factors (SQF) - Define the core set f actors that research shows contribute to school and school system quality and the ability achieve desired results. The SQF provide a framework upon which schools and systems continuously gather and assess the perspectives, beliefs and experiences of all s takeholders to diagnose strengths and deficiencies in organizational quality at the school and system level. Performance Standards - Describe the level of quality expected of high performing institutions in the areas of leadership capacity, learning capaci ty and resource capacity. The Standards depict a clear picture of quality for each institution type (e.g., schools, schools systems, early learning institutions, education services agencies, etc.) and provide research -based criteria against which to evalu ate and benchmark institutional quality. Learning Environments - Depict a core set of factors that research and best -practice show contribute to high levels of student -engagement and quality teaching and learning. These environments provide a framework upo n which quantifiable experience and perception data can be gathered through multiple lenses to continuously evaluate and improve student engagement and learner outcomes. Improvement Journey Roadmap The second element of the AdvancED CIS is an Improvement Journey Roadmap. This roadmap outlines a proven process - that can be adopted by any institution - to drive education quality and systemic improvement. This dynamic six (6) step process is designed to help institutions as they engage in a process of conti nuous improvement that: Is authentic and inclusive Considers the beliefs, perspectives and experiences of all stakeholder groups Measures the parts, connections and whole of the education system Addresses research -based factors of school and system qual ity and diagnoses areas in need of improvement Supports the attainment of clearly defined goals and measurable objectives 78 The following steps are numbered and there is value for institutions new to the process to engage in some of the associated activities sequentially in order to reap the greatest benefit. However, high performing institutions embrace the concepts outlined within each step and embed them as part of their organizational culture that blur the lines between steps and take ownership of their unique improvement journey. 1. Understand Your Current Reality Obtain/maintain a clear understanding of the perceptions and believes of your education community (all stakeholder groups) Understand and examine teaching and learning experiences and outcomes Synthesize and analyze data from multiple data sources to gain a comprehensive understanding of your institution's current reality Collect and examine evidence that reflects the work of the institution Evaluate the overall organizational quality and performance against best practices and research -based factors Diagnose areas in need of improvement and areas of strength Bring v oice to the community stakeholders that will shape and traverse the journey 2. Communicate Your Vision Paint a picture of your current reality and share it with your entire education community Collaborate with stakeholders to create a unified vision to guide the journey Document and communicate that vision and the process that will be used to get there 3. Plot Your Journey Define the key strategic goals that will drive the journey Set annual priorities and success metrics Leverage diagnostic data to identify evidence -based strategies to address annual priorities Plot out improvement activities 4. Get Started Communicate your commitment to the journey Ensure stakeholders are prepared for the journey - provide training, build buy -in, support and proper mindset to d rive and sustain change Make sure resources are appropriately allocated in support of the plan, communicate expectations, and clarify support structures and next steps Embrace and start the journey - initiate action 5. Build Momentum and Capacity Execute the plan of action Provide a formalized structure of professional collaboration, accountability, and learning Identify, share and replicate successful practices and incremental improvements in leadership and learning conditions - build positive m omentum Focus on building system -wide leadership, learning and resource capacity Document results and track progress 6. Yield Periodically to Reflect, Evaluate & Adjust Course Gather and consider what the community learns as the journey progresses Continuousl y examine evidence and information and determine if the course of action needs to be adjusted Adjust and adapt as needed to remain committed to the vision and strategic goals 79 Data Collection & Diagnostic Tools The third element of the AdvancED CIS is a comprehensive suite of data collection tools and diagnostic instruments designed to facilitate the collection and use of relevant, meaningful and actionable data and information as part of the Improvement Journey. Every question/item within the CIS suite of tools is aligned to the research -based framework increasing the usefulness and relevance of the information collected. Surveys - gather stakeholder beliefs and perspectives Climate & Culture Surveys Student En gagement Surveys Teaching & Learning Pedagogy Surveys Inventories - gather stakeholder experiences Student Inventory Teacher Inventory Impact of Instruction Inventory Observation Instruments - gather quantifiable data on the extent to which learners are engaged in activities and/or demonstrate knowledge, attitudes and dispositions that are conducive to effective learning Effective Learning Environments Observation Tool\u00ae (eleot\u00ae) Diagnostics - guide the examination of evidence and information, and cross -stakeholder discussion/deliberation to diagnose areas of strength and need School Quality Factors Diagnostic System Quality Factors Diagnostic With more than 34,000 institutions around the world using this suite of AdvancED Certified Content as part of their improvement journey, North Dakota schools and district also benefit from the ability to benchmark their individual institution results against the global network. Web -based Improvement Management System - eProv e The fourth element of the AdvancED CIS is a 21st century web -based management system specifically designed to support institutions as they engage in all aspects of their improvement journey. In addition to providing North Dakota schools and districts streamlined and simplified administration of AdvancED Certified Content mentioned above, the eProve platform empowers institutions to create and administer custom surveys, tailor report outputs, conduct observations via mobile device (with or without internet access), and more. Through six (6) inter connected modules, eProve helps institutions to own and manage their improvement journey. At the same time, eProve provides a system -wide support tool to facilitate collaboration, communication, analytics, reporting, monitoring and accountability. Enab ling a systems approach to continuous improvement, relevant data, information and tools are accessible to authorized users at all levels - from the classroom to the statehouse. 80 Training & Support Resources The fourth element of the AdvancED CIS incorporates a variety of training and support resources designed to build an institution's capacity to authentically own and engage in their improvement journey. A series of online asynchronous training modules provide a foundational understanding of the CIS and all its interrelated elements. North Dakota schools and districts have unlimited access to these and other related online guides, workbooks and support resources. Every institution is also provi ded access to the online eleot\u00ae training and certif ication course to further increase local leadership and learning capacity. Furthermore, NDDPI partners with AdvancED to provide two annual school improvement conferences as well as additional workshops and training sessions. Dedicated school improvement experts are also available through AdvancED to create and deliver personalized and customized training and professional development, if requested. Professional Services The fifth and final element of the AdvancED CIS speaks to our shared commitment to help every institution improve. At least once per year, a school improvement representative checks in with each institution to see where it is in the improvement journey. Through this outreach, AdvancED in partnershi p with NDDPI provides up to 4 hours of virt ual support, technical assistance, and guidance to help all schools and districts successfully navigate their journey. In addition, institutions can contact AdvancED Client Services and/or NDDPI at any time for support and assistance. If desired, institutions can request in person annual touch -points and/or expanded professional services, at minimal cost, at any point along their journey. System of External Engagement and Support for All North Dakota's comm itment to education quality and continuous improvement does not end there. Building upon the foundational elements of the CIS, North Dakota provides an aligned system of statewide support for all schools and systems. At least once every five years, every school system in North Dakota receives an AdvancED Engagement Review (a.k.a., External Review) as part of our statewide commitment to improvement, accountability and Accreditation. Through the AdvancED Accreditation process, highly skilled and trained Engagement Review Teams spend multiple days on -site at a school system and its schools to gather first -hand evidence and information pertinent to evaluating the institution's performance against the research -based AdvancED Performance Standards. Team membe rs spend a significant amount of time in classrooms assessing the quality of the learning environments, from the perspective of the student, to gain valuable insights and target improvements in teaching and learning. They also glean valuable evidence and information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys and additional engagements such as observing governing boards in action. Through a comprehensive review of evidence and information, teams gain a comprehensive understanding of institution quality. 81 Following the Engagement Review, institutions are provided a written report summarizing the data gathered by the team, as well as findings and conclusions. The comprehensive report provides the institution's overall rating on the Performance Standards, a ggregate eleot\u00ae results, as well as Promising Practices and evidence -based Improvement Priorities. Each school system also receives an Index of Education Quality (IEQ) rating, which can be benchmarked against both the North Dakota state, and AIN averages . The Improvement Priorities provided through the Accreditation Engagement Review process help to focus and guide each institution's improvement journey. Institutions find great value in the third party evaluative feedback and leverage the actionable pri orities to inform the strategic planning process. They also use them to prioritize annual action plans and as critical checkpoints for improvement -focused accountability. All public schools in North Dakota will participate in an annual school improvement process documented in an improvement plan . School improvement plans will be living documents that are updated annually and uploaded into the AdvancED platform. Schools will review data on an annual basis and make updates to their plan. School improvement plans will outline the interventions and strategies that each school will employ to address identified needs. Schools will be required to review subgroup performance as part of the annual school improvement process. A. Comprehensive Support and Improvement Schools . Describe : i. The methodolog ies, including the timeline, by which the State identifies school s for comprehensive support and improvement under section 1111(c)(4)(D)(i) of the ESEA and 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.19(a) and (d) , including : 1) lowest -perform ing schools ; 2) schools with low high school graduation rates; and 3) schools with chronically low -performing subgroups . Comprehensive Support: Every three years, North Dakota will select 5% of its schools (approximately 1 5 schools) with the highest proporti on of struggling students. These schools will receive a comprehensive Diagnostic Review specifically designed to pinpoint root - causes for underperformance . NDDPI will work with school and school system leaders to develop a customized approach to address a reas in need of improvement. Each identified school will receive 3 consecutive years of school improvement grant funding ranging between $300,000 -$400,000 to implement evidence -based strategies and build local capacity to sustain improvement efforts. ESSA specifies that state education agencies (SEAs) identify schools for \"comprehensive support and improvement\" beginning with school year 2018 -2019 and at least once every 3 years, Schools that meet the following criteria are required to be selected: 1.) Lowest Performing 5% of Title I Schools . The lowest -performing 5% of all Title I schools in the state (based on performance on accountability framework over no more than 3 yea rs) and. 2.) Low Graduation Rate High Schools . All public schools (Title I or non -Title I) that graduate less than 67% of their students using a 6 -year graduation cohort . Low-Performing Subgroups . Schools with low -performing subgroups will be selected for Targeted support. In Comprehensive support, North Dakota wants to focus on our lowest 82 performing schools. Our intent is to keep this a relatively small number of schools so that we can use the state's minimal school improvement funding (approximately 2.2 million) to provide grants to all schools selected for support. North Dakota student s are participating in our annual state assessment from March through May 2017. This is the third year of testing within the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium. North Dakota will be releasing an RFP to solicit a vendor to create our school dashboards in May 2017. By July 2017, we anticipate having a vendor on contract that can begin work on the school dashboards. We anticipate the dashboards to be available to school personnel in early 2018. North Dakota will be using data from the three years of tes ting under Smarter Balanced (2014 -2015, 2015 -2016, and 2016 -2017) in addition to data within the other elements of our accountability pie to select schools for comprehensive support. The intent is to select comprehensive schools in the spring of 2018 so th at there is ample time to conduct training on the required improvement process and plan that will need to be submitted to the state. This process will allow North Dakota to have comprehensive schools selected by the beginning of the 2018 -2019 school year a s required within ESSA. ii. The uniform statewide exit criteria for schools identified for comprehensive support and improvement established by the State, including the number of years over which schools are expected to meet such criteria, under section 1111( d)(3)(A)(i) of the ESEA and consistent with the requirements in 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.21(f)(1). A school could exit Comprehensive support status upon achieving: For all schools: Scores that are above the bottom 5% of Title I schools for three consecutive years, For a school identified based on graduation rate: A graduation rate that is 67% or higher for three consecutive years For a school identified based on being a low performing school: Success in meeting their established interim goals for three consecutive years for both academic achievement and graduation rates. B. Targeted Support and Improvement Schools . Describe: i. The St ate's methodology for identifying any school with a \"consistently underperforming\" subgroup of students, including the definition and time period used by the State to determine consistent underperformance, under 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.19(b)(1) and (c ). Further expanding the statewide system of support, North Dakota will selec t schools for Targeted Support from a pool of \"consistently underperforming\" schools. Through stakeholder consultation with the ESSA Planning Committee, North Dakota has defined \"consistently underperforming schools\" as schools, based on all indicators within the state's accountability system performing in the bottom 10% for three consecutive years. Identified schools have a high proportion of struggling student groups and/or sign ificant perf ormance gaps between student groups. Through partnership, NDDPI works with school systems that have one or more school identified for targeted support and improvement to diagnose root - causes for under performance and target interventions and su pport services. Districts receive 83 a school improvement grant per identified school to support and sustain improvement efforts. North Dakota believes strongly th at if a school is selected for t arget ed support and required to develop a system of interventio n and support, then every school selected must receive funds to assist with their improvement efforts. The method for selecting targeted support and improvement schools will reflect schools that are consistently under -performing or low -performing in any o f the following subgroups : Economically disadvantaged students Children with disabilities English learners White American Indian or Alaska Native African American Asian or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander Hispanic or Latino Identification Criteria The Targeted support schools selected are schools that fall into the following categor y: Schools , within the pool of consistently underperforming schools that have one or more subgroups with achievement levels below the highest performing compreh ensive school based on all accountability factors within the state's accountability system Timeline for Identification of Targeted Support Schools Targeted s chools will be selected beginning in the 2018 -2019 school year. North Dakota anticipates notifying LEAs of any schools that have been selected for target ed support in early spring 201 8, so that they have time to develop their improvement plan for implementation in the 2018 -2019 school year. North Dakota will select schools for Targeted support on an an nual basis. ii. The State's methodology , including the timeline, for identifying schools with low - performing subgroups of students under 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.19(b)(2) and (d) that must receive additional targeted support in accordance with section 1111(d)(2)(C) of the ESEA . See abov e. iii. The uniform exit criteria , established by the SEA , for schools participating under Title I, Part A with low-performing subgroups of students , including the number of years over which schools are expected to meet such criteria, co nsistent with the requirements in 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.22( f). A school could exit Targeted support status upon achieving one of the following: 1.) A school no long er meets the eligibility criteria for targeted support and improvement. 2.) A school is successful in me eting their established interim goals in the identified subgroup for two consecutive years thus ensuring that a school doesn't get bumped out due to a newer low achieving school getting in, rather, the school is exiting because it is making progress on its own. 84 All schools not selected for comprehensive or targeted support are required to identify and address areas for improvement , including improvement needs at the subgroup level, through the annual school improvement process within AdvancED. All schools can access some of the universal supports available through the AdvancED school improvement system as well as supports available through the NDDPI . As indicated, North Dakota will select schools for Targeted support in spring 2018, so they are ready to implement their improvement plans at the beginning of the 2018 -2019 school year. Targeted support schools will be given a grant an d additional support by the Division of Student Support & Innovation within the NDDPI, as well as through the REAs . Schools that received additional Targeted support and receive Title I funds that do not meet the exit criteria afte r being identified for th ree consecutive years will be selected for Comprehensi ve support beginning in the subsequent school year. These schools will then need to meet the established criteria for Comprehensive support schools. The first year in which North Dakota will select schools for Comprehensive support that were previously selected for Targeted support will be the beginning of the 2021 -2022 school year. 4.3 State Support and Improvement for Low-performing Schools . A. School Improvement Resources . Describe how the SEA will meet its re sponsibilities, consistent with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.24(d) under section 1003 of the ESEA , including the process to award school improvement funds to LEAs and monitoring and evaluating the use of funds by LEAs . North Dakota intends to select for support, Comprehensive and Targeted schools. These schools need resources, training, and support. North Dakota will reserve, as required under ESSA, 7% of the state's Title I, Part A allocation for school support grants. Every school selected for Comp rehensive and Targeted s upport will receive a school support grant. An LEA with a schoo l selected for Comprehensive s upport may submit a grant application for funding ranging from $300,000 to $400,000 to support a three -year implementation plan per school . An LEA with a school selected for Targeted support may submit an annual application for funding in the amount of $50,000 to support an implementation plan per school . The NDDPI will ensure that allocations for both Comprehensive and Targeted schools are of sufficient amount and enable the schools to effectively implement selected evidence -based strategies. The NDDPI will implement a carefully defined SEA grant review process that includes highly qualified and trained SEA grant reviewers. Similarly, the L EA application will require districts demonstrate planning, capacity, and alignment with SEA guidelines for these funds in their grant plan and narrative. The NDDPI issues Grant Awards to LEAs upon approval of the LEA grant application for allowable activi ties aligned to amounts approved in order to carry out the proposed activities for the grant award period. SEA Grant Review The following elements will ensure the SEA grant review process carefully analyzes an LEA's budget and application with respect to defined metrics for quality and success. 85 Expert SEA grant reviewers. The reviewers for all LEA grant applications will be NDDPI program staff who are well experienced as educators and are highly knowledgeable in the school and district improvement proces s, as well as with federal Title I and ESSA regulations. The NDDPI will review each LEA grant application to ensure it has requested adequate resources to support an implementation plan per school and their identified evidence -based interventions. The budg et and detailed budget narrative, in conjunction with the application, will be analyzed to ensure that the LEA has the resources and capacity to fully implement the selected intervention and evidence -based strategies in each selected school according to th e timelines outlined in the implementation plan. Pre-proposal LEA training. The NDDPI is planning to provide training to eligible schools, as applicable, for each year of grant funds. At this training, eligible schools will be provided with the applicati on, guidance, and other resources to help them apply for funding, if they so choose. We will provide detailed training to LEA staff on the process and allowable activities pertaining to the implementation process. NDDPI training will include sessions to as sist schools with English learners on implementing effective programs to meet school and student long -term goals and interim progress measures. NDDPI will demonstrate how schools can use the STARS to check on EL progress and school/state data. Grant revie wer training. NDDPI SEA staff who will be reading, analyzing, and scoring the grant applications will also receive training on the requirements and components unique to the grant process. Scoring rubric. The LEA grant scoring process will be guided by a d efined scoring rubric that targets the review of each LEA's budget as it relates to LEA goals, implementation activities, coordinated resources, and timeline. Cross -referencing during grant scoring. The reviewers will also cross -reference the proposed implementation activities with the district's detailed timeline to ensure that the LEA does not begin utilizing grant funds until the SEA has awarded the LEA a grant award for the specific budget period. The reviewers will also cross -reference the narrative response and the timeline with the proposed budget to ensure alignment of all proposed activities. This step also assists in the determination of whether the activities are reasonable and necessary to implement the proposed reform initiatives and evidence -based strategies. Comprehensive Support Focus. The NDDPI SEA staff will review each LEA's application, budget, and detailed budget narrative to ensure that the LEA has sufficient funds to implement their selected intervention model and activities are allowable. LEA Grant Application and Process The L EA grant application has been specifically designed to guide districts through the process of carefully aligning their budget with their grant plan and requirements. 86 LEA grant requirements. In the LEA grant application, the LEA must specifically describe its capacity to use these funds to provide adequate resources and related support to each of the schools identified in order to implement, fully and effectively, the required activities of the school intervention model and/or strategies it has selected. Allowable activities. The LEA grant application has a specific section where the district is required to describe, in detail, the activities to be conducted during the pre -implementation and implementation phase that will better enable them to begin imple menting their strategies and initiatives at the start of the school year, upon grant funds approval. Reviewers will be able to review and cross -reference the narrative question, the detailed timeline, the budget, and the budget narrative to ensure alignmen t of all activities, to ensure that the activities take place during implementation phase, and to ensure that they are reasonable and necessary to enable the LEA to begin full implementation of their grant application. LEA demonstrated capacity. The NDDPI staff will communicate with LEA staff to resolve all issues, offer assistance, and ensure that approval of an LEA application is only granted to LEAs that have demonstrated the resources, capacity, and support necessary to implement their select ed intervention model and strategies in the plan. The LEA's budget must include sufficient funds to implement the selected intervention fully and effectively in each eligible school, as applicable. Annual Review Formally on a yearly basis, LEAs and school s will be required to review and update the comprehensive needs assessment, the intervention plan, and the budget based on annual school data. B. Technical Assistance Regarding Evidence -Based Interventions . Describe the technical assistance the SEA will pro vide to each LEA in the State serving a significant number or percentage of schools identified for comprehensive or targeted support and improvement , including how it will provide technical assistance to LEAs to ensure the effective implementation of evidence -based interventions, consistent with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.23(b), and, if applicable, the list of State -approved, evidence -based interventions for use i n schools implementing comprehensive or targeted support and improvement plans consistent with \u00a7 200.23(c)(2) -(3). North Dakota has a differentiated system of technical assistance based on a continuous improvement process. This statewide system of technic al assistance applies to all public schools and includes multiple measures for supporting all schools with an emphasis on low performing schools. The NDDPI is committed to providing technical assistance and support to schools selected for Comprehensive an d/or Targeted s upport. The NDDPI, in collaboration with the State ESSA Planning Committee has created a multi -faceted approach to providing support for each cadre of schools. Resources/ Support for Comprehensive Schools Comprehensive Support Title I schools that are in the lowest performing 5 percent of Title I schools in the state. All high schools that fail to graduate one -third or more of their students. These schools will be selected at least once every three years, starting in school year 201 8-2019. 87 The NDDPI will provide support and resources for schools selected for Comprehensive support. Our proposal includes a multi -faceted approach to providing support: Action One - All Comprehensive Schools Action Two - All Comprehensive Schools Action Three - All Comprehensive Schools o Action One - All Comprehensive Schools All schools selected for Comprehensive support will be eligible to apply for a $350,000 school improvement grant to be used over the three years they are selected for improvement. These funds can be used to help the school make improvements in the areas that led to the selection . o Action Two - Comprehensive Schools NDDPI/Student Support & Innovation will provide guidance and support to all schools selected for Compr ehensive support. Training will be held to overview the requirements and opportunities available to schools. Each school selected will be assigned a liaison in the Division of Student Support & Innovation to answer questions and provide assistance . o Action Three - All Comprehensive Schools Within Action Three , support and assistance will be provided to all schools selected for Comprehensive support. NDDPI is proposing to build into North Dakota ESSA plan a partnership with an outside entity which will provid e coaching and consultation services to help schools conduct a needs assessment and create a plan for improvement within a state-determined model . LEAs will also be allowed to purpose a locally -determined mode if it meets the same rigor and intensity as th e state -determined model. Resources/Support for Targeted Schools Targeted Support: School s that are consistently underperforming (as defined by the state) for one or more student subgroup. The NDDPI will provide support and resources for s chools selected for Targeted s upport. Our proposal includes a multi -faceted approach to providing support: Action One - All Targeted Schools Action Two - All Targeted Schools Action Three - All Targeted Schools o Action One - All Targeted Schools All schools selected for Targeted support will be eligible to apply for a $50,000 school support grant each year they are selected for support. These funds can be used to help the school make improvements in the subgroups that led to the selection . o Action Two - All Targeted Sc hools NDDPI/Student Support & Innovation will provide guidance and support to all schools selected for Targeted support. Regional trainings will be held to overview requirements and opportunities available to schools. Each school selected will be assigned a liaison in the Division of Student Support & Innovation to answer questions and provide assistance. o Action Three - All Targeted Schools NDDPI is proposing to build into our North Dakota ESSA plan a partnership with the North Dakota REAs to roll out MTSS support to all schools selected for Targeted support. NDDPI will pool state resources within multiple programs Title I 88 Title II Title III Title IV Special Education School Improvement Other Identified Resources NDDPI will have a statewide contract with the North Dakota REAs to assist schools selected for Targeted support to implement the MTSS process within their schools. North Dakota's Multi -Tier System of Supports (MTSS) Project will be implemented statewide . North Dakota will implement MTSS for not on ly Targeted and Comprehensive Schools, but all schools in the state, to support sub -groups needing support and the continuous improvement process. Schools selected for Targeted support will receive priority. Below is overview of the MTSS project. North D akota MTSS Project Overview North Dakota's Multi -Tier System of Supports Project is led by the North Dakota Department of Education, Office of Special Education and Early Intervention Services through a State Personnel Development Grant from U. S. Departme nt of Education - Office of Special Education Programs. This project is designed to help schools develop school -wide support systems in academics and behavior. NDMTSS project collaborators include the Mid -Dakota Education Cooperative (MDEC), South East Edu cation Cooperative (SEEC), the National Technical Assistance Center on Positive Behavioral Intervention & Supports (PBIS.org) and the National Implementation Research Network (NIRN). North Dakota's Multi -Tier System of Supports North Dakota's Multi -Tier Sy stem of Supports (NDMTSS) is a framework to provide all students with the best opportunities to succeed academically and behaviorally in school. NDMTSS focuses on providing high -quality instruction and interventions matched to student need, monitoring prog ress frequently to make decisions about changes in instruction or goals. NDMTSS framework provides a pathway for effective coordination of services across systems and within schools. ND MTSS five essential components 1. Assessments 2. Data -based decision making 3. Multi -level evidence based instruction 4. Infrastructure and Support Mechanisms 5. Fidelity and Evaluation Professional Development - Delivered through a cohort model provides statewide NDMTSS professional development for all schools and districts addressing NDMTSS framework implementation. Additionally, a scaffold PD model intentionally targets schools where they are to provide train ing and guidance for essential components, building capacity, and additional follow -up adult learning 89 opportunities to impact content knowledge and build skills where needed in the implementation process. Coaching and Technical Assistance - Provides sup port structures, which are scaffolded , to build adult skills introduced during professional development sessions. Ongoing support provided through continual follow -up coaching and progress monitoring helps break through barriers and change educator behavio r to be able to build skills for the expected new work. Continued training provides skill development at the school level for problem -solving facilitation, shared leadership, content/expert knowledge, and teacher mentoring. State Leadership Team - Meet re gularly to ensure scaffolded PD is available to all schools/districts, preview upcoming PD content, and build a statewide community of practice. The NDMTSS framework outlines a plan for conditions that make implementation of effective practices with fideli ty reasonable, practical and doable, through a collaborative statewide process. NDDPI works in partnership with ND REAs to effectively provide and deliver supports to school teams across North Dakota. A plan for training, coaching, providing technical assistance and distribution of materials, is based on school/district individual needs. Evidence -based Interventions Resources: ESSA requires each SEA to describe its processes for approving, monitoring, and periodically reviewing LEA comprehensive support and improvement plans for selected schools. The NDDPI will offer a variety of additional supports to schools and LEAs that could include: on -site technical assistance, off -site networking sessions, embedded professional development, virtual learning experi ences, guidance documents, and templates to support improvement planning and monitoring. The NDDPI will work with LEAs and REAs to support schools with implementing evidenced -based strategies. In addition, NDDPI will assist LEAs in exploring and identifyin g appropriate resources within the various national clearinghouses. What works Clearinghouse is a central source of scientific evidence for what works in education. (Institute of Education Sciences) http://ies.e d.gov/ncee/wwc / IES Practice Guides are subjected to rigorous external peer review and consist of recommendations, strategies, and indications of the strength of evidence supporting each recommendation. 90 Florida Center for Reading Research provides information about research -based practices related to literacy instruction and assessment for children preschool through 12th grade, as well as a variety of evidence based interventions for use by educators. http://www.fcrr.org/ Best Evidence Encyclopedia offers information to improve lear ning for students in grades K -12 and particularly targets students in mathematics, special needs/diverse learners, and English language learners. http://www.bestevidence.org/?ad=6 The Center on Instruction offers information to improve learning in reading, mathematics, science, Special Education, and English Language Learning instruction. Center for Comprehensive School Reform and Improvement's mission is to help schools organize, plan, implement, and sustain improvement. Evidence for ESSA, a free web site designed to provide education leaders with information on programs that meet the evidence standards included in the E very Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). In ESSA, Section 1003(a) re quires that schools selected for comprehensive and targeted support use their improvement funds only for interventions reflecting one of the highest three levels of evidence (Strong, Moderate, a nd/or Promising). Strong - at least one well -designed and well -implemented experimental study (e.g., a randomized controlled trial). Moderate - at least one well -designed and well -implemented quasi -experimental study. Promising - at least one well -designed and well -implemented correlation study with statistical controls for selection bias. Based on an analysis of the needs assessment, the school and LEA must identify prioritized needs for each selected school in order to select the evidence -based strategie s for their intervention plan. The development and implementation of the school and LEA intervention plan will include evidence -based strategies addressing student academic achievement and school success. The plan must reference the research supporting the selected evidence -based strategies in the appendix of the application. Technical Assistance The NDDPI has multiple ways of providing statewide technical assistance and sharing effective strategies for schools selected for Comprehensive or Targeted suppor t. The following summarizes our key initiatives: Extensive Website The NDDPI, has developed an extensive website for schools and districts identified for improvement. This site contains a variety of resources including a link to all district and school accountability reports, information on reports due throughout the year, information, and application forms on additional funds available for schools, templates and sample reports, and resources and handouts from prior trainings. Assigned NDDPI Division Li aison The NDDPI, Division of Student Support and Innovation, assigns all schools a contact person for technical assistance and support throughout the school year. NDDPI staff will be responsible for reviewing all reports for the schools under their purview , in coordination with the SEA grant application review process. This ongoing, multi -tiered, detailed review process ensures the grantee is on the right track during the school and when closing out at the end of the program year. The liaisons keep in close contact with their assigned schools by gathering information, answering questions on issues, acting as a guidance coach, and tracking a school's needs and efforts in a very comprehensive manner. 91 Monthly Research Report The Division of Student Support an d Innovation generates and distributes a monthly report which summarizes newly released research/resources on educational issues relevant to North Dakota schools. The monthly Research/Resource Report (RRR) is disseminated electronically to all principals, administrators, and Title I teachers and staff in schools approved for comprehensive and targeted support. AdvancED Accreditation The NDDPI requires statewide accreditation that is coordinated with AdvancED and monitored through a web -based tool, eProve. In order to streamline reporting the NDDPI supports consistency in plans and reduction in burden of paperwork through streamlining reports utilizing the AdvancED tool, eProve, to provide information regarding the schools needs assessment, programming, goal s, activities, and plans to meet federal requirements and continuous improvement plans. The reports within the tool meet multiple reporting for state and federal programs including statewide accreditation, North Dakota approval process, Title I schoolwide plans, and continuous improvement plans. School Improvement Network School turnaround experts emphasize the importance of utilizing \"skilled outside assistance to mount a comprehensive, sustained turnaround initiative\" (Calkins, Guenther, Belfiore, & Lash , 2007. The Turnaround Challenge, p. 5, 2007). The NDDPI has partnered with the School Improvement Network (SINet) as an external partner to support NDDPI's implementation of comprehensive support with impactful and expert services and resources. This part nership provides an opportunity for comprehensive support schools to contract services to support the state determined model and federal requirements which includes intensive support, coaching, professional development, evidence -based instructional strateg ies, data review/appraisals, and ongoing technical assistance. The SINet offers a Turnaround Success Model, a proven blended school turnaround framework designed to support struggling schools. This system wide turnaround model combines the effectiveness an d richness of on -demand digital tools with the transformational power of professional learning communities (PLCs) and on -site coaching. School Improvement Network will assign two resources to assist each school through the turnaround process. 1. Partner Suc cess Manager - Partner Success Manager (PSM) will manage the project for each school and assist with the documentation and reports needed for ongoing needs analysis, pre -implementation planning, progress monitoring, mid -course corrections, required reporti ng, and overall project implementation. 2. Turnaround Coach - Turnaround Coach will provide focused and expert coaching for leaders and teachers, working with designated staff on recommended strategies in both on -site and online coaching sessions. SINet will provide virtual and onsite -specific classroom professional learning. Each school will have a customized service delivery schedule that includes coaching and consultation with ongoing feedback and recommendations for extended learning and collaboration uti lizing evidence -based and on -demand professional learning resources. These resources include the Edivate professional learning system, virtual coaching for individual schools, actionable feedback, and recommendations for implementation of instructional str ategies and materials, as needed. Department Sponsored Conferences The NDDPI sponsors several conferences each year. Each spring, regional trainings are held for schools and districts to disseminate key information regarding the supports, services, and re quirements as well as to share effective strategies for making progress. In the fall, a statewide conference is held for educators 92 to promote effective evidence -based strategies designed to raise achievement. The NDDPI sponsors webinar presentations specif ically designed to provide technical assistance and guidance to comprehensive support schools. Numerous other trainings, via conference call or webinars, are also offered each year to share and disseminate information statewide. Time that staff spends prov iding technical assistance to comprehensive support schools will be coded to administrative funds. Webinar Trainings To further expand the number of training opportunities available to educators , the NDDPI periodically conducts webinar trainings on relevant educational issues. This form of training is very beneficial because the trainings are short (one hour), easy to access, and participants don't have to be away from their building. In addition, each train ing is recorded for viewing at times convenient for school personnel. All trainings the NDDPI will hold for the comprehensive schools will be conducted through webinar trainings. SEA grant funds will be used to provide statewide technical assistance for th ese key initiatives. Sharing of Effective Strategies The NDDPI frequently collaborates with educational entities to create resources for North Dakota schools and districts. We believe it is critical to highlight what has been proven to be effective across North Dakota. Within North Dakota's original ESEA Flexibility Waiver application , states had to create intervention charts and identified priority and focus schools would have been required to submit an improvement plan to the NDDPI identifying interventi ons that will be implemented to address the identified needs and challenges at the school. Over the next year, NDDPI will be working with the North Central Comprehensive Center (NCCC) and the Regional Education Laboratory at Marzano Research to reinvent an d update intervention charts for four specific categories of students that outline and list evidence -based strategies and interventions. Within our state plan, there will be four charts providing a menu of interventions for schools to reference. The inter ventions will be separated into categories, which include: Interventions for Low Achieving Students Interventions Geared for English Learners (EL) Students Interventions Geared for Native American Students Interventions Geared for Students with Disabilities Schools selected for comprehensive and targeted support can select interventions from the state generated list or select other interventions of their choice. These schools will outline their selected interventions in their improvement plan, a s well as on the Consolidated Application for Federal Title Funding. C. More Rigorous Interventions. Describe the more rigorous interventions required for schools identified for comprehensive support and improvement that fail to meet the State's exit crit eria within a State -determined number of years consistent with section 1111(d)(3)(A)(i) of the and 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.21(f)(3)(iii) . As per ESSA, if a school does not meet the e xit criteria for Comprehensive s upport, NDDPI will require the LEA to conduct a new school -level needs assessment and, based on its results, amend its comprehensive support and improvement plan. 93 D. Periodic Resource Review . Describe how the SEA will periodically review, identify, and, to the extent practicable, address any identified inequities in resources to ensure sufficient support for school improvement in each LEA in the State serving a significant number or percentage of schools identified for comprehensive or targeted support and improvement consistent with the requi rements in section 1111(d)(3)(A)(ii) of the ESEA and 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.23(a). North Dakota will conduct periodic reviews of resource allocations to ensure sufficient support for school improvement in each district serving a significant number or percentage of schools selected for comprehensive or targeted support and improvement. Every school selected for Comprehensive and Target ed support will be eligible to apply for school improvement funds through a competitive process. These grant s will ensure that all schools have the resources needed to make improvements in the areas that led to the ir selection for support . A m ulti- diverse, division -wide team of NDDPI staff who have both programmatic and fiscal knowledge of the district will monitor each selected s chool's progress to ensu re adequate support is provided and timely intervention provided over a three -year implementation for comprehensive schools and annually for Targeted schools . The oversight process will include fiscal reviews, on -site reviews, desk audits, and a required annual review process to ensure that the State periodically reviews and addresses identified inequities in resources to ensure that sufficient support is provided to comprehensive and targeted schools. Within the reviews, NDDPI will examine closely potential areas of inequity so additional funding can be allocated, and resource allocation reviews will include an examination of all federal, state and local funding sources as a requirement in the application for school improvement dolla rs. Districts will be required to demonstrate their funding rationale, including a requirement for the annual renewal of funds. 94 Section 5: Supporting Excellent Educators 5.1 Educator Development, Retention, and Advancement. Instructions : Consistent with sections 2101 and 2102 of the ESEA, if an SEA intends to use funds under one or more of the included programs for any of the following purposes, provide a description with the necessary information. A. Certification and Licensure Systems. Does the SEA intend to use Title II, Part A funds or funds from other included programs for certifying and licensing teachers and principals or other school leaders? Yes. If yes, provide a description of the systems for certification and licensure below. No. Teacher licensure, certification, and endorsements are under the purview of the North Dakota Education Standards and Practices Board (ESPB). The ESPB is an independent board with the responsibility of teacher licensure, teacher education program approval, professional development and professional practices. The ESPB ensures all educators licensed in North Dakota have met all North Dakota standards through an established review system of initial certification, re newal, and endorsement based on current profe ssional knowledge of research and best practice. The N DDPI ensures the credentialing of superintendents, principals, counselors, library media specialists and Title I reading and math educators. North Dakota Century Code and Administrative Rules have bee n established outlining the requirements of each credential. B. Educator Preparation Program Strategies . Does the SEA intend to use Title II, Part A funds or funds from other included programs to support the State's strategies to improve educator preparati on programs consistent with section 2101(d)(2)(M) of the ESEA, particularly for educators of low -income and minority students? Yes. If yes, provide a description of the strategies to improve educator preparation programs below. No. Although Title II, Part A funds will not be utilized for educator preparation program strategies, it is important to note that all agencies that assist with preparing our educators are critical partners and work closely together, including higher education. North D akota higher education faculty are involved as stakeholders in many state committees. Faculty from teacher education departments from every program in the state participate in monthly collaboration with the ESPB . The goal of this group is to share information, data, and programming information to enhance future and current teachers in our state. In addition, principal and superintendent preparation program faculty collaborate with the ESPB to align standards, develop a Teacher Leadership Academy, an d coordinate efforts to prepare excellent leaders at all levels. The education departments in North Dakota have frequent and ongoing interaction with the state to promote effective teachers and leaders. C. Educator Growth and Development Systems. Does the S EA intend to use Title II, Part A funds or funds from other included programs to support the State's systems of professional growth and improvement for educators that addresses: 1) induction; 2) development, consistent with the definition of professional d evelopment in section 8002(42) of the ESEA; 3) compensation; and 4) advancement for teachers, principals, and other school leaders. This may also include 95 how the SEA will work with LEAs in the State to develop or implement systems of professional growth a nd improvement, consistent with section 2102(b)(2)(B) of the ESEA; or State or local educator evaluation and support systems consistent with section 2101(c)(4)(B)(ii) of the ESEA? Yes. If yes, provide a description of the educator growth and developm ent systems below. No. Principal Teacher Evaluation Support System With the knowledge that every student needs and deserves a strong teacher, it is essential to determine how to measure effective teachers and principals. The North Dakota Principal an d Teacher Evaluation and Support System Committee (PTESS), established in 2011, examined research on principal and teacher evaluations, reviewed methods in other states , and was provided technical assistance from McREL. Over the course of several years, th e PTESS Committee drafted principal and teacher evaluations guidelines to provide more uniform standards and guidelines for improving local principal and teacher performance evaluations. After several reviews and edits, these guidelines were eventually app roved through the NDDPI in 2014 (Principal Evaluation Guidelines) and 2015 (Teacher Evaluation Guidelines). District s were able to adopt existing or develop locally designed principal evaluation models aligned to the state's guidelines. All districts are using one of four models: the Danielson Model, the Marshall Model, or the Marzano Model , or the McREL Model . The guidelines outlined a means of selecting a model aligned to standards, training staff, including a district's communication plan, and informat ion on efforts to record and compile appropriate performance level determinations for internal quality assurance. The PTESS Committee membership includes representation from large and small school districts as well as representation from districts impleme nting the Danielson Model, the Marshall Model, and the Marzano Model. The PTESS Committee continues to meet regularly throughout the year to provide advice in the leadership and facilitation of the implementation of the N orth Dakota Principal and Techer E valuation Guidelines state -wide. The PTESS Committee: Share successes and challenges with implementing the PTESS Guidelines and support the \"scaling up\" process, Assist with the collaboration on the implementation process, Assist with gathering feedback and data on the implementation process, Develop a statewide systems approach, Assist with planning for next steps in the implementation process and building a \"sustaining\" process, and ; Potentially may develop a group of North Dakota experts on each model to support and train the future trainers in the models. With exciting new changes on the horizon, the committee continues to have discussions on implementing practices and processes for scaling up principal and teacher evaluation models. Some areas of th e state held principal rounds, where principals observed a classroom, discussed what they saw and learned how to hold an effective post conference with the teacher. Teachers have been involved in the evaluation implementation process from serving on the st eering committe e, to selecting the model, and assist ing in selecting the emphasis for each year. Districts can support new teachers by providing a separate training for new staff. Additionally, the teacher -mentoring program is designed to offer support and assistance. 96 The Professional Standards for Educational Leaders (PSEL) Standards, formerly known as the Interstate School Leaders Licensure Consortium (ISLLC) Standards has recently been released. The most obviou s change between the ISLCC and the PSEL is standards have changed from six principles to ten and added clarification on how the standards can be met. The standards also include greater attention to promoting student well -being rather than academic rigor al one. It also factors in principals' abilities to provide instructional leadership. These new standards will be considered in moving toward implementing changes. The PTESS Committee has discussed rating systems in the evaluation models. There are higher expectations for teachers and principals. Training could be enhanced and it should not be driven from the top. A good system is in place for evaluation of teachers but the biggest gap is including a student growth component. The committee has discussed how t o track student growth and tie in student test scores. In the fall of 2017, the focus of the PTESS will be to enhance the implementation and align the evaluations to the school improvement process. Leadership Academy The North Dakota Cross -State Learnin g Collaborative (CSLC) Team has worked to identify and address \"Problems of Practice\" within the North Dakota education world. \"Problems of Practices\" are problems that is not already on its way to being resolved and if changed, would dramatically impact adult practice and student outcome. After reviewin g and analyzing data, the CSLC T eam decided to focus on the question, \"How can the NDDPI create a multi -tiered leadership academy to ensure our principals are effective leaders?\" This aligns to a key goal in the NDDPI - providing leadership, guidance, and support to North Dakota 's principals. By implementing a Leadership Academy, the CSLC T eam's goal is to ensure N orth Dakota principals have the resources and support they need to be effective leaders. The Leadership Academy will provide... Which in turn will... Professional support Professional development Career ladder opportunities Assist with administrator shortages Address administrator retention And ultimately raise student achievement The NDDPI is work ing closely with the NDLEAD to implement/expand a principal mentorship program, provide ongoing professional development directly related to the knowledge necessary to be an effective leader, and explore avenues to encourage career ladder opportunities. The professional development is a series of ongoing skill development for principals in a series of modules provided at the regional level. It is important to tie the professional development into the principal mentorship program In the fall of 2017, the Leadership Academies will serve as a resource in schools in comprehensive and targeted status in order to support and build their capacity in specific aspects of leadership. Training will be provided that is unique to the principal and focused on higher l evel perspectives on leadership. 97 Principal Mentoring In the 2015 -2016 school year, the NDLEAD piloted a principal mentoring program for first year administrators. The fi rst year of implementation, six principals were in the program. Mentors were trained an d assigned to new principals. M entors conducted at a minimum one site visit during the school year and met almost weekly. Additional mentors were trained during the summer of 2016. During the 2016 -2017 school year, there were 17 new principals in the men toring program out of an estimated 30 new principals. During this second year, mentors conducted at a minimum two site visits during the school year along with weekly meetings. The goal for the future is to assure all new administrators are provided a men tor. The program has two main objectives; to increase the rate of effectiveness of new administrators and to decrease turnover among rural and struggling schools. Special Education North Dakota has programs in place to ensure there are highly qualified st aff in the public schools to improve results for students with disabilities. North Dakota has taken a grow -your-own approach to filling the shortage areas in special education and related services. Following are some of the professional development program s the State funds using IDEA -B monies: Resident Teacher Program: The Special Education Resident Teacher Program seeks to attract and keep teachers in rural schools in North Dakota that have challenges recruiting and retaining teachers. The purpose is to increase the pool of endorsed and prepared special educators already licensed and admitted to graduate programs in special education. They complete a full -year internship in a school district or special education unit. The resident teachers work under the joint supervision of an experienced special educator and a university special education faculty member. Financial support for this program began in 1998 and continues to assist in meeting the special educator shortage needs in North Dakota. Speech -Langu age Pathology Scholarship: Due to a shortage of Speech -Language Pathologists in North Dakota public schools, six scholarships, funded through IDEA B funds, are awarded to graduate level Speech -Language Pathologists at two North Dakota universities. These scholarships fund the student's tuition, university fees and books. For each year the student accepts the scholarship, he/she signs an agreement to work in a school district in North Dakota. Traineeship Scholarship: Each year NDDPI awards Traineeship Sc holarships in priority disability areas to N orth Dakota teachers who wish to pursue graduate level retraining in the field of special education. As part of the application, a recommendation is provided by the local Special Education Unit Director where the applicant is working. This recommendation includes information about the applicant's skills as well as the identified need of the Special Education Unit for a teacher trained in the identified area. Scholarship amounts are based on the credit hours of cou rsework taken during a semester. Once accepted for the Traineeship Scholarship, applicants may be funded for a maximum of three years or until they complete their endorsement, whichever comes first. There is an average of 90 scholarships given per year in nine different special education and related service areas. 98 North Dakota Native American Essential Understandings: Transforming education through the Teachings of our Elders. In the Spring of 2015 the NDDPI brought together Tribal elders from across North Dakota to develop the North Dakota Native American Essential Understandings to guide the learning of both Native and non -Native students across the state. It is our hope that these Understandings will open up many more additional opportunities and a wareness of our Tribal Nations in classroom practices throughout the state. The NDNAEU resource document and the Teaching of our Elders website, which includes elder videos, K-12 lesson plans and additional resources were developed to increase learning, u nderstanding and well-being among all North Dakota students, educators and communities. We are currently in the roll-out and training phase of the NDNAEU project. Professional Development and Technical Assistance to Help All Students North Dakota provide s professional development and technical assistance for teachers and administrators for all students, including students who are EL, migrant, gifted and talented students, special education, homeless, and have low literacy levels. There are a plethora of professional development opportunities are available to support educators, such as the NDDPI fall conference, year -around workshops and trainings, and webinars. Guidance documents, Frequently Asked Question documents, Fact Sheets, and other resources are c reated and disseminated regularly to support educators. The NDDPI personnel are available to answer questions and provide targeted assistance to support educators. Additionally, the NDDPI partners with the National Math and Science Initiative (NMSI) to pro vide their rigorous NMSI Laying the Foundation (LTF) professional development program to all North Dakota educators each year. The LTF program strengthens the existing teaching corps through professional training aligned to 21st century mathematics and sci ence expectations while ensuring English language arts are fundamentally addressed. North Dakota has hosted LTF trainings in 2015, 2016, and 2017, and will host again summer 2018 and 2019. Any North Dakota educator is welcome to attend the LTF event with t he registration fee provided through a generous donation to NMSI. The NMSI LTF program aims to train teachers to facilitate students' progression through their academics toward advanced coursework opportunities. Developed by experienced teachers and content experts, the program provides comprehensive, hands -on training led by a national corps of expert classroom teachers. Trainers guide teachers through content -rich instruction that moves beyond what to teach, to how to deepen student understanding of key concepts. The program also offers classroom -ready materials and resources, which align with state standards and encourage higher -order thinking. NMSI LTF training emphasizes research -based instructional strategies including: inquiry -based learning, instru ctional scaffolding (techniques and guidance for delivering differentiated instruction), and vertical alignment (education about the knowledge and skills that students need to master at each grade level) all designed to help increase academic rigor and bui ld college and career readiness. The NMSI LTF professional development program is comprised of a summer institute that focuses on content and pedagogy. Many participating districts elect to follow -up course -specific training throughout the school year. It is North Dakota's plan to utilize NMSI in developing and sustaining these programs for North Dakota educators and students. 99 5.2 Support for Educators. Instructions : Consistent with sections 2101 and 2102 of the ESEA, if the SEA intends to use funds under one or more of the included programs for any of the following purposes, provide a description with the necessary information. A. Resources to Support State -level Strategies. Describe how the SEA will use Title II, Part A funds and funds from other included programs, consistent with allowable uses of funds provided under those programs, to support State -level strategies designed to: i. Increase student achievement consistent with the challenging State academic standards; ii. Improve the quality and effectiv eness of teachers, principals, and other school leaders; iii. Increase the number of teachers, principals, and other school leaders who are effective in improving student academic achievement in schools; and iv. Provide low -income and minority students greater acc ess to effective teachers, principals, and other school leaders consistent with the educator equity provisions in 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 299.18(c) . The NDDPI will use Title II Part A funds for the following statewide initiatives: Continued high quality job -embedded professional development to support strategies designed to increase achievement, Improving the quality and effectiveness of school leaders by utilizing the PTESS as an educator improvement tool, Enhance and expand the Leadership Academy which supports i mproving school leaders who are effective in improving student academic achievement, Increase the principal pipeline through the established principal mentoring program to increase the rate of effectiveness of new administrators and to decrease turnover a mong rural and struggling schools For low -income and minority students to gain greater access to effective educators, the state will extend capacity to continue implementation of Equitable Access to Excellent Educators plan strategies: (1) meaningful profe ssional development; (2) leadership training; and (3) partnership with higher education. The North Dakota State Plan to Ensure Equitable Access to Excellent Educators (Appendix O ) plan provides the full details. Supporting targeted and comprehensive school s in having access to and participating fully in the department's annual NMSI Laying the Foundation professional development program (see 5.1 Educator Development, Retention, and Advancement). The NDDPI will be utilizing flexibility in the state's Transfer authority (Title V Part A \u00a75101) to support this initiative (see 6.2 Title IV, Part B: 21st Century Community Learning Centers). The NDDPI will use Title II Part A funds to support state level strategies designed to increase achievement, improve teacher and principal quality and effectiveness, support strategies to strengthen access to low -income and minority students, and to address equity gaps. The NDDPI will grant Title II Part A funds to LEAs through the Consolidated Application process. Title II, Par t A funds will use 1% for administrative costs to oversee, monitor, and fiscal duties and approximately 2.6% for statewide initiatives with remaining funds as LEA allocations. Statewide initiatives include professional learning offered to principals, teach ers, and administrators to support school leadership mentoring, provide professional support for a multi -tiered leadership opportunity, support teacher effectiveness, addresses equity gaps, build their content knowledge in the North Dakota Standards, gifted students, English Learners, Native American populations, and students with disab ilities. The framework allows for awarding Title II funds to REAs , districts, and external providers to provide 100 support through professional development opportunities and dev elopment of resources to support selected strategies. There will be an effort to increase general communication to stakeholders regarding statewide initiatives, grant opportunities, professional development opportunities, etc. The state -level strategies using Title II Part A funds is described in Section 5.1. This include the Principal Teacher Evaluation Support System, Leadership Academies, and Principal Mentoring. B. Skills to Address Specific Learning Needs . Describe how the SEA will improve the skills of teachers, principals, or other school leaders in identifying students with specific learning needs and providing instruction based on the needs of such students, consistent with section 2101(d)(2)(J) of the ESEA. The NDDPI will collaborate with loca l and REAs and community partners to provide training and support aligned to district needs identified by local needs assessments and continuous improvement plans. This training includes identifying students with specific learning needs and providing instruction based on the needs of such students. More information o n students in spec ial education, EL students, Gifted/Talented, and students with low literacy levels can be found in Sect ion 5.1 C. Providing evidence -based practices for districts and schools will increase opportunities to differentiate professional learning based on local needs. Additionally, leveraging federal, state, and local funds in alignment with established partnerships will enhance support in the dissemination of best practices and resources. The NDDPI has enhanced the continuous improvement and strengthened the connection between professional learning and developing skills to provide instruction to students with specific le arning needs. Support is also provided in conjunction with other partners, including REAs, N orth Dakota Council of Educational Leaders, NDLEAD, N orth Dakota School Board Association and others. 5.3 Educator Equity. North Dakota developed, submitted, and r eceived approval on the North Dakota State Plan to Ensure Equitable Access to Excellent Educators (Appendix O) published in August 28, 2015. This plan is intended to ensure that every student in every school is taught by an excellent educator. Historically , North Dakota has had minimal gaps statewide among our schools with regard to the extent that poor students are taught by inexperienced, unqualified, or out -of-field teachers. North Dakota has summarized the equity gaps in this report that currently do ex ist and provided charts that reflect the data available. The State Equity Plan identified four key gaps within the plan: Slightly higher levels of new teachers teaching in high poverty schools than in low poverty schools , Teachers and school leader recru itment and retention, Teacher shortage, and Equitable access to high quality professional development. For ea ch gap identified, North Dakota outlined selected strategies that are being employed to address the root causes. North Dakota has and will contin ue to monitor and provide support on the strategies identified. The goal is to ensure that poor and minority students are not taught by inexperienced, unqualified, or out -of-field teachers at higher rates than other children. We intend ensure all students in North Dakota graduate choice ready with the knowledge, skills, and disposition to be successful in 101 whatever they choose to do, whether they pursue a post -secondary degree, enroll in a technical college, enter the workforce, or join the military. Appendix V provides updated data from the 2016 -2017 on out -of-field teachers and inexperienced teachers in Title I and non -Title I schools. North Dakota has established a method and will begin to collect data starting in the fall of 2017 to be used in repo rting the rates of effective teachers in schools. North Dakota has never collected or reported information on teacher effectiveness in the past. The system to collect data on teacher effectiveness was built this summer and is in place in the STARS (State A utomated Reporting System) where each school will fill out and report this data. North Dakota is fully prepared to report the data requested through the ESSA requirements. This data will provide information on any equitability gaps of inexperienced, unqual ified, and ineffective teachers. The intent is to ensure poor and minority students are not taught by inexperienced, unqualified, or ineffective teachers at higher rates than their counterparts. Comparison data between Title I, Part A and non -Title I, Part A schools will be collected and reported to align with the ESSA requirements. A. Definitions. Provide the SEA's different definitions, using distinct criteria, for the following key terms: Key Term Statewide Definition (or Statewide Guidelines) Ineffective teaching * A teacher is considered ineffective within a specific element/component in which the teacher rates a one in the teacher evaluation model. Statewide guidelines are provided under the Determination of Educator Effectiveness. Out-of-field teacher*+ Teachers who have been assigned to teach a class for which they are not highly qualified. This category does not exist in North Dakota as it is not allowable under state or federal law to assign an educator to teach a class for which they are not considered highly qualified. Inexperienced teacher*+ Teachers having three or fewer years of teaching experience. Low-income student A child who is eligible for free or reduced price meals. Minority student A student having racial or ethni c origins in any group other than the majority for the state. *Definitions of these terms must provide useful information about educator equity. +Definitions of these terms must be consistent with the definitions that a State uses under 34 C.F.R . \u00a7 200.37 . Other Key Terms (optional) Statewide Definition Unqualified teacher Teachers who are not qualified according to North Dakota state licensure laws to teach a specific course. Excellent Educators High quality educators who guide and support all students in getting and remaining on track to graduate from high school ready for college or careers (i.e. effective teachers). Future determinations of \"excellent educators\" will be based on teacher evaluations once our process and tools are completed. Determination of Educator Effectiveness Educator effectiveness will be determined by the number of students, number of teachers evaluated on the teacher evaluation model, number of elements/components rated during the year, and number of ratings on levels within the teacher evaluation model. This calculation is used to determine ineffective teaching. 102 The NDDPI will determine ineffective teaching using the data outlined above. Multiplying the number of teachers evaluated by the number of elements evaluated, provides the total number of elements that are rated. (Ex: 20 teachers x 20 elements = 400 elements total). By looking at the number of elements rated at a Level 1 (or ineffective teaching), and dividing by the number of teachers evaluated, this provides t he percent of ineffective teaching (Ex: 20 elements rated at a Level 1 \u00f7 400 total elements rated = 5% of teaching is ineffective). To find an ineffective teacher equivalent, the percent of ineffective teaching is multiplied by the total number of teachers (Ex: 5% of ineffective teaching x 20 total teachers = 1 ineffective teacher equivalent). Equitability can be calculated by determining ineffective teaching. Equitability in high -poverty and high-minority schools will be ascertained using the calculations described above. A sample of this data can be found in Appendix K. B. Rates and Differences in Rates. In Appendix L , calculate and provide the statewide rates at which low -income and minority students enrolled in schools receiving funds under Title I, Part A are taught by ineffective, out -of-field, and inexperienced teachers compared to non -low- income and non -minority students enrolled in schools not receiving funds under Title I, Part A using the definitions provided in section 5.3.A. The SEA must calcula te the statewide rates using student -level data. The North Dakota State Plan to Ensure Equitable Access to Excellent Educators , published in August 2015, can be found Appendix O. This plan includes data on inexperienced, unqualified, and out -of- field teachers. The NDDPI is developing reporting requirements to in clude data on ineffective teaching . This data will be included in future reports. C. Public Reporting. P rovide the Web address or UR L of, or a direct link to, where the SEA will publish and annually update, consistent with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 299.18(c)(4) : i. The rates and differences in rates calculated in 5.3.B; ii. The percentage of teachers categorized in each LEA at each effectiveness level established as part of the definition of \"ineffective teacher,\" consistent with applicable State privacy policies; iii. The percentage of teachers categorized as out -of-field teachers consistent with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.37 ; and iv. The percentage of teachers categorized as inexperienced teachers consistent with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.37 . The NDDPI will publish and annually update the rates and disproportionalities calculated under this section and report on the rates and disproportionalities in the manner described in this se ction on the NDDPI website and update equity documentation. D. Likely Causes of Most Significant Differences. If there is one or more difference in rates in 5.3.B, describe the likely causes ( e.g., teacher shortages, w orking conditions, school leadership, compensation, or other causes), which may vary across districts or schools, of the most significant statewide differences in rates in 5.3.B. The description must include whether those differences in rates reflect gaps between districts, within districts, and within schools. The N DDPI is committed to ensuring that an excellent teacher teaches every student in a North Dakota school . The N DDPI recognizes that to accomplish this goal that systemic strategies are employed to eliminate the identified equity gaps. The N DDPI 's plan to eliminate the identified gaps is predicated on the following theory of action: 103 If a comprehensive approach to the human capital management and support of teachers is systemically implemented and implementation is monitored and modified over time, Then North Dakota school districts will be better able to recruit, retain, and develop ex cellent teachers such that all students have equitable access to excellent teaching to help them achieve their highest potential in school and beyond. The State Equity Plan identified four key gaps within the plan: Slightly higher levels of new teachers teaching in high poverty schools than in low poverty schools Teachers and school leader recruitment and retention, Teacher shortage, and Equitable access to high quality professional development. More details can be found on pages 10 -12 of the North Dakot a State Plan to Ensure Equitable Access to Excellent Educators . E. Identification of Strategies. If there is one or more difference in rates in 5.3.B, provide the SEA's strategies, including timelines and Federal or non -Federal funding sources, that are: i. Designed to address the likely causes of the most significant differences identified in 5.3.D and ii. Prioritized to address the most significant differences in the rates provided in 5.3.B, including by prioritizing strategies to support any schools identified for comprehensive or targeted support and improvement under 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.19 that are contributing to those differences in rates. The state -level strategies using Title II Part A funds is described in Section 5.1. This include the Principal Teacher Ev aluation Support System, Leadership Academies, and Principal Mentoring. Other strategies are implemented through a collaborative effort in alignment with established partnerships leveraging federal, state , and local funds. The likely causes of the most significant differences in rates and the strategies including a timeline are available in pages 16 -22 of the North Dakota State Plan to Ensure Equitable Access to Excellent Educators . Likely Causes of Most Significant Differences in Rates Strategies (Including Timeline and Funding Sources) See N orth Dakota State Equity Plan. F. Timelines and Interim Targets. If there is one or more difference in rates in 5.3.B, describe the SEA's timelines and interim targets for eliminating all differences in rates. The NDDPI will ensure that districts collect and submit this data annually in the consolidated application. Baseline data will be collected during the 2017 -2018 school year from districts. The NDDPI will provide ongoing monitoring and support in collectin g the data on ineffective teaching by providing guidance and training. Further details on the timeline and targets in providing ongoing monitoring and support is described on page 28 in the North Dakota State Plan to Ensure Equitable Access to Excellent Educa tors. 104 Section 6: Supporting All Students 6.1 Well -Rounded and Supportive Education for Students . Instructions : When addressing the State's strategies below, each SEA must describe how it will use Title IV, Part A funds and funds from other included programs , consistent with allowable uses of fund provided under those programs, to support State -level strategies and LEA use of funds . The strategies and uses of funds must be designed to ensure t hat all children have a significant opportunity to meet challenging State academic standards and career and technical standards, as applicable, and attain, at a minimum, a regular high school diploma . The descriptions that a n SEA provides must include how , when developing its State strategies, the SEA considered the academic and non -academic needs of the following specific subgroups of students: Low-income students; Lowest -achieving students; English learners; Children with disabilities; Children and youth in foster care; Migratory children, including preschool migratory children and migratory children who have dropped out of school; Homeless children and youths; Neglected, delinquent, and at -risk students identified under Title I, Part D of the ESE A, including students in juvenile justice facilities; Immigrant children and youth; Students in LEAs eligible for grants under the Rural and Low -Income School program under section 5221 of the ESEA ; and American In dian and Alaska Native students. A. The S tate's strategies and how it will support LEAs to support t he continuum of a student's education from preschool through grade 12, including transitions from early childhood education to elementary school, elementary school to middle school, middle school to high school, and high school to post -secondary education and careers, in order to support appropriate promotion practices and decrease th e risk of students dropping out; and North Dakota's vision is to ensure all students in North Dakota graduate choice ready with the knowledge, skills, and disposition to be s uccessful in whatever they choose to do, whether they pursue a post -secondary degree, enroll in a technical college, enter the workforce, or join the military. North Dakota's support for students spans from early childhood educational settings through elementary school, middle school, high school and transitions into partnerships for college and career readiness. Supported through a long tradition of local contro l, the continuum of education in North Dakota is primarily determined at the LEA level. The NDDPI has established frameworks and processes to provide support to all LEAs , including those receiving Title I Part A funds, through this PreK -12 experience as we ll as preparing students to be choice ready upon graduation. The State Superintendent has set five priority areas that guide the agency's work in assisting students in achieving the state's vision of being choice ready. The state will continue to take a n umber of actions to support student access to a well -rounded education and work with districts in that regard through the five priority areas which include: 105 Great Teachers/Leaders The NDDPI, in collaboration with NDREAs, NDLEAD, and NDUnited, are dedicated to providing high quality professional learning for all educators across the state. The department will continue to grant funding to these partners to ensure teachers and leaders are equipped with a deepened understanding of content knowledge, effective i nstructional strategies, and student learning supports needed in order for students to experience high levels of learning and academic success. Additionally, the state is working with the NDESPB to redefine how North Dakota will define a highly qualified educator. Continuous Improvement The NDDPI supports one continuous improvement plan for all schools throughout North Dakota . This consolidated plan brings together various federal and state requirements for school improvement into one place so schools can speak with a common vision and language. It is the intent of the department that school improvement is a continuous process for all schools, not a one-time event, and not for a specific subset of schools. All schools are expected to participate in a co ntinuous improvement cycle that serves as the foundation for school improvement. North Dakota currently utilize s AdvancED state -wide for all North Dakota p ublic schools. The AdvancED 5 -year improvement cycle serves as the vehicle for schools to : a.) gather information specific to their school and system, b.) study, analyze, and establish goals, c.) develop a plan of action and improvement, and d.) implement, monitor , and evaluate on a continuous basis. NDMTSS is a school improvement framework to provide all students with the best opportunities to succeed academically and behaviorally in school. NDMTSS focuses on providing high -quality instruction and interventions matched to student need, monitoring progress frequently to make decisions about cha nges in instruction or goals. Data are used to allocate resources to improve student learning and support staff implementation of effective practices. NDMTSS recognizes that providing all students with the best opportunities to succeed academically and beh aviorally requires a constant focus on improvement. This is done through needs assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluatio n. Equity North Dakota is committed to reviewing information and addressing equity including: fiscal equity, teacher equity, and equitable access and participation for students. Between North Dakota's vision statement referenced above and ESSA 's intent to provide all children significant opportunity to receive a fair, equitable, and high quality education, and to close the achie vement gap, it is North Dakota's responsibility to provide an equitable education that ensures all student excel and succeed. Research tells us s trong teachers and school leaders matter for all children, particularly students who are behind academically. In addition, far too often, students who need strong teachers and school leaders the most have the least access to them. ESSA requires s tates and district s to ensure low- income students and students of color are not taught at disproportionate rates by ine ffective, out -of- field, or inexperienced teachers. The NDDPI is committed to ensuring an excellent teacher teaches every student in a North Dakota school . The NDDPI recognizes to accomplish this goal , systemic strategies be employed to eliminate the identi fied equity gaps. In many places, schools serving the most vulnerable students get less funding. These gaps happen between districts and within districts. The intent of ESEA has always been to provide more dollars for historically disadvantaged students and this is maintained through the reauthorization. ESSA requires per pupil reporting on actual school level spending practices as well as equity measures to ensure students are not disproportionately represented. 106 North Dakota recognizes a ll students deser ve access to broad and rich in content curriculum. Research shows that students \u2014particularly historically underserved students \u2014engage more deeply in learning when they are exposed to a variety of topics and can better connect what they are learning in the classroom with the world outside of school. ESSA's focus on well -rounded education opportunities ensures all children receive fair, equitable and high quality education by addressing the academic and non -academic needs of students and students within subgroups. North Dakota believes all students should have equitable access to equitable academic opportunities. These program s may include ; preschool programming, advanced coursework, science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) educatio n programming , physical education promoting healthy lifestyles, career and technology education, 21st century skills, competency -based learning, as well as personal learning opportunities. Rigorous coursework and opportunities in all curricular areas , including but not limited to: English, reading/language arts, writing Mathematics , computer science Science, technology, engineering Foreign languages Civics, government, economics Visual arts, drama, dance, media arts, music History, geography, social studies Career and technical education programs Health, physical education Local Educational Opportunities North Dakota's K -12 students have access to rigorous academic content standards. These standards, developed through North Dakota established framewo rks, engage educators and stakeholders in setting high expectations for academic achievement. Additionally, North Dakota recognizes the need to support LEAs in providing students a variety of academic, cross curricular, career and technical opportunities t hroughout their K -12 career, and specifically during their secondary school experiences. These programs include Career and Technical Education (CTE) options and career pathways, health and wellness programs (including physical, mental, and emotional health ), advanced coursework options (such as Advanced Placement, Dual Credit, Early Entry), services through enrichment, developmental or accelerated programming, arts and music programs, standards -based and competency -based initiatives, STEM and STEAM educatio n, internships and externships, educational technology opportunities , out-of-school time programming as well as the necessary supports. Although these supports are available to all schools K -12, many are implemented in schools providing transitional servic es to middle school and high school level students. North Dakota intends to ensure all students in North Dakota graduate choice ready with the knowledge, skills, and disposition to be successful in whatever they choose to do, whether they pursue a post -secondary degree, enroll in a technical college, enter the workforce, or join the military. Providing well -rounded and supportive educational opportunities for students in PK -12 is an essential component to achieve this choice ready goal. North Dakota's Choice Ready component addresses strategies for transitioning all middle school and high school students, but in particular those at risk of dropping out. As outlined in the Choice Ready Initiative (Appendix J) all North Dakota schools are r equired to ensure that all students meet the Choice Ready indicators highlighted by in the blue bars. This includes earning a diploma or GED and evidence that the student, parent and the school have developed a rolling 4 -year education plan of study for ea ch student. After the implementation of a career interest inventory in 8th grade, students consult with advisors, and parents and jointly develop a 4 -year rolling education plan for the next four 107 years of high school. These plans begin while students are i n middle school and are continually reviewed and updated each year through high school. The rolling 4 -year education plan provides a ladder of next steps for the students' educational path that leads into post -secondary education or training, career or mil itary. In addition to the plan, all students must meet particular academic benchmarks and participate in essential skills indicators including: community services, strong attendance, co -curricular or extra -curricular activities. In addition to academic growth, school climate is often considered the 'heart' of each school building. School climate is grounded in relationships and social interactions for staff, students, parents and community that creates the positive atmosphere for learning and teaching. W hile unique to each school, climate is a strong predictor of academic and personal growth. Climate also is paramount to staff retention, student engagement, student dropout rates , and violence, all leading to high student achievement. School climate is oft en viewed in multiple context to include physical safety, peer and adult relationships, teaching , and post school planning. Not to be confused with school culture, climate is grounded in how people feel about their school as a safe and caring place. Measur ing action and evaluation requires an initial needs assessment; multiple instruments are reliable in the determination of needs and active goals and strategies to meet the intended outcomes. Using multiple assessment data, each school can transition to a s pecific action plan or activities; these same activities can provide a springboard to the community and home partnership, as the school assumes the role of the community 'hub'. With an emphasis on climate as its foundation, every school can offer students, staff, parents and the community sound rationale that academic and social growth is a priority for lifelong learning and meaningful post school choices and citizenship. In concert with school climate, the NDDPI and State ESSA Planning Committee have had c onversations regarding student engagement as another critical indicator. Strengthening student engagement allows academic and social/emotional gains for all students and builds student investment in their individual education and that of their peers, schoo l and community. Student engagement strategies in the classroom energize success, curiosity, originality and relationships with peers and adults. Understanding the relevancy of what they learn and how they apply that to themselves and the world around them invites connection, commitment and accomplishments. Student engagement in school social situations, for example, extra -curricular activities, offers the same connection, commitment and accomplishments, in addition to multiple trusted peer and adult relationships, academic success and many social/emotional traits such as time management and self - confidence. Children from elementary to high school who are fully engaged and committed to education in its entirety become satisfied and strong student learner s and confident adults and leaders. Students want and need work that enables them to demonstrate and improve their sense of themselves. While this can be motivational, NDDPI will work with districts and educators to strive for students to produce high -quality work by clear articulation of academic and social criteria for success, demonstrate the academic and social skills to be successful via modeling, and connecting success as a valuable aspect of their personalities long after the school day ends. Early Childhood Education North Dakota has made great strides in support of early childhood education throughout the state. During 2015 -2017, a collaborative initiative between the North Dakota Department of Commerce, North Dakota Health and Human Services, and NDDPI were successful in securing state funding to support early learning opportunities for children between the ages of four and five. Additionally, the department has made early childhood education a priority by establishing an Office of Early Learning that will be staffed to oversee preschool to elementary transitions, early learning standards, early childhood education programming, and the state's Head Start/Early Head Start programs. 108 North Dakota's adoption of PreK -12 academic content standards, partnered technical assistance, and commitment to resources work together to support the entire continuum of education. The NDDPI , Prek-12 educators and early learning educators have made significant progre ss through statewide and local efforts to establish the continuum of student education; supporting school transitions, the promotion of developmentally appropriate practices, and to reduce the student dropout rate while increasing retention. The ESSA's emphasis in the essential foundational practices and transitions from pre -kindergarten to the K -12 system requires educational systems to provide considerable opportuni ties for technical assistance. Greater guidance and technical assistance supporting earl y educators implementing innovative practices to aid in a smooth transition from pre -kindergarten to kindergarten, elementary to middle school, and middle school to high school. Through the continued use of the state's pre - kindergarten standards, kindergar ten entry assessment, and high quality professional learning opportunities will aid in maximizing on gains from early learning interventions to close the achievement gap. Community and parental involvement strengthens and improve s transitions and build s the capacity for greater pedagogical initiatives of early childhood and elementary educator's administrators, and principles throughout the state. B. The State's strategies and how it will support LEAs to provide e quitable access to a well - rounded education and rigorous coursework in subjects in which female students, minority students, English learners, children with disabilities, or low-income students are underrepresented . Such subject s could include English, reading/language arts, writing, science, technology, engineering, mathematics , foreign languages, civics and government, economics, arts, history, geography, computer science, music, career and technical education, health , or physical ed ucation . North Dakota recognizes all students deserve access t o a broad and rich in content curriculum. Research shows that students \u2014particularly historically underserved students \u2014engage more deeply in learning when they are exposed to a variety of topics and can better connect what they are learning in the classroom with the world outside of sch ool. ESSA's focus on well -rounded education opportunities ensures all children receive fair, equitable and high quality education by addressing the academic and non -academic needs of students and students within subgroups. North Dakota believes all student s should have equitable access to equitable academic opportunities. These program may include ; preschool programming, advanced coursework, science, technology, engineering, a rts, and mathematics (STEAM) education programming, physical education promoting h ealthy lifestyles, career and technology education, 21st century skills, competency -based learning, as well as personal learning opportunities. Rigorous coursework and opportunities in all curricular areas , including but not limited to: English, reading/l anguage arts, writing Mathematics , computer science Science, technology, engineering Foreign languages Civics, government, economics Visual arts, drama, dance, media arts, music History, geography, social studies Career and technical education programs Health, physical education The NDDPI will utilize 1% of the state's Title IV, Part A allocation to support the activities and 109 initiatives addressed in 6.1.A and administrative costs associated with the Student Support and Academic Achievement program, which includes public reporting on how LEAs are using the funds and the degree to which LEAs have made progress towards meeting the identified objectives and outcomes. The NDDPI has, and will consider, the academic and non -academic needs of all students, including all sub groups of students, when developing strategies and implementing programs for well - rounded education. The NDDPI will use these funds to provide technical assistance and capacity building to LEAs to meet the goals of this program. The NDDPI will award Student Support and Academic Achievement program sub grants to LEAs through a formula in the same proportion as to the prior year's Title I, Part A allocation for each LEA as required in (\u00a74105(a)(1 )). North Dakota assures that no district will receive less than a $10,000 allocation as required by statute. The NDDPI will grant Title IV, Part A funds to LEAs through the North Dakota Consolidated Applic ation for Federal Title Funds. This process allows school districts to submit one comprehensive appli cation for funding for several federal programs, including: Title I, Part A; Title II, Part A; Title III, Part A; and Title IV, Part A. Guidance on allowab le activities and program guidelines is developed by NDDPI and shared with North Dakota districts. Each year, districts must submit this application to the NDDPI in order to receive federal funds. The district's application provides a plan for meeting fed eral program requirements based on a needs assessment and alignment with specific needs of the LEAs for improving student achievement. Each district's school board appoints an authorized representative for the programs funded in the consolidated applicati on and approves the application prior to its submission to the NDDPI. The submitted consolidated applications are reviewed by the NDDPI, who provides technical assistance as needed and approves the applications when information is correct and in compliance . North Dakota Standards , Locally Selected Curriculum , and Professional Learning In North Dakota , all curriculum and instruction is determined at the LEA level and, as required by the NDCC \u00a715.1, must meet or exceed the state content standards. Through th e state's process of engaging educators and stakeholders in the review and drafting of academic content standards, and the LEAs alignment of their curriculum and instruction to these standards, all North Dakota students will be provided with equal access t o a challenging, well -rounded instructional experience. When the NDDPI use state and/or federal funds to support standards, instruction, and professional learning, the NDDPI ensures it offers a variety of approaches to schools serving all levels of studen ts. The NDDPI sponsors several conferences each year. Each spring, regional trainings are held for schools and districts to disseminate key information regarding the supports, services, and requirements as well as to share effective strategies for making progress. In th e fall, a statewide conference is held for educators to promote effective evidence -based strategies designed to raise achievement. The NDDPI sponsors webinar presentations specifically designed to provide technical assistance and guidance to comprehensive support schools. Numerous other trainings, via conference call or webinars, are also offered each year to share and disseminate information statewide. Each of these initiatives offers supports to all LEAs, including those receiving Title I Part A funding, and ensure support for schools working with students in early childhood, elementary school, middle school, high school environments. Safe and Healthy School Environments Students learn to their potential when learning in a safe, caring and healthy enviro nment which promotes trusted peer and adult relationships, a climate which supports student academic and social growth and leadership, and strides to motivate students to adapt to personal and academia rigors. 110 The State ESSA Planning Committee has chosen t o focus on school climate and student engagement as indicators paramount to well -rounded education. Support of broad strategies will allow large and small districts to provide services, implement strategies and evaluate effectiveness based on multiple local factors. This also allows the NDDPI to build upon its foundational work surrounding MTSS, RTI, PBIS and the Behavioral Health initiative. Existing data sources (Youth Risk Behavior Survey, Suspension, Expulsion and Truancy report) may serve as baseline d ata at both the LEA and SEA level. The additional strategies aligned with school climate and student engagement and implementation of specific LEA approved activities will reduce incidents of bullying and harassment and the overuse of discipline practices that remove students from the classroom. The NDDPI does not support adverse behavioral interventions for the management of behavioral challenges in schools. The NDDPI provides, and will continue to strengthen support to schools for the implementation of e vidence based intervention techniques to increase student engagement, self - regulation, and effective instruction for behavioral challenges. North Dakota's State Systemic Improvement Plan, Indicator 17, State Identified Measurable Result (SiMR) is: Increase the extended 6 year Graduation Rate for students identified with Emotional Disturbance. The stakeholder group involved in the selection of the SiMR, chose to broaden the targeted group to students with behavioral, social/emotional, social communication, a nd mental health needs . The State has supported the local districts through their local Special Education Improvement Planning Process as they have implemented Evidence Based Practices and developed and entered goals into each school's continuous improveme nt plan, which is aligned to the AdvancED Process (Accreditation). The NDDPI will continue to support this local planning and implementation process with NDDPI technical assistance with an emphasis on evaluation and fidelity. The planning model focuses on the two standards: Effective Instruction (self -regulation skills and executive function skills) and Effective Supports (academic supports, behavioral supports and parent, student, family, and community supports).The support has and will continue to include NDDPI resources for Professional Development. Along with its partners, the NDPI will promote advocacy to increase mental health services. North Dakota, through the State Personnel Development Grant (SPDG) has developed a Multi -Tier System of Supports (NDMTSS). North Dakota's MTSS is a framework to provide all students with the best opportunities to succeed academically and behaviorally in sc hool. NDMTSS focuses on providing high -quality instruction and interventions matched to student need, monitoring progress frequently to make decisions about changes in instruction or goals. Data are used to allocate resources to improve student learning an d support staff implementation of effective practices.North Dakota has cultivated a relationship with the Regional Education Associations in the state who are taking over the trainings throughout the state, which will enable the number of districts that ad opt this systemic change, MTSS, to increase. The NDDPI (Safe and Healthy Schools Office ) will be soliciting volunteers for a task force to look at multiple data sets to determine the criteria for persistently dangerous student definition. The Task Force w ill also look at having an \"early warning system\" in place. This will include a two -prong approach: 1) Victim can move to another school; 2) Dangerous student can move to another school. Technology Education North Dakota Educational Technology Council (NDE TC) has statutory responsibility to coordinate educational technology initiatives that promote efficient, effective and equitable technical and online learning services for all elementary and secondary schools in the state. Most recently, the NDETC launch ed plans to centralize its grants programs to a single initiative that focuses on using technology to transform education. Additional funds have been requested to improve wireless infrastructure, increase student access to internet connected devices and ex pand instructional coaching for educators. In addition to these initiatives, the NDCTE will continue to support various initiatives directly focused on academic achievement and digital literacy for all students. The NDETC 111 works in collaboration with the No rth Dakota Information Technology Department (NDITD), NDDPI, the North Dakota Department of Career and Technical Education (NDCTE), and REAs to accomplish this work. The NDDPI also supports LEAs to effectively utilize and leverage educational technology opportunities to support student learning and increase digital literacy. The NDDPI adopted the North Dakota Library and Technology Content Standards in December 2012 wh ich help guide teachers. The North Dakota Center for Distance Education (NDCDE) is also a key player for education in North Dakota. The NDCDE provides curricular and instructional equity for North Dakota's students, particularly those students who are edu cated in North Dakota's smallest K -12 schools. The NDCDE provides direct access to courses, including but not limited to advance coursework, STE AM experiences, credit -recovery options, developmental coursework. Innovative Learning Through ESSA, North D akota schools will be encouraged to incorporate STEM and STEAM learning strategies, competency -based learning program s, and project -based learning frameworks. These educational environments encourage students to connect and engage with a variety of learnin g mediums and demonstrate proficiency in nontraditional ways. The NDDPI will support districts that develop a comprehensive , innovative learning plan that demonstrates innovative practices and increases rigorous learning for students. STEAM education str ategies incorporate several academic disciplines that let students design, build , and communicate through tangible projec ts that support deep learning and create academic growth, and possibly a passion in 21st Century work skills and functions. STEAM strat egies add the discipline of the arts. The arts-through music, visual arts, and drama, amongst others -promote creativity and a different kind of problem solving skills. The arts also promote fine and gross motor skills , risk taking , and further problem solv ing. Furthermore, the arts add a unique aesthetic attractive element to projects that may draw the curiosity of students that are not usually excited about the sciences. Project Based Learning does much of the same as STEM and STEAM ; however , it goes dee per in to more academic disci plines through possibly longer enduring projects. North Dakota is committed in providing strategies that promote the passion and learning of all students. We believe these strategies will ultimately lead to a much higher level o f successful students in North Dakota . North Dakota will provide multiple platforms of support for the application process , as well as requirements associated with Title IV, Part A funding. These supports may include: Self-service supports (written guida nce, planning tools, rubrics, guidebooks, fast facts) Trainings (webinars, regional meetings, conferences) Targeted s upport (onsite technical assistance, program planning support) LEAs will have the flexibility to use state, local and federal funding to de velop, continue, or support initiatives specific to offering well -rounded education opportunities based on a review of their needs. North Dakota 's participation in AdvancED and the MTSS framework are both model vehicles for this review process and can also act as a delivery mechanism providing individualized support. LEA needs assessments are expected to drive the identified goals and subsequent activities. Each LEA will convey this information to the state by the use of the consolidated application includ ing a process of review according to the ESSA final regulations and the N orth Dakota ESSA State Plan. It is recognized LEAs also have the flexibility to utilize this funding through the transfer program to best meet their needs (for instance Title IV, Part A transfers to Title I, Part A). In the event an LEA transfers its funding, the needs assessment will be reviewed accordingly. 112 Approved activities will be identified and approved by SEA staff , and guidance available through technical assistance, material dissemination, professional development and training. A calendar of timelines will be developed for LEA submission and SEA approval processes. If an SEA intends to use Title IV, Part A funds or funds from other included programs for the activities that follow, the description must address how the State strategies below support the State -level strategi es in 6.1.A and B. C. Does the S EA intend to use funds from Title IV, Part A or other included programs to support strategies to support LEAs to improve school conditions for student learning, including activities that create safe, healthy, and affirming sch ool environments inclusive of all students to reduce : i. Incide nts of bullying and harassment; ii. The overuse of discipline practices that remove s tudents from the classroom; and iii. The use of aversive behavioral interventions that compro mise student health and safety? Yes. If yes, provide a description below . No. The State ESSA Committee elected not to set aside Title IV, Part A funds for state level initiatives. D. Does the SEA intend to use funds from Title IV, Part A or other included programs to support strategies to support LEAs to effectively use technology to improve the academic achievement and di gital literacy of all students ? Yes. If yes, provide a description below . No. The State ESSA Committee elected not to set aside Title IV, Part A funds for state level initiatives. E. Does the S EA intend to use funds from Title IV, Part A or other included programs to support strategies to support LEAs to engage p arent s, families , and communities ? Yes. If yes, provide a description below . No. The State ESSA Committee elected not to set aside Title IV, Part A funds for state level initiatives. 6.2 Program -Specific Requirements . A. Title I, Part A: Improving Basic Programs Operated by State and Local Educational Agencies i. Describe the process and criteria that the SEA will use to waive the 40 percent schoolwide poverty threshold under section 1114(a)(1)(B) of the ESEA that an LEA submits on behalf of a school, including how the SEA will ensure that the schoolwide program wil l best serve the needs of the lowest -achieving students in the school . The NDDPI has a long -standing tradition of local control and flexibility to provide districts with options. The NDDPI maintains the tradition of the 40 percent schoolwide poverty and offers the opportunity to apply by waiving the 40 percent schoolwide poverty through a state waiver option to receive consideration for the schoolwide waiver. A school that serves an eligible school attendance area in which less than 40% of the children a re from low -income families, or a school for which less than 40% of the children enrolled in the school are from 113 such families, may operate a schoolwide program under federal law, as the school is receiving a waiver from the NDDPI. By selecting the waiver option, the school assures it must take into account how a schoolwide program will best serve the needs of the students in the school served in improving academic achievement and other factors. The school provides supporting documentat ion outlining this in formation that will be kept on file to document this waiver option. Further considerations may include the educational need for schoolwide status. Under the state waiver option , Title I eligible schools may include the size of the school, the benefit the s choolwide status will provide, and other factors the school wishes the state to consider. The NDDPI requests additional suggestions for other f actors it may wish to consider with regard to waiving the 40 % poverty threshold. The NDDPI will continue to suppo rt all schools , including those ineligible for schoolwide programming, those that have not received a waiver to operate such a schoolwide program, or those that choose not to operate a schoolwide program in addition to our current operating schoolwide buil dings. B. Title I, Part C : Education of Migratory Children. i. Describe how the SEA and its local operating agencies, which may include LEAs , will establish and implement a system for the proper identification and recruitment of eligible migratory children on a statewide basis, including the identification and recruitment of preschool migratory children and migratory children who have dropped out of school, and how the S EA will verify and document the number of eligible migratory children aged 3 through 21 res iding in the State on an annual basis. The North Dakota migrant education program consists of two seven week summer programs. The two programs serve around two hundred and fifty students. Around 95% of our families are from Texas and the same families re turn summer after summer and return to Texas the months of October, November and December. Because our state usually serves the same families each summer and those same families staying for around three months during the regular school year our state feel s very confident about the accuracy of the eligibility of the migrant families. The SEA holds a training for the recruiters annually on eligibility requirements and completing the certificates of eligibility (C.O.E.s). At this meeting recruiters are pro vided with an ID&R manual provided by Office of Migrant Education and a manual that our state has produced. This publication is an integral part of OME's identification and recruitment to help states conduct timely and accurate ID&R of eligible migrant chi ldren. This manual includes detailed guidance on key revisions made to the program regulations such as (1) resources that help strengthen their ID&R practices and quality control systems, (2) disseminates best practices for identifying and recruiting migra nt children and determining their eligibility, and (3) provides up -to-date federal policy guidance on migrant child eligibility and ID&R issues. During the regular school year written procedures are provided to all school personnel on how to collect and r eport pupil enrollment and withdrawal data. North Dakota has a state reporting system called (STARS) State Automated Report System. Every school district reports all of their students on this system. This system allows the school districts to be able to identify all of their students who are migrant. The state migrant office has access to this 114 report and when a migrant student is identified those schools are contacted to determine if the student is an eligible migrant student. If determined the student is indeed migrant the schools have been trained on how to complete the C.O.E. and obtain a signature. The C.O.E's are sent to the state migrant office to be entered into the migrant database. The North Dakota summer migrant education programs collaborate with Tri Valley Head Start in Crookston, Minnesota. The summer migrant education programs also utilizes the Tri Valley Head Start recruiters, which are all Spanish speakers. All preschool migrant children are recruited and documented on the certificates of eligibility and entered into our migrant database MIS2000 that downloads this information into the national database (MSIX) Migrant Student Information System. The Head Start migrant students are served by Tri Valley Head Start which provides school re adiness from June through October. After that time the preschool migratory students are served during the regular school using Title I part \"A\" funds or State funds. If the recruiters come across migrant students that have dropped out of school they are i nstructed to identify those students and provide them the services that our program provides. The principals and counselors are also informed of students who have dropped out of school. The school policy is to meet with the parents and students to educate them on how important it is for their student to attend school or obtain a GED. Finally, the North Dakota migrant program conducts a re -interview of twenty five families from each center ever summer to verify that the families are indeed eligible for mig rant services. The re -interviews are conducted by Tri Valley Head Start recruiters from Apple Valley, Minnesota. ii. Describe how the SEA and its local operating agencies, which may include LEAs , will identify the unique educational needs of migratory childr en, including preschool migratory children and migratory children who have dropped out of school , and other needs that must be met in order for migratory children to participate effectively in school . North Dakota conducts a comprehensive needs assessmen t of all migrant students every other year and a program evaluation on alternate years. This continuous improvement model incorporates the use of state assessment scores in language arts, math and English language proficiency to assess need and indicate p rogress. Since only a small percentage of North Dakota migrant students take the state assessment teacher ratings of student proficiency in language arts and standards are also used to identify needs and assess impact. In addition, administrators, teach ers, parents and students are surveyed to assess the unique needs of migrant students. Pre -school migrant students are assessed using the GOLD teaching strategies system in partnership with Tri -Valley Head Start. Online classes are available for studen ts who have dropped out of school along with a lab top. The principals, counselors and EL teachers are the contacts for these students to help them with lessons. The students may email, call or face -time these individuals for any help them 115 may need. Thes e students are also encouraged to attend migrant education summer school and P.A.S.S. The NDDPI seven -week summer Migrant Education Program (MEP) completes the following four -stage process in the continuous improvement cycle to ensure that the unique need s of the state's migratory students are met. This process includes : (1) A comprehensive needs assessment completed by an independent agency that captures the current needs of all migratory students (2) A service delivery plan which, is based on the needs identified in comprehensive needs assessment (3) Implementation of the program services needed to assist students and their families and (4) A program evaluation to determine if the objectives of the services where met NDDPI seven -week summer migr ant program has established a partnership with the Adult Basic Education Office for early identification of migrant dropouts and coordinates with available Spanish and English GED programs. Early childhood and preschool services are provide through sub -grants to the migrant summer schools by Tri Valley Head Start. The North Dakota Title I, C Migrant Education Program Administrator shares an office with the Title III English Language Acquisition Program Assistant Director. Together we facilitate the coord ination between these two programs within the state agency and across the school districts. The North Dakota Home Language Survey is included in the seven -week summer migrant program registration packets and the migrant families are required to complete th e form for each student. Students who indicate a language other than English was spoken at home and who have not been previously identified as an English Learner, are provided the WIDA W - APT or WIDA MODEL diagnostic assessment to determine English learner eligibility. The migrant summer school sites employ local district ESL teachers who are knowledgeable about the identification of English learners and trained to administer the diagnostic assessments. English language instruction is included as a part of the instructional services provided by the migrant summer schools. Migrant students with low levels of English proficiency are paired with bilingual teachers and or/ paraprofessionals. The summer migrant schools are required as a part of their contract to employ bilingual staff members who are able to communicate with the migrant students who are English learners and their parents. During the joint Tri Valley Head Start and Migrant Parent Advisory Council meetings, the director's present information to the migrant parents related to English language acquisition, stages of language development, responsibility of the districts to provide language instruction programs to all migrant students. 116 iii. Describe how the SEA and its local operating agencies, which may inc lude LEAs , will ensure that the unique educational needs of migratory children, including preschool migratory children and migratory children who have dropped out of school, and other needs that must be met in order for migratory children to participate ef fectively in school, are addressed through the full range of services that are available for migratory children from appropriate local, State, and Federal educational programs. The results of the comprehensive needs assessment are included in the North Da kota Migrant Education Service Delivery Plan which targets student needs and provides recommendations and strategies to meet needs. Each of the North Dakota migrant programs are required to submit an application for funding each year that details how the y will meet student needs and provide services to all migrant students. The migrant program evaluation on alternate years identifies what strategies have been implemented, to what degree and to what effect as well as the overall impact of the program serv ices on meeting student needs. Once the migrant students are identified they benefit from the provision of a comprehensive continuum of services through summer and regular school programs. The states comprehensive needs assessment addresses unique lear ner needs of this population, schools can customize added services to help them meet the state strategic goals, academic content and student achievement standards and improve student performance. Performance goals and expectations in reading and mathematic s under the Every Student Succeeds Act are targeted for improvement. The seven week summer migrant education programs provide coursework, tutoring, and online instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. Success plans (IEPs) are created for many st udents to target their specific academic needs. The Migrant Literacy NET is used extensively to provide lessons for teachers targeting student needs and online reading tutorials to facilitate reading proficiency. The summer programs also collaborate with Tri Valley Head Start. All preschool migrant children are recruited and document on the certificates of eligibility and entered into our migrant database MIS2000 which downloads this information into the national d ata base (MSIX) Migrant Student information system. The Head Start migrant students are served by Tri Valley Head Start from June through October. Tri Valley Head Start and the North Dakota summer migrant programs share the cost of busing and recruitment. Our state receives a very small allocation, therefore; without the cost -share of busing many of our migrant students would not be able to attend the migrant summer school because our state is very rural and the cost of fuel is very expensive. During th e summer migrant program and regular school year recruiters and counselors provide information regarding what the migrant education program can provide for dropout students. Such as Portable Assisted Study Sequence (PASS) which consist of self -contained, semi-independent -study courses designed to assist secondary -level students in earning 117 academic credits. Our recruiters also provide those students with the GED test sites, and inform them that the migrant summer program will help with the cost of the GED te sts. The PASS program and GED are highly recommended programs for dropout students. Our recruiters do a very good job on educating those students about the programs our state offers. All Portable Assistance Study Sequence (PASS) courses completed by th e secondary migrant students are recorded in MIS2000 our state migrant data base and in (MSIX) the national migrant data base. This program addresses migrant student needs in several ways, including compatible scheduling of work and school, academic and ca reer counseling, social activities, respect for cultural heritage, and involvement of parents in the instructional program. iv. Describe how the State and its local operating agencies, which may include LEAs , will use funds received under Title I, Part C to p romote interstate and intrastate coordination of services for migratory children, including how the State will provide for educational continuity through the timely transfer of pertinent school records, including information on health, when children move f rom one school to another, whether or not such move occurs during the regular school year (i.e., through use of the Migrant Student Information Exchange (MSIX), among other vehicles) . The Office of Migrant Education awards Migrant Education formula grants to SEAs, which are solely responsible for the operation and administration of the program; our state sub grants a portion of our MEP grant to LEAs, which help SEAs administer and opera te the program. At the state level our program administrator is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the administration of the program, including the state ID&R system. For the interstate coordination our state works very closely with the Texas Migr ant Interstate Program. During the summer and regular school year the State Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) and the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and skills (TAKS) are administered. Our test administrators provide the migrant students the opportunity to take the state assessment that allows students to meet the Texas requirements for grade advancement or graduation. During the regular school year, schools are encouraged to use the national database MSIX. Many of our schools that have migra nt students during the regular school year have access to MSIX. These schools do not receive Migrant Education funds. Our state offers (PASS) Portable Assisted Study Sequence, which is a national instructional program designed for secondary migrant childr en of migrant farm workers. The PASS program consists of self -contained, semi -independent -study courses designed to assist secondary -level students in earning academic credits. Each standards -based course is learner - centered and competency -based, thus all owing the student to progress through the curriculum and periodic tests at his or her own pace. Because of this structure, PASS can be offered in a variety of delivery models and/or locations. Across the nation PASS is being used to help students meet grad uation requirements, cope with scheduling difficulties, for skill -building or as supplemental support for traditional courses. 118 Our state is a member of the MiraCORE consortium. This consortium is committed to improving the interstate coordination of MEPs by sharing and developing supplemental, technology -based reading instructional materials and assessments designed specifically to improve the literacy skills of migratory students and youth. The goals of MiraCORE are: Improved literacy skills for migrant students and youth; The development of valid and reliable online diagnostic literacy assessments for all age levels of emergent and developing level readers that are mapped to the online Reading Tutorials; Increased capacity of MEP teachers and staff to identify migrant student/Out of School Youth literacy needs; Improved MEP staff skills for identifying/assessing student needs/skills; Scientifically -based literacy instruction, and effectively utilizing the online student reading tutorials and other lit eracy resources on the Migrant Literacy Net. For the intrastate coordination our state during the summer migrant program and regular school year offer busing for all migrant students so that the migratory children are able to participate in school. The students during the summer and regular school are provided free meals. During the summer migrant program the students work on improving their skills in reading, writing and mathematics along with science and art activities. These supplemental services duri ng the summer improve the educational services to the migrant children in our state. All supplemental programs and credit accrual that are, offered during the summer migrant program are, recorded on the migrant student's education. This information is ente red into MIS2000 and MSIX for all states to be able to view a student's education record. Counselors during the regular school year send all education and health records to the receiving schools once the students leave our state. They provide advance noti fication to other states of migrant students and families who are moving to ensure that education and support services are in place once the students arrive. North Dakota is an active member of the National Association of State Directors of Migrant Educat ion (NASDME). v. Describe the unique educational needs of the State's migratory children, including preschool migratory children and migratory children who have dropped out of school, and other needs that must be met in order for migratory children to partic ipate effectively in school, based on the State's most recent comprehensive needs assessment. The evaluation of the North Dakota migrant program was designed to be completed through the collection of and analysis of data using a wide variety of formative and summative strategies. Educational Research and Training of Colorado was the external evaluator. The following data collection instruments, sources and strategies were incorporated: 119 Fidelity of Implementation Survey - Completed by teachers and admini strators for all migrant districts. State assessment scores in language arts and math - These are required through the GPRA act for growth comparisons for all students. It is important to note that in North Dakota (as in most states) only a minority perce ntage of migrant students take the state test and even fewer take the state test two years in a row in order to facilitate growth comparisons. Teacher ratings of student proficiency in the North Dakota content standards in reading and math. These rating s are based on the same rubric score provided by the state assessment (4 = Advanced, 3 = Proficient, 2 = Basic, 1 = Below Basic). Student scores on the North Dakota English language proficiency assessment (WIDA). Administrator/Teacher Survey of Migrant Pro gram Effectiveness - Completed by teachers and administrators in all North Dakota migrant programs. Parent Evaluation Survey of program effectiveness - Completed by parents in all migrant programs. Student Evaluation Survey of program effectiveness - Compl eted by migrant students in all migrant programs. Pre-school needs were also assessed per requirement of OME. The North Dakota migrant program has had a long term partnership with the Tri Valley Head Start in Grafton to serve pre-school age migrant students in the summer program. Tri Valley Head Start, in conjunction with the state migrant program, collects needs data on all migrant preschool children. In 2016 there were 28 pre -school age migrant students in the program for which needs assessment data was collected. A wide variety of needs were collected for all of these children using the GOLD Teaching Strategies System. The following summarizes the academic needs identified by the assessment: Pre School Needs: Tri Valley Migrant Head Start D ata 2016 (N = 28) Area of Need Below Proficient Proficient Exceeding Identifies names of letters 32% 64% 4% Uses letter -sound 96% 0% The comprehensive needs assessment and the evaluation of the program is conducted in alternate years by (ERTC) Educational Research and Training Corporation who is based 120 Taos, New Mexico. Data is provided for the annual report by the educational officer based on the data that is provided through the consolidated state performance report (CSPR), the needs assessment survey, staff survey and parent survey that are collected by the schools during the summer education program . The Office of Migrant Education (OME) requires that all states have an updated comprehensive needs assessment (CNA) and a service delivery plan (SPD) as part of the program implementation process. ERTC helps our state with these two processes which are updated every other year. The CNA was completed for our state in September 2016 and the service delivery plan was revised in December 2016. This task is included in the contract with ERTC. The CNA/Service Delivery committee reviewed the data analysis and results for the needs assessment process and provides the following recommendations to local programs for service delivery: The recommendations below are now being fully implemented. These recommendations are allowing our migrant children to be able to p articipate effectively in school. Recommendation 1: Implement tutoring and small group instruction in reading and math for migrant students into summer programs. Recommendation 2: Utilize instructional materials specifically designed for migrant stude nts (e.g. materials from the Migrant Literacy NET including the lesson plans and online tutorials for students). Recommendation 3: Develop individual learning plans for all priority for service migrant students (e.g. the electronic Success Plans on the Migrant Literacy NET). Recommendation 4: Utilize bilingual and bicultural staff whenever possible for instruction. Recommendation 5: Target writing and reading comprehension instruction for all migrant students. Recommendation 6: Target number sense, ba sic operations as well as algebra, patterns and functions instruction for K -4 migrant students in math. Recommendation 7: Target algebra, patterns and functions and measurement for students in grade 5 -12 in math. Recommendation 8: Utilize the electronic graduation plans specifically designed for migrant on the Migrant Literacy NET to assist secondary migrant students to overcome barriers to graduation. Recommendation 9: Educate students on the importance of attendance in school and other key essentials f or success in school. This includes working with students who have dropped out of school. Recommendation 10: Provide transportation as needed and practicable to secondary level migrant students for the summer migrant program. Recommendation 11: Collabora te with Tri Valley Head Start to facilitate early childhood readiness for school and parent involvement. vi. Describe the current measurable program objectives and outcomes for Title I, Part C, and the strategies the SEA will pursue on a statewide basis to ac hieve such objectives and outcomes consistent with section 1304(b)(1)(D) of the ESEA . All local programs who apply for migrant funds for the summer migrant program must describe in the application how they plan to meet the performance targets and measurable 121 outcomes (MPOs). Districts may choose their own strategies such as (use of the Migrant Literacy NET tutorials and lessons, etc.) to address the performance targets and measurable program outcomes. The North Dakota Migrant Education Program Administrator keeps close contact with the migrant programs to discuss possibilities for cooperation and collaboration among the programs for the benefit of migrant students. In addition, the state migrant program has maintained a long partnership with Tr i Valley Head Start to meet the needs of pre -school migrant children. The North Dakota Service Delivery plan includes the measurable outcomes that the migrant education program will produce statewide through specific educational or educationally - related s ervices. The measurable outcomes below allows our Migrant Education program to determine whether and to what degree the program has met the special educational needs of migrant children that were identified through the comprehensive needs assessment. The measurable outcomes also help our state to achieve the State's performance targets. The following measurable program outcomes were developed based on the results and analysis of the North Dakota comprehensive needs assessment. Measurable Outcome #1 Read ing Comprehension: 70 percent of migrant students targeted for reading instruction in the summer program will demonstrate proficiency in specific reading comprehension skills based on teacher ratings and/or other assessments of student performance in rela tion to state content standards in reading in order to facilitate reading achievement and progress towards high school graduation. Measurable Outcome #2 Writing: 70 percent of migrant students targeted for writing instruction in the summer program will d emonstrate proficiency in specific writing process skills based on teacher ratings and/or other assessments of student performance in relation to state content standards in language arts in order to facilitate writing achievement and progress towards high school graduation. Measurable Outcome #3 Number Sense & Basic Operations in Math: 70 percent of migrant students targeted for math instruction in the summer program will demonstrate proficiency in number sense and basic operations based on teacher rating s and/or other assessments of student performance in relation to state content standards in math in order to facilitate math achievement and progress towards high school graduation. Measurable Outcome #4 Algebra, Patterns and Functions: 70 percent of mig rant students targeted for math instruction in the summer program will demonstrate proficiency in algebra, patterns and functions based on teacher ratings and/or other assessments of student performance in relation to state content standards in math in ord er to facilitate math achievement and progress towards high school graduation. Measurable Outcome #5 Overcoming Academic Barriers to Graduation: 70 percent of migrant students targeted for reading, math, and English language instruction in the summer program will demonstrate progress toward proficiency in reading, math and English language fluency based on teacher ratings and/or other assessments of student performance in order to facilitate progress towards high school graduation. 122 Measurable Outcome #6 School Attendance: Overall attendance during the summer program will increase by 10% for all migrant students from the previous year. Measurable Outcome #7 Transportation: Transportation will be provided to and from the summer migrant program for a min imum of 75% of all migrant students who need assistance to attend the program in rural areas. vii. Describe how the SEA will ensure there is consultation with parents of migratory children, including parent advisory councils , at both the State and local level, in the planning and operation of Title I, Part C programs that span not less than one school year in duration, consistent with section 1304(c)(3) of the ESEA . The effectiveness of the migrant program is assessed through school administrators, teacher, parent surveys, migrant needs assessment, EL Advisor Board and the PAC meetings. These surveys are used in making decisions that affect the overall program and identifies needs of the children. Our local school districts are require to implement programs , activities and procedures for the involvement of parents. This involvement must include, but is not limited to, parents input into the planning, design, and implementation of the migrant programs. Each summer our migrant centers hold two parent involv ement meetings during their seven week migrant program. At these meetings the local parent advisory council elects officers which consists of one migrant parent elected as the parent advisor and one parent as the alternate. A newsletter is sent out durin g the first weeks of migrant school informing the parents of the PAC meeting dates, times, and locations. All updates regarding the programs will be noted in newsletters throughout the duration of the program. All correspondence with the migrant families are done in English and Spanish. Parents are encouraged to visit the school, or call with comments and concerns. Open discussion is part of every parent meeting. viii. Describe the SEA's priorities for use of Title I, Part C funds, specifically related to the needs of migratory children with \"priority for services\" under section 1304(d) of the ESEA , including: 1. The measures and sources of data the SEA, and if applicable, it s local operating agencies, which may include LEA s, will use to identify those migratory children who are a priority for services ; and 2. When and how the SEA will communicate those determinations to all local operating agencies, which may include LEAs, in the State. The state has determined that the following indicato rs shall be used to ensure that the migrant children who meet the definition \"priority for services\" are given priority for Title I, Part C services: scored a Level 1 or Level 2 on the (MAPS) Migrant Achievement & Performance System is an English Languag e Learner whose education has been interrupted during the regular school year. A critical piece of the Comprehensive Needs Assessment is to identify the needs of priority for service students. Priority for service students are those who have had their education interrupted in the past year and who are at risk academically. 123 All district summer migrant programs assign online tutorials lessons from the Migrant Literacy NET, as appropriate, to facilitate proficiency in reading particularly targeting comprehen sion, math and writing. The Migrant Literacy NET lessons target the priority for service migrant student's needs. North Dakota provides summer program services for migrant students only; there are no academic year programs receiving migrant funding. The s tate assessment is not administered during the summer. However, teachers were asked to rate student proficiency according to grade level across all North Dakota state content standards in math and Reading using the same 4 -point rubric incorporated into the state assessment (4=Advanced, 3=Proficient,2=Partially Proficient, 1=Novice). The district service providers will annually review and analyze the migrant student's Migrant Achievement & Performance System (MAPS) and state assessment information and use t his information as part of the Title I Migrant Education Program Annual Needs Assessment, Service Delivery Plan and Evaluation. C. Title I, Part D: Prevention and Intervention Programs for Children and Youth who are Neglected, Delinquent, or At -Risk i. Describe the SEA's plan for assisting in the transition of children and youth between correctional facilities and locally operated programs. Neglected, delinquent, and at -risk programs receiving Title I, Part D funds must demonstrate that a transition pro cess is in place for implementation when students lea ve correctional facilities and return to schools, districts, or other institutions as well as the transition from locally operated programs to correctional facilities . North Dakota collects i nformation regarding the bidirectional transition process to support the student's entry into the educational program at the facility or LEA through the Title I, Part D funding application. Applicants must describe how the funds will be utilized to provide support se rvices. These descriptions will also be used to address the effectiveness and progress of the applicant's program when evaluated. The Title I, Part D funding application for neglected, delinquent, and at -risk programs requires the programs , both at the f acility and LEA, to provide transitional activities including GED testing; personal, vocational, technical, and academic counseling; placement programs for post -secondary institutions; information and assistance with financial aid, counseling, job placemen t, placement procedures for existing students; facilitating arrangements and records and follow -up work with former students. The NDDPI has informed applicants about the requirement for an increased use of Title I, Part D funds to support transition progr ams through guidance, assurances, and the annual application process. The NDDPI will develop implementation timelines, as well as a plan to provide additional training and technical assistance to staff in LEAs and neglected and delinquent instit utions. 124 ii. Describe the program objectives and outcomes established by the State that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the program in improving the academic, career, and technical skills of children in the program, including the knowledge and skills needed to earn a regular high school diploma and make a successful transition to postsecondary education , career and technical education, or employment. Program Objectives The purpose of Title I, Part D is to support the operation of state facilities, correcti onal facilities, delinquent programs, neglected programs, or local educational agency programs that involve collaboration with locally operated correctional facilities - To carry out high quality education programs to prepare youth for secondary school completion, training, employment, or further education; To provide activities to facilitate the transition of such youth from the correctional programs to further education or facilitate employment; To provide comparable services to neglected children or institutional delinquent children and neglected and delinquent children in community day -school and long -term programs; To prevent at -risk youth from dropping out of school and to provide dropouts and children and youth returning from correctional faciliti es or institutions for neglected or delinquent youth, with a support system to ensure their continued education; and To provide transitional services in local schools for youth returning from correctional facilities and programs, which will further serve a t-risk youth. Program Outcomes The Office of Federal Title Programs administers the Title I, Part D program. The Office of Federal Title Programs utilizes a variety of elements to assess program effectiveness, including: Application: The NDDPI has develop ed an application to gather detailed information about the Title I, Part D programs within North Dakota. This application is required in order to receive Title I, Part D funding. The application contains assurances, narrative descriptive questions, and bud get information regarding the Title I, Part D program. Upon receipt at the NDDPI, applications are reviewed and scored based on a developed rubric document. Within the application for Title I, Part D funds, applicants must address several issues with narra tive descriptions. The answers to these questions will document the usage of funds for the Title I, Part D funds. These descriptions will also be used to address the effectiveness and progress of the applicant's program when evaluated. Applicants are notif ied if they receive funding from Title I, Part D funds. Reports: The NDDPI requires an end -of-year report from all state and local entities receiving Title I, Part D funds. It summarizes both budget and program effectiveness from the year. Monitoring: Thos e receiving Title I, Part D funds will be monitored on the required components to assure they are implementing correct policy with the funds. Test Scores: Program effectiveness will be based on student outcomes. State assessment scores from neglected and delinquent students will be gathered and analyzed. Students in these facilities will be held to the same high standards of quality that all students within North Dakota are held. 125 Accountability The state educational agency may reduce or terminate fundin g for projects under this subpart if a state or local educational agency does not show progress in reducing dropout rates for all students over a three -year period. The state educational agency will require correctional facilities or institutions for neglected or delinquent youth to demonstrate, after receiving assistance under this subpart for three years, to show that there has been an increase in the number of youth returning to school, obtaining a secondary school diploma (or its recognized equivalent ), and transitioning to postsecondary education, career and technical education , or obtaining employment after such youth are released. A program under this subpart that supplements the number of hours of instruction students receive from state or local sou rces shall be considered to comply with the supplement, not supplant requirements. Each state agency or local educational agency that conducts a program under this subpart shall evaluate the program by conducting a needs assessment for future program plann ing, disaggregating data on participation by gender, race, ethnicity, and age, to determine the program's impact. The results of the needs assessment are to be incorporated into the Title I, Part D application. D. Title III, Part A : Language Instruction for English Leaners and Immigrant Students . i. Describe the SEA 's standardized entrance and exit procedures for English learners consistent with section 3113(b)(2) of the ESEA . These procedures must include valid and reliable, objective criteria that are applied consistently across the State. A t a minimum, the standardized exit criteria must : 1. Include a score of proficient on the State's annual English language proficiency assessment; 2. Be the same criteria used for exiting students from the English learner subgroup for Title I reporting and accountability purposes; and 3. Not include performance on an academic content assessment . Entrance and Exit Criteria and Procedures North Dakota ha s established entrance and exit criteria and procedures by reviewing what was previously in place and revising it to meet the needs of all schools in the state. The review was completed by the English Language Program Advisory Committee (ELPAC) which is ma de up of LEA representatives from across the state, as well as other professionals related to English learner education . The entrance and exit criteria created and approved by the ELPAC was also recommended for approval by the Accountability and Standards Subcommittee and approved by the State ESSA Planning Committee. These two committees include professionals from across the state and represent a wide variety of agencies and LEAs. North Dakota has established entrance criteria and procedures as follows: A statewide Home Language Survey (HLS) is required. The statewide HLS form is Appendix Q. The first page of the survey includes the required elements. The second page contains items the schools will be encouraged to use. The districts also have the option t o add items or addenda as they wish beyond the required elements . 126 Districts must conduct a screener assessment if another language is present unless there is overwhelming evidence of academic success at the time of registration. The required screener options are the WIDA Screener (online or paper) grades 1 -12 or WIDA MODEL K -12 The statewide entrance scores are consistent with the exit criteria. Students must receive 3.5 proficiency level for each domain and 5.0 composite proficiency level to be consid ered proficient . The WIDA Screener only reports domains in integer values (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0). Therefore, a student receiving a 3.0 in any one domain would qualify for the program. If a student received a 4.0 in each domain, they would not qualify. The composite scores are reported in 0.5 increments (4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0). Districts may allow teacher referral for students who were not screened due to the information on the home language survey. (Appendix Q) The referral may be investigated by EL staff to determine whether the Home Language Survey is correct or needs to be revised by the parents . All potential EL students will be assessed for admission to the EL program within 30 days of enrollment to any school. North Dakota has establishe d exit criteria and procedures as follows: Districts must use the annual ELP assessment (currently ACCESS 2.0) proficiency level scores to approve exit of the EL Program. Cut scores are the same as the entrance criteria with a 3.5 in each domain and a 5.0 required for the composite proficiency level. The composite score is made up of 35% reading, 35% writing, 15% listening, and 15% speaking proficiency levels. For students who are never in attendance during the annual ELP testing window, the full screener ( MODEL) may be used to exit a student. Districts may approve to exit a student with disabilities if the EL team and IEP team (as applicable) including parents or guardians determine the student has plateaued in their growth and the evidence including EL and IEP team documentation shows the student would not further benefit from additional English Language Development instruction, but rather other services as appropriate. E. Title IV, Part B: 21st Century Community Learning Centers . i. Describe how the SEA will us e its Title IV, Part B, and other Federal funds to support State -level strategies that are consistent with the strategies identified in 6.1.A above . First, the State would like to make clear that tracking of all 21st CCLC funds are done separately, and not combined with other federal programs. The SEA's 21st CCLC staff tracks all time on a time tracking mechanism to make sure that all time spent on various federal programs are done accurately with no cross over. Three staff are allocated out of 21st CCLC funds: the SEA's 21st CCLC state director, the fiscal administrator and one support staff employee. 127 The state director will: Make site visits; conduct monitoring reviews; Risk-assessment reviews; Conduct director meetings; conduct monthly Adobe Connect meetings; Assist in research and development of 21st CCLC programs; Disseminate pertinent information and best practices regarding program; Attend trainings and workshops; and conduct trainings and other workshops for stakeholders in the state; and Oversee the new evaluation process that focuses on a continuous improvement model. Specifically relating to the strategies outlined in 6.1A abov e, the 21st CCLC program will correlate in the following manner: 1. Great -Teacher/Leaders North Dakota's 21st CCLC programs must create a relationship with stakeholders in the communities they provide services. This relationship directly extends to principal s and teachers. Program directors and site coordinators must have frequent communication with principals and teachers to provide appropriate programing to children and to align curriculum. This bridge promotes collaboration among stakeholders in schools an d facilitates transparency. This transparency enables principals, teachers, program directors and site coordinators to improve their practice based on feedback, communication and student data discussions. Activities that promote collaboration is the year ly self -assessment process, APR and Youth Services data entry, and frequent collaboration on lesson planning and implementation. 2. Continuous Improvement North Dakota 21st CCLC programing helps in the continuous improvement process by providing children be low, at and above the poverty line access to quality out -of-school programing. This programing provides students a safe, nurturing environment and an education anchored in a STEAM curriculum. North Dakota 21st CCLC programs also requires a thorough needs assessment to address and find issues programs might have and improve them. In addition, the program dictates a strong and positive working environment with teachers, principals and parents. This transparency enables growth and improvement within the progr am and schools. Additionally, all ND 21st CCLC programs are reviewed by a certified evaluator. A new Evaluator RFP has been produced and currently under bid. The RFP outlines that the new Evaluator use an evaluation based on continuous improvement. This evaluation must help sub-grantees identify strengths and weaknesses, and use findings to improve their 21st 128 CCLC program, and attain GPRA measures. The SEA will monitor the Evaluator, the evaluation process and outcomes. The State director will work with s ub-grantees to provide technical assistance to implement new strategies to help them improve and to correct any findings found in the evaluation. 3. Equity North Dakota 21st CCLC programs prioritize that children living at or below the poverty line have acc ess to services. In addition, a school in which not less than 40 percent of the children are from low -income families is eligible for \"school -wide\" status. This means, if a school is deemed \"school -wide\" all students in the school may participate in the program. However, programs may have a sliding payment scale for children to participate, nevertheless, 21st CCLC programs prohibit the refusal of children from participating in the program based on socio -economic status and ability to pay. Research has prove n that this at -risk population is most in need of out -of-regular -school -hours programing. North Dakota 21st CCLC programs do this by providing an equitable and stable education; environment that promotes children's academic success. Funds for 21st CCLC pro grams will be distributed equitably via a state formula based on amount of dollars allocated by the Federal Government and the number of 30 day regular attendees. Last year's allocation per student was $1,135 per student. In addition, no program will be allocated funds of less than $50,000 dollars per year as long as they meet a minimum threshold of participating students. 4. Local Control Opportunities The NDDPI encourages all eligible entities to apply for 21st CCLC grants. The NDDPI publishes RFP's public ally and all applications are peer reviewed by non -objective reviewers and selected via the competitive RFP process. The NDDPI provides information and resources to all applicants such as bidders' workshops, technical assistance for applicants and other we b-based trainings such as webinars. However, we do not force programs or ideas upon local communities. These decisions are strictly up to the stakeholders in the community. For LEA's to be eligible, they must meet certain criteria. For example, the LEA must provide proof they provide safe and healthy learning environments, how they provide transportation to and from sites if applicable, and how they will communicate informati on with the community. 5. ECE The State of North Dakota is making a concerted effort to provide more enriching Early Child Education opportunities to our youngest children. The professional expertise and current data indicates the strong need to begin addre ssing how to engage school -age after school programs for pre -kindergarten -aged children. This includes collaboration with the NDDPI's 21st CCLC program, ND Bright and Early, Head Start, school districts, special education units, and the State legislature. We are making tremendous headway in the 129 latter, for example the ND State Legislature voted to provide preschool grants to low income families during the last session. On the State level 21st CCLC State Director is working closely with the NDDPI's Office of Early Learning to explore how to implement a quality improvement system for out -of- school -time care for North Dakota young children. The NDDPI is engaged with early care and education state agencies and experts from the National Center on Afterschool and Summer Enrichment (NCASE) to identify our potential levels of change on the Center's core quality elements. The primary focus of the NCASE work group is to form a peer learning community involving all early care and education stakeholders. Below is fu rther clarification from NCASE: The goals for this community are to identify and share promising practices for quality improvement and Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) that include school -age programs, including defining and measuring program quality with standards and assessments. This PLC will use an implementation science framework, with a focus on stages and continuous quality improvement using materials that support the framework. This PLC addresses the \"Support Continuous Quality Improve ment\" Office of Child Care Priority. (NCASE, 2016, p. 1). There will be no mandate that sub -grantees work with ECE organizations; however, the State strongly recommends they do so. 6. NMSI Laying the Foundation Professional Development Program for Targeted and Comprehensive Support Schools The NDDPI will be exercising flexibility in the state's Transfer authority (Title V Part A \u00a75101). The NDDPI will annually transfer 1% of state administrative funds from Title IV, Part B 21st Century Community Learning Cen ters to Title II, Part A Preparing, Training, and Recruiting, High -Quality Teachers, Principals, or Other School Leaders. These transferred funds will be dispersed to schools with targeted support or compressive support designations. The School Support Pr ofessional Development Grants will enable schools identified for targeted and comprehensive support to obtain access to and participate fully in high quality professional development. The NDDPI believes supporting professional development of high quality w ill assist these schools in meeting their goals and improving academic performance. It is recognized funds that transfer toward Title II Part A will be subject to the rules and requirements of the Title II Part A program. 130 ii. Describe the SEA's processes, procedures, and priorities used to award subgrants consistent with the strategies identified above in 6.1.A. above and to the extent permitted under applicable law and regulations. Overview Every three to five years North Dakota holds a Request for Propos al (RFP) grant competition for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC) program. Eligible entities can apply individually or as a consortium to receive federal funding for afterschool programming. Eligible entities that form consortiums will receive competitive priority points on their 21st CCLC grant application. The RFP award application will be developed in consultation with the Governor and other state agencies responsible for administering youth development programs. Processes Communicat ion to Public. The NDDPI makes a concerted effort to communicate the 21st CCLC program, its benefits, and application process when funds are made available. This communication comes in the form of press releases, posting to the NDDIP website, and emailing all superintendents in the State, this includes both public and private schools. Private School Communication . Regarding, private schools, the NDDPI mandates that REAs and other sub -grantees enter into a Consortium agreement. This Consortium agreement requires sub -grantees to openly communicate and invite private schools into the agreement. More on the Consortium below. The Consortium. A consortium is a group of local education agencies (LEA) and community based organizations (CBO) that apply as one enti ty for a North Dakota 21st CCLC grant. Each LEA and CBO must enter into a consortium agreement. There are numerous parts and steps required in the consortium agreement. Consortium Agreement: 1. The consortium must identify which LEA or CBO will be the sub -grantee. The sub - grantee receives the grant and is also the grant administrator. In situations where the grant administrator and fiscal agent are different, the consortium must submit a document stating how the 5% administrative set -aside will be split. 2. A fiscal agent must be identified for the consortium. The fiscal agent must be able to reimburse the members of the consortium and operate normally while waiting for reimbursement from the state. Reimbursement is usually two -three weeks after the state receiv es the request for funds. To verify this, the fiscal agent will need to submit a cash flow statement from their general fund. 3. Each LEA and/or CBO must submit a letter to the sub -grantee stating they want to be a part of the consortium. The letter must als o state they are approving the consortium to apply for the grant on their behalf. 131 4. A consortium agreement is for the life of the 21st CCLC grant. Ex. If the grant is a three -year grant, each member of the consortium will remain a part of the 21st CCLC gra nt for a three -year period until the grant ends and as long as they are in good standing in regard to 21st CCLC guidance and regulations. Additional Application Guidelines Partnerships . All applicants must outline their partnerships -and quality of partners -during the application process. Applicants must include a list of all community partners, the services provided by the partners, and partner verification of involvement in the 21st CCLC program. The application requires sub -grantees to create a needs -assessment, which outlines how the program will work with the community to fill a gap of services. The applicant must be willing to collaboratively work with community, non and for profit organizations and faith -based organizations. Family Involve ment . Applicants must provide how they will meet the needs of families. This include a concerted effort to reach out to families, how they reached out to families create the application and used their input to implement the program. The Fiscal Agent. The LEA that is selected to be the fiscal agent must identify the authorized representative for the 21st CCLC grant. The fiscal agent will identify the authorized representative by submitting their board minutes stating who has been approved to be the authori zed representative. The signature of the authorized representative is required on all 21st CCLC documents. Monetary Requirements The 21st CCLC grant operates on a reimbursement basis. This requires the fiscal agent to be able to disburse funds ranging bet ween $25,000 - $120,000 for program expenses from their general fund and operate normally until reimbursement from the state is received. The amount of expenses for each 21st CCLC fiscal agent depends on the size of the program. Reporting Requirements The fiscal agent, in collaboration with each program director, is required to submit a number of reports. Each report is required to be submitted in a timely fashion. Below you will see a list of these reports along with a description and due date. Request f or Funds (SFN 14660) - 15th of each month This is the report used to request reimbursement for expenses paid by the fiscal agent. The authorized representative and program director need to communicate to make sure the expenditures are correct and allowable. 132 Monthly Excel Spreadsheet -15th of each month The excel spreadsheet tracks monthly expenditures for each line item of the grantee's approved budget. The authorized representative and program director need to communicate to make sure expenditures are cor rect as well as identify any data entry errors. Grant Revision Request ( SFN 9035 )- Anytime during the grant period Grant revisions also known as budget revisions are used to move fund ing from one -line item to another. The program director will contact the authorized representative if there is a need for a grant revision. Mid-Year/Final Financial Report ( SFN 7822 ) This report is required to close out the grant period. It summarizes expense payouts by the fiscal agent and reimbursements sent by the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction (NDDPI). The authorized representative and program director will communicate to make sure all amounts are correct. Continuing Application Each 21st CCLC program is required to submit a continuing application each year to remain a 21st CCLC grantee. This application requires the signature of the authorized representative in three sections: The application - one page narrative that includes what projects sub -grantees are working on, goals of the program, and progress on these goals; and other interesting facts of the program. The general assurances - assurances include agre ement to comply all federal laws and regulations, transportation of students, health and safety of the environments, the grantees willingness to collaborate with other entities and use of funds, the grantees agreement to supplement not supplant federal fun ds. The budget The authorized representative and program director will work together to complete the above sections of the continuing application. Role of the Grant Administrator Hiring The grant administrator has all hiring authority for the 21st CCLC program. The administrator can decide what the best practice will be for hiring for their consortium. They can leave it up to the individual LEAs and CBOs to hire for their sites or the grant administrator can hire the program staff. Monitoring The grant administrator is responsible for monitoring each site to ensure they are in compliance with their grant application, meeting principles of effectiveness, using funds on 133 allowable expenditures, monitoring progress toward application goals, and complying wi th all signed assurances. Monitoring the sites of a consortium is not limited to an on -site monitoring visit. The purpose of monitoring is to ensure there is ongoing communication between the program administrator and all sites that are a part of the conso rtium year round. This was an area of concern when the North Dakota 21st CCLC state office was monitored by the U.S. Department of Education (USDE). It was made clear that monitoring is not limited to on -site visits, but must include multiple monitoring ac tivities. There are a number of monitoring activities; below are some examples. It needs to be noted that any monitoring activity must have documentation to validate it occurred. Examples of Monitoring Activities: Annual on -site monitoring visits (Requi red) Quarterly desktop monitoring calls Fiscal spreadsheets Monthly conference calls with staff Technical assistant calls and publications Communication of statewide evaluation to personnel The grant administrator will be held accountable for monitoring all of the schools that are part of the 21st CCLC consortium through all the various methods described. Reporting Requirements Quarterly Project Narrative Report ( SFN 9013 ) Program di rectors are responsible for completing and submitting quarterly reports. These reports will summarize what has been taking place in their program over the months being reported on. Continuing Application The program director will need to submit an annual continuing application. Posting of Annual Evaluation The program administrator is responsible for posting the results of the annual program evaluation on their website as well as notifying the public of the results. Accountability Since the grant admin istrator is the LEA or CBO that is the sub -grantee, they are accountable for making sure all sites are in compliance with the grant. The grant administrator must also be in compliance with the grant. The grant administrator must have all documents listed o n the state monitoring tool on file. Priorities The priority of 21st CCLC program is provide a safe, nurturing and educational out -of-school - time environment to students in North Dakota. Schools in which 40% or more of the students 134 are on free or reduced lunch will receive a priority for programing. Below are priorities in further detail. Eligible applicants may include Local Educational Agencies (LEAs) and/or CBO. These may include faith based organizations, institutions of higher education, city or co unty government agencies, for -profit corporations and other public or private entities, or a consortium of two or more of such agencies, organizations, or entities. State will give priority to regions of the state not currently being served. There are th ree types of priorities for this competition: absolute, invitational, and competitive. The absolute priority is a strict requirement for each application, while the invitational priority is strongly encouraged, but not strictly required. Applications that address the competitive priority receive preference points. Each priority for this competition is discussed below. Absolute Priority The State will fund only those applications that: 1. Serve schools that meet the threshold poverty requirement of 40% free and reduced lunch or are operating as Title I school -wide program. 2. Offer activities that provide expanded learning opportunities for eligible children and youth in the community. 3. In the case of extension of the \"school -wide\" definition, meaning sch ools that have less than 40% free and reduced lunch and are deemed \"school -wide.\" Sub -grantees shall create a scoring system that fully utilizes granted funds from the state, and distributes and prioritizes funds to the neediest of the neediest schools wit hout hurting services. Invitational Priority The state strongly encourages applications for projects that will meet the three criteria set out below; however, an application that meets these invitational priorities does not receive competitive or absolut e preference over other applications: 1. Serve student populations that are at -risk, including students from high poverty areas; students with limited English proficiency; and students who, due to other considerations, are recognized as not achieving at the level of other students. 2. Promote parental involvement through program implementation. 3. Serve students attending high -need rural and urban communities that have low achieving students and high rates of juvenile crime, school violence, and student drug ab use, but lack the resources to establish after school centers. Competitive Priority The S tate may select an application that meets these competitive preferences over an application of equivalent merit. Preference will be given to applications that: 1. Are jointly submitted by a consortium of eligible entities. 135 2. Will serve students and the families of those students who attend schools that have been identified as Title I program improvement and Targeted Support schools. 3. Provide services to students at tending highly rural LEAs. Use of Set -Aside Funding The S tate will utilize the 7% set -aside granted under ESSA. Two percent (2%) will be allocated for administrative costs. Administrative costs include but are not limited to: Sec. 4202. (2)(c)(B) \"establishing and implementing a rigorous peer review process for subgrant applications described in section4204(b) (including consultation with the Governor and other State agencies responsible for administering youth development programs and adult learni ng activities); ''(C) awarding of funds to eligible entities (in consultation with the Governor and other State agencies responsible for administering youth development programs and adult learning activities).\" The SEA budget and track expenditures that q ualify under the 2% maximum to cover the allowable costs. Five percent (5%) of set -aside funds will be used for Technical Assistance and State Activities as designated under ESSA: Sec. 4202. (3) STATE ACTIVITIES. \u2014A State educational agency may use not mo re than 5 percent of the amount made available to the State under subsection (b) for the following activities: (A) Monitoring and evaluating programs and activities assisted under this part. Including: Academic activities, arts and music activities, entrepren eurial education, tutoring, programs for EL students, recreational activities, STEM activities, telecommunication activities, programs that promote parental involvement, etc. In addition, monitoring of non -academic activities such as safe environments, inf ormation dissemination, and travel for students. Sub-grantees will be monitored using data as well. This includes imputing of APR data, and the sub -grantees use of data and best practices to make insightful and proper decisions regarding programing. Sub-grantees will be monitored on their collaboration with private and public schools their students attend. Sub-grantees will be monitored on implantation research and best practices and implementation of performance measures. (B) Providing capacity building, training, and technical assistance under this part. 136 (C) Conducting a comprehensive evaluation (directly, or through a grant or contract) of the effectiveness of programs and activities assisted under this part. The SEA will formally communicate these evaluati ons, recommendations and corrective actions. (D) Providing training and technical assistance to eligible entities that are applicants for or recipients of awards under this part. (E) Ensuring that any eligible entity that receives an award under this part from the State aligns the activities provided by the program with the challenging State academic standards. (F) Ensuring that any such eligible entity identifies and partners with extern al organizations, if available, in the community. (G) Working with teachers, principals, parents, the local workforce, the local community, and other stakeholders to review and improve State policies and practices to support the implementation of effective pro grams under this part. (H) Coordinating funds received under this part with other Federal and State funds to implement high -quality programs. This includes transfer of 21st CCLC funds to Title II to work Department of Public Instruction state level initiative s and projects: E.g., Consolidated Applications, training of staff and LEA's, administration, professional development and other allowable activities under Title II. (I) Providing a list of prescreened external organizations, as described under section 4203(a )(11). Audit and Fiscal Policy Regarding audits and fiscal policy, the State Auditor's Office audits the SEA every three to five years to ensure fiscal integrity. The audit ensures that fiscal records are maintained for at least five years then shredded. After the audit the Auditors Office will meet the SEA and review the findings. If there is a Formal finding, the SEA will take immediate corrective action. At the sub -grantee level, the SEA will financially audit them during their yearly review. The state is currently working on the new RFP that will align with ESSA will be completed in the upcoming months. F. Title V, Part B, Subpart 2 : Rural and Low -Income School Program . i. Provide the SEA 's specific measurable program objectives and outcomes r elated to activities under the Rural and Low -Income School P rogram , if applicable . Historically, North Dakota has only had one to two LEAs eligible under the Rural and Low - Income School (RLIS) formula in a given year. LEAs receiving RLIS funds will be encouraged t o use these funds in partnership with other federal and state funding. LEAs will be required to use funds available from the RLIS Program to support evidence - based strategies which will be driven by each LEAs Comprehensive Needs Assessment. When applying for the RLIS funds, eligible LEAs will need to: 137 Describe each activity they plan to undertake with the Rural and Low -Income Schools funds (be specific). Indicate for each activity 1) the amount needed; 2) the goal the activity addresses (Goal 1, 3, or 4 from the RFP); and 3) the ID code (see the ID numbers from the Allowable Uses of Funds section of the RFP). Describe how the plan will increase student achievement. Also, describe how the Rural and Low -Income School plan aligns and coordinates with feder al Title programs indicated on the 2016 -2017 Consolidated Application for federal Title funding that was submitted to NDDPI. LEAs participating in the RLIS program will be supported and provided with technical assistance, as there are unique needs that ru ral school districts face because the y frequently lack adequate personnel and resources. North Dakota provides regional technical assistance and trainings to all districts to support them in the completion of their consolidated application and through work shops each spring to provide federal updates and guidance. This process provides one -on-one assistance per district requests to address any questions, and troubleshoot any concerns. The NDDPI, Division of Student Support & Innovation, assigns all schools a contact person for technical assistance and support throughout the year. NDDPI staff will be responsible for reviewing all reports for the schools under their purview, in coordination with the SEA grant application review process. This ongoing, multi -tiered, detailed review process ensures the grantee is on the right track during school and when closing out at the end of the program year. The liaisons keep in close contact with their assigned schools by gathering information, answering questions on issues , acting as a guidance coach, and tracking a school's needs and efforts in a very comprehensive manner. Technical assistance and support is also provided by the NDDPI through a combination of face-to-face (conferences, workshops, meetings) and virtual opp ortunities (webinars, online courses, phone conferences). Additionally, support and assistance is provided in collaboration with our partners; such as the Regional Education Associations and statewide universities. G. McKinney -Vento Act. i. Consistent with section 722(g)(1)(B) of the McKinney -Vento Act , describe the procedures the SEA will use to i dentify homeless children and youths in the State and assess their needs . Identification of students experiencing homelessness is the primary responsibility of Local Educational Agencies (LEAs). The State Education Agency (SEA) provides extensive professional development in addition to technical assistance to LEAs in order to as sist with the proper identification of students experiencing homelessness. Process All districts are required to provide a housing questionnaire to students at the beginning of each school year including new students entering the district. This questionnaire is the first step in identifying students experiencing homelessness. If the questionnaire denotes that a student may be experiencing homelessness, the student is promptly referred to the McKinney Vento liaison. Professional development will be provided on the prompt resolution of disputes and districts will be requested to implement a timeline to ensure prompt resolution of 138 disputes. The state will also implement a time line to ensure prompt resolution. The liaison than conducts a strengths/ needs assessment to determine and prioritize the needs wi th the guardian and student or unaccompanied minor in order to determine if they meet the definition of experiencing homelessness as well as to determine the prioritized needs. If the student meets the definition as experiencing homelessness, they are entered into the data collection systems; STARS and PowerSchool. Professional Development The SEA provides regular professional development to liaisons and administrators on the identification of stu dents experiencing homelessness. The professional development provided includes various critical elements related to the identification of students experiencing homelessness Necessary elements to include on housing questionnaire Internal process on how t o sensitively and properly identify students experiencing homelessness Assisting liaisons on conducting professional development for staff on identifying students that may be experiencing homelessness Assisting liaisons on conducting professional developme nt for staff who are involved in administrating the housing questionnaire How to conduct a strengths and needs assessment with families and students experiencing homelessness Collection of data Posting of educational rights of students experiencing homel essness Partnering with community to better identify students who are experiencing homelessness The above includes only some of the topics which are covered by the professional development provided by the SEA to assist and support districts in the proper identification of students experiencing homelessness. The professional development provided is both face -to-face as well as a series of on -going webinars. Liaisons and administrators are alerted to professional development opportunities through memos and newsletters. Webinars which are provided are recorded and posted to the NDDPI website for reference and review. E -mails are sent to liaisons and administrators which include the PowerPoint , webinar link along with supporting documentation for the present ation. Technical Assistance The SEA provides on -going technical assistance to the field. The SEA encourages liaisons, administrators, and other staff through webinars, memos, and newsletters to contact the NDDPI directly with any specific issues. A go od deal of the SEA's time is focused on answering calls from the field to provide technical assistance in specific situations inclusive of identification of students experiencing homelessness. The SEA also provides memos on specific issues to provide more clarification to the field. This occurs on a regular basis. Resources The SEA provides and highlights various resources to assist liaisons in properly identifying students experiencing homelessness. Resources that are provided include, but are not limi ted, to the following; Notification of NCHE resources 139 Newsletter created and dispersed to liaisons, administrators and other key stake holders Sample housing questionnaire Sample strengths and needs assessment document Website providing resources and information on identification of students experiencing homelessness Monitoring The SEA monitors districts on a regular basis. The sites monitor in collaboration with sites monitored under Federal Title I provisions, sites allocated grant awards and those which are target monitored based on risk factors. The monitoring process imple mented by the SEA is transparent. The monitoring template is on the NDDPI website and professional development is provided on monitoring. There are several monitoring elements related to the proper identification of students experiencing homelessness. The SEA also requires liaisons to attend at least three webinars per year. This is tracked by the SEA. The liaisons are also required to attend one face to face meeting. This is also tracked by the SEA. Assessment of Data Elements/Data Collection The SEA analyzes various forms of data to determine if LEA's are correctly capturing/identifying students experiencing homelessness. One example of how the SEA assesses this is through yearly comparative analysis of district identification of students experie ncing homelessness. The SEA monitors the numbers of identified students experiencing homelessness over numerous school years. If there is a significant increase or decrease the SEA contacts the district to determine the reason for the increase/decrease i n students identified as experiencing homelessness. The SEA also tracks calls from districts inquiring about the identification of students experiencing homelessness and specific situations. This documentation is reviewed and compared to the district num bers. If there is a district where there is no identification of students experiencing homelessness is noted, but a call was issued from the particular district the SEA follows up in regard to this situation. The SEA works internally with entities to enhance and improve the data collection process in order to ensure that it collects the necessary data required. Currently, two systems capture the identification of students experiencing homelessness; STARS and Power School. ii. Describe the SEA's p rograms for school personnel (including liaisons designated under section 722(g)(1)(J)(ii) of the McKinney -Vento Act, principals and other school leaders, attendance officers, teachers, enrollment personnel, and specialized instructional support personnel) to heig hten the awareness of such school personnel of the specific needs of homeless children and youths, including such children and youths who are runaway and homeless youths. Process The primary responsibility of providing professional development to educato rs, staff, administration, and community members is that of the LEA and McKinney -Vento liaison. Liaisons are required to provide professional development to educators, staff, administration and community members. The specific professional development is left up to the district liaisons and the specific needs of the district. Liaisons are encouraged to provide professional development that address the specific needs of their particular district. Not all districts have 140 the same needs, thus, professional d evelopment needs to be culturally sensitive to the climate of each district. Professional Development The SEA provides regular professional development to liaisons and administrators on the identification of students experiencing homelessness. The professional development provided includes various critical elements related; Dispute and prompt resolution Unaccompanied youth ; inclusive of homeless and runaway youth Fees, fines and absences relate d to the experience of homeless ness Extracurricular act ivities and students experiencing homelessness Enrollment procedures and protocols Barriers of students experiencing homelessness Title I and students experiencing homelessness Comparable access to summer school, online learning, Advance Placement courses and all other academic supports and resources Comparable services In order to facilitate LEA identification of youth who are runaway and homeless youth, the NDDPI will provide training and technical assistance to both new and veteran liaisons through the development of valuable training tools, resources, guidance, and a series of recorded webinars. These items are focused on the liaison's role in identifying homeless and runaway homeless youth, sample forms for registration, dispute resolution policy and templates, questionnaires, needs assessment forms, liaison job descriptions, data entry and tracking, and other district resources. Additional trainings may be added based on input from the field and the liaisons. Guidance, resources, and trainings will be available in the NDDPI website. Each year surveys are sent out to liaisons and to administrators listing a variety of topics for webinars. Liaisons and administrators are asked to rank in order of importance and also offer other topics that they would l ike to have addressed. Based on this feedback a webinar schedule is determined. All webinars are recorded and posted to website as well as sent out to liaisons. This ensures the SEA is not only ensuring liaisons and administrators are educated on McKinn ey Vento regulations but also provides an understanding as to the needs in the field. Technical Assistance The SEA provides on -going technical assistance to the field. The SEA encourages liaisons, administrators and other staff through webinars, memos a nd newsletters to contact NDDPI directly with any specific issues. A good deal of the SEA's time is focused on answering calls from the field to provide technical assistance in specific situations inclusive of identification of students experiencing homel essness. The SEA also provides memos on specific issues to provide more clarification to the field. This occurs on a regular basis. Resources The SEA provides and highlights various resources to assist liaisons in properly identifying students experiencing homelessness. Resources that are provided, include, but are not limited, to the following: 141 PowerPoints which can be adapted for liaisons to utilize to provide professional development to educators, staff and community partners on various issu es relating to homelessness Notification of NACHE resources and webinars Website providing resources and information on identification of students experiencing homelessness Newsletter created and dispersed to liaisons, administrators as well as other key s take holders Various guidance is provided to staff (inclusive of Guidance for Enrolling Homeless Unaccompanied Youth) Monitoring The SEA has a self -monitoring tool which is displayed on the NDDPI website and professional development is provided on the to ol. This tool provides liaisons and administration information as to the necessary actions to implement in order to meet McKinney Vento. One of the components in the tool addresses the necessity to provide professional development to educational staff, a dministrators and community members. The SEA also requires liaisons to attend at least three webinars per year. This is tracked by the SEA. The liaisons are also required to attend one face to face meeting. This is also tracked by the SEA. Monitoring is completed yearly in three tiers; monitoring collaborative with federal title I, monitoring of McKinney Vento sites and monitoring based on risk analysis. Data Elements The SEA requires that liaisons attend at least three webinars a year. The liaiso ns can determine what webinars they attend as each district has unique needs. The SEA tracks the attendance at the webinars and reaches out to those liaisons and districts who do not comply with the determined professional development . iii. Describe the SEA's procedures to ensure that disputes regarding the educational placement of homeless children and youths are promptly resolved. Process The dispute resolution process for LEA's is as follows; If there is a dispute, the liaison notifies the state homeless coordinator regarding the dispute. The state homeless coordinator documents the cause of the dispute The state homeless coordinator contacts the LEA enrollment contact to discuss the issue and explain the contact will be followed with a letter detailing th e requirements of the McKinney -Vento Homeless Education Assistance Act. The LEA will be informed the school must immediately contact the last school the student attended to obtain relevant academic and other records and the student must immediately be admi tted to the school in which he/she is seeking enrollment, while the dispute is being resolved. The State Homeless Coordinator sets up a meeting with the following individuals \u2014 the LEA enrollment representative, the LEA liaison, parents of the student, home less service providers, and the state homeless coordinator to resolve the issue in a calm, respectful manner. 142 If the school does not comply with the Act, the case will be referred to the NDDPI Superintendent. If a resolution cannot be reached between the c omplainant and the school district, the dispute may be appealed to the United States Department of Education. The SEA will share the dispute policy and procedure with members of the State Homeless Coalition to gather their input and recommendations. The po licy and procedures will also be shared at a meeting with McKinney -Vento Act grantees. After changes are made based on these recommendations, the dispute policy and procedures will be published on the Education of Homeless Children and Youth website at www.dpi.state.nd.us/title1/homeless/index.shtm and included in a mailing. All North Dakota schools have been informed of the policy and procedures for the resolution of disputes. Professio nal Development The more knowledgeable liaisons and school staff are about the law and skilled in working with families and students experiencing homelessness, the less likely errors or misunderstanding will arise and become contentious enough to require f ormal dispute processes at the local and state levels. Thus, the SEA provides on -going professional development and technical assistance to liaisons in order to assist them in carrying out their roles within their district . The SEA will implement a compone nt in the professional development on the prompt resolution of disputes. Districts will be asked to ensure a timeline once a dispute has been received. As stated previously, the SEA provides various opportunities to educate and inform liaisons and adminis trators on the rights of students experiencing homelessness, best practices, policies and procedures that assist students experiencing homelessness to meet high academic standards and participate to the full extent in extracurricular activities. The follo wing professional development is provided to liaisons and administrators addressing issues related to dispute resolution: Prompt resolution of disputes McKinney -Vento Law Dispute resolution process Identification of students experiencing homelessness Students rights in relation to extracurricular services Comparable services Educational placement Technical Assistance The SEA provides on -going technical assistance to the field. The SEA encourages liaisons, administrators and other staff through webinars, memos, and newsletters to contact NDDPI directly with any specific issues. A good deal of the SEA's time is focused on answering calls from the field to provide technical assistance in specific situations inclusive of identification of students experienci ng homelessness. The SEA also provides memos on specific issues to provide more clarification to the field. This occurs on a regular basis. 143 Resources The SEA provides and highlights various resources to assist liaisons in properly identifying student s experiencing homelessness. Resources that are provided include, but are not limited, to the following: Notification of NACHE resources and webinars Website providing resources and information on dispute resolution Newsletter created and dispersed to lia isons, administrators and other key stake holders, Template of sample dispute resolution documentation Template of dispute resolution policy for districts Monitoring The SEA has a self -monitoring tool which is displayed on the NDDPI website and professio nal development is provided on the tool.

A description of how h omeless youth will receive assistance from counselors to advise such youths, and prepare and improve the readiness of such youths for college . North Dakota's support for students spans from early childh ood educational settings through elementary school, middle school, high school and transitions into partnerships for college and career readiness. Supported through a long tradition of local control, the continuum of education in North Dakota is primarily determined at the LEA level. The NDDPI has 148 established frameworks and processes to provide support to LEAs through this PreK -12 experience as well as preparing students to be choice ready upon graduation. Process All districts are required through North D akota Century Code 15.1 -06-19, to provide a school counselor for grades 7 -12, at the ratio of one full time equivalent counselor for every three hundred students. Guidance for school counseling in grades K -6 is set forth as best practice and is an area of accreditation monitored within the advanced process. The North Dakota Department of Public Instruction supports the implementation of a comprehensive school counseling program that is based on the American School Counseling Association (ASCA) Model. The \"ASCA Mindsets & Behaviors for Student Success: K -12 College - and Career - Readiness Standards for Every Student\" describes the knowledge, skills, and attitudes students need to achieve academic success, college and career readiness, and social/emotional development. The ASCA Mindsets and Behaviors should be aligned with initiatives at the district, state, and national level to reflect the district's local priorities. North Dakota's leadership has displayed strong resolve towards ensuring career readiness for all students. School counselors play an essential role in providing advice and guidance to homeless youth who prepare and improve their readiness for college. Key benchmarks, which are set through legislation, must be met. The strong position of the state to mandate the creation of individual education plans, individual consultative reviews of education plans, require interest inventories, ACT or WorkKeys assessment, and selecting high school courses appropriate to their educational pursuits and caree r interests help assure that all students are prepared to be choice ready upon graduation. Barriers to educational success may include but are not limited to: Graduation options Credit recovery options Lack of opportunities to dual credit or Advanced Placement courses due to cost Loss of educational records, resulting in potential loss of academic credits and time Cost of either the ACT or Workkeys (is also addressed through legislation) Lack of college scholarship awareness Completion of college info rmation/FAFSA Cost of sending transcripts to colleges Cost of applying to college Professional Development SEA provides regular professional development to liaisons and administrators on assisting youth experiencing homelessness to navigate through high s chool and preparing for college or career readiness. Counselors will also be invited to attend the professional development that is focused on this area and recorded webinars will be provided to counselors on this area. The professional development provi ded includes a variety of critical elements related to college and career readiness.

Accountability is not new ESSA was intended to provide new resources and funding PowerPoint Table Discussion Notes #1 Topic School Dashboa rd and Rating Sy stem: Heather Kinsey, Presenter What does it look like to provide data transparency? Key questions again to decide what data do we show and how to represent it so it is meaningful? Thinking about a data davenport. A website availab le to the public Who is this dashboard for? What purpose does it serve? Accurate, honest but complete list of what is happening in our schools What does school quality data look like? How is it used to create an accurate picture of what is happening in our schools? How do we communicate that we are moving in the right direction? Achievement marries achievement and growth Needs to be sustainable Learning index Growth index - quadrants Formula State assessment is used for the formula Only one factor of accoun tability measurement Need to keep in mind schools' needs assessments Topic Update and Overview if Agenda: Shelby Hubach, Presenter Accountability system is main priority Shift in strategy All will be involved in accountability portion then split into buckets Interactive meeting Topic School Dashboa rd and Rating System: Heather Kinsey, Presenter Data is not just state assessment What is our vision?

Baesler's cabinet offered ideas for a school quality factor: community engagement, access to courses , learning environment, post -secondary plans, preschool availability, extracurricular activities, access to school counselor Need to consider the weighting of all indictors in the accountability system; academic indicators need to be given greater weight PowerPoint Table Discussion Notes #3 Topic School Improvement System: Heather Kinsey, Presenter Need to design a statewide system of continuous improvement that includes monitoring and support to schools and districts Provide schools with three years t o implement continuous improvement and set data points to progress over the three -year period Start with an assessment to inform a comprehensive improvement plan; then, implement the plan using data to monitor and adjus t implementation; align improvement tools, supports, and services to the improvement plan PowerPoint Table Discussion Notes #4 Topic Synthesize Main Discussion Points: Heather Kinsey, Presenter Offered main discussion points based on table discussions held throughout the meeting Topic Timeline, Next Steps, and Q & A: Shelby Hubach, Presenter ESSA implementation begins July 2017 and submission of the ND ESSA Plan occurs March 2017. Between now and March 2017, the ESSA Steering Committee will begin drafting the ND ESSA Plan and gather fe edback from the ESSA Advisory and Planning Committee. It will be an iterative process with numerous revisions made to the ND ESSA Plan and several occurrences of gather ing feedback from ESSA Advisory and Planning Committee members. Doodle polls will be sen t to the ESSA Advisory and Planning Committee members to schedule meetings for September, October, and November. The next meeting on August 30 will focus on accountability. Future meetings this fall will focus on getting feedback on drafts of the ND ESSA P lan. No questions were asked during the Q&A portion. Next Meeting Date: August 30 Location: To Be Determined Time: 10:00am -3:30pm Table Discussion 1 Key Elements of a State Accountability System Discussion on Vision, Goals, and Key Accountability Presentations What key takeaways do you have from the presentation? Need to be aware of the law; need sustainability Who are we building this for? The first word is students -community . We h ave a lot of lagging indicators The purpose, make sure system works. Is funding making a difference? It will be different for different stakeholders Can we come up with different levels of accountability or systems? (ex. rural vs. urban) Accountability, can we have flexibility? It has to understand the complexity and still be fair Different agencies come up with different a perceptive - is there funds? Need resources for what is important. We want student success prepared after school Technology is changing fast Want critical thinkers, as now we seem to take that away Kids learn differently - there is no one way - every kid has a different hook Those with disabilities need SPED Curriculum - should it be based on tests? Need transition plans for starting at age 14; as long as the plan is aimed at all students' potential, it is okay it if changes over time. Make is easy to measure Key elements - time is a factor - most effective teachi ng B alance between local control vs. everyone being accountable - cannot sit back and do nothing Growth System recognizes strength vs. a deficiency model Collaboration (Fosters) Purpose to support schools in growth of key factors Do what is right for ND and best for kids System Accountability - new system is often the fact - too late What is reported now is easy numbers, not necessary. What is happening in school or quality indicators? 100% no realistic - became punitive How can we move to meaningful data in a timely manner to help kids? Improvement system/focus. Accountability definition: Funding, legislation, boards Ownership belongs to the locals, but how do we do that? How do we make it understandable? Role of stakeholders in system Need to supply resources where needed and continually evaluate and reallocate resources Need a user-friendly system Students Teachers Move away from \"business model\" approach - we deal with real humans and education is a unique system Funding formula Spending regulations Resource allocation Need flexibility, programs that work Need to educate all levels of the \"system\" to ensure they understand education is not a \"business\" Will the recommendation of this committee be taken to heart or will outside stakeholders determine the system? Need to support project -based learning What is dr iving instruction? Using test results to evaluate programs does not necessarily tell the success of programs Challenging that others/special interest groups add to curriculum/school Bullying Civics Scripted programs are not always the best for education Improvement takes time Every school is at a different starting place It takes time - programs, people, students need time to adapt and see results Schools are trying everything - but test scores still may not move NDSA means nothing to the student How do we change the conversation? Discourse on how guidelines/law end up Long-term solution to gaps (for students) Strength of ESSA - family involvement Differentiation - need to get back to embracing improvement Skills - teachers need to engage students Purpose ful, meaningful to students and teachers Student growth - other measures besides standardized tests How do you design a system that honors multiple pathways? State must respect local voice How does accreditation play into this? How will the opt -out option affect the accountability system? What's the intent of our state assessment under ESSA? Success looks different - student Do Not measure in the same way for every student Key components for every student Choice Ensure students are growing (check points) Relevance Motivation Profiles of learning/competency System allows- ensures-encourages- measures student growth Afraid of the system becoming an assignment - make sure our purpose is about kids Make sure systems mesh Leading the lagging Where do we see students not growing across the spectrum/state? Figure big state framework All students have equal opportunity Building capacity as the lead driver System flexibility - ala carte, needs are different Resource library Students should have multiple ways to show choice- readiness Flexibility to schools to ensure LEA priorities are included Built upon a growth model System that supports innovation and capacity building A re we leveraging what other states are doing with ESSA? Relationships are critical Question one size fits all Less punitive, more flexibility Values must be shared and supportedSustainability? Stakeholder roles? Teacher prep/preservice/recruiting Affordable tuition/salary Focus on the law Compliancy AchievementTable Discussion 2 School Dashboard and Rating System Driving Continuous Improvement through Data Transparency Must be communicated effectively to parents Parents should understand so they can be part of the process Data for presentation versus data that staff can actually use Include 21st century skills as a qualitative measure on dashboard Content measure should be embedded in the 21st century skills Need a standardized measure for creativity. How do we do this? Define the skills and also the rubrics for measuring the skill across the state Need a common assessment track Graduation rate should include GED. People learn different way and GED With ESSA we are hopeful we can get back e to what we love about education The four Cs: Creativity Critical thinking Collaboration Communication Who is it for- Any one, business, parents, the state to decide services and support Purpose-yet to be determined depending on data on it Simple enough for parents/others to use Concern: Will people think of it as only data (may not understand) Would/should show schools growth/achievement Categories on it may be limiting If parent has special education child it may be more important Translate dashboard into other languages (different cultures). What is the culture of the school is it welcoming to all We want to treat all students as individuals not masses Concern with tests and struggling children This is majority average how do we factor in lower struggling children? Do we want to con centrate more on growth or achievement? There may be focus on struggling and a focus on gifted-What about middle group? Be Standards Based (How close are we achieving the standards?) versus Ranking Data should answer: How are we doing for ourselves? Student groups to longitudinal data How are we doing similar groups? Middle school to middle school How are we doing overall meeting the standards? What processes are important? What growth needs to be recognized? Real time Assessment parameters Student value of testing Meaningful data Fidelity of testing process Stoplights/colors -good Change metrics-standard data-baseline Small school reports Dashboard Who: Parents, legislators, business and industry, higher education, and teachers Reports: should/could look different for constituents Purpose: Communicate to constituents What are you trying to communicate? Basic school performance Table Discussion 3 Additional School Quality Factors Identifying Additional Factors of School Quality Focus on student achievement Approaches to curriculum and instruction Use of evidence for planning, organizational learning and accountability District- wide sense of efficacy Building and maintaining good communications and culture Investing in instructional leadership Commitment to school improvement Job embedded professional development Infrastructure alignment/resource allocation (reference: Leithwood 2010) Student remediation is an issue at all levels (elementary school, middle school, high school, and college) Providing student guidance on coursework options and future choices is a challenge Schools with system of MTSS for those that are struggling or/and those tha t need more challenge Do AP courses equal Dual Credit courses? Some policies are making districts pick between offering both types of advanced coursework options Parents need to be engaged, involved, and invested in education and their child's future How do K- 12 processes align or enable kids for future experiences? (i.e., allowing students to retake exams until successful - does this prepare them for experiences outside school?) Why are students disengaged? What can we do? Many AdvancED districts already us surveys - ELEOT - the surveys that are used could be used for multiple purposes (locally, accountability) H ow can ELEOT criteria/research be used to train staff on effective practices? If ELEOT data elements are used, the expectation of districts will b e for AdvancED to provide training and share ELEOT resources What does effective instructional design look like? What schools are teaching with 21st century skills? How can these elements be measured? How can interventions be provided in an accelerated environment? S chools need to shy away from remediation and pull out environments as kids miss out and it is not effective. Are there ways to provide flexibility in scheduling, school start times (junior high starting later), etc. as options? Key Takeaways - Communication Who is this for? Communities in general What purpose? Communication/public State dashboard with local component (can't incorporate all local components initially.) What communication? We have workable, viable schools students growing school is working. What is considered achievement? What is considered growth? An Individual Learning Plan (ILP) has to be taken into consideration What indicators of school quality should we use? School facilities (libraries, computers Class sizes Teacher qualifications/quality School connectedness - climate School discipline policies Extra -curricular activities (Are there opportunities for students to get involved?) Meaningful professional development School Quality Indicators should include, but not be limited to: High levels of student engagement Positive school culture Safety and Security schools Early Childhood Program as prevention Students should have a sense of belonging We should identify a list of initiatives proven to work and place them in a clearinghouse. PLC's are effective. If we impact what adults are doing through PLC work than we will see positive student growth and achievement. Quality leader activities serve as leading indicators of lagging data. Professional Development should be embedded in a continuous school improvement plan or serve as an indicator. Research supports that opportunities for fine arts, STEM, and CTE programs indicate a high quality school a nd su ccess for students. How do we gage if students are successful after graduation? Climate and culture are important, but how do we measure this? When looking at culture, it's important to include all student populations with different languages and different cultures Parent Involvement is critical - Type of parent involvement activities should be identified and defined Think about what kind of engagement - school activities or at home - that we want to measure Could measure attendance/activities/conferences of parents - however, parent may have specific needs - they may never attend, do not feel welcome, don't get needs met, think it's waste of time ELL students are more challenging Statistics show those that graduates make more money National PTA School of Excellence - form a measurement to identify areas of strength/weakness, involves all stakeholders, schools enroll in this program so not all schools have this Ensure there are resources available (i.e., PTA, PTO, etc.) Use a survey Assure parents understand importance - Culture matters because some don't understand Family Engagement is a measure to be looked at - how is this defined and how do we measure this? C limate and culture measures School of Excellence - school enroll for this program Need something comprehensive If measuring student engagement, how is this defined? Impact of instruction - different modalities of learning and demonstrating learning Common Benchmarks How to really measure? Grade specific Multiple measures Balance of all students Parental role/involvement Rigor/growth Blur (?) the line Graduation Page 2 Data Points Table Discussion 4 School Improvement System Identifying Schools for Improvement under ESSA Would it be appropriate for teachers to use ELEOT more often? Does it cost the school more to use? What does continuous improvement look like? Have base line and in the future should increase Annually review Continuous updating Sharing information with parents, stakeholders in a common language Alignment of survey data Parent involvement is important Laws on the number of hours per day - seat time = credit Create barriers How can we be more flexible? CBE What is the constant/more important? oTime? oKnowledge? Does traditional schedule currently work? What data supports this? Governance: School board role Multiple boards Not familiar with the process/system of education School system can only be as effective as its board Politics are involved at some levels Teachers want to teach and coaches want to coach Transfer/transition between schools/districts Districts/boards communication with each other is same areas Principal/Superintendent relationship with board Open lines of communication Variations within one system People on different ends of the spectrum Potential consistency between factors ELEOT Surveys Not just accountability Using some things in place that drive/connect to improvement System has school improvement plans that have direct connections to data State needs to understand that each school/district is at a different starting point Logistically - within cycle Strategically - interventions/support We need a good/great support system for students How can we help kids before we lost them? Non academic More resources & support What community supports exist for students? Mental health - mental well -being for our students! Students have real needs - unmet Difficultly hiring people Need financial flexibility Teachers Social Workers Psychologists Counselors What are the support services? Define - allow flexibility Identify student needs Find resources for those needs Coordinate services Each community has its own unique needs and challenges How can we measure? How can we give \"credit\" for other options? Flexible scheduling Start time/end time Teens - research says mid -day best function How can we better provide services/flexibility? Emphasis on sustaining accountability Whatever we end up with must be: User friendly and transferrable Meaningful and relevant to the teacher and community Able to meet students where they are How are we going to pull this together? How are we going to prevent this from feeling like \"one more thing\" for teachers and schools to do? How can we fit in principal effectiveness? Teacher leaders effectiveness Takeaway for continued improvement Use the score from AdvancED as the secondary score (color coded) It is measured nationally Go with standards based instead of one score at the end On accreditation/site visit and dash board, eliminate the overall rating Color coding or wording for dash boarding Instructional coach in every school Integrated momentum Remove \"2030\" from vision Still asking: Where are we going? Set vision Select common priorities High school diploma is not enough 2-year/AA degree at a minimum Learning structures Workplace What are the takeaways? If student engagement is used, the concern is how we effectively and cost effectively use and measure without compromising AdvancED? Adding the element of accountabi lity into the system potentially impacts the process. Most team stated that this is the first time hearing about ELEOT, except one team member. Review base line data & review trend data annually! Need to build capacity to sustain improvement through the use of resources Discussed use of ELEOT at school l evel Discussed use of iobservation What specific topics/areas do you still have questions about? Would it be appropriate for teachers to use ELOET more frequently? Currently, can be used as a formative tool but above and beyond ND accreditation contract , a dditional $400 per year. Is ELEOT adaptive to ELs, SPED, other student populations? Yes, also adaptive to STEM schools Notes for next meeting: More diverse seating, report time out & cookies ESSA Planning Committee MINUTES Tuesday , August 30 , 2016 | 10:00 AM - 3:30 PM | Baymont Inn & Suites, Mandan Facilitator Note Taker Bucket Leader Shelby Hubach Shauna Greff Meeting Convened Meeting Adjourned Breakout Room 10:00 am 3:00 pm A ttendance Planning Committee Members Nick Archuleta Jennifer Fremstad Marcus Lewton Amy Arness Jody French Tracy Mike Nathe Jeffrey Brandt Jon Godfread Amy Nybladh Cheryl Hagar Davis Rosemary Hardie David Richter Teresa Delrome Julie Jaeger Russ Riehl Teresa Desai Rod Jonas Richard Kirsten Melanie Wendy Fastnacht Wayne Kutzer Stenehjem Tim Flakoll Robert Lech L Anita Thomas NDDPI Ex Officio Members Lodee Arnold Lucy Fredericks Kay Mayer Kirsten Baesler Greg Gallagher Gail Schauer Ann Robert Marthaller Gerry Teevens Valerie Fischer Laurie Matzke Stefanie Two Crow Agenda Items Topic: Welcome and Overview if Agenda Presenter Shelby Hubach Review of Agenda Logistics overview Topic : Working Group Roles, Responsibilities, Expectations Presenter Heather Kinsey Review of ESSA planning committee chart Role is to advise and inform and we own Support and guidance provided by ESSA Steering Committee Workgrou ps will produce work products and report to full committee Topic : Work Group Timeline/ESSA Plan Structure Presenter Heather Kinsey/Laurie Matzke Powerpoint: Significant time commitment and each workgroup will have additional meetings separately Optional to be part of a sub committee workgroup Will have opportunity to hear from them and provide feedback if not in a particular workgroup Workgroup 1: Teacher/Leadership Effectiveness group Educator support and improvement Educator effectiveness - Teacher and principal evaluation \\not mandated Title II Part A Support and align Equity Plan Key data points & definitions Alignment across all work groups Workgroup 2: Standards, Assessment, Accountability & Reporting Standards and assessments Key performance indicators Accountability Data definition, reporting, transparency Continuous improvement Improved use of resources Critical and will take the most time as it is the meat of the plan Workgroup 3: Continuous Improvement (Not just Title) Statewide system of Continuous Improvement Comprehensive and targeted supports & interventions Strategies and best practices Program alignment & Coordination Progress monitoring, evaluations improvement Overview of timeline of workgroups and full committee Needing to identify any legislative changes - Dr. Rebecca Pitkin and ESPB board will lead ESPB is collecting feedback regarding changes needed Definition of effective teachers will be critical Highly qualified vs highly effective teachers Table discussion on content reviewed Laurie Matzke: Further review of buckets and what they will entail and en compass Details that will need to be decided and included in each workgroup Will be able to sign up at end of meeting Tomorrow those who signed up will receive email and doodle to setup subcommittee meetings Questions on buckets?

The more people the USDE hears from the better. Use this as an example and create correspondence to the USDE. At the large districts, how does this effect you? The letter from the NDDPI covers their main concerns - teacher transfers. This is important from the standpoint of student- teacher relationships and also teacher - teach er rel ationships and communication for a team effort. Is there more of an opportunity to share the delegations view of the overreach? Supt Baesler will reach out to see if they could indep endently or jointly get more communicatio n o utreach to share their concerns about regulation overreach. If the reg ulations come out and there is major overreach, we will be reaching out to th e del egation for their support so we do not just accept. 10:30AM Reports from ESSA Subcommittee Meetings Teacher and Leader EffectivenessESPB Update on Effective Teacher Definition - Mary Eldredge -Sandbo With the removal if the Highly Qualified requirement, needed to review and decide how to make sure our teachers are qualified. Indicated four non- negotiables and seven passed motions - report out to committee . Discussion on Kindergarten being kept separate: received strong recommendations to keep it as is - such a crucial time for students to get star ted with their learning. Supt Baesler commented that nationally, developmental needs are dramatically different fo r Ki ndergarten than they are for older grades. They need a specialized skill set to meet the needs of the 0 -5 year olds. Seems more burdensome to put additional requirements to receive the ECE endorsement. NDDPI does have funds to help teachers receive this endorsement . Leadership Academies - Gail Schauer Multi -Tiered Leadership Academy to provide professional support, professional development, and career ladder opportunities. An update on mentoring, cost, and the critical skills of the Missouri Model.

To be able to use it for accountability, we need det ailed data for each student specifically . All agree growth should be in the program . ACT does not show growth - not geared for kids with special needs . ACT is a college readiness, not high school accountability . Need to work on the determination of growth in high school . Index gives credit for t he growth that is occurring in schools . The dashboard has an opportunity to be a sales pitch for each school . Will allow schools to display the good things that are going on at schools. Vote on r ecommendation of N Size of 10 with multiple year average: o27 in favor oNone not in favor High School Assessment (options for growth)Conducted a survey and results showed fifth graders are hit hard and 11 th graders a re s lammed for testing . Student Cabinet had a discussion was dedicated to going over survey results and assessments.They feel like they are checked out after 11 th grade . Since they do not count for accountability, we do not test or check in with them on how they are doing. What is best for our kids? 8th grade to ACT there is no reconnect with kids . Can we do something in the 9th and 10th year to prepare them for the testing that takes place in the 11th grade? How well did we do in the 12th grade to help students to be choice ready? Not about the number of times tested but is the data meaning?Having the flexibility of using the Work Keys option is important. Want credit for growth - if ACT will not show that, it probably would not be the best choice. ESSA requires testing once in the secondary level.Qualifying indicator could be Redefining Ready . Progres s monitoring can be displayed on the dashboard and will show growth but does not need to be used for accountability.There is value in every test given. How do we value and place weight on the different ones? What is the negative with testing in 9 th? First year of high school is your last year of assessment. Ninth graders tested to represent how the entire high school is doing. You are not adding a test; you are moving the testing from 11th to 9th for assessment. We have to acknowledge the s ensitivity to assessments. What is the true value of the standards you set, and does the measure provide every studentthe best opportunity for growth? What about testing in 12 th? What would that do for those students? Factor for admission into certain colleges - won 't need rem ediation course their first year of college. Would provide students and parents feedback on whether they are choice ready. About 24% of ND students that went to ND Universities required remediation courses. Each university uses their own placement cr iteria . Discussion needs to be continued in this issue .Relationship between assessment and culture/climate: There is a dilemma between time out of the classroom and having good opportunities for our kids. There are things that impact children other than academics. There are things we can do that are valuable if we test in 9th grade. They can still use the ACT and Work Keys to monitor the high schools progress but not used in accountability. Agenda of topics that will be discussed by this subcommittee . G ifted and Talented Topic Gifted and talented in what? Academics? Math and English only? Science? Arts? Need a better terminology than gifted and talented - maybe highest group of academic achievers ? Is it worthy of shining a light on those stu dents who are not being served the best we can? A presentation will be given at the Continuous Improvement subcommittee regarding this issue. Potentially if we include this subgroup, does it open the door to other subgroups ? Where do draw the line to include? There are options as far as where this information can be displayed . Pieces of the presentation that is going to be given on this issue will be brought back to the large group in November. 3:15PM Q&A and Next Steps Topics each subcommittee need to discuss and make recommendations on Next Meeting - November 30, 2016 3:30PM Adjourn ESSA Planning Committee MINUTES Tuesday , December 20 , 2016 | 8:30 AM - 4:15 PM | Baymont Inn & Suites, Mandan Facilitator Note Taker Bucket Leader Laurie Matzke Kathleen Dempsey Meeting Convened Meeting Adjourned Breakout Room 8:30 am 3:45 pm A ttendance Planning Committee Members Nick Archuleta Tracy Friesen Amy Neal Amy Arness Robert Grosz Marc Bluestone Nikkie Cheryl Hagar Brown Rosemary Sonja Butenhoff Russ Riehl Aimee Copas Rod Jonas David Steckler Teresa Delrome Ashley Kelsch Jim Stenehjem Teresa Tracy L Dvorak Wayne Kutzer Travis Lewton Fremstad Mike Nathe N DDPI Ex Officio Members Lodee Arnold Greg Gallagher Kay Mayer Kirsten Baesler Joe Kolosky Gail Schauer Ann Valerie Fischer Laurie Matzke Stefanie Two Crow Lucy Fredericks NORTH DAKOTA ESSA PLANNING COMMITTEE TUESDAY, DECEMBER 20, 2016, 8:30 AM - 4:15 PM PIER ROOM, BAYMONT INN & SUITES, MANDAN, ND AGENDA M EETING OBJECTIVES: Provide an overview of Final Regulations Provide updates regarding federal ESSA guidance, requirements, timelines , and opportunities for cross -state collaboration Learn about the progress and recommendations of each subcommitt ee S olicit feedback on subcommittee recommendations AG ENDA ITEMS: 8: 30 AM Welcome The meeting began with a welcome from Laurie Matzke and a review of the meeting's agenda. To inform all meeting participants, each table group compiled and reported on the actions taken and questions/concerns of stakeholders. [KD1] What will the high school assessment be? How will growth be measured? Elementary like the idea of growth with achievement scores (same cohort) What will the dashboard look like? W hat will it say about our school? How do you measure student engagement? Like the idea but question how it will work What will be the overall school quality factor? The discussion on ineffective teachers is very concerning to all stakeholders Discussed assessment options with NDCEL Discussed how to define teacher effectiveness and the complexities of the definition Discussed what it means to be \"Choice Ready\" (college, career, and/or military) What does Career Ready mean? How do we \"beef\" up career, college, military readiness? What tools do we use? How do we record results? Meetings with stakeholder groups: Informational Direct people to NDDPI ESSA website Discussion with colleagues about assessments Discussion on definitions of teacher effectiveness Growth vs. Accountability Presented to NDREAs (GN WEC) to give them updates Email updates sent to approximately 111 teachers who wanted updates Conducted a survey of North Dakota teachers in October with 452 responses - sent results of the survey, encourage them to follow updates and notes Maintained contact with community members to keep them informed Presented to the Great Northwest (REA) consortium Wrote a letter to Fort Berthold reservation leaders Met with superintendents at a Vegas conference about GED counting as part of graduation rates Communicate d with district administrator and with teacher education groups about how to define teacher effectiveness Learned that teachers wanted more information about the dashboard Indicated that some stakeholders feel the that \"engagement\" could be a school indicator but are uncertain of how to measur e it L earned that elementary school stakeholders indicate interest in considering student growth as a factor Continue to update administration on and at the local levels Update Title Staff Continue communication with stakeholders MTSS - updates after meeting with continuous improvement presentation Visit with building level administrators in districts Visit with district level administration Email correspondence sent to curriculum directorsEmail correspondence sent to Special Ed directors Visits with H igher Ed/T eacher Ed NDDPI communicated with various subgroups such as Special Ed and EL NDDPI related t he information obtained at the c ombined Federal Programs meeting and its usefulness - meeting with ED program officer was most useful 9: 15 AM Overview Highlights of Final ESSA Regulations - Laurie Matzke Final ESSA regulations were released on November 28. Some of the major changes include: New submission dates - The first submission date is now April 3 (rather than Mar. ) and the second submission is Sept 18, 2017. NDDPI plans to submit in April. States must use the ED provided template for their ESSA plan due to the peer review process. ED allots 120 days for peer review. States will identify Comprehensive Support schools by start of 2018- 2019 school year. States will identify Targeted Support schools by the start of 2019 -2020. States must assure that their academic standards meet the requirements in the law Accountability oDon't need one summative rating/only identify amo ng three categories (Comprehensive, Targeted, or Not identified) oDashboard - no prescribed percentages are required Report cards oMust be disseminated by December 31 of each year oMust collect post -secondary data School improvement oMust set aside 7% even in first year to establish a base in 2017 -2018 even though no schools have been identified. States may bank these funds or may use the funds to support schools under NCLB. oTargeted Support schools may receive a $50,000 grant and Comprehensive Support schools may receive as much as $500,000 (may give smaller amounts). oAll public schools should be included in the pool for Targeted Support calculations, not just Title I. oStates may allot funds to non -Title I schools to support improvement needs. Graduation rate oEL in the grad calculations LEA Consolidated Application oSEAs may approve LEA applications without having their state ESSA plan approved oAssurance document must be submitted by April 3 Appropriations for 2017- 2018 oAllocations may be late June or July - districts must know that these are coming late 9: 40 AM Equity Presentation - Ann Ellefson Ann Ellefson provided an update about equity expectations under ESSA. The equity areas of focus in ESSA include: Teacher Equity Fiscal Equity and Transparency Equitable Access to Educational Opportunities Ann presented information about each focus area and then invited meeting attendees to discuss how these areas might look in N orth Dakota. Teacher Equity : In ESSA, states and districts must ensure that low -income student s and students of color are not taught at disproportionate rates by ineffective, out -of-field, or inexperienced teachers. North Dakota has a high rate of qualified teachers in classrooms across the state In a 2016 Gallop Poll of North Dakotans, 89% of survey respondents indicated that they believed their schools were either \"excellent or good.\" Fiscal Equity and Transparency : In many places, schools serving the most vulnerable students get less funding. ESSA requires transparency in fiscal reporting to insure that equitable funding is maintained for the most vulnerable students. ESSA Maintains the Title I funding formula and increases the role of poverty in Title II. Requires reporting on actual per pupil school level spending. Requires reporting on equi ty measures including rates of student discipline, chronic absenteeism, pre- school, and advance d c oursework.oSupt. Baesler discussed how this might impact small schools and indicated that both Republican leadership and Civ il R ights groups supported fiscal transparency processes. She reminded meeting attendees that NDDPI is committed to a continuous improvement process. oJoe Kolosky discussed reporting on fiscal transparency processes (fiscal workgroup) indicating that districts wi ll n eed clear guidance on the type of data to collect Equitable Access to Educational Opportunities ESSA focuses on a well -rounded education ESSA is less punitive and more transparent empowering the community and the school board to make decisions that are most meaningful for the dis trict. 10: 00 AM Update on Tribal Collaboration - Lucy Fredericks Lucy Fredericks provided an update on consultation activities with tribes and highlighted the following points. Consultation is a government to government relationship and may mean different things to different tribes. Tribal consultation should occur early in the planning process so that tribal views are integrated into the plan. Meaningful tribal consultations must occur between LEAs and tribal education leaders , as well as between the SEA and triba l ed ucation leaders. A combined meeting with tribes occurred on October 21 in Bismarck with meeting facilitation by the North CentralComprehensive Center at McREL International. oApproximately 50 participants attended the meeting. oParticipants indicated the need to meet individually with tribes and so Lucy Fredericks and Supt. Baesler scheduled meetings at tribal locations to discuss ESSA. oSome meetings occurred in November and December with additional consultation meeting scheduled for January. December 13: Meeting with Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa January 2017: Meeting scheduled with Three Affiliated Tribes in New Town, ND January 2017: Meeting scheduled with Standing Rock January 30, 2017: Meeting scheduled with Spirit Lake N ation oA second whole group tribal consultation meeting is scheduled for Dec. 22 at Bismarck. oNDDPI will work with LEAs to help them how to conduct their own tribal consultation meetings. 10:15 AM Recommendations from ND Council on the Arts Laurie discusse d the letter from the North Dakota Council on the Arts regarding their recommendations for the ESSA plan. Beth Larson -Steckler offered comments about the state of the arts in ND indicating that smaller school districts hav e d ifficulty funding arts programs such as visual arts, dance and/or media arts in the schools. Multiple meeting attendees expressed their concern and support for funding arts opportunities. It was expressed that guidance should not push one type of program over another, but should identi fy the multiple options for use of the funds. One meeting participant shared how arts can be incorporated into the regular content and not only as an extra program. The school culture indicator may partially address the concerns expressed by the ND Counci l on the Arts oGiven that ND respects local control, NDDPI doesn't plan to dictate how the arts should be included in LEA plans but can provide guidance about the arts 10: 25 AM Break 1 0:35 AM Reports from ESSA Subcommittee Meetings Standards, Assessment, Accountability and Reporting Subcommittee Report This subcommittee meets December 21 to continue its work. Graduation Rate Update - Jeff Fastnacht oRecommends keeping the calculation for graduation rate the same as it is in NCLB oDiscussion with South Dakota about the GED extender and how that state has used this extender to measur e gr aduation rate Must continue to report on four -year standard but wants to consider a seven -year report. May use national database to track students that move to other communities. Extending the time frame for graduation mayimpact the way that the student dropout is reported. Questions about how to link attaining a GED or diploma after leaving a ND school to the initial contributions made by ND schools are being investigated. Climate/Engagement Update - Jeff Fastnachto The subcommittee likes the school climate option , but is unsure how this factor might be measured. The subcommittee will identify a measurement tool in the upcoming meeting and is considering whether th e AdvanceEd effective learning environments observation tool (ELEOT ) may be appropriate. Discussion about the frequency of asse ssing school climate using ELEOT occurred. One participant commented on how the yearly AdvanceEd climate survey (student, parent, teacher, etc.) may be the best option for measuring school climate. Assessment Update - Jennifer Fremstad oBecause of the consistency across K -8 academic courses, measuring growth is more straightforward at this level. oMeasuring student growth at the high school level is more problematic as there are multiple academic pathways for students to take oThe subcommittee sent out questions regarding assessment options to HS principals and requested feedback. Concerns about the length and long wait for the assess ment report from NDSA were expressed - Principals would prefer a test that could give information/results back more quickly. When asked whether NDSA should be administered in the sophomore year, 57% of responding high school principals indicated that sophomore administration represented a viable option. Participants discussed the viability of administering NDSA at grade nine as this option might provide aclearer representation of student growth Advantages and disadvantages for using the ACT as a proficienc y measure were discussed. Choice of assessment at the school/district level is important to Supt. Baesler. School Dashboard Update - NDDPI is in the process of developing a RFI for the school dashboard. They will review proposals and consider options as proposals are received. English Learner Update - - Sonja Butenhoff oLodee Arnold continues to work with the English Learner Program Advisory Committee (ELPAC) to gather input for the ESSA plan. oCommittee recommends the continued use of WIDA English Language Development Standards and the use of the WIDA proficiency assessment, ACCESS 2.0. oGuidance suggest that state assessment should be available in other languages when a \"significant language\" ofELs are identified. Currently, Spanish is the only other significant language group in North Dakota. oCommittee recommendations Exclude newly arrived EL for the first year of test administration in ELA (Option 1) Use proficiency levels from entry year (considered year 0) and then consider growth over 4 -6 years Monitor students for two years after they exit the program Administer a state -wide home language survey Screen students if there is evidence of another language in the home (unless academic progress shows no need to assess) Use teacher recommendation to recommend assessment on program entry oThe committee is currently working on components of the exit assessment 12:20 P M Lunch 1:20 PM Reports from ESSA Subcommittee Meetings Teacher and Leader Effectiveness Subcommittee Reports Equity Presentation - Russ Ziegler oMeetings in November and December - The committee looked at survey results from the equity plan which showed a large number of new teachers at low poverty schools Definition of Effective Educator - Aimee Copas oThe subcom mittee is currently working on definitions for effective and ineffective teachers and indicated the complexity of articulating these definitions. oThe subcommittee is considering a multi -tiered approach that might include factors such as whether the teacher is highly qualified, on a plan of improvement, and/or receives a satisfactory formal teacher evaluation. A discussion on continuous improvement and how to develop effective teachers occurred. oSupt. Baesler reminded meeting participants that ESSA requires a definition of effective and ineffective teachers. State ESSA plans must include a link to a state website that shows where information on teacher effectiveness isreported. oMembers indicated concerns about establishing a ranking system for educators. Continuous Improvement Subcommittee Reports Identification for School Improvement and Resources - Joe Kolosky and Laurie Matzke oComprehensive Support schoolsRepresent the lowest 5% of Title I schools Include high schools that fail to graduate one -third or m ore of their students Are identified for three years oNDDPI recommends using a multi -faceted approach (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3) to support all Comprehensive Support schools Tier 1: NDDPI will propose a partnership with the School Improvement Network to provide coaching and consultation services to help schools conduct a needs assessment and create a plan for improvement.

First draft of ESSA plan to subcommittees - end of December 2016 Feedback from subcommittees during January 2017 Review of feedback and plan revisions by ND DPI - mid February Public review of draft ESSA plan through mid -March Editing and a pprovals through end of March Submission to ED by end of March Q uestions were addressed. 3: 45 Meeting was adjourned ESSA Planning Committee MINUTES Wednesday , February 8, 2017 | 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM | Bismarck Ramada Hotel Facilitator Note Taker Bucket Leader Laurie Matzke Kathleen Dempsey Meeting Convened Meeting Adjourned Breakout Room 9:00 am 4:00 pm Attendance Planning Committee Members Nick Archuleta Tracy Friesen Amy Neal Amy Arness Robert Grosz Marc Bluestone Nikkie Cheryl Hagar Brown Rosemary Sonja Butenhoff Russ Riehl Aimee Copas Rod Jonas David Steckler Teresa Delrome Levi Bachmeier Jim Stenehjem Teresa Tracy L Dvorak Wayne Kutzer Travis Thorvilson Eldredge Marcus Jennifer Fremstad Mike Nathe NDDPI Ex Officio Members Lodee Arnold Greg Gallagher Kay Mayer Kirsten Baesler Joe Kolosky Gail Schauer Ann Valerie Fischer Laurie Matzke Stefanie Two Crow Lucy Fredericks Page 2 NORTH DAKOTA ESSA PLANNING COMMITTEE WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 2017 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM ASSEMBLY HALL, RAMADA BISMARCK HOTEL, BISMARCK, ND AGENDA MEETING OBJECTIVES: Provide updates regarding federal ESSA guidance, requirements, timelines and opportunities for cross -state collaboration Learn about the progress and recommendations of each subcommittee Solicit feedback on subcommittee recommendations AGENDA ITEMS: 9:00 AM Welcome -Laurie welcomed committee members and discussed the most recent ED updates. Action taken by CRA repeals Accountability rules and regulations Key questions for ESSA development are oTimeline - CCSSO is encouraging ED to keep the current tim eline in place. oTemplate - Question -Will the ED template continue to be a requirement for ESSA plan development. oDoes the new Administration have a different intention for ESSA? (ED may not issue rules and regulations but may issue non regulatory guidance .) ND is confi dent that the drafted ESSA plan is in compliance as it was built on the statute. The committee was reminded that the plan should not include hyperlinks. All resources/attachments must be included in the plan itself or the appendices. Overview of Agenda Stakeholder Table Discussion/Report Out Participants discussed the most recent outreach activities by committee members and stakeholder feedback the draft ESSA plan. Notes were recorded on chart paper, and small groups reported to the whole group. The cha rts were collected and the information compiled by NDDPI. oThere was a recommendation to draft a statement from the ESSA planning committee that articulates how the ND ESSA plan clearly reflects the requirements in the ESSA statute. This statement would rep resent a proactive communication strategy. Report outs oMany stakeholders are still not familiar with ESSA. It is recommended that the committee help community/educators understand the \"big picture\" of ESSA. One group recommended a message map with key details about ESSA. This might result in a one -page document with visuals to help communicate the ideas. Stakeholders seem to focus on one aspect of ESSA (ELL, SpED, etc.) rather than the \"big picture.\" oHow can we communicate with stakeholders? Bite-size c hunks ESSA Message Map : Break plan down into sections, give 3 -4 critical elements within that section Give web links to the section of the plan Provide the comment link This would target the audience to their needs oThere is so much beyond ESSA, nothing con crete now oCan we supply links to recap meetings oPresentations given at conferences for various groups throughout North Dakota oInformation being given out at board meetings, workshops, and professional organizations oDiscussions at REA monthly meetings oCTE director regular meetings, CTE listserv oConsultation with tribal councils and leaders oELPAC discussion on EL issues oThe question of \"What If\" and should we have a plan in place?Page 3 oThere has been considerable consultation with tribal members and this process has been well received. Committee members have talked with tribal councils and chairs of the tribal colleges. It is noticeable that comments have been very quiet. oCommittee members noted that stakeholders appeared positive about ESSA accountability through AdvancED. Committee members also noted that there was a positive response to focusing on effective/ineffective teaching practices rather than effective/ineffective teachers. ESSA Training Plan - Grant Opportunity Laurie discussed the training plan and suggested that messages would be crafted in small chunks with specific messages by audience (ELL teachers, administrators, parents, etc.). The training plan would be multifaceted. oWebinars (maybe 15 minutes at a chunk) - similar to the webinars that DPI de veloped for School Board members (short clips from various DPI offices) oBook study on ESSA oStatewide ESSA training scheduled (East side of state on May 4 and West side of state on May 8 possible dates) oRegional training with REAs on consolidated applicatio ns with administrators oThe ESSA planning committee will remain a structure during the plan's implementation, especially through subcommittees. DPI wants to ensure the right data is being collected and needs help from committee members to work through imple mentation details. (This includes the training phase.) oCCSSO is allowing states to apply for an engagement grant to help SEAs conduct training and communicate about the ESSA plan. oIt was noted that messaging needs to be consistent from group to group. It w as suggested that DPI develop a slide presentation(s) to help committee members as they interact with stakeholders. There was a recommendation that slide presentations be as specific to the audience as possible. oDPI plans to share information through the m any conferences (professional meetings) that will occur through the rest of the year. oIt was shared that the partnership with AdvancED represents a big advantage as what is already occurring across the state with AvancED accountability supports ESSA. oThere was a reminder to continue outreach to stakeholders as an ongoing part of ESSA implementation. 10:00 AM Overview of CCSSO Sponsored Meeting Regarding Plan Peer Review Laurie offered comments on the CCSSO meeting and noted that the team would have prefer red comments in writing. Several comments referenced the long -term goals. Key components oChoice ready: The team was commended on having a choice -ready goal, but reviewers didn't think the goal was rigorous enough. They questioned the decision to require pi cking two indicators, rather than require all. oAssessment: The goal for reducing the number of non -proficient students was supported by reviewers. Switching from grade 11 to grade 10 for accountability testing was supported. There was discussion about the use of the ACT as an option. oSchool improvement - target schools - There was discussion about whether capping the number of targeted schools at 10% would be supported by reviewers, however, since the Congressional Review Act (CRA) may void ED's rules and r egulations, using this process should not be problematic. It was recommended that discussion related to English learners be inserted across in all components of the plan. In regards to defining ineffective teachers, focusing on ineffective teaching practi ces rather than on ineffective teachers was supported. General comments included: oProvide more specific information on AdvancED into the plan. oNo hyperlinks can be included in the plan. All documents should be included in the plan or the appendices. oReviewers were complimentary on stakeholder engagement, especially tribal consultation - Wanted to know how plan has changed as a result of stakeholder input. 10:20 AM Update on Tribal Collaboration - Lucy Fredericks Page 4 Outreach included: Two tribal stakeholder meetings (October 21 and December 22) Board of Directors' meeting - Nov 4 Superintendent Baesler, Lucy Fredericks, and Scott Davis (Indian Affairs Commissioner) are participating in the onsite tribal consultation meetings. oFirst tribal meeting - 12/13 Turtle Mountain band of Chippewa - This meeting focused primarily on providing information about ESSA as there were several newly elected tribal leaders. oOnsite meeting at Standing Rock, January 17 - There was strong participation from the communit y with about 35 attendees. Areas of interest/concern included: Culture and language commitment Preserving heritage Discussion on language immersion Need to continue discussion with tribal leaders oOnsite meeting in New Town on Feb 7 with approximately 30 at tendees. Attendees voiced appreciation for participation by Superintendent Baesler. oMeeting is scheduled for Feb 15 at Spirit Lake Tribe oThe third ND ESSA tribal stakeholder meeting will occur on Feb 16. oThere will be a leadership summit focusing on cons ultation between tribes and LEAs on Mar 3. NIEA is collaborating on this summit. There was discussion of how the ND Essential Understanding will help address concerns from tribes for inclusion of language and culture. 10:30 AM Break 10:45 AM Reports fr om ESSA Subcommittee Meetings Teacher and Leader Effectiveness Subcommittee Reports Use of State Title II Funding Stefanie Two Crow shared CCSSO feedback regarding ineffective practices. CCSSO recommended omore positive language, and omore collaboration with institutes of higher education in the plan. Title II Funding includes State level administration of Program - 1% (approximately $100,000) State level activities - 2.6% (approximately $260,000). Proposed state level activities include: oPrincipal mentor ing oREA Grants for PD oPrincipal -Teacher evaluation support system - possible state dollars Vote for Title II Set Aside (total of 3.6% set aside) - results: (Agree, Disagree, Need more discussion) o96% agree, 4% needs more discussion Overview of Proposal f or Reporting - Jim Stenehjem (ND LEAD Center) Reported on concerns expressed by stakeholders ogoing from a growth model to a deficit model oCommon definition of ineffective teacher oOpen records and identification of individuals (privacy) Recommendation Focus on performance of teach ing rather than an individual teacher. Recommended using ratings 1 -4 from educator evaluation systems. Levels 3 -4 will denote effective teaching. Level 2 will identify developing teaching practices and Level 1 will identify ine ffective teaching practices. oThe calculation based on the number of ineffective elements identified on the evaluation versus the number of total elements on the evaluation rubric. oCurrent software being used in schools across the state would allow for this calculation. oPlan for training to improve, that is help teachers build effective teaching practices. Whole group discussion included: Page 5 The needs of high poverty schools and what this reporting means to those communities. Concerns about inter-rater reliability in applying the evaluation elements, needs to be based on classroom teaching (engagement of students) rather than professional activities such as participating in a PLC. Need to have talking points for individuals sharing this message. (e.g. Receiving a 2 on an evaluation indicates an opportunity for growth, not a poor rating.) Vote for proposal for reporting : oReport out as effective teach ing practices rather than effective teachers - results: 92% agree, 8% Need more discussion (model to report on te aching practices rather than teachers) oReport to ED as ineffective teaching. Practices identified as Level 1 will define ineffective teaching: results 92% Agree, 8% Need more discussion 12:00 PM Lunch 1:00 PM Reports from ESSA Subcommittee Meetings Standards, Assessment, Accountability and Reporting Subcommittee Reports Assessment - Jennifer Fremstad oThere was discussion about when to test high school students. It was indicated that secondary principals wanted the state accountability test in the sophomore year, Grade 10, rather than at Grade 11. ACT will remain the test at grade 11 and will remain an option for accountability purposes. Vote: Accountability assessment will be administered at Grade 10 (Sophomore year) Agree - 100% Choice Ready Initiative - Jeff Fastnacht Jeff provided context about the Choice Ready framework. oRoots in redefining Ready indicators come from ASA oEach high school is encouraged to provide all four options, but may focus on one option more than another depending on school resources. For example, a school may not offer AP courses but may offer dual enrollment. oSchools would not be rated only on one pathway (college ready). oLife ready may be added at a later date. oGraduation rate expectations would remain in place. Vote: Approve Choice Ready framework: Agree: 100% Long Term Goals - Ann Ellefson & Greg Gallagher (see handouts) oAmbitious long -term goals for all students and for all student subgroups is the goal of ESSA with academic achievement measured by proficiency on annual assessments. DPI projects a 2.05% rate of increase per year in student academic performance over a six-year period. This will reduce the number of non -proficient students by 33% over the six-year time frame. An accountability system must be valid , reliable, and fair and thus DPI will incorporate an assurance system when calculating whether goals have been met. This includes using a 99% confidence level. Current software tools can be systematized to report school achievement over the six years. High school graduation rates (four -year cohort) Greater improvement for students who are further behind Vote for agreement on six -year 33% goal: Agree 96%, Disagree 2%, Need more discussion 2% Accountability Indicators - Aimee CopasPage 6 oIndicators will be identified at two levels: Secondary and Elementary Vote: on the percentage of indicators for Secondary: 96% Agree, 4% Need more discussion Vote: on the percentages of indicators for Elementary: 100% Agree English Learners - Lodee Arnold and Sonya Buten hoff (see handout) oWIDA standards and assessments will continue to be used across the state. oSpanish is the significant other language across state at 28%. oGrowth for English learners will use a linear trajectory. oStudent trajectory growth chart will begin with the initial annual ELP level of each student. The maximum number of years to exit the program will be identified based on the entry ELP level. oLong term and interim goals for student growth will be determined upon completion of the 2017 - 2018 adminis tration of the ELP assessment. This will provide base year data. oThe subcommittee had considerable conversation and review of cut scores to arrive that their recommendations Included data from former ELs Comprehensive school report would include the percent of students not meeting their individual growth expectations. Vote: English learner model for ESSA: Agree = 100% 3:00 PM Reports from ESSA Subcommittee Meetings Continuous Improvement Subcommittee Reports - Joe Kolesky - Overview - Discussed the need to target a number of schools as ND could have hundreds of schools identified under ESSA - thus the cap for targeted schools will be 10%. There are simply more needs than resources. Selection Criteria for Targeted Support - Russ Riehl (principal, Sim le MS in Bismarck) oComprehensive schools are capped at 10%, so the subcommittee recommends using the same approach for targeted schools. oSchools will apply for funding as a targeted school. MTSS model: moving away from consequences and toward intervention/ enrichment This model allows for more positive messaging. This model will also help sustain the interventions after three years. oIf schools apply for funds but don't receive funds, there will be other options to support these schools Vote: Selection Crite ria for Targeted support: Schools with large gaps in one or more subgroups - 100% Agree Suggestion for tying goals to accountability oFeedback from CCSSO peer review: Use progress toward program goals as exit criteria for schools This approach could apply to both Comprehensive and Targeted schools. Such as approach would make the goals more meaningful. This would create buy -in from schools for the goals. This approach doesn't create more work, but makes the work more current and meaningful. Vote on Propos al for Use of State Title IV Funding - Cheryl Hagar -Minot Public Schools (See handout) oEstimated Title IV, Part A Funding is $2,425,000 DPI will reserve 95% of the funding for Student Support and Academic Enrichment program allocation for sub -grants to LEA s. 1% of the funding will be reserved to support DPI administrative costs. DPI wishes to reserve 4% to support LEA activities and programs designed to meet the overall purpose of the program.Page 7 Vote: Agree 29%, Disagree 46%, Need more discussion 25% Discuss ion indicates that the formula is not equitable to all districts. DPI will reserve only the 1%. ESSA Plan Development Timeline (after today's meeting) oStarting Feb 9 - Update the plan based on feedback oFeb 16 through Mar 16: Official 30 -day comment period oFeb 16 through Mar 16: CCSSO will review the plan oMar 20 - Mar 24: Review comments from the public. Based on comments, a committee meeting may be needed. oLate March: edits and proofing oApril 3: Submit to ED State ESSA Plan - Official Release for Public C omment Feedback Form: Committee members were asked to review the ESSA plan section by section during the 30-day review period. Members should provide their feedback (support plan as drafted, recommend changes) check the box, provide feedback if appropria te, sign and return the feedback form. The form is due at the end of 30 -day public review process. Superintendent Baesler - comments Feels that this plan is the beginning, not the end. Wants to continue to work with committee during implementation to buil d a collaborative effort and make the plan a reality. Will be across the state to support communication about the plan Committee members offered kudos to DPI, especially Laurie, for leading this effort. 3:50 PM Q&A and Next Steps Next Meeting 4:00 PM Adjourn ESSA Planning Committee MINUTES Wednesday , March 22 , 2017 | 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM | Conference Call Facilitator Note Taker Bucket Leader Laurie Matzke Shauna Greff Meeting Convened Meeting Adjourned Breakout Room 3:30 pm 4:45 pm Attendance Planning Committee Members Nick Archuleta Tracy Friesen Amy Neal Amy Arness Robert Grosz Marc Bluestone Nikkie Cheryl Hagar Brown Rosemary Sonja Butenhoff Russ Riehl Aimee Copas Rod Jonas David Steckler Teresa Delrome Levi Bachmeier Jim Stenehjem Teresa Tracy L Dvorak Wayne Kutzer Travis Fremstad Mike Nathe NDDPI Baesler Schauer Valerie Fischer Laurie Matzke Stefanie Two Crow Lucy Fredericks Rob Bauer Page 2 Agenda Items Topic: Communication from USDE - New Template Monday March 13, USDE sent out a l etter with new template with dramatic changes Same submission dates Regulations were thrown out therefore they were required to change the template USDE s tated faith in CCSSO so either use new template or work with CCSSO t o use another template NDDPI had a webinar with CCSSO and they will use the template we have with just a few revisions Some minor tweaks throughout the template with additional 3 items: Long term goals for EL Title IV program funding How do we ensure homel ess receive assistance from counselors Due to requirement of 30 days for governor to review , once changes are made, the governor must have an additional 30 days so we are given until May 3 to submit Once all changes and updates are made , we will put it out for 30 days a nd plan to submit on May 1 or 2 Need a table of contents with a crosswalk so they know where to find all information from new template on our plan Topic: Feedback Received from Open Comment Period Received minimal feedback Created one document of comments broken out by section NDDPI created a response to each comment Review the document and m ake sure you are comfortable with response s If concerns, email Shauna, so we can make the corrections This document will be posted on web and will be included along with plan Topic: Feedback from the Governor Laurie Matzke and Superintendent Baesler met with Governor Bergum and Levi B achmeier last week Governor's office is very engaged and interested in the plan Were not able to get through everything so there is another meeting on the March 29 Governor's t op 2: main street initiative and education Very positive When meet next week , will give our revised plan for his review Topic: CCSSO Review of Plan Against Statute - Recommendations Scott from CCSSO gave our plan an in -depth review Provided comments summarized on chart handed out Kudos in 3 areas: Choice Ready, Continuou s Improvement theme, Excellent Stakeholder E ngagement Recommendations: Some are easy fixes Instead of being narrow - talk of continuous improvement on an overall scale Need more d etail on pie chart - step by step document Adding paragraph on how we make annual determinations and how our dashboard will work Most states are using summation A -F rating. We are in the minority because we are not making an annual summative rating so need to be very clear how we are making annual determinations Graduation rates must be clear - first and foremos t calculating grad rate using 4 -year cohort then can includ e GED Change of percentage on pie chart for high school - need to add up all 3 elements : State assessment, grad uation rate, EL Plan must more heavily weight academic factors and must be over 50% - we are currently at 45% Take a little f rom Choice Ready and Climate engagement and add to grad uation rate and state assessment ? Discussion: Hard to make this change when we don't see the data and how this will impact schools We have a time element and need to make decisions Do we want more time and only submit in September ? What is our current grad uation rate - 89% overall ? We currently have 25 % on assessment , 10% EL (leave) , grad rate 10% Page 3 Topic: Communication from USDE - New Template Recommend up grad uation rate to 16% Can we split between grad uation rate and GED? 13% grad rate and 8% GED, leav e state assessm ent at 25%, leav e EL at 10% Should we t ake equally from Choice R eady and Engagement or all from one ? Both are at 25% right now Take from each equally 3% from each leaving 22% This would put the total at 51 %, which would meet the letter of the law Need to add clarity to timeline on comprehensive and targeted support Identity comp rehensive schools in March 2018 so they are ready for 2017-2018 year Targeted by 2018-2019 school year Recommended a thesis statement - overarching - strengthen the beginnin g of section Strengthen resource review for lowest performing schools Some were long -term considerations that are not part of the plan but things to think about going forward Putting out RFP for new assessment Nothing we need to worry about now or need to be in the plan - just need to be thinking about it Two additional school quality indicators Create subcommittee groups to work on implementation of these Questioning our rigor Several organizations are going to be re viewing state plans and rating them Effective educators: Intrigued with our creative proposal - if truly going to do th e things we say we are going to , it will be a great idea How are the evaluations used? As they are supposed to be used? Would a teacher t ruthfully receive a 1? Percentage for l ong-term goals Reducing number of non -proficient students - questioning our 33% because most are at 50% Could strengthen on what led us to use 33%. More justification why 33% works for ND based on data would strengthe n Advocating for meeting letter of law and improve over time ; look at adjustments based on data in the future Three areas we need to make changes Choice Ready : Not a required element in ESSA statute - Overarching theme is they are amazed and like the concept Just not rigorous enough, a lot of potential Don't want to pigeon hole students Require tweaking the language and change the word \"pathways \" Be clear in our language and ideally have all students ready for all areas Create a small group to go over this concept and need to be consistent in the 3 areas this topic is discussed in the plan Incorporate Sup erintendent recommendations and Jeff's revisions Wayne Kutzer, r each out to Jeff Fastnacht, Aimee Copas or Russ Ziegler Additional School Quality Indicator: Need to pick either climate or student engagement Can't s ubmit without choosing - plan now states to be announced We have r esearch and language on both so we need to decide First thing they will do is a completeness check Anything not answered - we will have 3 days to fix or it will be rejected Heather Kinsey's recommendation to go with student engagement Student engagement surveys were designed to measure accountability The climate surveys use perception data Russ Riehl will be administering the se surveys within the next week but prefers the engagement over the climate Not sure if any schools have started implementing the surveys Appears as though schools have just received these surveys Have any received the climate survey and how effective w as it? These were completed more for parents and staff rather than students More information that can be used to move schools forward using the student engagement survey Page 4 Topic: Communication from USDE - New Template For the areas in the final column of the chart that we have discussed , will do a quick s urvey and get feedback since the call attendance does not include all members Targeted Support : Huge concern and issue from all states If use process outlined in law, it could be a very large number identified Want to get away from this Rather than look at low performing, look at schools that have gaps and cap it at 10% Scott does not believe we meet letter of the law according to statue Gave ideas on how we can move forward Statute requires states to identify low performing subgroups 5% based on low perf orming subgroups and 5% based on gaps Revise using 10% using gaps Regards to capping: Scott thinks this concept might be approved if we can truly demonstrate all schools are doing a n annual school improvement process and looking at low performing subgroups All work done in AdvancED and create a school improvement plan Once every 5 years is not good enough to show improvement plan Every school should have a sch ool improvement on an annual basis If we can show this, for ESSA purposes, we are only going to tar get 10% to get the additional resources AdvancED would have capacity to upload annual school improvement plans If having low performing subgroups, they would be identified and they would work on them on their own Can use 10% if lowest performing sub groups and see how many are identified and that would determine how we proceed Do not need to score the plans, just need to be able to demonstrate that it is taking place ; it should be happening anyway Some schools are already doing this so it would not be anythi ng additional for schools - may need to formalize a little more but the process is there Either use AdvancED and strengthen this section to show we have a process for each school to have an annual school improvement plan as justification OR go with letter of law, identify for targeted support any school that has a lower performing subgroup than the highest performing for comprehensive support - we have no idea how many schools this would be AdvancED is revising their process to move in this direction anyway Recommend we move in the AdvancED direction Topic: Additional Comments Confusion with business managers on new law - in light of regulations being thrown out regarding school level data It is a requirement in the law - schools need to present school level data This will be recorded on dashboard and reported Will try to get more information out to all PowerPoint says implemented by December of 2017 Topic: Next Steps Please review feedback document, correspondence will be sent to whole committee with brief survey questions regarding: Targeted support Using student engagement as first school quality indicator Minor changes to pie chart at the high school Will work to get all changes put in plan Meet with Governor and Levi next week Next Thursday will post and have 30 -day comment period ESSA Continuous Improvement Subcommittee MINUTES Thursday, September 22 , 2016 | 1:00 PM - 4:00 PM | State Capitol - Sakakawea Room Facilitator Note Taker Bucket Leader Laurie Matzke Shauna Greff Meeting Convened Meeting Adjourned Breakout Room 1:00 pm 4:10 pm Attendance Planning Committee Members Amy Arness Rosemary Hardie Jill Louters Marc Bluestone Julie Jaeger Russ NDDPI Tara Bitz Gwyn Burke Robert Martha ller Lauri Nord Ann Ellefs on Laurie Matz ke Stefanie Two Crow Page 2 Agenda Items Topic: Welcome Presenter: Laurie Matzke Introduced Joe Kolosky who will lead this subcommittee once he begins his employment with NDDPI .

Overview of all sections on template that this group is tasked with . Team of NDDPI staff went to Atlanta to a CCSSO meeting - recap of that meeting . Discuss how this group will report out - asking for volunteers . Informal so want it to be conversational. Topic : Subcommittee Roles, Responsibilities /Expectations Presenter : Laurie Matzke Roles as facilitators is to serve as a guide but look to team members to rep ort out on the topics discussed . Facilitator's main responsibility is to listen, take minutes, facilitate discussion, set realistic agendas, and stay on task . We a sk that everyone be respe ctful of everyone's opinion . There m ay be some homework . Subgroup member responsibility is to address specific sections of the state plan, make recommen dations to the large ESSA group . Superintendent Baesler does have the final decision but this group makes recommendations to the larg er group who then makes recommenda tions to S uperintendent Baesler . Topic: Overview of Sections Presenter : Laurie Matzke One accountability system for ALL schools. ND uses Advan cED statewide so uniform improvement for all schools . Overview of all sections this subcommittee is responsible for : 4.2 Identification of Schools Continuous Improvement for all schools Identification of Schools for Comprehensive Support Identification of Schools for Targeted Support 4.3 Support & Improvement for Low Perform ing Schools Allocation of School Improvement Resources (7% set aside) Interventions Direct Student Services 4.4 Technical Assistance for Improvement of Schools Performance Management and Technical Assistance for Improvement Schools oApproval of Plans oData Collection oMonitoring 6.1 Well -Rounded and Supportive Education for Students Well -Rounded and Supportive Education for Students Early Childhood Education Parent & Community Engagement Statewide System of Support 6.2 Supporting All Students Page 3 Title IV Part A oPlans oData Collection oMonitoring Topic : Discussion of Workgroup Timeline Pres enter : Laurie Matzke Timeline handout overview .

Do what we can and after final reg ulations - make changes if needed . 30-45-day comment period . Based on comments , do we want changes ? Submit by March 7, 2017 Recommendation from Atlanta indicated those that submit first will probably be able to get more things approved so that is our plan. Agreement on timeline proposed - no further discussion on timeline . Topic : Continuous Improvement for all Schools Presenter: Heather Kinsey PowerPoint : All should be engaged in an improvement journey . Gathering survey data on Climate/Culture, Student Engagement - gathering experience data . *Does it make sense to start with explanation of Advan cEd plan before we get into identification of schools? USDE is not asking for this information , this would be ND providing details of what we are doing as the first layer Many states requir e letter grades for each school, t hey will have two systems because that does not meet ESSA Fortunate with local control so we can address how we meet the federal law but we hav e the ability to infuse our philosophy on sch ool improvement for all schools Discussion: Concerns on what this will look like on the bottom end? How important is school in certain places? Things you can do now are just Band -Aids because of no community support. Fear of what the list of improvement schools will look like. These concerns are for all N ative American schools. ESSA does not have punitive sanctions like NCLB had. If not improving in scores, what happens? ESSA is vague and just indicates you need to do a plan. This group needs to recommend what happens if you are identified. Schools that choose not to accept federal funds would still be in the improvement plan through the AdvancED system. MTSS - Schools need to stop talking abou t consequences and talk about interventions instead . Need to focus more on interventions rather than consequences, which align better with AdvancED. This group will be brainstorming the interventions that schools could choose from. USDE will want to see wh at we are doing if schools are in improvement. No mandates but list supports. Provide transparency for all schools and systems. Which schools are most in need of support s and interventions? Where is the system broken and how do we support? Need to identify where they are struggling and what they need. Important to say if this is what this group supports and recommends. NCLB created historical trauma so will have pushback from some schools even though continuous improvement is how all feel. October 21st meeting on ND Indian Ed Advisory Committee: Schools that have a significant number of Indian students, Marc Bluestone will be informing on this topic at that meeting and hope s to come with a common theme to indicate that continuous improvement is the right way to go so we can move forward. Meeting will hopefully make people at ease on the process. A summary of that meeting will be provided at the group meeting the end of October. Page 4 Perception of AdvancED as an improvement system. How will this be approac hed? ESSA School Improvement Handout: School Identification *Do we go strictly by the math and go by a number or look at a natural cut point? Consider the current assessment (smarter assessment) data when making this decision. How would more schools effect the funding? This will influence decision dramatically. Also take into consideration graduation rate. This won't be very many but we need to be aware of this indicator. Very likely these may also already be included in the low er percent. Another consideration is to use one year of results or three years? Strong likelihood we will be going with a new state assessment. If this happens, this would not work and we could not use that data. We would need to use the current data under Smarter Balance d. Are we o nly using achievement for this factor? Lowest 5% based on the factor the state decides to use. State Assessment, graduation rate, additional school quality, EL - there has been no decision made on whether to bring in other factors? Discussion on growth has taken place. Discussion: We need to s tep away from punitive and should look at more schools we can help. More on a scale system - going to support your pl an but how can we spread it out? It is going to c ome down to USDE and their decision with funding. Under NCLB there are dissemination requirements, would this continue? Yes, ESSA requires transparency so this will continue to be required. If information goes out, how does the public not get a perception that the schools are crappy on reservations? Is there a chance that the bottom 24 or quartile will be just like it is under NCLB and be Native American schools? Community perceptions are hard to overcome. How do we counter that? Another cycle of people to be productive members of society and remains a cycle of poverty. Could GED be part of the completion rate? This would help all over the state. Need to have a conversation on what we want in our plan. Under NCLB, schools were al ready eligible before considering graduation rates. Small schools will be more protected under Targeted supports. While large districts will not be under Targeted. Special needs, minority, ELs would still be able to use subgroups . *Funding for School Impro vement Activities: This would roughly be 2.5 million. ESSA law does not state this - USDE overreaching says they are concerned that states will water it down to spread out funding. They say they must give $500,000. Of the 24 schools, only 5 would receive help and no funding for Targeted schools. ND pushed back and said this makes no sense for ND. In Atlanta the question was asked if this will be changed, answer was they may bend but it doesn't appear to be going away. Asked for state to decide amount based in need. They did not feel that flexibility will be given. USDE under ESSA is supposed to be less control. They are able to do it because their authority is limited on only four areas. Accountability, Assessment, Supplement not Supplant, Pilot Projects . There s till are areas they have the authority to do this. We have a proposal as to how this might work. Break it out into a 3 -year period. oTake 24 and chunk it out into 3 years so it would be 8, 8 and 8. oTiered approach - receive grant and diagnostic revie w. oThe others would do their diagnostic review so they can receive funds the following year and again for the 3rd year. It would be $250,000 for the first year 8 schools. If USDE allows to give less than $500,000 and if we are allowed to use a tier ed appro ach, what are thoughts? Discussion: Might we be able to carry it out to year four ? Not with funding but still have supports? Sustainability is needed. If look at systems approach then it is not just interventions , it is a change in systems and will contin ue. When we review plans, we need to look at sustainability of these interventions. So they can continue if funding is no longer there. MTSS, Student Support Strategist, REAs, etc ,. need to be addressed in the plan to be included in the exit plan for schoo ls. Diagnostic review is based on how to build capacity and sustainability. Page 5 Needs to be a 4 to 5 year improvement process. Also contains a leadership component within. Evidence based capacity of the leader to accomplish this. Changing and reshaping the conversation. All 24 will have diagnostic review. Would like to provide all with resources. They will have flexibility to use other Title funds to supplement interventions. Leadership option is vastly different than the NCLB model of replacement of leaders hip. Would it be helpful to c reate a chart to show what this tiered approach would look like ? We don't get anywhere when we suggest what we are thinking right now with the USDE , but we have been told that if we don't like what we see on the final regulatio ns, we should fight back and use our congressional leaders. What happens if it completely changes? Laurie M does not feel this will happen. The best guess after Atlanta is there will be minor flexibility and will consider alternative plans if it is justifi ed. For next meeting a chart or two will be provided to show how this funding might work. Topic : Direct Student Services Provision Presenter : Laurie Matzke CSSO has been provid ing support, AdvancED has also been assisting. *Chiefs for Change has offered to form a workgroup on DSS. They are having a meeting in October and we need to decide if we want to incorporate in our plan. 2 handouts: Direct Student Services and Expanding Equity . This is taking the place of Supplemental Services from NCLB . If chose to do this - set aside 3% of Title I funds for this purpose and they would be made available to comprehensive and targeted improvement . Need to have list of tutoring providers but districts/parents could use their own. Pros: oAlready had discussion these schools have serious needs - any supports are a benefit oAmount of funds for improvement is not enough to help all schools - this would be additional funding and supports for these schools Cons: oA lot more work at the state leve l (vast majority of states are not onboard) oUsing Title I funds for this so reducing districts allocations. Already taking 7% for improvement. This would be an additional 3% on top of that. NDDPI is ok with the work if we want to do this. The big question is the funding. We could ask our grants manager to run some estimated numbers to see how this would affect allocations if this is something we are interested in pursuing. Comparing the 7% required to the 10% if we want to do this. Discussion: How would these funds be disseminated? It would be a school based decision on where the need is. Not just for free -reduced lunch. There would be an application process - need to identify what they want to do. Comprehensive and Targeted schools would be eligible but we could limit it to just comprehensive if we want to. These funds could be used in those eligible schools and not just to Title students. Are there other elementary options beyond tutoring? There should be other opportunities, not just tutoring. If we use d the tier ed approach, could these funds go to all 24 or just the 8 that are getting funding each year ? Comprehensive schools will be the ones receiving these funds primarily. Taking 3% of funding from districts that have interventions that are working, wo uld create a problem and may affect what is currently working. Question the rules that would be in place for these funds. Taking this funding off the top is an issue for districts. Currently have no evidence that the supplemental services under NCLB made a significant difference. So much negativity from SES and states have this concern. Comprehensive schools are probably rural so where would they go to get this tutoring. Would a spreadsheet help? NO Unanimous recommendation to the large committee is to n ot take the additional 3% for Direct Student Services. Page 6 Topic : New Title IV Block Grant Presenter : Ann Ellefson PowerPoint: This will be for the 2017 -2018 school year. Received little to no guidance from the USDE other than the ESSA law. Consolidated a number of programs . Purpose to help improve academic achievement . Have an application process through STARS . Need to include e quitable services of private school in community . What supports do our schools need ? A survey is out there to see where schools would possibly use these funds. Will ther e be a reallocation of Title IV? W ill be structured the same and allow for this but because of the flexibility, probably won't have many f unds available for reallocation. Topic : Q & A and Next Steps Presenter : Laurie Matzke For sections 4.4 and 6.2 - the administration of these programs is what we need to include so it won't take a lot of work from this committee. Reporting out: Four key areas: Concept of continuous improvement - Heather's presentation - she could give an abbreviated presentation to group - anyone to jump in and give summary of comments and recommendations of our subgroup. Discussion: Could dissemination letter have ad ditional information included ? The concern is the transparency from the state identifying these schools because the community percep tion is not good and will hurt N ative American schools. Social media is bad regarding perception of Native American schools. Administrators in the large gro up need to hear these struggles. Need a better representation of the good things that are going on in Native schools. Montana is in the same situation; Laurie will reach out to M ontan to see what they are doing. Marc Bluestone will report : Identifying scho ols - pass out 1 page - who will summarize our conversation and talk about our concerns along with the charts of what our approach will look like? Marcus Lewton Not using school improvement to identify schools and will not be included on the dashboard. DSS - Provide the handout - Rosemary Hardie will report out Title IV - Ann will give brief overview Follow up email on Monday with minutes and Doodle for future meetings: Do we want full morning or afternoon like this or full day? Full days are hard so \u00bd days are better Need to talk about funding for school improvement MTSS Is \u00bd day doable? Yes - choices of morning or afternoon but just half days in October, November, December Date: TBD Location: Time: ESSA Continuous Improvement Subc ommittee MINUTES Monday, October 31 , 2016 | 1:00 PM - 4:00 PM | State Capitol - Sakakawea Room Facilitator Note Taker Bucket Leader Joe Kolosky Angie Thomas Meeting Convened Meeting Adjourned Breakout Room 1:00 PM 4:00 PM Sakakawea Room Attendance Planning Committee Members Amy Arness Marc Bluestone Nikki Gullickson Cheryl Hagar Two Crow McDonough Nancy Burke Lea Kugel Laurie Matzke Robert Marthaller Page 2 Topic: Welcome/Introductions Presenter: Joe Kolosky Joe introduced himself as the lead for this subcommittee.

Through the interim education hearing process, the majority of our senators and representatives now have an understanding of what levers or options are available to states and which they are using to turnaround the lowest performing schools. There were six levers that states were using. Of the six levers, ND only had one lever and that was to give more money. What can this realistically solve? Other levers might be available depending on the results of the 2017 legislative session. How do we identify Title I schools? oIn small districts , need a poverty count of 10 oIn large districts, need to be above district poverty percent oThis funding is meant to level the playing field Are there other funding sources to help out non -Title I schools? oThere are look -alike programs given to these schoolsPage 4 SIG Partnership with School Improvement Network (Stefanie Two Crow) Partnership with School Improvement Network oExternal provider who offer resources to schools and districts in a model referred to as a \"turnaround\" model Four areas this model covers Effective school leadership Effective teachers Personalized learning School culture that promotes excellence oSupport schools in capacity building oAssist with effective school leadership oRoadmap achievement goals through an appraisal process oLook at effective teaching practices oHands -on modeling and coaching oProvide a collaborative culture oPersonalize learning oPromote excellence in school culture oProvide a year's subscription to a platform called Edivate which offers professional development opportunities 1003 (g) funds - $2.2 million oThree year grant process oFirst 6 months get 20 days of on -sight coaching oBoot camp - coaching services oTracking method to ass ist with capacities - Partner Success Manager oSubscription for Edivate oOne question to discuss when go to Washington DC in December: There are two schools applying for SIG funds over the next 3 years Good chance these schools would fall into comprehensive support Would they be exempt because already going through Sc hool Improvement Grant process?

NDDPI would still have an application and rubric to address key components under the law . Looking to this committee for input on what should be required or revised Have a recommended list but not inclusive (ex. School Improvement, REA's ) to show they are reaching out to partner with them All comprehensive schools are small, rural districts so capacity is going to be an issue What can we add to strengthen rubric...sustainability? What will they do after three years to keep the schools going in a positive direction ?Page 3 Suggested by Marc B. - Are schools required to take Title II funds ? What interventions are in place? What weaknesses for comprehensive support ? Outline Title I, Title II, Title IV, and School Improvement funds. Use all resources for the school to show NDDPI what they are going to do to all work together and how all these schools will be used to implement their plan Russ suggested we give extra points on rubric for budget Topic: Overview o f Section 4.3 - Support & Improvement for Low Perform ing Schools Presenter: Laurie Matzke Re-address Identification and Resources for School Improvement Comprehensive Support Targeted Support Subcommittee needs to make recommendations to the whole ESSA Committee on November 30. Revision s will be made for ALL s chools. We want to create one unified accountability system for all schools under ESSA . School dashb oard for Title I and Non -Title I for all schools in ND Will have Advan cED Improvement for all schools Long -term goals apply t o ALL schools within the state Comprehensive Support for Title I Schools: Lowest Performing 5% Schools - Can do ranking based on scores 5% would be about 15 schools - not necessar ily accurate because it will be based on new accountability Looking at : Achievement Growth Climate and Student E ngagement High school graduation (all will go into one score and then will rank them) In addition, schools having a graduation rate of less than 67 % (looking at about 10 ) all but one or two were Title I schools . Exit Criteria - Approximately eight states have posted a draft ESSA plan; most of them are keeping it simple. What got you into identification of comprehensive support is what can get you out of comprehensive support. Can get out by achieving scores above 5% for three consecutive years Graduation rate bumps above 67% Have to make AYP for two consecutive years to bump out Discussion - Is one year sufficient vs . two or three consecutive year s? If they stay for t wo consecutive years it would give them three years of money Feel the school would need three years of support for systemic change Perception is supposed to be a \"school improvement\" process not a \"gotcha\" process ; three years shows we are buying in to you and helping you Three -year term, writing a three -year plan, show three years of continuous improvement before you bump up Hold a Program Improvement Workshop to go through the requirements so schools know what is expected Identif y 5% lowest performing schools, but can't force distri cts to apply for funds . If you are identified as a low performing school and you choose not to participate, you give up Title I funds and school improvement funds Our plan is to have a liaison identified within NDDPI where they would be on all the calls and would be the \"go to\" person to help them, answer questions and walk them through processes to provide individual s upport and technical assistance to focus on the 15 schools Hopeful for revised timeline with dates pushed back for identifying schools fo r school improvement TARGETED SUPPORT - Every three y ears Laurie shared data Low Performing Subgroup l ooking for schools with one or more of their subgroups performing as poorly as the highest performing comprehensive school ; data shows 10% will be higher when everything is on the dashboardPage 4 Asked for list of schools with one or more subgroups wher e performance was 10% or lower EXIT CRITERIA - Low Performing Subgroups Used 10% as threshold; many s chool with subgroups below 10% Real data is going to be significantly worse than this with all crite ria on the dashboard this may go up to 20 % How many more sc hools will have subgroups below 20%? Only t aking into consideration four subgroups under N CLB oEconomically Disadvantaged oIEP Students oLEP Student s oEthnic Student s Under ESSA w ill also be looking at: oHomeless Students oFoster Care Students oMilitary Family Students We will never have money to give 167 or over 200 schools a grant We also r un into a capacity issue; focus our efforts on 15 schools but don't have enough staff to focus on 200 schools All the ones in YELLOW (shown on handout) are non -Title I schools Discussion : Do we identify only Title I school s for targeted schools or any school? Most states are again taking a simplistic approach - exit when they move above the performance of the highest performing school in comprehensive support - what got you in can get you out. Need to decide one, two, or three consecutive years Targeted Support is annual Comprehensive Support is every three years Resources available for schools identified for improvement Bonus year of 2.2 million if we don't have to identify school till 2018 -19 Option 1 Take comprehensive schools and give them $350,000 ea ch over a 3 -year period then set aside $1 mi llion for Targeted Schools . State Set -aside July 1, 2017 2.2 million July 1, 2018 2.2 million July 1, 2019 2.2 million July 1, 2020 2.2 million 8.8 million available Comprehensive Schools - 3 year Identification 5% Title I Schools - 15 350,000 X15 = 5,250,000 Targeted Schools 50,000 x 20 = $1,000,000 1,000,000 x 3 years = 3,000,000 Option 2 State Set -aside July 1, 2017 2.2 million July 1, 2018 2.2 million July 1, 2019 2.2 million July 1, 2020 2.2 million 8.8 million available Comprehensive Schools - 3-year Identification Page 5 Early Childhood Education - Early Learning in the Every Student Succeeds Act - Tara Bitz 5% Title I Schools - 15 500,000 X 15 = 7,500,000 Year 1 School Year 2018 -19 200,000 X 15 = 3,000,000 Year 2 School Year 2019 -20 150,000 X 15 = 2,250,000 Year 3 School Year 2020 -21 150,000 X 15 = 2,250,000 Targeted Schools No funds available Set aside $1 million for Targeted Schools and make it competitive of 200 schools identified ; only 20 would get a grant . For 15 sc hools g ive $500,000 a year for three years ; when divide d out, not a lot of money if we expect them to contract it out . Year 1 - 200,000 Year 2 -150,000 Year 3 -150,000 Noth ing left for Targeted Support so no funds for Targeted Support and focus only on the comprehensive schools . Discussion on Targeted - We would not fund any of them and IF we did it would be very minimal . Discussion on whether non -Title schools have the sense of urgency; feel that they do because they are left u nnoticed and may be left behind . VOTE: #1 Do we think the targeted identification should apply to all schools or only Title I schools ? All Schools - Russ Riehl , Julie Jaeger, Amy Arness, and Marcus Lewton Only Title I Schools - Rosemary Hardie, Cheryl Hager , and Marc Blueston e ** Marc Bluestone and Cheryl Hager changed their vote to All schools** VOTE: Continuous Improvement Focus Funds on just Comprehensive - 0 votes Some for Compre hensive and Some for Targeted - Russ Riehl, Julie Jaeger, Amy Arness, Marcus Lewton, Rosemary Hardie, Cheryl Hager, and Marc Bluestone Laurie asked the group to identify someone to report out to the committee; someone who would be able to be balanced and give both sides . Amy Arness nominated Rosemary Hardie to report out and committee agreed. Superintendent Baesler - Called in and Laurie gave her an update regarding the vote. Kirsten agreed with the recommendation so all school s can improve in North Dakota; m indset is more state responsibility plan and what are we going to do to stay focused and help all school s. Superintendent Baesler also asked about equity and stated it is d efined differently by culture and people. For education, what opportuni ties are we giving our students? What do students in every z ip code need? She felt that we need to make opportunity for all students and give them access to even more opportunit ies; move the needle on areas like electives, dual credit, fine arts, and AP. Superintendent Baesler will be meeting with the Trump tran sition team to discuss ESSA regulations . North Dakota charted course for state plan is to be a responsible leader . 6.1 Topic: Statewide System of Support - Early Childhood Education, Equity Presenter: Tara Bitz & Joe Kolosky Page 6 Tara reported there ar e very few changes with ESSA. Following are t hree key pieces they are concentrating on: 1.Expand high -quality learning 2.More focus on preschool - 3rd grade 3.Supporting educators with high focus on professional development States & LEAs are required to include on their report cards the number and percentage of children enrolled in preschool programs . Local Education Agencies are also responsible for developing agreements with Head Start p rograms to coordinate services (data sharing, transition activities , and special education ). Provisions to Support Early Learning in Three Main Ways oExpanding Access to High -Quality Early Learning oEncouraging Alignment & Collabo ration from birth through 3rd grade oSupporting Educators Title I funds may be used for oProfessional lea rning for early childhood staff oMino r repairs or remodeling to accommodate preschool program oHealth, nutrition, and other services for children in a Title I preschool program To support children at risk of failing to meet the State's standards by improving quality of K -3 education Preschool Development Grants : New discretionary grant for States to improve the coordination and quality of early childhoo d education programs for children birth to age 5 Jointly administered by the Federal ED and HHS Builds on original PDG program authorized in 2014 oND did not apply for the 2014 PDG oND anticipate s applying for the 2016 -17 PDG Initial Grant New ways SEAs and LEAs may support early learning through Title II Part A : Joint PD learning to increase ability of principals & other school leaders to support teachers, EC educators & other professionals Identifying students who are gifted & talented, and implementing in structional practices that support the education of such students, including early entrance to kindergarten Opportunities for principals, and early learning leaders/teachers to participate in joint efforts to address the transition to elementary school The ultimate goal is to have an O ffice of Early Learning. If we get the preschool development grant and create an Office of Early L earning, we can bring all early learning together. All students should have equitable academic opportunities - Joe Kolosky North Dakota Department of Public Instruction's Vision Statement is \"All students will graduate choice ready with the knowledge, skills, and disposition to be successful in whatever they choose to do, whether they pursue a post -secondary degree, enroll in a technical college, enter the workforce, or join the military. \" It is ND's responsibility to provide an equitable education that ensures all students excel and succeed. Equity = Uniqueness of support in the light of the setting for the student Equality = Uniform insertion of supports ESSA and Equity - Areas of Focus Teacher Equity Fiscal Equity and T ransparency Equitable Access to Educational Opportunities for All Students Teacher Equity - What does this mean? Highly Qualified Teachers in Every Classroom Fiscal Equity and Transparency Stakeholders knowing where their tax dollars are going Ability to have a conversation on fiscal allocations based on dataPage 7 Ability to compare and contrast fiscal allocation on the local level Stakeholders have the responsibil ity to be informed and local district is spending dollars efficiently Should ther e be a discussion on dashboard under general information regarding dollars and what they are being used for? Equitable Access to Educational Opportunities All students should have equitable academic opportunities District population and funding should not hinder students ' access to opportunity Courses, such as Pre -K Advanced Placement, the Arts, STEM, and Physical Education that promote healthy lifestyles, 21st Century Skills, and academic skills Support students who drop out Programming to aid with transitioning students Equitable educational opportunities are a right for all ND students Topic: Overview of Section 6.1 - Well-Rounded & Supportive Education for Students Review of Rough Draft Template 6.1 Well -Rounded and Supportive Education for Students 6.2 Supporting All Students Q&A and Next Steps: Joe Kolosky will get one -page summary out to group .

Betsy Deal added that during AdvancED external reviews when looking at student performance, th e focus is on gaps Do not want to use negative verbiage -call it what we want, use supportive verbiage Example \"Local school district awarded an educational support grant to strengthen systems and enable all students to succeed\" Recommend to the large ESSA group: Use targeted ESEA flexibility waiver which identifies focus schools and look for gaps Cap at 10% so every school identified gets a grant Topic: Overview o f Section 4.3 - Support & Improvement for Low Performing Schools Presenter: Joe Kolosky A request was made to not use the term \"low performing school\" We can use whatever verbiage we would like Resources/Supports for Comprehensive Schools: Within Tier (Strategy) 1 - Continue work with SIG schools which provides coaching and consultation service s to help schools conduct a needs assessment an d create a plan for improvement Tier II - All schools identified will be eligible for $350, 000 grant used over three years Tier III - NDDPI will provide guidance, support and training. These are lowest performing schools which lack capacity Resources/Supports for Targeted Schools: Tier I - NDDPI is proposing to build into our State ESSA plan a partnership with the ND REAs to roll out MTSS support to all schools identified. NDDPI will pool state resources within multiple programs: oTitle I oTitle II oTitle III oTitle IV oSpecial Education oSchool Improvement Tier II - All school s identified will be eligible for $50,000 grants each year they are identified Tier III - NDDPI will provide guidance, support , and train ing Use the word \"Action\" instead of \"Tier\" Next steps: After initial vote in February, write a letter to Luke and CC all REA's, with a formal proposal in writing Request a proposal from them as well We can then determine the cost Work with AdvancED as to not duplicate information Exit strategy to be determined oWant to look at other states plans Topic: Overview of Section 4.4 - Technical Assistance for Improvement Schools Presenter: Laurie Matzke Within Waiver application, identified priority and focus schools will be required to submit an improvement plan to identify interventions that will be implemented to address the identified needs and challenges The interventions are separated into categorie s to include: oInterventions for Low Achieving Students oInterventions Geared for English Learners (EL) Students oInterventions Geared for Native American Students oInterventions Geared for Students with Disabilities The committee agreed these interventions we re a valuable supplement for the planPage 4 Q&A and Next Steps: Next l arge ESSA meeting will either be February 7th or February 8th Russ will report out to large ESSA group on 4.2 and 4.3 Cheryl will report out on 6.2 Date: February 7 or 8 Location: TBD Time: TBD Will need to update the information Topic: Overview of Sec tion 6.1 - Well-Rounded and Supportive Education for Students Presenter: Ann Ellefson ESSA Title IV, Part A new formula grant Estimated Federal Title Allocation of $2,425,000 Purpose of grant is to improve academic achievement by increasing the capacity of states educational agencies (SEAs), local educational agencies (LEAs), schools, and local communities to: oProvide all students with access to a well -rounded education; oImprove school conditions for student learning; and oImprove the use of technology in order to improve the academic achievement and digital literacy of all students Some key areas to highlight: 1% set -aside (estimated $24,250) must be set -aside for administrative costs An opportunity is proposed for an additional 4% set -aside (estimated $97,000) for states to provide monitoring, training, technical assistance, and capacity building to: oSupport LEAs to improve school conditions for student learning, including activities that create safe, healthy, and affirming school environments oSupport LEAs to effectively use technology to improve the academic achievement and digital literacy oSupport strategies to support LEAs to engage parents, families, and communities Wide scope on how funds can be used Can transfer funds into Title I, Title II, etc. Vote on funding: (none, 2% or 4%) None - 1 2% - 0 4% - 6 Topic: Overview of Sec tion 6.2 Supporting All Students Presenter: Ann Ellefson Section VI, Key Initiatives to develop a choice ready student: Great Teachers/Leaders - Professional Development/Mentors, ESPB Licensure, Professional Learning Partnerships with NDREAs, NDLEAD, and NDUnited Continuous Improvement - Increase Academic Proficiency, AdvancED, School Improvement Process, NDMTSS Equity - Fiscal Equity, Teacher Equity, and Opportunities for Equitable Access and Participation for Students Local Educational Opportunities - Well Rounded Education, Student Engagement, School Culture/Climate, Waivers, Innovative Learning Early Childhood Education - Office of Early Learning, Preschool Funding and Transition Supports, Pre - kindergarten Content Standards, Kindergarten Entry AssessmentESSA Continuous Improvement Subc ommittee Conference Call Meeting Minutes Wednesday, February 1 , 2017 | 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM | State Capitol - 11th Floor Conference Room Facilitator Note Taker Bucket Leader Joe Kolosky Angie Thomas Meeting Convened Meeting Adjourned Breakout Room 3:00 PM 4:00 PM Attendance Planning Committee Members Amy Arness Marc Bluestone Nikki Gullickson Cheryl Two Crow McDonough Nancy Burke Lea Kugel Laurie Matzke Robert Marthaller Page 2 Date: February 8, 2017 Location: Ramada Hotel - Bismarck Time: 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM Topic: Welcome/Roll Call Presenter: Joe Kolosky Joe introduced himself Other attendees: Amy Arness - representing ND Parent Teacher Association Marc Bluestone - representing Middle School Principals Nikki Gullickson - representing ND Parent Teacher Association Cheryl Hagar - representing Title I Targeted Schools Julie Jaeger - representing ND Association for Gifted Children Russ Riehl - representing Middle School Principals NDDPI Employees Topic : Feedback from CCSSO Sponsored ESSA Meeting Presenter: Joe Kolosky Joe provided an overview of the meeting, attended by several NDDPI staff , in Washington DC on January 26, 2017. The purpose of the meeting wa s for states to have their ESSA plans reviewed with immediate feedback and suggestions. Joe attended the meeting for Continuous Improvement and received verbal feedback. The reviewe rs provided very few comments and no action steps. They were pleased to see our ESSA planning include d tribal stakeholders and parent groups. Two key suggestions were: Include strong stakeholder engagement to support rationale for recommendations/decisions in the plan Clearly explain that strategies implemented are used to build capacity at state and loca l level Topic : Language from the Law Presenter : Joe Kolosky Joe provided a handout on ESSA law for Targeted Support and Identification of Schools. The l aw does not specifically give instruction on how to identify schools for T argeted support. The l aw states that the State is responsibl e for identification measures; h owever, the regul ations give recommendations on T argeted support identification. A brief summary of the C omprehensive schools (lowest performing 5%) identified would be approximate ly 13 schools and T argeted schools would be appro ximately 40 schools. Targeted support would be capped at 10% lowest performing. This capping would be similar to the ESEA waiver the s tate previous ly applied for and was granted. Topic: Capping Targeted Support Schools Presenter: The subcommittee discussed the recommendation to move forward with the decision to cap Targeted schools at 10% or to reconsider and follow the law by identifying all schools in North Dakota. Topic: Options Presenter: The subcommittee decided t o leave the 10% cap as it will allow more funds to support identified schools. We will make any revisions if necessary in the future. Topic: Goals Presenter: Laurie Matzke discussed the option to use the goals of the accountabili ty system as exit criteria for Comprehensive and T argeted schools. This decision will be discussed in futur e meetings as exit criteria has not been established at this time. The goals are in draft form and will be presented to the large group at the February 8th meeting. Topic: February 8, 2017 Meeting Presenter: Russ Riehl will speak to the large group on the recommendations for identification and exit criteria Cheryl Hagar will speak to the large group on the recommendations on Title IV State set -asideESSA Standards, Assessment, Accountability and Reporting Subcommittee Minutes Monday, September 19, 2016 | 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM | State Capitol - Sakakawea Room Facilitator Note Taker Bucket Leader Laurie Matzke Angie Thomas Meeting Convened Meeting Adjourned Breakout Room 10:00 am 3:00 pm Sakakawea Room Attendance Planning Committee Members Sonja Butenhoff Tracy Friesen Wayne Kutzer Amiee Copas Robert Grosz Richard Rothaus Teresa Desai Cheryl Hagar Wendy Sanderson Jeff Fastnacht Julie Jaeger L Anita Thomas Jennifer Fremstad Melanie Kathrein Russ Ziegler Jody French Tracy Korsmo NDDPI Lodee Arnold Lucy Fredericks Gerry Teevens Kirsten Baesler Greg Gallagher Rob Bauer Ann Ellefson Robert Marthaller Tammy Mayer Valerie Fischer Laurie Matzke Beth Larson -Steckler Page 2 Topic: Overview of Agenda Presenter: Laurie Matzke Review of Timeline handout: Does meeting once a month September through December seem realistic in terms of having enough time to discuss/make recommendations to the large ESSA group? oDetermined timeline seemed reasonable at this time. Will tweak if needed . oDecided to extend the length of the meeting to a full day versus 4 hours. Topic : Subcommittee Roles, Responsibilities & Expectations Presenter: Laurie Matzke A handout was provided listing the roles and characteristics of a facilitator, attributes of effective committee members, and the purpose of each workgroup . Each subcommittee will have a spokesperson who will present information back to the large ESSA group regarding committee recommendati ons. Bob Grosz agreed to be this subcommittee's representative. Topic : Overview of Section 1.0 Goals & Measures of Progress Presenter : Laurie Matzke Suggested Goals/Measures of Progress : Long term achievement goals Graduation rate English Language proficiency Topic: Overview o f Section 3.0 Standards & Assessment Presenter: Laurie Matzke Review content and structure of current state academic content standards State assessments Topic : Overview of Section 4.0 Accountability, Support, & Improvement for Schools Presenter: Laurie Matzke Suggested methods of identifying accountability/school improvement: School dashboard Report card Additional school quality factorsPage 3 Topic : Discussion on Section 4.0 Accountability, Support, and Improvement for Schools Presenter : Heather Kinsey ESSA requires that we establish an accountability system based on multiple indicators: Academic achievement Another academic indicator (which must include graduation rates at the high school level) English proficiency At least one other valid, reliable, comparable, and statewide indicator of sch ool quality or student success The survey results for additional school quality factors resulted in 25 additional factors. From those it was broken down further into ten factors: Commitment to school improvement Use of evidence for planning, organizational learning, and accountability Student engagement Approaches to curriculum and instruction School climate/culture Teacher quality/qualifications School connectedness/sense of belonging Job-embedded, meaningful professional development School leader quality/qualifications Infrastructure alignment/resource allocation To help narrow the recommendations e ven further, we must ask ourselves: Can valid & reliable data be collected statewide for all school types/classifications? Is there evidence that improving this measure will directly impact student achievement? Will this measure allow for meaningful differ entiation? Can results be disaggregated by student groups? Does this measure align with ND's vision? Does it promote continuous improvement? Narrowing the recommendations School Climate/Culture: PROS oCritical factor of school quality oActionable & meaningful data oSurveys currently part of ND continuous improvement/accreditation oCost effective CONS oPerception data -relative to situational context & normative expectations oPotential motivation/pressure to inflate response to improve school standing oLimited ability to disaggregate by student population Additional Points/Comments: Need to define the difference between climate and culture. How would we make this relatable to all schools? Positive climate would equal positive culture? Need to find the right tool to measure so schools don't feel threatened and will report the actual response. Students, parents and staff are important to climate/culture.Page 4 Student Attendance: PROS oImportant factor -especially for ND lowest performing schools oActionable & meaningful data oCurrently collected oCost effective CONS oPotential motivation/pressure to falsify data to improve school standing oLimited school/district control oLimited use of opportunity afforded under ESSA Additional Points /Comments : Attendance is a critical issue and a key driver to student success. Potential of having cost involved as this requires new data collection points. Will require student engagement to collect valuable and reliable data. Student Suspension/Expulsion: PROS oImportant factor oActionable & meaningful data oCurrently collected oCost effective CONS oPotential motivation/pressure to falsify data to improve school standing oLimited use of opportunity afforded under ESSA? Additional Points /Comments : We can control suspension/expulsion versus attendance and it is measurable . Tracking truancy can tie to dropout prevention. Having control over suspension/expulsion will assist in helping us keep those students in school. Getting schools/buildings to agree on what sus pension/expulsion means is challenging. Which can we truly control out of attendance, suspensio n/expulsion, and student engagement? Attendance is more of a parent control, but we can control suspension/expulsion -do what we can to keep the student in school. Student Engagement: PROS oDriving factor of student success & school quality oActionable & meaningful data oDirectly aligned with ND continuous improvement/accreditation oInnovative use of ESSA Flexibility oExperience vs. Perception CONS oNew data collection requirement oPotential motivation/pressure to inflate response to improve school standing -especially if linked to student identifier oCost? Additional Points /Comments : Student engagement is the strongest driver to get student success -more likely to come to school if engaged . Providing this data to schools/teachers will drive change in the classroom. Other states are currently piloting student engagement surveys. Changing climate/culture can have immediate impact in the classroom and on student engagement. All are tied together.Page 5 Polls for School Quality: Truancy? ement? Unanimous Yes Suspension/Expulsion? 8 No; 1 Yes We need to focus on where the system is broken and which areas need the most support and resources. Move forward with those items we feel passionate about . Want school dashboard to be positive . Topic : Discussion on Section 3.0 Standards Update Presenter : Greg Gallagher Under States application: Expectation to have section on standards & assessment Academic expectations and the matter in which they measure them Peer Review for state assessment and state's alternate assessment oSmarter Balance for general oDLM for alternate oSubmitted and so far so good Submit template in March Final release in July RFP going out after March, resolution by August Constitutional Mandates: Uniform system of free publ ic schools throughout the state To prevent illiteracy, secure a reasonable degree of uniformity in the course of study Legislative Mandates: All approved schools must meet curricular requirements set forth in state law (NDCC 15.1 -06-06) Each instructional unit in approved high schools will meet or exceed the state content standards (NDCC 15.1 -21-02) Committee Activity Summary: Two committees: one for English language arts/literacy & one for mathematics These committees will study the effects of implementi ng the 2011 approved academic content standards in each content area and draft any revisions to improve the structure and content Content Standards Committee Structure: General education, K -12 Special education settings, K -12 Higher education English lear ner settings Career technical education Title I schoolwide and targeted assistance schools Committee Member Duties: Review content and structure of standards Review standards from other sources Examine and set structural design for proper articulation, breadth of inclusion, depth of knowledge, internal and cross -grade integrity, presentation of sequence, and support doc umentation of content standards Discussion, voting, preparing multiple drafts, etc.Page 6 Every Student Succeeds Act, 2015 This act is t he reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 Reaffirms the requirem ent for states to develop own academic content standards Requires states to adopt content standards aligned to college and career readiness expectations Each state shall provide an assurance that the State has adopted challenging academic content standards and aligned academic achievement standards (align curriculum to content standards) Each State shall d emonstrate that the State academic standards are aligned with entrance requirements for credit -bearing coursework in the system of public higher education and relevant State career an d technical education standards The Secretary shall not have authority to mandate, direct, control, coerce, or exercise any direction or supervision over the s tandards adopted or implemented Purpose of Academic Content Standards: Present concise statements of what students are expected to know/do within a sub ject at a specified grade level Establish guidelines for local school district curriculum Content standards are NOT curriculum The State establishes these standards Local school d istricts determine local curriculum Additional Points/Comments: Greg suggested adding alignment activity to the report card -statement of assuran ce. This committee doesn't need to do anything regarding the template for standards but may want to incorporate the meaning of standards for accountability. Do superintendents , teachers, etc. want to see an option in ESSA where they can choose to give either the state assessment or ACT/SAT? Topic: Discussion on Section 4.0 Dashboards & Report Cards Presenter: Laurie Matzke Dashboard : Reveals and reflects the school's progress toward the vision for the state education system (Summary or Overview) Achievement on state assessment High school graduation rates Progress of ELs in achieving proficiency At least one additional measure of school quality Need to be publicly available and transparent Report Card : Detailed information and data that serves as the compliance reporting instrument in support of federal and state regulations (In Depth) Achievement on state assessment High school graduation rates Progress of ELs in achieving proficiency Achievement by subgroup 95% participation rate Need to be publ icly available and transparent Additional Points/Comments: What a dditional elements on dashboard beyond what is required? Minimal funding available What methods do we want to use on our dashboard? Numbers, words, letter grades, symbols, colors, etc. Acce ssibility requirements important and will be built into RFP .Page 7 Likes: Staff attendance has high rating for impact Important for schools/teachers to own the dashboard Colors are useful /graphics are nice Equal amount of white space Showing progression is good Modesto City dashboard is well liked -3 year comparison is nice Graphs/charts Core was liked as well without school quality index number Trends and arrows are liked Dislikes: Do not like letter grades Too many items (not sure what they all mean) Don't want repetitive charts, graphs, etc. Colors -need to choose colors wisely (yellow proceed with caution?) Learning Opportunities: (a bucket for more flexibility to include) Criteria Attendance AP Courses Suspension Follow -up survey on what was liked/disliked on the example dashboards will be sent out Next Steps: Next meeting: Will discuss dashboards & a ssessments Homework: Read the ND Assessment Task Force Final Report and be prepared to discuss at next meeting Next meeting is large ESSA group meeting on September 30, 2016 at the Baymont Inn in Mandan. Bob Gros z agreed to be the spokesperson to report back to the large ESSA group regarding additional school quality factors.

Report Card is more indepth: Detailed information and data that serves as the compliance -reporting instrument in support of federal and state regula tions. Both must be publicly available and transparent. Reviewed required key elements on Dashboard and Report Card. Need to consider weight given to each element within accountability system. Greater weight must be given to academic factors. Topic : Acco untability Indicators Presenter : Heather Kinsey Do we want to define Indicator types/levels? Using asterisks will be beneficial . Need to define in the plan and be clear . Who is our audience? Initial audience is accountability committee . Use an asterisk with a clear definition so it's transparent . Plan does not need to be a long plan that no one can understand . Simple and clear would be beneficial so parents and everyone can understand. How do we make it visually understandable with asterisks ? It should not be cumbersome. Need to be able to define the elements that are in the calculation . Need to categorize : what is on the dashboard what is required what is not required but we want included as useful One -page direction or interpretation guide should be very simple and then also an in depth version . Dashboards will be created for every individual school. How do we compare if schools are all going to be different? Comparative data is being used now along with individual data . They need to be able to find their data easily and needs to be user friendly . Need to keep the data simple . Start with what we need and it can grow from there . Still need to categorize . Achievement, Data, Report Cards, EL and additional school qualify factors are all required and reported. We have informally mentioned these but do we want to come up with definitions? Formalize criteria? Circle back to that . States are creating a framework; does ND want to do that? Taking what we have been talking about and putting them into ca tegories . The indicators need to be detailed out and we need to define those . The template is kind of a framework already . Really need to dig in and apply definitions to the indicators: Page 3 Measures and metrics, the ESSA requirement and how it applies to the i mprovement plan. Laurie and Heather can create a framework based on our discussions after this meeting and bring back to this committee for input. Because of time restraints, putting something together to bring back to the committee makes sense. AdvancED has school quality factors that are directly linked and aligned with performance standards. All schools in ND will be hearing and learning about - this is an organizing structure. AdvancED has done research and background on this. This may help in definin g climate and culture and also school quality. We should link back to this so there is a connection . Does the group want to dive into definitions or prefer a first draft that is brought back to the group? Group input is fine but group drafting doesn't necessarily work well. Elements we know are required: Achievement on state assessment Growth High school grad rates English Learners - score on access? Can be on growth and other factors. School quality indicators: Climate/Culture or Student engagement? Mold together or be just one? Smarter Balance for one more year, so will need to use Spring of 2017 for first determination of these factors. Is the group comfortable with the subgroup of ELs being the only subgroup taken into account? This info will not be on the dashboard bu t is reported. Need to decide what is reported and what is on the dashboard. The dashboard can have a high level and then also dive deeper if more information is being s earched for. Do we as a group want to collect information on these subgroups and put on the dashboard ? Do we want to be accountable for this data being reported and part of our accountability? Do we put all schools in this same predicament? Are we only being held accountable for those students that can reach growth? What do we need to do for accountability? What do we need and want to have on the dashboard? What is on the report card ? Focus today on accountability . Achievement on state assessment. What d oes the law require? Law required we report on all on the report card but states can decide which they can use for accountability -the only one required is ELs. Not just schools' perception but also a parent's perception. Accountability will still be requi red for Special Ed students? Is it our choice which achievement data we use? Do we set benchmarks? Which subgroup in each district is determining whether they meet that benchmark ? How much do we want to dictate at the state level what those levels are? How much do we want to use for accountability? We can still report but will this data be used for accountability? NCLB was all in one bucket as a total - we don't need to do this anymore. Need to be based on continuous improvement but not used for accountabil ity. Still need to report on dashboard because they are important even though they are not the triggers. ESSA must identify schools for comprehensi ve support and targeted support. Need to dig into this - comprehensive will be lowest performing . Targeted wi ll be high performing but lower performing subgroups. Even though not an accountability factor but do fit into improvement status . This would be accountability for the subgroups. To be identified for these Comprehensive supports they must be Title I School s. Any school can be identified for Targeted support . Some schools did not accept Title I funds so they would not be identified for improvement in the past . Schools still had T itle I teachers, they just used local funds for them . Need to double check on wh o can be identified for Targeted supports. Funding will be an issue . Just don't know if there will be any funds for Target ed Supports for schools . Comprehensive Supports will use up these funds . Conflicting information on lowest 5% : no guidance has been given not clear what it is based onPage 4 is it set by the state? is it based on all of our indicators? Do we want to add accountability factor s for other subgroups? Or just for ELs? Economically disadvantaged will be reported but doesn't need to be used. Race - do we just pick out one race to report? Need to discuss . Students with disabilities - will there be concern if we report on ELs but not students with disabilities? Under ESSA - states must incorporate all of these subgroups for accountability and report o n these subgroups . The formula for identifying the schools for comprehensive supports is determined by the state . Based on this formula, the lowest 5% are identified . Need to decide what is reported for accountability and what is on the dashboard? What is important for parents to be able to see? We need to decide on the formula because they are all reported and the dashboard can come later. Which indicators are important? What is the math behind the scenes to calculate this formula? Difference between EL pe rformance which is reported and EL proficiency assessment which is what is required on ESSA . Are there states that have determined the math? Draft from SC CA has it but Heather has no details KY incorporated the most with a nonacademic piece: achievement, growth, GAP accounts for 70% We can get really deep on this formula . All of details need to be discussed with regard to the formula . We can define indicators and how to display, but we need to dig into the measures and how we are using them as part of the formula. ND doesn't have anyone in staff to do this formula. For NCLB this was contracted out. We currently don't have that. Maybe we need to contract with someone to run scenarios regarding this math. Summative rating : Every sch ool would have a summative rating Math behind the scenes, and they will be identified but we are not going to rate each school Will the USDE allow all of these indicators without a rating? Should we push to not have that rating? Will the legislature let u s not have a rating? Does it have to be a rank? Can it be proficient and not proficient rather than a number? Could we use categories or different term for growth model? Again , this is all coming from the formula. Do not want to see a list in rank order b ut ok with some type of summative rating. Not hearing consistency. Some would ok to have a soft rating, while others saying no summative rating. Ranking means something for accountability . Need to be able to rank the schools . What is the difference between school 1 and school 21? What would be the difference? They may be so slight and is that necessary? Some crave the ranking but others tear it apart. People make large decisions and spend lots of funds with regard to these rankings even if the difference is small. Not sure rankings work. Would the higher ranked schools be complacent? Do we rank schools or label schools? NCLB labeled schools. Need to figure out the formula, do we need to use this formula to label/rank schools. In each class, students are proficient and not ranked 1 -20. Why can't we use schools this way instead of ranked? Don't need to know which ranking you are but need to know which schools are proficient. Package we choose to use is important. Percentages are messy. Is there c onsensus on what we don't want: percent letter grades colors Can we use words as a summative rating with behind the scenes numbers? The math behind the words might still be subject to open records so the data will be there if someone wa nts to rank if they so choose. Page 5 KY labeled their schools as: distinguished, proficient, and needs improvement based on their formula . They then define which schools labeled as needs improvement are identified for supports. Topic: Non-Academic Indicators Presenter: Heather Kinsey Move to next agenda as we didn't get to this at this meeting . Topic : Achievement & Growth Presenter: Dr. Mark Eggert Low growth, low achieving will be where the 5% will come from . To calculate the learning index: Start from where they are at currently . How do we measure this? Growth matters more than achievement for bottom half of state . Maintaining achievement but still showing growth for top is important . Student Learning Earning index determines the impact and allowable un der ESSA . Formula must be applied to all schools equally . You then can differentiate by what you choose to measure . Easy to determine achievement data. The growth data would be a year behind . You can set it up fall and spring as intervals to measure growth or the spring to the following spring. We will need to use this spring's data (2016 -2017 for growth and 2017 for achievement) . Need to use the learning index number to determine overall accountability . ESSA requires majority of weight must be on assessments not achievement which includes achievement and growth. Don't revert back to NCLB - move forward and us e multiple measures for accountability . You can choose to do achievement and growth separately but the learning index number combines them . There are different models. ND needs to identify the model under which you want to operate . What makes the most sense to schools and districts that will guide continuous improvement. To determine where the school s tarts is based on achievement data but then that data is not used to go forward. Going forward, use the specific formula based on that schools starting point. What is the formula to determine the starting points? Take an achievement score and provide a val ue point . Mean achievement score from prior year is then used . Then ranked f rom top to bottom - this rank will determine which quartile they fit into and therefore which formula to use to determine achievement and growth. Based on the prior year data to se e where each school's starting point is. How do you handle different configured schools? Law requires annual testing in grades 3 -8. If you have odd grade configuration, could rank all individual by grade then aggregate your total. This will identify bottom 5% of schools. Every student has value points . Is there a perfect formula for each school? No but this is much better . Using the growth factor assists low achieving schools. If we want to use this process, need to discuss all of the issues including grade configuration in using this. Could use ranking based on grade configuration. Needs to be fair and consistent. Achievement data is state assessment? Growth achievement can it be on other assessments. Can use one assessment to determine achievement and growth. Can use multiple assessments: one for growth, one for achievement Assessments must pass peer review at Federal level . NWEA growth assessment as a standalone will not pass peer review . State will pay for interim assessment for each school . Could say ACT makes up a percentage of indicator for high schools . Keep it as simple as possible . Need to report by subgroup on the report card but don't have to give weight to it. One formula is applied to every subgroup throughout the school - you must use a consistent formula . Ok with a summative rating if its wor ks and not a ranking, subgroups are not really a part of the summative rating. They tie in based on the overall score. ACT grade 11 - no grow th data included . ACT just apply standard deviation to receive point value . High School has no growth measure. Page 6 If I am a low performing school, I am not using ACT because there are no points for growth. The assessment is used to determine the point value t o revert it to a common value . It is possible but bot h must pass peer review by the f eds. Need policy guidelines for using a certain assessment . Why would a high school ever choose to use the ACT? Great policy question - would need to create an incentive to use ACT rather than state assessment . Supt Baesler doesn't want an incentive but wants district s to have the ability to choose. Test grades 8 and then not until 11. At the secondary level there is never any growth data. High schools will never benefit from this. Still being measured on grad rates and achievement so not moving forward. Schools data is then based on Junior testing data. Could add in a college and career ready option. Redefining \"Ready\" does this. Achievement data based on 11 th grade, so w ouldn't it need to be same cohort. Measuring readiness by senior level should be included. Need to consider a vehicle to consider college and career readiness for high schools. Many other states are using this factor. Graduation is not synonymous with bein g ready. Need to create a system for those schools that are graduating career ready and not just for those who are college ready. Will there be options for sc hools to use different measures? Introduce certain metric s to show career readiness versus college readiness. Value points would be different based on what they are pursuing. Add to next agenda : full discussion on the college and career ready option . Elementary level - do we like this student learning index model or do we want to look at another model that separates growth and achievement? Information is valuable so seeing the other model would be helpful. Page 7 Topic : Presentation on Subgroups within ESSA Presenter s: Lodee Arnold - EL Sandra Peterson - Migrant Beth Larson -Steckler - Homeless Subgroup Handout Things we need to be thinking about for subgroups: Accountability, What do we want in our pie (elementary, high school), Report Card, Dashboard English Learners Report: PowerPoint ESSA and Title III Is there any subgroup that makes up entire EL population with one language? Spanish might be the only one. 30% is by state not by district. What tests to use for accountability - is there any way that the tiers were determined with an earlier test? Scores ar e taken from the previous year. Access is taken in the spring but is there a different time they can take that test? They have been a 1, new child, if took it in the fall, those kids would be shown as lower and fall on Tier one which would be more funding. Access test must be used but it doesn't say when that test has to be given. Could use model score if they do n't have previous years' data. First year kids are the most work but they are not being placed in the correct tier , and therefore , not receiving th e correct funding. If went to an earlier test what would be a funding impact? Not sure but it would be more at Tier s 1 and 2. Could have Jerry Coleman come to discuss with subcommittee. Reasons it can't be changed would be insightful. They want to be paid for the level at which they entered the district, not at the level they are currently at when tested. There will be a lot of administrative items but this group needs to weigh in on : goals accountability weight how soon to include ELs in the account syste m N Size level of growth. Why is the word ambitious included? This is because of our goals and we can't be lax. Migrant Report: Handout ND has been very proactive with this program. Need to be more proactive with dropouts but Grafton has started an online program. There are not many changes as ND has been proactive. Many people don't know a whole lot about this program. Do parents of these children need to provide documentation? Yes, they do. If they are from Mexico they must provide green cards . They must have this documentation or they will not receive services . They must also provide proof of moving to receive services. There used to be quite a bit of fraud , therefore , quite a few requirements in order to receive services . Because of the fraud, we are required to re -interview the families and reports need to be verified. Homeless/Foster Care Report: PowerPoint Homeless includes preschool age if the district currently has a preschool program. Working on development o f policies and procedures . Foster care students and military are required to be reported but not for accountability . How to determine when they are in foster care? Guessing it will be the same as it is for homeless which says if they were homeless at any time throughout the year, they are considered homeless. There are lots of questions that need to be answered with regard to ESSA. We need to know what the questions are from the field? This is important for us to know going forward. Foster care can be for just one night - would they need to be identified for the year? At this point, yes. Clarification with regard to foster care and who needs to be reporting it . If entire school population is military, how is that considered a subgroup? Military is not for accountability but needs to be repor ted. Gifted and Talented - this should also be reported and monitored but not necessarily for accountability. Trouble is how do you determine or define this? If they are in the top 5%. Page 8 Do we need to come up with a standard definition of gifted and talented ? Gifted in what? Music, math, etc . This only looks at academics. Fargo is tracking gifted and talented and it is really being discussed throughout the state. This will be put on the agenda for our next meeting. Top 5 is against the national norm . What does the report mean because there is no funding? What was the basis for bringing the Gifted and Talented issue forward? NDDPI does hear from both sides from parents of kids that are gifted and talented. Other states are hearing about it also. Run into roadblocks for reporting out of this data. Is public education out there to make sure every child reaches 110% ? Might need statistics on how many students fall into this category before we include it in our ESSA plan? Possibly do a study but not under ESSA . Topic : Student Group & School \"N\" Size Presenter : Laurie Matzke Handout ND has always historically used 10 which is the lowest . Only have 10 sizable districts . Many schools are too small to be a part of our accountability system . Do we want to look to go above 10 because at 10 there are already a lot excluded? If we determine accountability, we do not need to say by how many students. The raw score is reported but not the number behind the scenes . No state funding support for ELs and when they do not show growth, they harm the overall picture. NCLB we used up to 3 years for data. Do we want to recommend N size of 10 or larger? Recommendation for 10 from the subcommittee . How many years do we want to include? Group recommend ed using at least 2 years possibly up to 3. If we use 3 years, if those kids are not still there, the data is just harming the district. If we did use 3 years, it would only be for the first year because then we would start over and not have it again for the next 3 years. If report ing out every year, larger school s' factors are different than the smaller ones and small ones may never report out. Need to make sure no particular students are being identified. If you only have 1 student within that subgroup, everyone will know which child it is. Topic: Establishing Long Term Goals Under ESSA Presenter: Laurie Matzke Packet of information: Handout: Measuring Progress If this criterion is used, it would be based solely on high school . We need decide on benchmarks and in how many years? Proficient includes all accountability factors . Do the goals have to be aligned with the accountability factors? We do need a goal for each indicator and broken down by subgroup ? Define progress . If end goal is 100% proficient in 15 years, is there a negative impact on those schools if they don't make it? We continue to look at accountability factors but it is different than the long term goal. Chiefs for Change is also working on this issue of goals. Need to continue to close the gap. Why do they want a starting point and end point? States are setting different years as their goals. Each state can choose and if our goa l is continuous improvement, there would be no end goal. Need to get more information - no guidance from the USDE on this issue. Goal is to make sure every student is choice ready when they leave high school. They will want to see the benchmarks in -between . We will reach out to CCSSO for information and also see what other states are doing with this issue. Page 9 Next Steps: Need a o ne page s ummary: Discussion on Accountability Indicators: Key elements Really is about the formula - then we can define Keeping the dashboard simple so it's easy to understand Discussion on Achievement and Growth: Key elements How will it look for different school configurations ? Growth is not an option for high schools College or Career readiness options Can we use readiness as growth? Talked about Gifted and Talented and acknowledged it but need additional information and do not believe at this time it should be included in the ESSA plan. Report on subgroups Student group size and N Size will make recommendation . Long term goals - need more clarification. Needs to be peer review approved by the Federal government . College and Career ready used to a bigger element but it has now fizzled . Hard to define . Use WorkKeys as assessment for career readiness - optional for sc holarships . Redefining Ready has benchmarks that may be beneficial . Give students options like AP but also career ready opportunities . If school chooses ACT then W orkKeys would not qualify . Students need different levels of readiness . This committee determ ines factors to use . District chooses which indicator and has to use only 1 and can't use different indicator . ACT is not accommodating or flexible . It is hard to show growth . If alternate assessment is optional, what options are available for high schools ? Add a component of College and Career readiness to discuss further at the next meeting. Why can't we use every grade level testing to show growth? Comes down to funding. If required in 11th grade, is that the only one that has to be peer reviewed? Need t o be compar able , if using a different assessment. The growth model would need to pass peer review regardless of which assessment is used. ACT is not aligned to state standards so is not a for sure that it would pass peer review. Most districts want just one test, and ACT is paid for so they chose that but didn't think about the fact that it doesn't include a growth model. Are we getting enough done in our meetings? We have talked about a lot of issues so hoping it all comes tog ether. Still believe we are ahead of many other states. We are moving ok - once the final regulations are out, we can get answers but now, we have no answers. In the meantime, we are trying to make decisions where we can and discussing all the issues. Next meeting will be focused on Assessment . Bring back the other issues we talked about today that need more discussion. Are we revisiting the work of the assessment taskforce? No but are we in agreement and looking at those recommendations or do we have oth er items that need considering? A lot of the plan is housekeeping/administrative issues. There are some big things to decide but there aren't that many. Whole group meeting in December will be a meeting where answers are provided because the final regulati ons will be out. Page 10 What about the formulas? This is a big issue that we want to discuss. Heather should have some examples of other states formulas. Are there any concerns of this data going to a third party interest out of state? Supt Baesler is very concer ned about what the committee's interests are. Timeliness is the biggest issue. Want to see what our options are . How long and what is the cost? This group can then make a recommendation as to where we want to go with it. Concerns about security of student data . Pros and cons to going with outside group and also with using instate. No actual contract if we go internally within the state where if we use third -party, we have a contract and if they don't reach the benchmarks, they don't get paid. Cost is also a factor . Lots of questions. Should be negotiable regarding funds. There was a data system created for the REAs from Sam - would we like a preview of these 2 data sources to see what they look like and are available. Sam will give presentation on REA dashboard and will ask Tracy to do one on the Parent dashboard. Will send out one-page summary to this group for feedback and then out to the large group . Reporting out on the 25th? Heather do a brief summary on indicators . Achievement and Growth - Jeff Fa stnacht will give brief recap of discussion . Recap of subgroup . N Size - recommendation and discussion -Jeff Fastnacht . Goals - Jeff Fastnacht Large group is the 24th with viewing of Most Likely to Succeed and meeting on the 25th.

Ultimately, the subcommittee would have to decide. Not a required subgroup. Very few states report results for high achieving students separately; only Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, and Wyoming. Possibility of factoring into performance index. Four Steps under ESSA states should take to ensure the needs of high achievers are prioritized: i. Academic Achievement ii. Student Growth iii. \"Gifted Students (or \"high achi eving students) iv. Growth for All Students Discuss with other states how they monitor achievement. Office of Student Support to coordinate discussion with other states. Subgroup created to do research: Cheryl Hagar, Leah Kugel, Julie Jaeger, and Heather Hume ; report out at the Nov. 22 meeting . Develop Criteria for \"gifted and talented,\" and \"high achievers.\" Topic : Graduation Rates Presenter : Greg Gallagher Do we want to include GED results in the Graduation Rate? South Dakota DOE shared language in their plan that states...the state's Accountability Work Group strongly recommended to give schools credit for committing to see that all students finish high school, whether they do it the \"traditional\" way or another appropriate route. \"All students\" level and at each subgroup level will still be reported out so schools can determine where to focus efforts to increase graduation rates. Are students dropping out due to the environment or to grades? How would the cohort be tracked? Will t hese students be tracked back to the school district? If the student enters an adult learning center, why would the school get credit when the center provided the teaching? Including this subgroup may have an impact on the GED program. Options: Reduce the number of non -proficient students by 25% over six years; handout provided to group Use quartiles (all students reach the 4th quartile in six years; handout provided to group) Growth Model in the Accountability System Run a mock trial of a couple schools and report out at the Nov. 22 meeting. Topic: Establishing Long Term Goals Presenter: Laurie Matzke Two handouts provided to the group: Measurable Objectives and Quartile Chart for non -proficient students. Tabled until the Nov. 22 meeting. Ran out of time. Topic: Elements to Include in the Accountability System Presenter: Laurie Matzke Pie charts using State Assessment Achievement, Growth, and Climate/Engagement were provided to the group regarding the ESSA Accountability w/o EL students and with EL students, with EL students making up 10%. More discussion will be held at the Nov. 22 meeting. Ran o ut of time.

Multi -year C ohort - Must have a four -year but can have additional years . Long -term Goal - Currently at 89% ; should state go high er? What would be an acceptable level? Interim Goals - Could set interim goals within your long -term goals. Sample Size Determination - Nine and below is non -reportable. Must be consistent across the board. Reliability Test - A rate is a rate; however, do we consider a pure rate or incorporate a statistical test to ensure stability ? Growth Model - Comparing one year to the next. Introduce a Completion Rate Metric - GED is not identified as a metric. If bring in GED, would lead to discussion of regulato ry review. Option to bring it in separately as a completion rate. Val gave an overview of GED: 92% pass rate Average age of 22 - bigges t population is 17 -18 year olds Opportunity to include GED offers fl exibility and validates efforts It is a rigorous test GED prepa res a student to be Choice ReadyPage 3 Many questions and details on how we want this to look. Four issues for committee to consider: 1.Are we comfortable with historical practice? Yes 2.Do we want to look at growth? Any concerns? Are the BIE schools g oing to be on the top of the list for comprehensive support? If look at GED extender and growth, it could help. Ok with language on using growth and extender model with understanding we want to look at this with regard to reporting. 3.Do we want to consider the GED extender? South Dakota has done it. 4.What do we want as our long -term goal for graduation rates? What is the reliability of our graduation rate? Seat time requirement unfortunately. The law says a four -year cohort and then state discretion, up to se ven-year. How do you honor the definition of the law and also give value to what your state wants? GED is state -by-state but could do a memorandum of understanding with surrounding state s. Topic : Additional School Quality Indicator - Climate and Culture Presenter s: Heather Kinsey /Valerie Fischer/Trish Arnold Heather Kinsey presented a PowerPoint on the status of development of AdvancE D. Need to understand what we are measuring and how we define it. List of 7 school quality factors. New set of Climate and Culture surveys. New diagnostic tools. How to measure student engagement? ELEOT c lassroom observation tool was used and came up with seven key learning environments. Developed a student engagement survey. Need to measure q uality and level of student learn ing process. Three types of engagement: Cognitive Behavioral Emotional (Affective) Additional measures of quality of engagement: Committed Compliant Disengaged School quality and performance standards directly related to surveys. School quality factors must be used state -wide so we are lucky to have AdvancED statewide. Surveys are being used to measure climate. Harder to measure culture. Have not piloted the survey but are in the process. Have research that shows there is a direct correlation to student outcome based on Eliot. Might be comfortable to actually see the survey before we agree to it. Heather will send to Laurie to disseminate. Student engagement is directly correlated to Climate and Culture. Content for new climate/cul ture Ad vancED surveys will be given to committee to review. Heather will ask if the developers can use these surveys as a measure for accountability because that was not the original intent. Can be vague on details but need the frame within the plan. Testing done on surveys before January. Accountability reporting should drive improvement. There are surveys that can be used for accountability and can be scored. Val Fischer/Trish Arnold presented on Measuring Climate and Engagement - PowerPoint Is there a survey that can be used to measure? Yes, but they are lengthy. One has a fee and one is free. Shouldn't we be using a metric of participation of students who are engaged in the survey and school improvement process? We should have, at a minimum, pa rticipation. Student engagement in academia and extracurricular are critical. Need to focus on accountability for our plan. School improvement is already part of this plan. What process can we use to encompass all? Need to have validity and reliability. Page 4 Need one consistent state -wide indicator and then each school can have more. Whether we like the survey will depend on the number of questions - should not be cumbersome. Crosswalk of surveys may be helpful as a next step. Interested in the compendium? Yes, it will be sent out. Topic: Assessment Presenter s: Bob Marhaller/ Greg Gallagher Copy of the pre -filed bill draft was handed out by Bob Marthaller. Greg Gallagher discussed handout on Assessment Consideration Points. Reaffirms states set their own academic standards. Driven by requirements of the law. The test is aligned to the standards. The old test was aligned to standards in 2002 and restated in 2006. Question of how to move forward with the reports that will provide the data we need. There shou ld be correlation of standards assessment data to the grade the student is receiving. Schools need to be transparent ; however, there are other factors that impact the data. Much of this section in the plan includes the story of how we got here, where we are at, and where we are headed. Decisions: Use ACT instead of Smarter Balanced 1.What are we going to use to measure growth? 2.What grade are we going to assess? Handout on pros/cons chart for discussion. Pros/Cons Grade Tested in High School Handout and Dis cussion: If tested in 9th grade, would assessment be at 9th grade level. Yes Is it possible to use cohort for growth? Yes Full Academic Year (FAY) is practical issue and has validity. Looking at one year to test. Voting took place regarding which grade the committee would like to see testing done: Do not want 12th grade but the other grades are not an obvious decision. At 11th grade, they could choose ACT or NDSA but if they want growth, the ACT doesn't include that. If choose 11th grade , some schools will only test once regardless of growth. Redefining Ready will be the indicator on how our students are doing. It is not and should not be based on testing. Not against testing in 9th grade as long as there is an indicator at the end of 12th grade like ACT or Redefining Ready. ACT and NDSA take so much time. If they were not so time inten sive would it make a difference? Very spli t between whether to choose 9th, 10th, or 11th grade . Is it best practice to move it? There are a lot of other changes ; this is just one small piece of the puzzle. The option of another test does change the picture. Teachers will teach to standards or teach to ACT. The option to give either test should not be there. They should have to take both so we can measure growth. Growth would give some schools an opportunity to not be identified for supports. Whatever you do to the whole group, it also affects the subgroup. There is a chance for growth and the state defines what that growth looks like. Hard to know until we run the data to see how it all plays out before we actually go live with our decisions. Need to decide on the option of ACT and on grade level for NDSA. 9th and 12th grades are not the grade s to test. Decision is either 10th or 11th grade and this needs more discussion. What would help make this decision? What does the data show? An idea would be to present to the large group on our discussion and indecision and allow for discussion and voting from the large group. We need to choose a grade for assessment. Schools will not hav e this choice. What do we want our state assessment to measure ? ACT does not measure what we value. Would like to give our principals an opportunity to share their view s on what they would choose? Then, shortly before the full meeting , report out what our colleagues decided . 10th or 11th grade? ACT or not? Page 5 Topic : College and Career Ready Table discussion until next meeting prior to large meeting at Baymont next week. Topic : School Dashboard/Elements to Include in Accountability System Presenter s: Sam Unruh/Ross Roemmich /Tracy Korsmo Presentation: Twelce questions arose when going through the AdvancED module. Could go into SLDS to get data but it wasn't in a usable format. Created a method of efficient analysis of the data. Several methods of data retrieval and viewing were presented. Name Organization Scope of Presentation Nathan Anderson SLDS SLDS cube (AdvancED reports) Sam Unruh SLDS Data Explorer Steve Derzi SLDS New.NET SLDS interface Potential analytics Tracy Korsmo SLDS Student/parent portal Could be updated daily with current information. Confidence in the data from the SLDS system is high. Schools will be able to customize their dashboard based on the information they desire. Could be share d on the dashboard? Live and interactive data. Would like to eventually get there. Challenges exist but they are working on it. Ross provided a handout on the State Support Team and the resources available. Next Steps on Dashboard: Next week put out Request for Information (RFI) and allow three weeks' turnaround Time is essential and all other deliverables Decide then to put out the full RFP in January February/March timeframe to decide Data turned over by June Dashboard ready by October Work to identify schools for s upports Meet with them to go over requirements and plans July 1, 2018 fully implement law for supports The entity we contract with will have the ability to tab into the SLDS data. Question on ownership of the data. There still must be a state view of the data. Concerns will hopefully be addressed from the information from the RFI. This committee will need to decide based in the RFI which vendors would be able to accommodate the state requirements and ne eds. Topic: Equity Discussion /EL Updates Presenter: Lodee Arnold Ran out of time - no discussion EL Updates: Handout with the updates from the English Learner Advisory Committee Meeting/ESSA Recommendations . No concerns on information presented. Do we feel comfortable recommending ELPAC recommendations as submitted? Timeframe of testing? Discussion on timeframe of when to test. We can ask for a shorter test and results back quickly. Topic : Establishing Long Term Goals Presenter: Laurie Matzke Incremental increments make the goal more achievable. Need to set an end goal to establish a reference point. Should we meet earlier next week due to the number of decisions to make? Do not want to make these decisions just to rush through the agenda. Further discussion at meeting prior to large committee meeting next week at the Baymont. Page 6 Yes, all were in agreement. Topic: Advanced Student Subgroup Discussion Ran out of time - no discussion Topic: Review Draft ESSA Template - Application Sections Presenter : Laurie Matzke Three sections of the template were handed out (1.0, 3.0, and 4.0).

If ACT were the option or choice are we still looking at options for different grade levels ? Stakeholders are excited about using the option of the ACT Standards need to be included on this Survey results: 61 responses 44 class B , 17 class A Leave as is: NDSA and ACT 11th Grade = 8.2% NDSA 10th grade and ACT 11th grade = Highest percent 57 .4 Only ACT 11th grade 26.2% 89.7% want state assessment given in spring Comment: Possibility to use NDSA to calculate grow th? Is it possible to use ACT Aspire as alternate to State Assessment ? Interim assessment - If move ND SA to 10th - would there still need to be an interim ? If you only use ACT - no growth would be used The data is telling us there is a d rop in student performance from middle level to high school Students are not being exposed to standards in high school Many feel students are o ver test ed in grade 11 Redefining Ready indicator should be used for growth rather than any test Still need to give a choice - Where do we keep the state assessment ? School level can choose to use ACT or NDSA or both 10th grade NDSA 11th grade ACT Which test are we going to use for accountability under ESSA ? What is ACT assessing? Tuesday large meeting - Hold off on this piece until we discuss more at Wednesday 's meeting? Committee would like to i nform the large group on this issue to hear their thoughts and ideas regarding this committee's roadblock so t hey can maybe shed some insight Jennifer will report out on where our commi ttee is to the full committee and then pick up this discussion at the Wednesday subcommittee meeting Topic : Redefining Ready Presenter : Handout on Career, College, Military Regarding the military - Is this through the Redefining Ready or from what other states have in place ? ASVAB given and technical assessment - Would schools have the capability to do this? The military would be a partner to work with schools for accessibility of these What is the technical assessment referring to? LM will get clarifica tion on this for our next meeting College Ready - If you meet one of those bullets you have met more. A lot of overlap on bullets Career Ready - Looking at different components within this factor Grade point average Using WorkK eys Page 3 Next Meeting : December 20 , 2016 Location: Baymont Inn, Mandan Time: 8:30 AM 11/29 email had attachmen ts with regard to this This will be discussed in full on the agenda as the first topic so it gets the time it needs to be discussed Workplace learning experience - Would it be wise to put hours with that if a possibility ? 75 hours would be equivalent to \u00bd credit; it should be hours based Sam will be on the agenda at next subcommittee meeting A concern is that State Assessme nt is not included in any area College Ready needs to be broken down based on readiness Wayne will upd ate on several of these areas to provide clarity No report to full committee on this issue Topic: Establishing Long Term Goals Presenter: What information can we bring on Wednesday to move forward with this issue ? States must use the USDE template because of the peer review process We h ave our Choice Ready Goal Need to get much more specific - Look at reading and math separately and subgroups Set an achievable goal 3 handouts distributed Where would you draw a line of the beginning expectation to be and then where do we want them to be ? 3rd quartile is ambitious but achievable Need to be clear in what our goal is; do not need to be 1 00% to be proficient Where will the information for foster and m ilitary be reported? They are not used for accountability but will be on the report card Laurie will look at other state plans to review this issue Topic: Elements to Include in the Accountability System (Assigning Percents) Presenter: Handout of pie charts of elementary and high schools USDE reminded states, you only have to have one factor according to the law Can start with one and add others at a later date Anything we can bring to Wednesday 's meeting to facilitate this discussion ? Sliding scale between growth and achi evement Growth and achievement would be combined behind the scenes with Dr. Elgart 's model Elementary level looks good High school level would work using Redefining Ready indicators Percentages are worthy of discussion ; however , they are at a good starting point We don't know how detailed it will need to be once President Elect Trump takes office Can we track the GED completion portion? Another state has been doing it so it should be able to be used Overview of December 20th and December 21st Agenda Presenter: Tuesday, December 20, 2016: Meeting from 8:30 -4:30 at Baymont Jeff will report out o n Grad uation Rate and Climate Engagement discussion Jennifer will report out on discussion on Assessment and survey results No recommendation s are ready to be made Sonja will report on the English L earner piece Redefining R eady and pie will not b e reported out , but tackled in m ore depth on Wednesday Wednesday, December 21, 2016: Comfort Inn - hope to be done by early afternoon Redefining Ready Assessment Long term goals Accountability percentages Gifted and Talented presentation ESSA Standards, Assessment, Accountability and Reporting Subc ommittee Minute s Wednesday , December 21 , 2016 | 8:15 AM| Comfort Inn, Facilitator Note Taker Bucket Leader Laurie Matzke Shauna Greff Meeting Convened Meeting Adjourned Breakout Room 8:30 AM 12:55 PM Attendance Planning Committee Members Sonja Butenhoff Tracy Friesen Tracy Korsmo Aimee Copas Robert Grosz Wayne Kutzer Teresa Desai Cheryl Hagar L Anita Thomas Jeff Fastnacht Julie Jaeger Travis Thorvilson Jennifer Fremstad Melanie Kathrein Lucy Fredericks Gerry Baesler Greg Gallagher Rob Bauer Ann Ellefson Leah Kugel Tammy Mayer Valerie Fischer Laurie Matzke Beth Larson -Steckler Robert Marthaller Ross Roemmich Joe Kolosky Page 2 Topic: Welcome and Overview of Agenda Presenter: Laurie Matzke Envision one more meeting in January for this subcommittee Present: Bob Gross representing Standards and Assessment Sonja Butenhoff representing EL Jennifer Fremstad representing High School Principals Cheryl Hagar representing Title I Targeted Teresa Desai representing S choolwide Tracy Fri esen representing Non -public schools Wayne Kutzer representing Career and Tech Ed Russ Zeigler representing ND Council Ed Leaders Aimee Copas representing ND Council Ed Leaders Jeff Fastnacht representing Small District s Julie Jaeger representing ND Assn for Gifted Children Tracy Korsmo representing ND ITD L Anita Thomas representing School Board Assn Travis Thorvilson representing ND EL Melanie Kathrein representing Curriculum Coordinators NDDPI employees Topic : Assessment - Grade Tested in High School Unless a waiver or given special permission, the grade selected in the plan would be for the whole state Dr. Elgart's model for testing at grade nine is a great option , as a system and using Choice Ready to measure growth Discussion on using grade nine or ten for NDSA PD planning currently is not based on NDSA so that should not be a factor The standards remain important, just not using the state assessment to validate instruction or PD Doing more than one interim assessment within their high schools Tenth grade takes Aspire and Pre -ACT Any negatives for going with grade nine ? Could the math be specific and not include geometry or be more a lgebra based ? If ninth grade , the issue of s cience would need to be changed Limiting the intent of the standards if you remove g eometry Assessments overall design of curriculum and where do our students stand What is the balance o f what the standards are trying to put forth? Just because we are not testing specific courses does not mean that those subjects are not being taught Standards are interwoven ; however , they are not a driving force in our high schools Redefining Ready is a measure of assessment - measures all of things that we value It is a different measurement of assessment but needs to be looked at and valued Interim assessments are great for engagement and measurement Need to balance a common measurement against common standards on a common goal What is the appropriate tools needed to accomplish our goals? If tes t early, it removes University S ystems data for placement There are many ways to assess our students on standards State assessment is a measure for College Ready but not Choice Ready How does assessment fit into Choice Ready and multiple measures? It is not a single measure but we need to figure out whe re it fits and should be used Students success needs to be measured by multiple indicators, not just one All paths matter not just one There will be pros and cons for any grade we choose Need to figure out which grade to use for accountability We have alre ady reduced the weight of the test as far as accountability Are we ready to vote? Jennifer has a conference call planned for early January of stakeholders If a recommendation is made, we can still change it, but it would be necessary to voice opinion Table discussions: Would like to steer away from eleventh grade Not sure ninth grade could show growth If math could be more aligned with algebra, ninth grade would work Concern of public relations aspect - State Assessment is still being viewed as accountability measure People that make the decisions and hold the purse strings still look at assessment - we need to inform them that it is only one measure Page 3 Quite a few new members on the Education Committee of the legislature so now is the time to provide information Are we stuck within our design structure and thought process? Can we come up with a hybrid of a system that would provide smaller assessments still tightly held to assessments to drive instruction ? What if instead of one assessment, we package what we feel is necessary for learning District 's responsibility when it is appropriate to give assessments Different tracks of learning: traditional or non -traditional Could we do this with interim assessments? They are not directly linked to our standards This has been in discussion for several years Focused tests per grade level that gets banked and provides opportunity for summative score Not a well -tested approach but does open the door for opportunity Need to design and sell this approach Two options: Use the interim like Smarter Balance that aligns to standards Use modules through the years with the summative to be used in the 11th grade for reporting Concerns would be cost - limited dollars for assessment and we need to pay for the dashboard with these funds The other issue would be the transient population - how would we track? Possibly assess as student enters your system so earlier modules would not need to be taken? For math, could our assessment be more subject based rather than how it is now? Put forth the recommendation of how to proceed but have this as an optional package in an RFP for assessments to figure out costs and what would be needed Giving the student the assessment close to instruction as chunked would help to use the data to drive instruction which would drive competency based education Huge hill to educate others on this because we would be going from one assessment to three However, these would be smaller and not such a huge test Other states are proceeding with this process This is a process we should pursue but we need to make decisions today University System s decision to use assessment for placement, it is based in assessment being used Innovative Learning initiative is being worked on and fits nicely into this From a parent perspective, my goal is to have them be college ready and access to other school's data to compare There were no comments in the survey valuing ninth over tenth or vice versa Vote taken on grade level: 9 - 6 10 - 8 11 - 0 12 - 0 Jennifer will run this by her group on the conference call and indicate the voting result and see what their views are Start with RFP Should Greg draft something preliminary to bring to January meeting? Or create a focus group to help Greg put the parameters together? Go with grade ten for state plan however, this would be a pilot idea to put on the RFP to determine cost and if it is possible to use multiple years Greg recommends drafting something and then bring to committee to review and discuss Topic : College and Career Ready - Potential Indicators Many different kinds of kids so we need to be diverse and prepare them the best we can We will be able to show different measures Opportunity to show growth at the high school Concern that state assessment wasn't reflected so it has been added for discussion Also examples regarding industry credential and also technical assessment under military Discussion on handout: All support the concept Are we in agreement on the three categories and what's within them? Like C hoice Ready and could add Life Ready at some point Need to be able to track these Struggle with including NDSA Isn't it better for them to have more choices to use? It is an option to demonstrate readiness so it makes sense to include Discussion on handout on Choice Ready PowerSchool is tool that is used Students need to identify a pathway Work with a counselor Discussion on 98% attendance - should it be lowered? Page 4 Excused absences are different from school board to school board Having schools report what the absence was for This tool is in PowerSchool and data we can attain Drill down data to school absences Every school determines whether it is excused or unexcused Schools need to report all absences even if excused Message is important that attendance is important This would count non -school related absences ; however , PowerSchool is not configured this way Working group could work out these details from PowerSchool For kids with medical needs, this should be optional instead of mandatory The attendance cal culation is for the entire high school career Leaning toward this factor being optional at 98% PowerSchool would need a check to indicate that they have identified a career cluster at some time in their high school career Kids could be ready for all three choices and shouldn't be just one Where do ELs and Special Ed fall into these categories Do we want conversation on how to make this work for these two areas? Yes, and bring back information that could be added and also for GED This is not per student; it is to show schools where their school is This does not indicate whether a student will be accepted into college , it is to determine how a school is doing Student engagement is also a large piece of readiness Need to empower kids, we do not need any more tr aining on identifying, we need to teach resiliency Data was given with regard to percentages of graduation rates in both high schools and colleges Discussion on bullets under Military Ready discussed Topic: Advanced Student Subgroup Discussion Presenter: Julie Jaeger Should we include this as a subgroup? Provide them an accelerated activity Levels of Service have been used Move away from this to identify or serve the Gifted and Talented group because there is no cohesiveness There are screeners available but are we in a position to do it Want to give an idea of questions: How are we going to identify? What are short and long term goals? Funding? Have kids who are on an IEP but IQ is very high In a regular classroom situation, these kids do not do well Need to be identified by a qualified professional Finances received for this subgroup are minimal 95% and above would be considered Gifted Do not call it Gifted and Talented Do not call it High A chiever because identification would be hard There are different characteristics of gifted students : Creative Learner Gifted High Achiever Whatever is done, it needs to be sure and include growth Some have positive behaviors but others have negative behaviors A lot of socio -emotional issues Standardized tests are much d ifferent than the cognitive test given to identify these students Funding: $400,000 per year Special Education request these funds Mostly large districts No separate line item for this Do we want to put something in our plan on this and are we prepared to do this or should there be more research and possibly include in the future? There are pieces all over the state in both large and small districts that have plans in place We need to be able to support this so more information is needed Topic: Elements to Include in the Accountability System - Pie Chart Feedback on the handout pie chart This graphic will be illustrated so do we need to change verbiage? Dashboard will show different information - this graphic is behind the scenes percentages This graphic is to determine weight of factors Page 5 Next Meeting : January based on doodle Location: TBD Time: TBD Dashboard will have a lot of parent friendly information and will give links so parents can always find additional information It is not a parent training tool Do we want to signify which factors are academic and can we as terisk or flag them? Or use a key sentence at bottom to signify which are academic Once Climate/Engagement are defined, parents will understand more clearly Topic: Establishing Long Term Goals Discussion of goals chart Goals for state assessment Greg advises removing Novice, Proficient as they are not appropriate Would level I, II, III, IV? Yes, but with definition as to what each level is Discussion on scatter plot charts Are goals used for identification - no they are not This should be as minimalist ic as possible and meets the law but not to put much focus on this Can we use the growth rate from the past five years, chart it, and project it forward? We need to be realistic and aggressive Use some statisticians to look at what the numbers should look like We will put information into the template and bring that to the January meeting NEXT STEPS: One -page summary Minutes Doodle for January meeting Same for full group meeting; minutes and doodle For January meeting: Report from Jennifer Bring data regarding goals Met with military so have information for Choice Ready Need to make decisions on additional school quality factor Decide whether to move forward with climate and add engagement when ready?

Decrease in student performance so Choice Ready is a very popular option Do we w ant to include growth component on state assessment from grades 8 -10? If it is left, it might represent some districts Growth isn't based on individual students; more it is a comparison from cohort to cohort All states are being very vague and very broad Include in our language that we are considering options and not lock us into something Very hard for Administrators to think past NCLB Multiple measures in ESSA will be used which is eye opening Need discussion points so we can begin to have discussions Someone from the NDDPI be in the networking room at the A dministrator's Conference to answer questions on ESSA Number of NDDPI employees will be attending so it is very doable Key is to get message out regarding ESSA How do we get the information to the administrators ? Series or video clips on different areas within ESSA Continue to brainstorm on how to get the word out on the plan Suggestion to create Fast Fact If video clips were to be created, what topics should be included? All applicable Moving sta te assessment to grade 10 in the spring ACT will stay, will write into plan the option for individual districts to use this in lieu of state assessment with details to be determined Growth will be through Choice Ready process and still interested in growth extension model between grades 8 and 10 Colleges will not accept 10th grade scores on tests A 12th grade test could be retaken for placement so they wouldn't need to take remedial courses Create a new section in part three regarding assessment, to be presented to large group on the 8th Jennifer agrees to present Hope we will be allowed the flexibility they said states would have so we can be vague in our plan now but once we decide we want it concrete in the plan, we could resubmit with addition al information Discussion on alternate high school assessment design: multi -grade assessment and achievement banking model Need to define this model: Align all test content to state academic content standard s Divide and administer assessment content components at grades 9,10,11 Prepare annual test strand reports; bank, compile, and report summative college and career readiness results in grade 11 Design test maps of English language arts/literacy content presented in grade -specific strands, 9 -11Page 3 Desig n test maps of mathematics content presented in domain strands Ensure assessment strands follow typical curricular offerings Designing the mode: Grade -level designs Test map Item augmentation Alignment study Standards setting Vertical scaling Quality assur ance Data banking and accountability Training Precedent setting with this multi -year assessment but it can be doable Technical issues and financial issues Possible to do a split in a rough way but to do it properly, you build a system to move in that direction Broad level design Drafted an RFP This would be best to be treated as a stand -alone RFP without compounding the current RFP with this information Won't be able to venture into until 18 months to 2 year s and implemented within 3 years Recommendatio n to build in a separate RFP approach This has been talked about and has merit but technical and financial challenges In long -term interest of the state needs to be taken into consideration This model has a lot of potential Financial key is concerning and this is a time of unknown regarding funding Topic : Plan for Differentiation Presenters: Laurie M Taking off the word improvement Instead of identify, we are selecting schools Would like districts to look at this as an awarded grant for supports Look at this as an opportunity to support schools All schools are in a growth model and focus on the positive Goal is for this to be easily communicated, understandable and transparent Dashboard will be positive as well as show areas where support is needed North Dakota was selected to pilot a new student engagement tool Should add NDSA/NDAA which implies the alternate assessment to all areas where assessment i s listed May get pushback from our cap of Targeted supports of 10% All schools are in General support and then schools are selected for additional Comprehensive and Targeted support If school is not selected for Comprehensive o r Targeted, they are still working on improvements and receiving supports Topic: Estab lishing Long -Term Go als Law requires us to have a progressive approach Academic achievement based on proficiency on annual assessments High school graduation rates Progress in achieving English language proficiency Timeline for achieving goals must be the same for all students and subgroups We must pay attention to lower performing subgroups and expect more progress from those groups that are further behind Two basic models : growth based o n current performance goals set on long -term outward limits 35% feels reasonable EL is a new group with inherent needs The other groups are stable What is realistic and what expectations are out there? For EL , are exited students included? EL students who have exited are still in for four years Hoping for clarification in DC next week regarding how thes e goals are aligned into the whole accountability plan No punitive action if goals are not met but need clarification on this We need to be fair and reasonable and realistic Striving for improvement but being fair We n eed to decide today but it is not set in stone and will be taken to the larger group The decision today will allow the plan to be updated and discussion to take place We want high achieving goals ; however, if unattainable or unachievable, they won't be used Page 4 They will not be used for accountabi lity so how will they be used? They can be used comparatively for growth as a possibility This data would be used by staff for root cause analysis for curriculum development District and building level more than specific teacher level What are our expectat ions for our students and how is it viewed by parents and students? They need to excel and progress , however , it must be attainable It sends a political message Any gains are good gains and need to weigh reasonableness versus rigor 35% gains over 6 years is considered rigorous The messaging is important We could use analogy to help with the message This i s a state goal so need clarifica tion as far as what is required There would be less pressure if state reported but should have access to individual percenta ges and progress for districts to see where they are at Need to make a recommendation to get the conversation started at the next level 25% seems small Could E L be put into different categories; those that are currently receiving services a nd another category for those who have exited Does it matter how we articulate this percentage? Percentage is the reduction of the non -proficient If we have anything that looks similar, administrators will compare to NCLB View this more positively if we approach it from reducing rather than increasing the percentage Rather than focusing percentage on students needing to become proficient we can focus on the percentage of non-proficient students needing to be reduced Will revise the language Give full committee three options 1/4 25%, 1/3 33%, 1/2 55% Subcommittee recommends 1/3 or 33% Topic: Discussion on Subgroups If using three -year averaging, that could be the same 3 kids repeatedly When apply ing confidence interval, N size of 10, you would not be reportable Rollup is the effect of all three years and not of just one year This gives protections We must help the administrators to understand and operationalize it Greg said there is a mathematical concept table on paper that can be made public to help with understanding Confidence interval against percentage of proficient students Greg provided the chart /table and an explanation of it If you raise the N size, are we excluding certain subgroups ? Would only the large districts be included ? Yes Need to explain this confidence interval to everyone Validity - you must report on where you are with achievement Reliability - don't report if you can't do it responsibly and with low N values Should we keep it at 10 or move to 15? Would it adjust the fairness? It would cloak schools from being reported Not the size of the school, it is the size of the subgroup How do you help to mitigate across the state? If bump beyond 10, and run the data, things start cutting out We need clarification on whether the USDE will allow the con fidence interval If it is not, we have issues with the N size of 10 If the issue of sampling does not apply, by regulations, 10 is defensible for reliability Should make language link between N size and confidence interval and not ask permission How many sch ools would not have been reported last year if didn't use the confidence interval and used an Nsize of 15? How many subgroups and how many districts would have fallen off? This would give us data to show districts what changing the Nsize does and the scho ols that would not need to report for accountability We could have this data prior to the February 8 meeting so we could get it out to members to be able to make a recommendation to the large group Every student in every year should be counted When used fo r accountability, is it fair to use small number of students to represent the entire school' s accountability and, therefore , select them for supports ? Page 5 Topic: Choice Read y We just need to get specific on details Three different graphics for Choice Ready Kirsten met with military representatives who were very helpful ASVAB score of 31 is the lowest score required Deemed physically fit could be left up to local school discretion Minimum GPA is 2.0 Liked attendance, work -based learning and community service NDSA was not a requirement but can be an additional factor Minimum composite ACT score Physically fit and quality citizenship is informational rather than something a district should verify Possibly include these in the statement prior to the listed requir ements Jeff presented a graphic that was very appealing We don't want to \" Pigeonh ole\" our students into one pathway or another It ensures students have options and will be ready for whichever pathway they choose Ideally, students should be qualified in multiple pathways Need to portray this positively and thoughtfully This gives students choices and we can't be narrow minded Redefining Ready is working on Life Ready/Community Ready and including 3 -8 grade readiness Academic Ready rather than College Read y which would include technical areas GPA of 2.8 in concentrat ed area ? Career Ready - develop a career education plan rather than advisement on career ed path Military Ready Required: 2.0 GPA or GED diploma ASVAB score 31 Option s: ACT score of 15 or 17 98% attendance 25 hours community service Proficient on NDSA Career Ready Required: GPA 2.8 within concentrated area Develop a career education plan Identify career cluster Option s: 98% attendance 25 hours community service 75 hours work -based learning Industry credential Two or more co -curricular activities Dual credit course and Work Keys Career ready pathways Proficient on NDSA Academic Ready Required: 2.8 GPA or GED diploma Option s: 98% attendance International baccalaureate Advanced Placement exam sc ore 3+ Advance d Placement course grade A, B, C Dual credit college English and/or Math College development/Remedial English and/or math ACT score in specific concentrated area NDSA proficient Soft skills could be included in information language since they are hard to determine Box chart in narrative form and then also include the graphic as a workable document Ann and Val will work on getting this in narrative form and make changes to Jeff's graphic and get it out to this committee for comment before presenting to the full committee Instead of Pathway A -D, use the symbol that is already on each specific pathway Instead o f All Kids should say All Students Page 6 Next Meeting: February 8, 2017 Location: Ramada Hotel Bismarck Time: 8:30am -4:30pm Topic: Elements to Include in Accountability System Agreeable to leave Climate/Engagement to be a significant piece? Do we want to change the amount in each piece of the pie? Leave it as it is reasonable and it can be changed later Elementary: Achievement 30% Growth 30% Climate/Engagement 30% EL 10% Are we being consistent?

Shouldn't they need all areas? Not all schools offer all of them Creates options for students who don't have all of them General advice not to pidgeon -hole students Clear to parents and students that they can jump areas any time and can be ready for all We would like them to be ready in all areas so maybe not the term \"pathway\" These experts really did not tailor their review with regard to North Dakota specifically and our demographics Jeff thinks there is a lot of posi tive interest from administrators , but, there are a lot of questions that we will need to deal with Anything we want to change before the large group votes on Wednesday? We can still make changes It still appears there will be state flexibility moving forw ard so we can be vague Are we okay with this document to present to the group ? Need to portray to schools that students can and should use more than one track Still need to figure out how to set goal s for schools to earn points in the pie chart One element of the pie chart for accountability - all are okay English Learners How we were doing on our growth to target model Interim progress Weren't on board with increment The main feedback was that it was not rigorous enough Establishing Long -Term Goals Reaffirm that everyone feels the long -term goals don't fit in with the rest of the accountability system Had an idea for connecting the goals with plan Use it as one of the exit criteria for schools selected for Comprehensive or Targeted support Comprehensive support - what got you in, could also get you out lowest 5% or 67% grad rate And/or you met your long -term goals for two consecutive years Group recommendat ion was 33% gain over six years They supported the idea of flipping to say decreasing the goal of nonsufficient s tudents rather than all schools reaching the goal of sufficient students Annual of 2.71% Page 3 Next Meeting: February 8, 2017 Location: Ramada Hotel Bismarck Time: 9:00 am - 4:00 pm Could look at using this for exit criteria especially for Targeted schools which would be at the subgroup level Is this realistic? The percentage is hig her for subgroup and the increase would need to be sustained Is it legitimate to look at for exit criteria? Might be an option to use proficiency level which would make more sense It would correlate with the State Assessment according to their English prof iciency It makes sense for comprehensive - another way they could exit Targeted percentages are more rigorous and more challenging criteria Can there be more than one way to exit? This would be just one option to exit but not the only one Targeted selectio n is done annually/Comprehensive selection is done every three years This is not an annual percentage required to improve - if use the confidence interval and interim interval goal - it will be relatively low identified - this percentage of goals provides sufficient safeguards to exit Even the large schools would be protected Need to get schools to think improvement Need to make good identification of interim goals Giving schools multiple options to exit is important In small cohort of 10 that are submittin g early so really can't view other states to see what they are doing Are we in agreement to use this as one of several measures to use to exit ? Yes, all are in agreement Work to reduce the number of nonproficient by 33% over six years - all agreed Assessment Nothing really said regarding moving assessment to grade 10 from 11 More discussion regarding using ACT rather than NDSA CCSSO is going to help states in this regard if they want to pursue this as an option They would get states together and off er technical assistance and support Wouldn't be entrance information Peer review would be the issue Deferring to peer review which is a separate requirement in the law, has to have comparable design to the assessment It might be challenged Not sure high schools will choose this option after they weigh the pros and cons Topic: Overview of February 8, 2017 Agenda Overview and confirmation of those who will report out on 2/8: Choice Ready - Jeff Assessment - Jennifer Goals - Bob Pie - Aimee Topic: English Learners Recommendations discussed regarding ESSA considerations These will be presented on Wednesday to the large group for a vote ESSA Teacher/Leader Effectiveness Subcommittee Minutes Thursday , September 8, 2016 | 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM | State Capitol - Peace Garden Room Facilitator /Team Lead Note Taker Stefanie Two Crow Gail Mittleider Meeting Convened Meeting Adjourned Breakout Room 9:05 am 12:20 pm Peace Garden Room Attendance Planning Committee Members Nick Archuleta Larry Nybladh Jeffrey Brandt Rebecca Pitkin Rod Jonas David Amiee David Teresa Del orme Jim Stenehjem Mary Eldredge -Sandbo L Anita Thomas Robert Lech Russ Ziegler Others Attending Laurie Stenehjem NDDPI Ex Officio Members Robert Laurie Matzke Peg Wagner Gwyn Marback Mary McCarvel -O'Connor Agenda Items Welcome Presenter : Gail Schauer The meeting objectives were reviewed, everyone present was welcomed and introduced.

Page 2 Sub-Committee Roles, Responsibilities, and Expectations Presenter : Stefanie Two Crow The handout entitled \"Roles & Responsibilities for ESSA Subcommittee\" was reviewed. Discussion was held regarding the role of Presenting Back to Large ESSA Group . A volunteer is needed to report the information from this subcommittee to the large ESSA group on September 30th. Overview - Section 5: Supporting Excellent Educators Presenter : Gail Schauer The handout entitled \"Section 5: SUPPORTING EXCELLENT EDUCATORS\" was reviewed as this is the template assigned to this subcommittee for review and to provide recommendations to the ESSA Planning Committee . A brief overvie w of all key elements of the ESSA State Plan Template was discussed for each section below: 5.1 Systems of Educator Development, Retention , and Advancement 5.2 Support for Educators 5.3 Educator Equity 5.4 Performance Management and Technical Assistance for Supporting Excellent Educators Homework . Subcommittee members are to review the Equity Plan which can be found at https://www.nd.gov/dpi/Community/NDStateEquityPlan/. Discussion on Workgroup Timelines Presenter : Stefanie Two Crow The handout entitled \"ESSA Teacher/Leader Effectiveness Subcommittee Timeline \" was reviewed. The timeline provides each subcommittee meeting date, topics for discussi on, key questions to consider, and scope of work for supporting educator excellence. The final Rules a nd Regulations should be received in December 2016. Discussion was held regarding the next meeting dates. The subcommittee meeting should be held the day after the large ESSA group meets to reduce travel for the subcommittee members. The large ESSA group' s next meeting will include reports from the subcommittees, discussion and voting. Length of subcommittee meetings was also discussed. The mission for NDDPI was reviewed. Discussion was held regarding the definition of \"educator\". It need s to be specific on who is include d (teachers /administrators). The State Equity Plan identified educators to include teachers, principals , and other school -based instructional staff . Summary of Key Elements of 5.1: Systems of Educator Development, Retention, and Advancement Presenters : Jim Stenehjem and Laurie Stenehjem Mentoring Programs - Jim Stenehjem (administrators) & Laurie Stenehjem (teachers) . Laurie Stenehjem presented two handouts : \"North Dakota Mentoring Program\" and \"North Dakota Teacher Support System Mentoring Program by the Numbers\". Details of the program were reviewed as well as data/statistics. Special education teachers have special educati on mentors. A pproximately 60% -70% of first year teachers are in the program but the percentage was hard to determine because the teachers were identified incorrectly on the MIS03. Ms. Stenehjem indicated that most large districts participate in the program and many are finding it helpful t o have one person help enroll the first year teachers . Some smaller districts did not participate because they felt they could provide their own mentoring. Ms. Stenehjem called this \"mentoring light\". Discussion was held on what other states do. Mr. Steckl er stated this was an intense program. Larry Nybladh suggested that if the teachers go through the mentoring program, there should be an endorsement added to their teaching license. Discussion was held regarding the funding of the program. Page 3 Summary of Key Elements of 5.1: Systems of Educator Development, Retention, and Advancement Presenters : Jim Stenehjem and Laurie Stenehjem Jim Stenehjem pr esented three \"North Dakota Teacher Evaluation System\", \"Performance Determination Rubrics: Standard 7 - Student Achievement Growth Indicators\", and \"Missouri Leadership Development System - Business Model\". Mr. Stenehjem reviewed the First Year Principal Mentoring Program. School districts are paying for this program. The program was initiated last December with six first year principals piloting the program and this year there are 17. The first year the mentors were retired administrat ors but this year there also are practicing principals. According to Mr. Stenehjem's estimate, t here were 2 7 new principals in the state and he wondered if those not enrolled were from small districts and the cost of the program was the barrier. This program went beyond the formal academic training in that it was on-the-job training and the application of skills. The next step w ould be to add additional training for both the mentors and new principals by adding more critical skills modules. Discussi on was held on student teaching and the resident teacher program. The \"Missouri Leadership Development System - Business Model\" was reviewed. If the mentoring programs were important, we needed to figure out how to get funding and it should cover small sch ools as well as large districts. North Dakota allow s principals to not have a masters degree completed initially, and in schools of 100 or fewer, no masters degree is required . Discussion was held on requiring mentoring for new principals, but not providin g state funding for it and the challenge of unf unded or underfunded mandates. Discussion was held regarding funding sources (federal and state) to support the principal mentoring program . Comments were made that if required, s chools should be allowed to c hoose at the local level. The subcommittee's job was to figure out what was needed and it would be the NDDPI's job to get the resources. The subcommittee needed to decide where North Dakota was going, what North Dakota needed to do to achieve the objection s and to define the end goal. Discussion was held regarding what to report to the large committee. M entoring first year teachers and principals should be reported. Discussing was held regarding going two years and the different levels of licensing. Mr. Ste nehjem volunteered to report to the large committee. Overview of Current PTESS System - Jim Stenehjem . Mr. Stenehjem reviewed the \"North Dakota Teacher Evaluation System\" handout. Every school in North Dakota indicated that they have an evaluation model for their teachers. Discussion was held on the ranking system in the evaluation models. Teachers are given a lot more expectations. T raining could be enhanced and it sh ould not be driven from the top. A good system was in place for the evaluation of teachers and the biggest gap was in cluding a student growth component . Discussion was held regarding how to track student growth. Student data on growth could be used but student test scores needed to be tied in. Discussion was held on \"high ly effective\". ESPB would define \"highly effective\" and NDDPI would give guidance to schools on how to report it to parents. Discussion was held regarding aligning student data to the teachers. Student data would be used in evaluation but not on the dashbo ard. The Report Card would indicate where the highly efficient teachers are.

Page 4 Summary of Key Elements of 5.2: Support for Educators Presenter : Stefanie Two Crow Overview of Support for Educators - Stefanie Two Crow . Stefanie Two Crow reviewed the allowable uses for Title II from the handout entitled \"Title II - Preparing, Training, and Recruiting High -Quality Teachers, Principals, or Other School Leaders\". Resources - Title II Part A 3% Set -Aside . Under ESSA there i s a 5% statewide set -aside (1% or approximately $100,000 for administration by NDDPI and 4% or approximately $400,000 for statewide initiatives in mentoring, leadership academy, etc.) and an optional 3% set-aside may also be considered for statewide initia tives (approximately $300,000). The Title II state discretionary funds will go away in the new law. Discussion was held regarding how to use these funds. It was decided that further information on how this would affect the local level was needed before a f inal recommendation cou ld be made. T he REAs would los e funding. T he rationale should be to have a plan focused on what is best for kids and then to solicit fu nds for it. Information was needed on how the current funds were being spent and what would happen after the new bill is in effect. Discussion Questions . Provided in Key Questions section of Tentative Timeline handout. Call for Recommendations . Mr. Stenehjem will report at the large committee meeting that th e set-aside was discussed and Larry Nybladh and David Steckler would speak , as administrators , about need ing further data to see if it w ould work. It was requested that NDDPI provide a chart of estimated Title II district allocations for 2017 -18SY with set -asides decreased in increments to show each district allocation amount.

Mr. Kolosky reviewed the PowerP oint slides. Schools in North Dakota were using the follow ing models: (1) Danielson; (2) Marshall; (3) Marzano; and (4 ) ND State plan. Bringing in another tool to determine effective teachers would be overwhelming for the teachers and administrators. Mr. Scherbenske reviewed the three examples of the Marshall model.

Discussion was held regarding how a multi -year average would be used for a teacher who was in his/her first year of teaching in the field. Discussion was he ld regarding each school determining what score to use. It was decided the state needed to give guidelines. Page 3 Discussion on Effective Teacher Presenter : Gail Schauer The state has the ability to amend the plan adopted. Discussion was held regarding when an improvement plan was used. The final suggested plan was t hat multiple measures would be used to determine an ineffective teacher: (1) the evaluation; (2) if the teacher was on an improvement plan ; and (3) qualification s. The concern was stated that an evaluation may be viewed as punishment. Further discussion wa s held regarding first year teachers. Plans of study and out -of-field teachers were also discussed.

Presentation on Determining Measurement Presenter : Jim Stenehjem Jim Stenehjem presented an April 2016 article from Charlotte Danielson on Rethinking Teacher Evaluation where she expressed her concern about transforming evaluations from the complex teaching profession into a list of performance behaviors that can be checked off on a checklist. She writes that if we want to make a difference for students in the classroom, we ne ed to collaborate and wor k together on what works best. Michael Fullan questions the research interpretation of \"the quality of the teacher is the single most important determinant in the learning of the student,\" to mean that we get rid of the worst teach ers and our students will excel. He explains that this hasn't worked, and if we look at our international competitors , we learn the main point is not the effect of the individual teacher, for better or worse, here and there, that counts, but rather how you maximize the cumulative effect of many teachers over time for each and every student, where you transform the entire profession -- not just the bottom 20%. Fullan's key drivers for system change include capacity building as a leading driver and then foll ow with accountability. The four 'right drivers' , , work, pedagogy, and 'systemness'. The USDE reversed this b y leading with accountability. AdvancED Indicator 2.6 reinforces the focus of supervision and ev aluation in the concept map which aligns to Level 4 attainment, \"The primary focus of the criteria and processes of supervision and evaluation is improving professional practice and ensuring student success.\" Jim suggest ed to define \"ineffective teacher\" as L evel 1 on the teacher evaluation models. When the PTESS developed these guidelines, they were aligned with the InTASC standards and came up with the four models: Danielson, Marshall, Marzano and McREL. Every model has at least four levels, with Level 1 being the lowest. Jim suggest ed we gather information , by school , on how many elements or components are rated during the year, the number of teachers, and the total ratings possible. He also suggest ed dividing the ratings by the different level s, and then determine the percent of L evel 1 ratings. The percent of Level 1 ratings would be defined as \"ineffective teaching .\" This percent could be multiplied by the number of teachers to come up with a number of the \"ineffective teacher equivalent .\" Jim shared a chart suggestin g how this \"ineffective teacher equivalent\" could be determined. A question arose that it might not comply with the USDE r egulations because it will not identify which students have ineffective teachers ; however, the percent of L evel 1 ratings could be multiplied by the total student population to determine a percent of students affected by the \"ineffective teaching .\" As a reminder , the purpose of this report is to determine equitability between high - poverty, high -minority schools and those that are not. This calculation meets the purpose. Another question a rose regarding if media will want all the teachers' names listed in the Level 1 percent. This percent is a calculation of all teachers and would not be tracked to any one , or even a few, teachers. Each teacher has strengths and challenges. It would not identify any teacher , but rather identify elements the school need s to work on. Jim suggested each LEA (district) w ould determine which elements to implement and this could change each year. LEAs would then report to the state each year on the elements or components implemented that year for the required federal reporting. Page 3 Presentation on Determining Measurement Presenter : Jim Stenehjem A question a rose about what system would be best to collect and report this data : STARS? AdvancED? Adva ncED has discussed collecting the data on which PTESS model each school is using. AdvancED needs to know the model so they can give feedback to the school. A number of administrators felt the consolidated application made the most sense to collect the data because they are already familiar with it and use it for other reporting. Like Ohio, we could also inclu de highly effective leaders. We could use that data in the state, and wouldn't ne ed to put it on the ESSA report; however, it would give NDCEL, NDLEAD , and NDDPI information for future planning. The subcommittee determined it would make most sense to collect this data by model for state purposes. This would be going beyond ESSA and allowing the state to share. A question was raised about capacity bui lding with accountability. Any time you infuse accountability into capacity building, you risk fidelity a little. Maybe risking a little fidelity is ok. This seems to be the best solution we have come up with so far. Everything we talked about can be done with or without ESSA. We need to concentrate on what's best for our state. All th e data we are discuss ing we are considering how we can use this for our state. NDDPI could write this into the ESSA plan , do a tr ial run in the 2017 -2018 school year, contin ue to have a committee meet to analyze the data and , if it doesn't work well, we can discuss changes to the ESSA plan . What do we need to do to help our schools do this? -Collect information from pilot schools for the 2017 -2018 school year. We will not rep ort th is during the trial year. Stakeholders will continue to meet and discuss how the pilot is going. If it is not going well, we will meet to determine changes to ESSA. If it works well, it will provide a baseline. -Provide information to schools/districts ahead of collecting the data so the y are aware of what to collect . -Training on how to collect and input data, a s well as how t he data results t o explain to stakeholders. Presentation and Resources on Effective Teachers Presenter : Matt Scherbenske Matt Scherbenske presented a conceptual model titled Effective Ready to address defining an effective teacher. This idea was based on suggestion s from Tracy Friesen and Russ Riehl to utilize an approach similar to graduating choice r eady students. The Effective Ready model is based on the InTASC domains and standards with the purpose of providing continuity and fle xibility to schools regardless of the evaluation model a school uses. This could work in tandem with, and provide support for, a school's evaluation process. Page 4 Recommendation on Definitions and Measurements Presenter : Gail Schauer We want the language in the plan to be general and still outline the concept s. Districts would not have to report data on ineffective teachers all year long, but rather would provide summative data at the end of the school year. Subcommittee recommends the plan outlined by Jim, trial implementation would be during the 2017 - 2018 sch ool year. This process would be a trial and regularly monitored. Stakeholders will continue to meet to discuss the process, strengths and weakness. At the end of the school year, stakeholders will determine if the ESSA plan is working well or if it should be modified. Jim will report out at the next ESSA committee meeting . Russ and Gail will start working on adding data collection to the consolidated application. Adjourn 11:30 AM Next ESSA Planning Committee meeting is scheduled for : Date: Tentatively 8 , 2017 1 , 201 7|9:30 AM - 10:30 AM Conference Call Facilitator /Team Lead Note Taker Stefanie Two Crow Gail Schauer Karla Mittleider Meeting Convened Meeting Adjourned Breakout Room 9:30 AM 10:15 AM Conference Call Attendance Planning Subc ommittee Members (all via telephone conference call) Nick Archuleta Larry Nybladh Jeffrey Brandt Rebecca Pitkin Rod Jonas Teresa Delorme Jim Stenehjem -Sandbo L Anita Thomas Robert Lech Russ Ziegler NDDPI Ex Officio Members Robert Marthaller Laurie Agenda Items Welcome Presenter : Gail Schauer The meeting objectives were reviewed, everyone present was welcomed and introduced. Update from CCSSO January 25, 2017 Meeting Presenter : Gail Schauer The individuals from the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction who attended the January 26, 2017 CCSSO meeting in Washington, DC were Kirsten Baesler, Laurie Matzke, Lodee Arnold, Joe Kolosky, Kay Mayer, Ross Roemmich, and Gail Schauer. Gail updated the subcommittee on what took place at the meeting. The CCSSO Critical Friends were from across the United States and represented many orga nizations. The morning session was North Dakota specific and the afternoon had various sessions centered on the ESSA Plan. Each North Dakota represent ative attended different session s. Page 2 ESSA Plan Section 5 Presenter : Gail Schauer Section 5 of the ESSA Plan was reviewed. The information highlighted in yellow are the latest changes. The CCSSO Critical Friends suggested that the following changes be made: 1.No links be included in the ESSA Plan - Appendixes will be added (i.e. Equity P lan). 2.Purpose of PTESS - See page 1 for addition . Also added were f uture goals . 3.Rational for Title II Funds - See page 4 for addition . 4.Collaboration with Higher Education - Information on collaboration could be added under Section 5A or 5B. Discussion was held on v arious areas of collaboration. Ms. Pit kin will be compiling a statement on the collaboration between ESPB and Higher Education. Any collaboration with Higher Education (even if Title II funds are not used) should be added into the ESSA Plan. The C CSSO Critical Friends commented that they wished that all states were as far along as North Dakota . They also commented that collaboration with stakeholders was extremely strong but the collaboration did not shine through in what was written. Other issue s for the entire ESSA Plan were: 1.Military stakeholders , 2.Higher education connection, 3.Chamber of Commerce, 4.Add that committee members have reached out to other organizations, 5.Add expect ations that districts will need to collaborate at the local level , 6.What is the f uture of ESSA committees, and 7.Load up appendixes - add committee members to appendix. The CCSSO Critical Friends were pleased to see parent organizations included and the tribal subcommittee was started . Ineffective Teachers Presenter : Gail Schauer Gail stated she attended the Teacher Leader Effectiveness section of the meeting and there were 15 individuals at the start of this meeting. Fourteen of these individuals were CCSSO Critical Friends. Gail stated she reviewed the plan and discussed not identifying specific teachers as ineffective. The CCSSO Critical Friends did not like the term \"ineffective\" teacher. Discussion was held using educator \"effectiveness\" equivalency to be more positive. Discussion was held regarding the terminology of the four models used in the state. Mr. Stenehjem stated the models used different terms and if \"effective \" were used, levels 3 and 4 would work. Mr. Stenehjem indicated he would refer back to the discussion at the beginning of PTESS. Stef Two Crow suggeste d the term \"Determination of Teacher Effectiveness\" be used on the data chart when gathering data on effective and ineffective teachers. This term would be a neutral term and still describe the purpose of the data. The Equity Report indicates out -of-field, experienced , and ineffective teachers must be reported. Gail stated there are a couple of states (one being Texas) who do not identify ineffective teachers in their ESSA Plan. Q & A and Next Steps Presenter : Gail Schauer The subcommittee was asked to review the following: 1.Running Place - How New Teacher Evaluations Fail to Live Up to Promises , 2.Draft ESSA Plan (Please send any changes to Gail by February 6th), 3.Jim indicated he had a Power Point presentation ready for the ESSA meeting on February 8th, 4.Gail stated she would report at the ESSA meeting on the CCSSO meeting in Washington, DC, and 5.Subcommittee members should reach out to inform other committees what is happening.Page 3 Adjourn 10:15 AM Next ESSA Planning Committee meeting is scheduled for : Date: February 8 , 2017 Location: Assembly Hall, Ramada Hotel Bismarck Time: 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM Next Teacher/Leader Effectiveness Force Chair Home Educator Association Jeff Hoverson, BurlingtonUniversity System Jennifer Weber, Bismarck Business and Industry Jon Godfread, Designee, Bismarck Joseph Chiang, TolnaND Council of Educational Leaders Superintendent Cory Steiner, Arthur ND Scott Faul, Designee, MinotND Council of Educational Leaders High School Principal Ned Clooten, Wahpeton North Dakota School Board Association Jennifer Wallender, Designee, HazenND Council of Educational Leaders Middle School Principal Stacy Murschel, Beulah Special Education Linda Hoag, BismarckND Council of Educational Leaders Elementary School Principal Dave Wheeler, Grand Forks Assessment/Curriculum Director Ryan Tow nsend, LincolnNonpublic Schools Tracy Friesen, Bismarck North Dakota Nick Archuleta, Designee, Bismarck Patty Barrette, BismarckHouse Education Committee Representative Cindy Schreiber-Beck, Chairman Designee, Wahpeton Representative Dennis Johnson, Devils Lake State Superintendent's Nominations Stacey Castleman, Parent Representative, Bismarck Gene Modin, Parent Representative, Mandan Tammy Ow ens, Parent Representative, Fargo Vanessa Anderson, Home Educator Representative, Harvey Brenda Goettle, Home Educator Representative, Mandan Jeff Lind, Board of Public School Education Representative, Mandan Lyn Hendry, Elementary Principal Representative, Hettinger Carrie Weippert, Assessment Representative, Grand Forks Jim Kasper, Business and Industry Representative, Fargo Wayne Trottier Jr, Native American Education Representative, RugbySenate Education Committee Senator Nicole Poolman, Chairman Designee Senator Joan Heckaman, New Rockford Education Technology Council Robert Kaspari, West Fargo Jody French, Horace NDDPI Ex Officio Members Gail Schauer - Teacher & School Effectiveness Greg Gallagher - Assessment Laurie Matzke - Federal Title Programs Ann Ellefson - Academic Support Gerry Teevens - Special Education STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S ND State Assessment Task ForceAppendix F Appendix G NORTH DAKOTA'S ESSA PLAN - RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE ARTS Submitted by Rebecca Engelman Arts in Education Director, North Dakota Council on the Arts November 1, 2016 DEFINING THE \"ARTS\" \"The arts\" offer opportunities to make a substantial impact toward closing student achievement gap for students specifically addressed by the Every Student Succeeds Act . Over the past 20 years, significant evidence indicates \"the arts\" have the largest and most profound effect on students at risk . In addition, the arts offer amazing results for improving learning; student, teacher and parental engagement; enhancing crea tivity; foster ing social and emotional skills; and fostering rich and inclusive school culture. Recommendation : The \"arts\" shou ld be stated by discipline (Visual Arts, Drama, Dance, Media Arts, and Music) within North Dakota's ESSA Implementation Plan. Stating each specific discipline removes ambiguity and makes clear the broad scope available to those hoping to use the arts as a tool in support of students and teachers. Referencing the arts in their entirety also aligns with the National Core Arts Standards , a framework for designing state standards. Response: The NDDPI will list the arts by discipline in our state ESSA plan. We agree that listing the various disciplines will provide more clarity to the readers. STATE PLAN Title I, Part A, Subpart 1, Section 1005 - As part of the accountability systems, states must inclu de at least one indicator of school quality or student success beyond student achievement, graduation rates and English proficiency. Indicators can include measures of student and educator engagement, access to advanced coursework, school climate and cult ure, or other indicators as decided by the state. Recommendation: The arts can serve as an asset in addressing each of these identified areas. I recommend that ND adopt the following arts -related indicators for its school quality or student success indic ator(s) . The number of arts course offerings. The percentage of high school students enrolled in arts courses that provide postsecondary credit. The proportion of certified arts educators to students .Response: The statewide ESSA Planning Committee has d iscussed at length the new requirement within ESSA to include additional school quality indicators beyond achievement. The committee voted to include climate and student engagement as our two indicators. LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY PLANS Title I, Part A, Subpart 1, Section 1006 - To receive Title I funding, a district must submit a plan to the state education agency that describes how it will identify inequities in educational opportunities and help close the achievement gap for all students. These plans m ust include a description of how the district will p rovide a well-rounded education. Recommendation: The definition of a well -rounded education includes the arts. When describing the instructional programs offered to Title I -eligible schools and populatio ns a district must provide a description of its arts education programs and the roll these programs play in providing all students a well -rounded education Response: All districts complete a consolidated application to access their federal Title funding. Within the consolidated application, there will be a section where districts will address well -rounded education. North Dakota is a local control state and each district will have the flexibility to define how they define a well -rounded and how they choose to use the funds. However, the NDDPI will be creating consolidated application guidance. Within the guidance, the NDDPI will outline options for districts to consider in their definition of a well - rounded education and we will include the arts as one of t he options. SCHOOLWIDE PROGRAMS Title I, Part A, Subpart 1, Section 1008 - Schools can use funding under this section of Title I, Part A to establish and implement plans based on a needs assessment to improve the education program of the entire school. To be eligible for schoolwide program funds, schools must have at least 40 percent of their students identified as coming from low -income families and create a schoolwide plan which embraces whole school reform. Recommendation: As a part of a well -rounded education, incorporate the arts as a strategy to provide all students the opportunity to achieve. For example, opportunit ies for the arts can include: Engaging the arts to improve students' non -academic skills, such as self-efficacy, engagement, and/or social and emotional learning. Supporting student attendance and other non -academic indicators through increasing access and opportunities in the arts and other well -rounded educational subjects.Improving 21st century skills for creativity, collaboration, communication, and critical thinking. Incorporating arts -based techniques in professional development programs to strengthen the effectiveness of educators in improving student learning outcomes. Response: The ESSA Pla n will provide a framework for districts and schools that allows them to articulate their unique needs for Title I schoolwide programming. The NDDPI will include within its guidance the importance of the arts in schoolwide reform strategies; however, it is ultimately a local school decision on what strategies they use and outline in their schoolwide plan. TARGETED ASSISTANCE SCHOOLS Title I, Part A, Subpart 1, Section 1009 - Schools that do not meet the poverty threshold for schoolwide schools can use Tit le I funding to create programs targeted to help academically at - risk students meet the state's academic standards. These programs can occur during the traditional school day or in expanded learning time. Recommendation: Include the arts as a potential strategy for meeting the objectives set by schools for the Targeted Assistance Schools programs. Response: The ESSA State Plan will provide a framework for districts and schools that allows them to articulate their unique needs to Title I Ta rgeted Assistance programming. The NDDPI will include within its guidance the importance of the arts in Title I targeted assistance strategies; however, it is ultimately a local school decision what strategies targeted assistance schools elect to use in th eir program. PARENT AND FAMILY ENGAGEMENT Engaging the families of students is an important aspect of ESSA and appears in several areas of Title I. Title I, Part A, Subpart 1, Section 1010 - Districts must establish, implement and annually review with parents and other stakeholders a policy for engaging families in the schoo l and, through doing so, improving their children's education. Recommendation: As an effective strategy for engaging families in the school, incorporate the arts by including: Arts programming in a back -to-school night or other broader parent engagement events . Updates on arts education activities in parent newsletters . Recording a ttendance at arts events . An arts -centered question on student, educator or parent surveys of school engagement and climate . Response: The NDDPI will include within its guidance for local school districts recommended strategies for parent and family engagement and within these recommendations, we will suggest and include arts initiatives; h owever, the sta te plan will not go into this level of detail. Title I, Part A, Subpart 1, Section 1006 - The district must provide parents and families of English language learners (ELLs) with information on how they can support their children in learning within the well -rounded education subjects. Recommendation: Provide parents with expectations for their children in arts classes, as well as strategies to encourage their children to practice and engage in creative activities at home. Response: The N DDPI will include wit hin its guidance the importance of the arts in schoolwide reform strategies; however, the state plan will not go into this level of detail. Title I, Part A, Subpart 1, Section 1008 - Schools must include parents, educators and other impacted community sta keholders in the development of the schoolwide program plan. Recommendation: To ensure that a school includes the arts as part of a schoolwide pro gram plan, i nclude arts educators, parents and others interested in the arts as part of the planning committee. Response: The ESSA State Plan will not go into this level of detail. The make -up of planning committees at the school level is a local decision. DEVELOPING STANDARDS AND ASSESSMENTS Title I, Part B, Section 1201 - States may use the Title I, Part B funds to develop standards and/or assessments in mathematics, ELA, science and any other subject that the state chooses - including the arts. Recommendation: ND's K -12 Art standards were adopted in 2000. Update the current standards and create aligned assessments to monitor student performance in the arts. (For example, the National Coalition for Core Arts Standards (NCCAS) has created Model Cornerstone Assessments aligned with the new National Core Arts Standards that assess arts learning across selected grade levels and artistic disciplines.) Response: The ESSA State Plan will provide a framework outlining the process used for standards review and adoption, but will not pr ovide a timeline for the adoption of review of arts standards sp ecifically or any other content area standards. The NDDPI does not create assessments for content areas beyond what is required in state or federal law. INNOVATIVE ASSESSMENT AND ACCOUNTABIL ITY Title I, Part B, Section 1201 - States may, either individually or as a group, apply to the U.S. Department of Education to pilot a new system of state assessments. This system can include a wide range of assessment structures including competency -base d and performance -based assessments. Recommendation: I nclude assessments of arts learning align ed to the state arts standards and incorporate both performance -based tasks and traditional written and multiple -choice questions. Recommendation: Provide districts with funding to ensure that learning in the arts is assessed throughout the school year with formative, interim and summative assessments. Response: Current NDCC 15.1 -21-08 outlines that the superintendent of public instruction administer s state wide assessments aligned to standards in reading, mathematics, and science. The NDCC does not include the authority for an arts assessment. STUDENT SUPPORT AND ACADEMIC ENRICHMENT GRANTS Title IV, Part A, Subpart 1 - As with Title I, Part A, states must submit a plan to the U.S. Department of Education in order to receive funding under Title IV, Part A - the Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants. These grants are designed to, in part, help districts and schools \"provide all students with access t o a well-rounded education\" (Title IV, Part A, Section 4101). As part of the requirements to receive funding under this new program, districts must conduct a needs assessment on how it currently supports a well -rounded education - including the arts - and identify areas for improvement. Recommendation: Include arts education programs initiatives that use the arts for student engagement and programs that integrate the arts into other subjects . Response: Within the consolidated application guidance, the NDDP I will provide information and direction to school districts with regard to the required needs assessment. NDDPI will include in our guidance, a recommendation that LEAs include arts education program initiatives in their programming. EDUCATOR EFFECTIVENESS There is considerable evidence that teachers of the arts are often considered as having made the most meaningful impact on the lives of students by encouraging discipline, persistence, collaboration, risk taking, effort towards excellence and more. These are skills that last a lifetime and may be applied to any career choice. The arts also eliminate barriers and engage students in activities in which they create their own relevance. Recommendation: Include artistic literacy as a quality indic ator for Educator Effectiveness in any future teacher evaluation system. Response: Principal/teacher evaluations is an area that ESSA leaves to local control. In North Dakota, school districts provide an assurance within the AdvancED system that they have a principal/teacher evaluation system in place . The model that districts use is a local decision. The NDDPI does not approve principal/teacher evaluation systems. Appendix H APPENDIX B : MEASURMENTS OF INT ERIM PROGRESS Instructions: Each SEA must include the measurements of interim progress for academic achievement, graduation rates, and English language proficiency consistent with the long -term goals described in Section 1 for all students and separately for each subgroup of students (except that measurements of interim progress for English language proficiency must only be described for English learners), consistent with the State's minimum number of students. For academic achievement and graduation rates, the State's measurements of interim progress require greater rates of improvement for subgroups of students that are lower -achieving or graduating at lower rates, respectively. A. Academic Achievement B. Graduation Rate s C. English Language Proficiency Appendix I Student Learning Index An accountability system based on continuous improvement changes reporting from a compliance activity to a process that enables positive change at a local level. To ensure that accountability doesn't impede improvement, each state needs to find the right mix of measures that come together to tell a holistic story about how schools and their students are performing - and those measures must provide enough meaningful information to help states plan and implement appropriate and targeted supports. Transparency of the many factors that influence performance or diversity in performance is critical to creating an accountability system focused on improvement. If the system wants to recognize positive movement towards the vision, ac hievement and growth should both be considered. Given that every school has a different starting point on their journey of improvement, achievement and growth can vary in the improvement targets established for the school. The Student Learning Index prov ides a measuring and monitoring structure that is responsive to the starting point for each institution in its unique journey to improve student learning. The structure is designed to recognize and be responsive to movement whereas both achievement levels attained and growth of achievement realized. However, the expectations for each institution is dependent on their prior year's achievement levels rather than a static expectation that every institution must realize the same growth and attain the same ach ievement level. Each school is unique therefore the Student Learning Index must be responsive to this reality. The basic structure expects schools with high achievement levels (top performing quartile) to maintain such levels while realizing minimal, but recognizable, growth. Schools with low achievement (lowest performing quartile) have a much longer road to reach expected achievement levels. Therefore the expectation for low performing schools at the beginning of their journey is high growth while impr oving over time and closing the gap to reach expected levels of achievement. Schools in the middle two quartiles are expected to demonstrate a balance of growth and achievement gains on an annual basis. Schools in the second quartile are expected to rea lize more growth than achievement gains whereas schools in the third quartile are expected to maintain an equal balance between growth and achievement. The goal of this system is to move all schools, over a defined period in time, to reach and sustain desirable achievement levels for student learning. Schools that create positive movement should be dully recognized. Schools that struggle to achieve any movement or experience negative movement should be identified as targets for support and intervention. The Student Learning Index guides and recognizes schools that generate and sustain improvement over time. Sample Methodology to Calculate the Student Learning Index Step 1: Calculate Achievement Exceed Expectations Greater than 1.0 Standard Deviation from the mean Meets Expectations Between -1.0 and +1.0 of the Standard Deviation from the mean Approaching Expectations Between -2.0 and -1.0 of the Standard Deviation from the mean Does Not Meet Expectations Less than -2.0 of the Standard Deviation from the mean Step 2 : Calculate Growth Exceed Expectations At least 1.5 year of growth Meets Expectations Between 1 and 1.5 year of growth Approaching Expectations Between .5 and 1.0 year of growth Does Not Meet Expectations Less than .5 year of growth NOTE: The assessment instrument used should provide an achievement score as well as a growth measure. Step 3 : Assign Value Points Per Student Exceed Expectations 1.5 value points Meets Expectations 1.0 value points Approaching Expectations 0.5 value points Does Not Meet Expectations -1.0 value points Determine each school's Achievement Impact Quotient (AIQ) and Growth Impact Quotient (GIQ) by dividing the sum of all its value points by the total number of students (Example below) Step 4 : Assign Each School to a Quadrant Plot schools using the Achievement and Growth Impact Quotients. Note: The axis is defined by the state's highest and lowest AIQ and GIQ. Step 4 : Calculate the Student Learning Index (SLI) Determine the formula that will be used to weight achievement and growth for each quadrant . Calculate the SLI for each school by applying the appropriate formula for each school. Sample Formula A 1ST Quadrant : High Growth/High Achievement .75A + .25G = SLI 2nd Quadrant : High Growth/Low Achievement .25A + . 75G = SLI 3rd Quadrant: Low Growth/Low Achievement .50A + .50 G = SLI 4th Quadrant: Low Growth/High Achievement .75A + .2 5G = SLI The sample calculations above recognize schools that created and/or sustained positive movement. The schools with the highest Student Learning Index are creating the most movement and improvement over time. Schools with the lowest Student Learning Index are targets for assistance and support depending on the requi rements of the state's accountability plan.

Appendix O 1 | P a g eState of North Dakota Department of Public Instruction Kirsten Baesler, State Superintendent 600 East Boulevard Avenue, Dept. 201 Bismarck, ND 58505 -0440 www.nd.gov/dpi North Dakota State Plan to Ensure Equitable Access to Excellent Educators August 28, 2015 2 | P a g eIntroduction In July 2014 , Secretary Duncan announced our Excellent Educators for All initiative, designed to move America toward the day when every student in every public school is taught by excellent educators. As part of the initiative, consistent with section 1111(b)(8)(C) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), each State ed ucational agency (SEA) must submit to the U.S. Department of Education (USDE), a State Plan to Ensure Equitable Access to Excellent Educators (State Plan) that ensures \"poor and minority children are not taught at higher rates than other children by inexpe rienced, unqualified, or out -of-field teachers\" as required by section 1111(b)(8)(C) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). Equality of opportunity is a core American value. Equal educational opportunity means ensuring the schools ha ve the resources they need to provide meaningful opportunities for all students to succeed, regardless of family income or race. To accomplish this goal, all students must have equitable access to a safe and healthy place to learn, high -quality instruction al materials and supports, rigorous expectations and course work, and , most critically, excellent educators to guide learning. Yet, too often, students from low -income families and students of color are less likely than their peers to attend a school staff ed by excellent educators, and are more likely than their peers to attend a school staffed by inexperienced educators or educators rated as ineffective. These inequities are unacceptable, and it is essential that a priority be placed on working collaborati vely to ensure all children have access to the high -quality education they deserve, and all educators have the resources and support they need to provide that education for all children. The North Dakota Department of Public Instruction (NDDPI) submits thi s State Equity Plan for meeting the Title I and Title II requirements under ESEA. This narrative and all annotated support materials attached herein constitute the full state plan for meeting the Excellent Educators for All initiative. The S tate of North D akota is committed to ensuring every public school student will graduate from high school college or career ready . In North Dakota, we have historically had a firm practice in place that all teachers have to be highly qualified. When the Highly Qualified T eacher (HQT) requirements were enacted in No Child Left Behind (NCLB), North Dakota followed suit and changed our state law to align with ESEA. North Dakota has had 100% of our teachers highly qualified in all schools regardless of the poverty level. In go ing through the process again to update our State Equity Plan, it remained clear that there remains only a minimal gap across the state with regard to the rate that poor students are taught by an unqualified teacher compared to students who are not poor . There is, of course, always room for improvement, especially with something as important as ensuring equity for all North Dakota students. The NDDPI remains committed to addressing the limited gaps that do exist to make improvements statewide. North Dakota is a state that strongly believes in and supports local control. Therefore, the role of the NDDPI is to submit a State Equity Plan that provides our schools and districts with 3 | P a g etechnical assistance, strategies and ideas to help them implement better plans, and policies within their school system that will ultimately ensure all North Dakota students are taught by excellent educators. It is not the role of the NDDPI to over regulate or force districts to implement certain strategies. The intent of the North Da kota State Equity Plan is to ensure poor and minority students are not taught by inexperienced, unqualified, or out -of-field tea chers at higher rates than their counterparts . In order to have all students reach proficiency, it is imperative every student h as a highly qualified teacher. Teachers have a critical role in actualizing this commitment; thus, NDDPI is also committed to ensuring every child has a competent, caring, and effective teacher. Research clearly points to the power of quality teaching in improving student academic achievement. Thus, this equitable distribution plan will : 1)Determine where inequities in teacher assignments exist in North Dakota public elementary and secondary schools; 2)Locate statewide disparities including dispa rities withi n larger districts; and, 3)Highlight strategies for eliminating these inequities to promote the long -term placement of effective teachers with the children who need them the most. Definition of \" Excellent Educators\" NCLB mandates all teachers be highly qualified. The requirement that teachers be highly qualified applies to all elementary or secondary school teachers employed by a public local educational agency who teach a core academic subject (e.g., English, reading or language arts, math ematics , science, foreign languages, civics and government, economics, arts, history , and geography) . The term \"highly qualified\" means the teacher: 1.Has obtained full state certification from ESPB as a teacher or passed the state tea cher licensing examination and holds a license to teach in the state, and does not have certification or licensure requirements waived on an emergency, temporary, or provisional basis; 2.Holds a minimum of a bachelor's degree; and, 3.Has demonstrated subject -matter competency in each of the academic subjects in which the teacher teaches, in a manner determined by the state and in compliance with federal statute. The statutory definition subject -matter includes additional elements that apply somewhat differently to teachers new and not new to the profession, and to elementary and secondary school teachers. Such differentiations are defined in various sections of the NCLB and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ). 4 | P a g eAccording to the federal de finition, almost all teachers in the state of North Dakota meet the highly qualified requirement. However, being \"highly qualified\" does not necessarily translate to \"highly effective\" teaching. In recent years, there has been a shift to teacher effectiven ess. Currently, the NDDPI is updating teacher evaluation guidelines to meet current thinking around teacher evaluation practices. The NDDPI is also developing a state teacher evaluation model that can be used by districts if their current teacher evaluatio n system does not meet the updated guidelines. All North Dakota districts are required to use a teacher evaluation system meeting the updated guidelines in the 2015 -2016 school year. Overview of the Equity P lan Development Process To develop the North Dakota State Equity Plan , the NDDPI staff used a four step process. First, education stakeholders from across North Dakota were identified and requested to be a part of the State Equity Initiative Planning Committee , which was an integ ral part of ensuring the State Equity Plan being developed was authentic and feasible for North Dakota public schools and districts. Second, state -level data were gathered to determine w here equity strengths and gaps existed in North Dakota . Third, using t he state -level data, a root cause analysis process was conducted to identify the source of the equity gaps. Fourth, practical strategies to eliminate the equity gaps based on the identified root causes were selected for implementation by appropriate educat ion stakeholders. The remainder of this plan focuses on the details of each of these four steps. Stakeholder Engagement The NDDPI understands the importance of obtaining broad stakeholder input in any statewide initiative and most certainly in the development of this State Equity Plan. We believe that stakeholder input is a strength of our North Dakota plan. North Dakota had created a committee when we began working on our ESEA Flexibility waiver . To establish our State Equity Initiative Planning C ommittee, the NDDPI went back to our ESEA W aiver Committee as a start and then updated that group. Following this established process was helpful to both the field and NDDPI personnel as it was a familia r process that was used successfully two years ago when the state created an ESEA Flexibility Waiver application. The committee represents a comprehensive group of key stakeholders across the state. More than 19 various stakeholder groups are represented o n the committee. The State Equity Initiative Planning Committee list is included in the plan as Appendix A. The NDDPI was proactive after receiving written notice by the USDE that each state needs to submit an e quity plan by June 1, 2015. In November 2014 , NDDPI staff began the process to establish an Equity Initiative Planning Committee . Careful consideration was given to ensure there would be broad and diverse representation and that all key education stakeholder groups were included. The committee inclu des 26 members represent ing the many different stakeholder groups across the state including the following: 5 | P a g eNDDPI Unit Directors North Dakota Indian Affairs Commission NDDPI State Superintendent North Dakota Regional Education Association s NDDPI Title I Committee of Practitioners North Dakota United (ND Teacher Union) North Dakota Association of School Administrators North Dakota University System North Dakota Association of Secondary School Principals Office of the Governor North Dakota Council of E ducational Leaders Pathfinder Parent Center/IDEA Advisory Committee North Dakota Department of Career and Technical Education Teacher Education Programs - North Dakota University System North Dakota Education Standards and Practices Board North Central Comprehensive Center at McREL International North Dakota English Language Learners Center on Great Teachers and Leaders In reviewing the list of stakeholders in Appendix A, it may appear certain groups were only represented by one member (ELL, parents, Special Education). However, many of the stakeholders had dual representation. The ND DPI felt strongly about having a committee that wasn't too large, as then it becomes more difficult to make progress and get work done in a timely manner. The NDDPI wanted the committee to have a manageable number; we knew from past experience that a smaller sized group is more productive. Each of the stakeholder members were also responsible to go back to their collective groups all throughout the process to gather feedback so each group was adequately represented. Stakeholder Meetings The State Equity Initiative Planning Committee convened four times between December 2014 and June 2 015. The NDDPI State Superintendent, Kirsten Baesler, opened each meeting with welcome remarks to the Committee. Her attendance at these meetings demonstrated the importance of the equity plan to the Committee members and set the tone that stakeholder input is valued and critical to the equity plan . Further, she fully s upported the NDDPI staff in the development of the North Dakota S tate Equity Plan. The Committee had its first meeting on December 16, 2014. At this meeting, NDDPI staff provided key background i nformation about the Excellent Educators for All initiative, the process that would be used to develop the North Dakota state plan, and their role or representation in the development of the North Dakota state plan. At this first meeting, the Committee als o reviewed data provided by the NDDPI. 6 | P a g eOn February 19, 2015, the Committee had a second meeting. During this meeting, NDDPI staff provided an update on the ESEA authorization and potential impact on the North Dakota state plan. The Committee also reviewed data bar charts created to easily reveal equity gaps. Then, staff from the North Central Comprehensive Center and Center on Great Teachers and Leaders co-facilitated a root c ause analysis process to identify the root causes of the identified equity gaps. Committee members provided their input on what the root causes are for each of the equity gaps identified. On April 1, 2015, the Committee convened for a third meeting. Durin g this meeting, NDDPI and North Central Comprehensive Center staff co -facilitated a process to gather feedback on draft sections on the North Dakota state plan that had been drafted thus far. Further, the Committee members were provided a process for gathe ring feedback from their stakeholders about the North Dakota state plan. This feedback was provided back to the NDDPI for integration into the North Dakota state plan. On May 14, 2015 the Committee had its fourth and f inal meeting. At this meeting, NDDPI and North Central Comprehensive Center staff provided the Committee members with the feedback received from the Committee members' stakeholders as well as the Equitable Access Support Network . They also co-facilitated a process to gather additional feedback from the Committee members on the full draft of the North Dakota state plan . Authenticity of Stakeholder Engagement Great care was taken to ensure our stakeholder engagement was broad and authentic. The NDDPI created a similar statewide committee to review and study the possibility of North Dakota applying for an ESEA flexibility waiver. We went back to this committee as our base for creating the State Equity Initiative Plan ning Committee. We then adde d members to fill in the gaps identified to insure we have representation from all stakeholder groups that had extensive knowledge and experience about education in North Dakota, including elementary, secondary, and post -secondary education. The NDDPI beli eves the Committee created has authentic representation and is a true reflection of individuals with a vested interest in ensuring all students are taught by excellent educators. Receiving and Incorporating Stakeholder Input Throughout the state equity pl an development, the NDDPI staff encouraged the Committee members to provide their input and feedback into North Dakota's plan. Gathering their input and feedback was intensively performed during the four Committee meetings. Further, the NDDPI staff provide d Committee members with a process to gather and document feedback from their organization's stakeholders on the draft state equity plan. See Appendix B for the documentation form Committee members completed and submitted to the NDDPI staff. 7 | P a g eContinued Stak eholder Engagement The NDDPI will continue to engage stakeholder committee members in order to ensure the State Equity Plan is implemented as intended . As guidance is created and strategies put in place, all State Equity Initiative Plan ning Committee members will be included in the disseminated information so that there is statewide awareness of those who contributed to the information as well as to enable committee members to follow up with district s. The c ommittee members will also share the informat ion with staff within their organization as well as their organization's stakeholders . The NDDPI will also periodically bring together committee members to review the status of the plan and discuss implementation. Monitoring data will be used during these discussions. Committee members will also be surveyed to gather input and feedback on how implementation is progressing . Finally, the NDDPI intends to employ another strategy of joining existing meetings for ongoing engagement in the fall of 2015. Equity Strengths and Gaps Key Terminology The NDDPI defines the key equitable access terms in the following manner : oInexperienced teacher - teachers having three or less years of teaching experience. oUnqualified teacher - teachers who are not qualified according to North Dakota state licensure laws to teach a specific course. oOut-of-field teacher - teachers who have been assigned to teach a class for which they are not highly qualified. This category does not exist in North Dakota as it is not allowable under st ate or federal law to assign an educator to teach a class for which they are not considered highly qualified. oEconomically disadvantaged (or poor) student - a child who is eligible for free or reduced price meals. oMinority student - a student having racial or ethnic origins in any group o ther than the majority for the state . oEducators - the group of professionals who are the focus of the State Plan. The NDDPI considers the term educators to include teachers, principals, and other school -based instructional staff. The NDDPI encourages an SEA to consider all educators when developing its State Plan because, although ESEA section 1111(b)(8)(C) focuses on student access to teachers, all educators are vital to students' success and their preparation for college or careers.8 | P a g eoEducation Standards and Practices Board (ESPB) - independent board responsib le for teacher licensure, teacher education program approval, professional development and professional practices. oExcellent Educators - High quality educators who guide and support all students in getting and remaining on track to graduate from high school rea dy for college or careers (i.e. effective teachers) . Future determinations of \"excellent educators\" will be based on teacher evaluations once our process and tools are completed. oEquity Gap - refers to the difference between the rate at which students fro m low - income families or students of color are educated by excellent educators and the rate at which other students are educated by excellent educators. By statute, a State Plan must, at a minimum, address the difference between the rate at which students from low income families or students of color are taught by inexperienced, unqualified, or out -of- field teachers and the rate at which other students are taught by these teachers. An SEA has the discretion to use school - or student -level data to identify equity gaps. The State Equity Plan Initiative Planning Committee considered a percentage difference of >5.0% an equity gap while a percentage difference of 5.0% was considered an equity strength . Further, equity gaps were identified by the State Equity P lan Initiative Planning Committee members given their extensive knowledge, experience, and expertise regarding education in the state of North Dakota. oEquitable Access - describes the situation in which students from low -income families and students of color are educated by excellent educators at rates that are at least equal to the rates at which other students are educated by excellent educators. An SEA has discretion i n whether and how to define this term for the purpose of its State Plan. By statute, a State Plan must, at a minimum, address how the SEA will ensure students from low -income families and students of color are not taught at higher rates than other student s by inexperienced, unqualified, or out -of-field teachers. However, the NDDPI encourages an SEA to adopt a more ambitious definition of \"equitable access\" that reflects the fact that certain subgroups of students \u2014 including students with disabilities and English Learners as well as students from low -income families and students of color \u2014 have been historically underserved. As a result, they may need greater access to excellent educators than their peers in order to get and remain on track to graduate fr om high school ready for college or careers. oRegional Education Association (REA) - a group of school districts seeking to improve their educational programs and services through cooperation and pooling of resources. NDREA is a network of eight REAs in North Dakota. In North Dakota, 93% of all public school districts in the state are members of an REA. Over 98% of all public school students in the state are served by an REA. Each REA offers unique programs and services based on the needs of the region.9 | P a g eoHigh Poverty School - refers to schools with poverty percentages that are 40% or higher. oLow Poverty School - refers to schools with poverty percentages below 40%. Data Sources The Management Information Systems within the NDDPI categorized all North Dakota public schools into the highest and lowest quartile of percentage of enrolled students who are \"poor students\" or \"minority students\". These schools are \"low poverty schools\", \"high minority schools\", or \"low minority schools. Thus, t by USDE based on the State Plans to Ensure Equitable Access to Excelle nt Educators: Frequently Asked Questions disseminated November 2014, NDDPI developed the following guiding questions to focus data analysis: 1.To what extent are \" high poverty schools \" being taught by an \"inexperienced teacher\" compared to non -\"low poverty schools \"? 2.To what extent are students in \"high minority schools\" being taught by an \"inexperienced teacher\" compared to students in \"low minority schools\"? 3.To what extent are \" high poverty schools \" being taught by an \"unqualified teacher\" compared to non -\"low poverty schools \"? 4.To what extent are students in \"high minority schools\" being taught by an \"unqualified teacher\" compared to students in \"low minority schools\"? 5.To what extent are \" high poverty schools \" being taught by an \"out -of-field teacher\" compar ed to non -\"low poverty schools \"? 6.To what extent are \" high minority schools \" being taught by an \"out -of-field teacher\" compared to \"low minority schools\" ? For guiding questions 5 and 6, \"out-of-field teachers \" are considered unqualified in North Dakota. Fu rther, North Dakota does not allow out -of-field teachers to teach in North Dakota schools. Thus, the guiding questions relat ed to out -of-field teachers do not pertain to North Dakota. The following data sources were used to answer the guiding questions and determine the equity gaps in North Dakota: North Dakota Department of Public Instructions Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) report for the 2013 -2014 academic year (HQT Report) and Educator Equity Profile for North Dakota based on 2011 -2012 academic year (State Equity Profile). The HQT Report identifies teachers who are deemed highly qualified according to North Dakota Century Code for schools that have large and small populations of impoverished students by core courses (e.g., reading/lan guage arts, mathematics, science, foreign language, social studies, and art), school type (e.g., elementary and secondary), and school enrollment (e.g., <100, 100 -250, 251-500, 501 -1,000, and >1,000 students). The State Equity Profile provides comparisons of various educator characteristics, such as those in their first year of teaching or not certified, within schools that have large and small populations of impoverished students.10 | P a g eAdditionally, a survey of the State Equity Initiative Planning Committee was administered in December 2014 (Planning Committee Survey). The Planning Committee Survey asked the State Equity Plan Initiative Planning Committee members to identify what they think the top three needs are for North Dakota schools. Identification of Eq uity Strengths and Gaps Equity strengths and gaps are revealed as the data were analyzed and the focus questions were answered. As mentioned in the key terminology, a percentage difference of >5.0% was considered an equity gap while a percentage differenc e of 5.0% was considered an equity strength . Below are graphical representations of the equity strengths and gaps by focus question using the HQT Report . 1.To what extent are \" high poverty schools \" being taught by an \"inexperienced teacher\" compared to \"low poverty schools \"? There was a 7.3% difference in high poverty secondary schools compared to low poverty secondary schools being taught by new, inexperienced teachers. There was a 5.51% difference at the elementary school level between high and low poverty schools. The State Equity Initiative Planning Committee members considered these differences an equity gap . 11 | P a g e2.To what extent are students in \"high minority schools\" being taught by an \"inexperienced teacher\" compared to students in \"low minority schools\"? There was a 2.43% difference in high minority secondary schools compared to low minority secondary schools being taught by new, inexperienced teachers. There was a 2.08% difference at the elementary school level between high and low minority schools. The State Equity Initiative Planning Committee members considered these differences an equity strength . 3.To what extent are \" high poverty schools \" being taught by an \"unqualified teacher\" compared to \"\"? There was a 0.04% difference in high poverty secondary s chools compared to low poverty secondary schools being taught by unqualified teachers.

There wa s a 0.01 % difference in students in high minority secondary schools compared to students in low minority secondary schools being taught by unqualified teachers. There was a 0.00% difference in students in high minority elementary school level compared to students in low minority elementary schools . The State Equity Initiative Planning Committee members considered these differences an equity strength . Planning Committee Survey findings revealed numerous needs for North Dakota schools, including: teacher and school leader recruitment and retention, teacher shortage, mentoring and support for new teachers, and inequitable access to professional development. The State Equity Initiative Planning Committee members considered these to be equity gaps . Given the Committee members' extensive knowledge and experience with education in North Dakota and based on these data, the following were considered equity gaps by the Committee members : Higher levels of new teachers teaching in high poverty schools than in low poverty schools ; Teacher recruitment and retention ; Teacher shortage areas ; and, Equitable Access to high quality professional development (PD) . When the No Child Left Behind Act was signed into law in 2002, the State of North Dakota adopted the major equivalency requirements into the North Dakot a Century Code ( NDCC \u00a7 67.1 -02-03-07). This strong alignment between No Child Left Behind and North Dakota Century 100.00% 99.89% 0.00% 0.11%100.00% High Minority Schools Low Minority Schools0.01% difference 0.00% difference13 | P a g eCode required all North Dakota educators to meet the No Child Left Behind requirements to teach in North Dakota. These 13 years of alignment have contributed to the low equity issues across the state. Quantifying the percentages provided in the report is a challenge for North Dakota as student data is collected separately than teacher data. We are not able to provide exact figures due to the di sjointed collection process. We can summarize our overall student population in relation to the distribution of teachers. To put these quantities into perspective, during the 2013 -2014 school year, 103,242 students were enrolled within our public schools ( 24,556 in high poverty schools and 78,686 in low poverty schools). The student poverty data cannot be consistently disaggregated by school (elementary and secondary) and cannot be tracked back to teachers. This is an area the state is well aware of and wi ll be working toward addressing for measuring future metrics relating to equity. When examining all of the course data provided in this report, the State of North Dakota holds firm that the percentages less than 5% are seen as strengths and impact a minima l number of students throughout the state's educational system. Strategies for Eliminating Equity Gaps Theory of Action The North Dakota Department of Instruction is committed to ensuring that every student in a North Dakota school is taught b y an excellent teacher. The North Dakota Department of Instruction recognizes that to accomplish this goal that systemic strategies are employed to eliminate the identified equity gaps. The North Dakota Department of Instruction's plan to eliminate the iden tified gaps is predicated on the following theory of action: If a comprehensive approach to the human capital management and support of teachers is systemically implemented and implementation is monitored and modified over time, Then North Dakota school districts will be better able to recruit, retain, and develop excellent teachers such that all students have equitable access to excellent teaching to help them achieve their highest potential in school and beyond. Identification of Root Causes The root cause analysis process employed by the State Equity Initiative Planning Committee was supported by staff from the North Central Comprehensive Center and Center for Great Teachers and Leaders. The process consisted of three steps: 1.Iden tification of Relevant and Available Data: The guiding questions were developed and data needed to answer the guiding questions were identified. The data were provided by the Management Information Systems Unit within the NDDPI . Charts were developed as user-friendly, graphical representations of the data to assist with the data analysis.14 | P a g e 2. Analysis of Data and Identification of Equity Strengths and Gaps : The State Equity Initiative Planning Committee identified the equity strengths and gaps based on the data charts. The identified equity gaps were used for the root cause analysis. 3. Analysis of Root Causes : With support from the North Central Comprehensive Center and Center for Great Teachers and Leader s staff co -facilitation, the State Equity Initiative Planning Committee brainstormed root causes that may underlay the identified equity gaps , using the WHY? Method. This Method includes three steps: 1) Identify plausible contributing factors(s). 2) Ask \"Why?\" o f each equity gap and answer \"Because...\" at least three times. 3) Stop asking \"Why?\" when a key contributing factor of the equity gap is revealed . 4) The root causes were then categorized by themes. As a result of step 2, the following equity gaps emerged: higher levels of new teachers teaching in high poverty schools than in low poverty schools teacher and school leader recruitment and retention, teacher shortage, mentoring and support for new teachers, and inequitable access to professional development. For step 3, Table 1 presents the root causes for each of the equity gap as identified by the State Equity Initiative Planning Committee during their second meeting. Table 1.

School is starting statewide and there are still many unfilled positions. A statewide teacher shortage task force assembled in June by Superintendent of Public Instruction Kirsten Baesler advanced a proposal to the E ducation Standards & Practice Board to give school districts that are having difficulty hiring teachers the authority to request a hardship waiver. The waiver would allow a community expert to become a classroom teacher in the subject area of his or her expertise. For example, a school district could hire an experienced farmer who lacks a college degree in education to be licensed to teach vocational agriculture. North Dakota's E ducation Standards & Practice Board , which is the state's teacher licensing agency, voted unanimously to endorse the proposal. Under its terms, waiver applications would be submitted to the Education Standards & Practice Board , which would decide whether to approve them. The proposal is cur rently being reviewed by the Governor. This issue surfaced at the time the NDDPI was preparing to submit our revised State Equity plan. We requested and received a two week extension to get resolve to this issue and incorporate it into our plan. To date, t he Governor has not approved the community expert proposal . The NDDPI shares this information as it is applicable to the work encompassed through the State Equity plan. Regardless of the outcome, the community expert proposal only appl ies to non -core positions, so we are not in violation of any federal requirement. Selected Strategies During and after the third stakeholder meeting, t he State Equity Initiative Planning Committee identified practical strategies to address the root causes. Table 2 align s the equity g aps with identified root causes, and selected strategies . Also presented in Table 2 are the responsible party/parties for each of the selected strategies as well as the essential activities that will be taken for each strategy. Please note that some strategies were used to address multiple equity gaps. For example, signing bonuses may be used to attract and recruit teachers to the field and in areas where there are teacher shortages. The tables presented on the preceding pages are an initial drafting of strategies identified by the State Equity Initiative Planning Committee , as well as by their constituency groups, through the planning process. The tables are meant to be working documents that will change and be adjusted as we begin the implementation phase of the state equity plan. In each table, we have listed the lead parties responsible for implementing each strategy. As we begin to work on each strate gy, we will broaden the groups to collaborate with other stakeholders.17 | P a g eTable 2.

implement the State Equity Plan . In order to adequately address equity issues statewide, the NDDPI has both financial resources as well as human resources to ensure that the strategies outlined in the plan are implemented in order to assist schools and districts in ensuring that all students have access to excellent educators. The NDDPI has several categories of funding a vailable to assist with equity is sues statewide. The federal Title programs within the ESEA are all consolidated within one unit in the NDDPI. Therefore, any initiatives or resources focused on addressing equity is sues can draw from the various T itle progr ams (e.g., Title I, Title II Part A, Title II State Discretionary, and Title III) that all are required to ensure compliance with equity provisions. In addition, there is strong collaboration with the Special Education unit in the NDDPI. Special Education has multiple members on the State Equity Initiative Planning Committee and has been an integral part of developing the statewide plan. All North Dakota districts annually complete a consolidated application to budget and access their federal Title funding. Each district is required to complete a narrative section on the consolidated application and outline measures employed by the district to ensure all students have equal access to highly qualified teachers. If barriers exist, the district address es strate gies that will be put in place to resolve those equity gaps. The S tate Legislature also provides financial resources to address equity issues and ensure that all students have access to excellent educators. The State Legislature supports a statewide mento ring program through ESPB. This program ensures that new teachers receive the guidance and support in those critical first years of teaching. In addition, the State Legislature provides funding for mandatory professional development for all North Dakota te achers to ensure that educators receive high quality professional development aimed at addressing key educational issues in each district. The NDDPI also has a significant number of human resources available to assist in the process of addressing equity st atewide. Within the NDDPI, multiple units are part of the State Equity Initiative Planning Committee and will also be integrally involved in the implementation phase of the plan. These staff include: Robert Marthaller Assistant Superintendent Greg Gallaghe r Standards and Achievement Steve Snow Statewide Data Systems Sherry Houdek Teacher & School Effectiveness Lucy Fredericks Indian /Multicultural Education Gerry Teevens Special Education Peg Wagner Academic Support Laurie Matzke Federal Title Programs 24 | P a g eThe NDDPI plan s to keep the State Equity Initiative Planning Committee involved as w e move into the implementation phase. The NDDPI will frequently survey members and seek input on the various resources to be created. The director of the ESPB has been and w ill continue to be a key player in the State Equity Plan . As the ESPB is responsible for the licensure of teachers and also oversees the state -funded mentoring program, it will be crucial to maintain communication and work together to roll out the various strategies identified within the State Equity Plan . The combination of financial resources and well -informed department and stakeholder groups came together as supports for the North Dakota State Equity Initiative. For these reasons, North Dakota has the c apacity and framework in place to implement this initiative. Timelines and Milestones The NDDPI has identified within our State Equity Plan numerous strategies for districts as they address the teacher equity issue in their school system. On pages 1 6-21 of this equity plan, the chart identifies strategies and activities for addressing teacher equity and also identifies a timeline for guidance on the various strategies to be completed. In addition, below we have created a chart that highlights the milesto nes for the development and implementation of North Dakota's State Equity plan.

These data collection methods will provide the NDDPI with the data needed to determine those schools and districts that may need to be monitored or reviewed in relationship to the equitable distribution of high quality teachers. The data collected will provide the information that the NDDPI need s to underst and where strategy implementation issues are occurring. The data will be reviewed by the ND DPI staff and the State Equity Initiative Planning Committee members on an annual basis to determine what course corrections and adjustments need to be made. 1.The re view and analysis of data from districts North Dakota school districts submit data regarding teacher assignments through the MIS03 re port , which is available for both the regular school year and state summer school. All contracted professional educational staff members working in North Dakota schools must complete an MIS03 (SFN 9111) form on an annual basis through the State Automated Reporting System (S TARS ). The two general classifications of employees involved are as follows: A.Professional Educational Staff Member - A professional educational staff member is a person who is performing activities regarded as professional in the field of education by the laws and regulati ons governing licensing in the S tate of North Dakota. All professional educational pe rsonnel employed in an elementary, junior high/middle, and/or secondary school operated by a Local Education Agency (LEA) including public schools, career and technology centers, special education units, schools operated by the BIA, state institution schoo ls, and nonpublic schools must complete an MIS03 form. Only persons holding the following positions must complete an MIS03 form: assistant director, assistant principal, assistant superintendent, coordinator, director, school counselor, counselor designate , instructional programmer, library media specialist, principal, pupil personnel, school psychologist, speech -language pathologist, superintendent of schools, supervisor, and teachers. Full-time contracted substitute teachers do not complete an MIS03. Coun ty superintendents and assistant county superintendents are not required to complete an MIS03 form unless they are holding additional position(s) previously listed. B.Positions Which Do Not Require a Teaching License - Persons assigned to positions not lis ted in section A above (e.g., social workers) must be listed on the PER02 Nonlicensed Personnel Form (SFN 9113) even if they have a license in their area of specialization. TEACHER AIDES AND PARAPROFESSIONALS must not fill out this form (MIS03) but must be included on the PER02. The MIS03 is submitted on an annual basis by all schools and districts on or before September 19. Schools and districts must submit revised MIS03 forms to reflect any 26 | P a g echanges throughout the school year. Personnel revisions include e mployment of new staff, termination of employment, and assignment changes (e.g., new courses, course cancellations). The MIS03 collects the school and district information associated with professional teaching staff, their North Dakota Educator's Professi onal License number, name, date of birth, gender, ethnicity and race, total salary, contract period, school's employee number, number of years of educational experience (in -state and out -of-state), previous year employment history, number of years of contr acted administrative experience, FTE, position assignment, area of responsibility, highest earned degree, and courses in which they are teaching. These data will be used to assess the extent to which new teachers are teaching in high poverty schools compar ed to low poverty schools, monitoring this equity gap. In addition, schools submit data to the Federal Title Programs office via the Consolidated Application for F ederal Title funding, which includes : Reporting the number of core academic classes that were taught by highly qualified teachers the previous school year, which at this time must be 100% Title II Part A Funding Priorities - Every school district must conduct a needs assessment to determine the needs of the teaching force in order to have all students meet challenging state content and academic achievement standards. After conducting a needs assessment, districts must target Title II Part A funds to schools within the district that have the lowest proportion of highly qualified teachers, have t he largest class size, or are identified for school improvement under Title I. Equity provision - Each district accepting federal funds must include in its application a description of the steps it proposes to take to ensure that all students are taught by a highly qualified teacher. Further, specific questions will be added to gather data on if and how the district is implementing the selected strategies. (Appendix D) 2.The application and Federal Title Programs consolidated monitoring process The Federal Title Programs office has an established consolidated monitoring process for Title I and Title II of the ESEA. All districts are monitored on a rotating schedule. When districts are monitored, staff review the various components related to the equitable distribution of teachers statewide. A review of each district's needs assessment and professional development plan is conducted. Staff ensure that each school disseminates information to parents regarding the Parent's Right to Know clause within Title I law. This document shows parents the distribution of teachers, whether or not each teacher is highly qualified, the years of experience each teacher has, and any endorsements held. In monitoring Title II Part A, NDDPI staff will address the distrib ution of highly qualified teachers and access to high quality professional development , which will monitor another equity gap . (Appendix E)27 | P a g e3.Through teacher licensure and certification In North Dakota, the Education Standards and Practices Board (ESPB) is responsible for teacher licensure and certification. This entity is not part of the NDDPI , but rather a self - functioning board supported by the state and teacher licensure fees. The ND DPI works closely with the ESPB regarding all teacher licensing issues, mentoring programs, and induction programs for new teachers. The ESPB Executive Director was a member of the State Equity Initiative Planning Committee and attended every meeting to provide guidance and support on ways in which ESPB can support the implementation of the selected strategies to close equity gaps. The ESPB monitors closely the highly qualified teacher provision to ensure that gaps are not increasing in any particular area and works hard to ensure that the highly qualified provisions are adhered to. The board has implemented a system that fines both the teacher and administrator if a teacher is found to be teaching out of field. 4.Through the approval and accreditation of schools In North Dakota, the acc reditation of schools is done through Advanc ED through contracted services. The NDDPI's Teacher and School Effectiveness unit is responsible for mana ging the process through Advanc ED as well as maintaining the reporting of teachers and administrators. Purs uant to the school approval and accreditation provisions defined within the North Dakota Century Code and the North Dakota Administrative Code, the NDDPI stipulates that the State of North Dakota has established meaningful compliance provisions that enforc e the HQT provisions set forth within the NCLB act and all subsequent USDE guidance documentation. The state has established clear definitions for highly qualified teachers through its licensure assurances. The state has established a valid and reliable me ans of monitoring and validating the compliance of proper assignments for all teachers. The combined authority of the state's teacher licensure laws and rules with the state's school approval and accreditation laws and rules set a clear policy for ensuring compliance with the provisions of HQT. The state has clearly linked the state's HQT provisions to the state's school approval and accreditation provisions. Specifically, these provisions within state law and rules require that all approved schools meet th e provisions of HQT or face noncompliance with approval law, accreditation rules, and possible financial sanctions. The State of North Dakota has established a zero -tolerance policy for non -compliance with the provisions of HQT. Effective July 1, 2006, any school that assigns a teacher outside his/her approved area of licensure will be in violation of the state's teacher licensure law, state approval law, and state accreditation rules.28 | P a g eOngoing Monitoring and Support Key dates for progress monitoring 1.Revi ew & Analysis of Data MIS03Fall 2015 Fall 2016 Due October 15th Review November - January 2.Consolidated Application Review Reporting number of Core Academic classes taught by highly qualified teachers Title II Part A Funding Priorities Equity ProvisionFall 2015 Fall 2016 Consolidated application due in August Review and approval in fall 3.Consolidated MonitoringWinter/Spring 2016 Winter/Spring 2017 Monitoring occurs January -March 4.ESPB Monitoring & Oversight Ongoing 5.Approval & Accreditation of SchoolsFall 2016 Fall 2017 Due to NDDPI October 1st AdvancEd reviews - Ongoing 6.Review of HQT Data for EdFacts SubmissionsFall 2015 Fall 2016 Review August -September 29 | P a g eResponsible Entities There are multiple entities that will share the responsibility for the ongoing monitoring of the State Equity Initiative. The lead agency is the NDDPI. The Federal Title Programs, Standards and Achievement unit, and the Teacher & School Effectiveness units will all share in the responsibility for monitoring and collecting data pertaining to the North Dakota State Equity Plan . Questions r egarding the State Equity Plan can be directed to any of the following NDDPI staff. Laurie Matzke, Director Greg Gallaghe r, Director Director Federal Title Programs Standards and Achievement Teacher & School Effectiveness (701)328-2284 (701)328-1838 (701)328-2755 lmatzke@nd.gov ggallagher@nd.gov Specifically, these NDDPI staff will be responsible for data collection regarding the strategies that will be implemented to eliminate the equity gaps in North Dakota . In addition, NDDPI person nel are responsible for monitoring the federal Title II provisions with the ESEA . The NDDPI also monitors the level of professional development participation through the annual professional development report submitted by local school districts, as require d by state statute. This report provides general information regarding the level of professional development accessed by local school districts statewide. The NDDPI reviews each local school district's professional development plan as an element of its ESE A consolidated monitoring efforts. These data collections provide insight into each local school district 's priorities and allocations. These reports and plans provide a base for the NDDPI to provide technical assistance regarding the school district's lon ger term personnel planning. Public Reporting of Implementation Progress When the NDDPI began the initial planning process for the State Equity Plan Initiative in the fall of 2014, we made a decision to be forthright and transparent in our reporting of the implementation process. We created a new website where all information could be housed and publicized the URL in correspondence to the field and in our monthly newsletter. Each time the NDDPI prepared to meet with the stakeholders during an equity plannin g committee meeting, we would contact members with potential dates so we could ensure our meetings had the highest attendance possible. In addition, we would ask committee members for input on agenda items. Committee members always received a copy of the a genda before the meeting convened (Appendix B) . Again, to ensure transparency, detailed minutes of each meeting were recorded , disseminated to committee members , and pos ted on our website (Appendix C) . The NDDPI will continuously monitor statewide equity issues and publicly report on the progress. The intent is to continue to convene the State Equity Initiative Planning Committee periodically to provide input and support. These meetings will be publicly reported on the NDDPI website. In addition, we will continue use of the state, LEA, and school report card 30 | P a g esystem to monitor and publicly report progress of LEA's toward reaching and maintaining the goal of having all core academic subject teachers highly qualified. It is believed that the actions and strategies described in this plan will increase the number of highly qualified teachers and will target access to those teachers to LEAs with hard -to-staff schools.

In the short -term, the key performance metrics that will be used to assess progress include end -of-year reports, feedback from educators, and review of data provided on the 2015 -2016 consolidated applica tion for federal Titl e funding. There are several end -of-year reports from the 2014 -2015 school year that can be reviewed to assess the data provided. Another performance metric to review would be feedback from our North Dakota educators. The NDDPI has already started the proc ess of implement ing the numerous strategies outlined in our State Equity Plan. As we begin to release guidance and resources to the field on our website, we will begin to get feedback and can collect and summarize that feedback for reporting purposes at a later date. For example, the NDDPI is currently working to create a website on loan forgiveness. Since the use of loan forgiveness is one of the strategies listed in several areas identified as a gap, we have a need to gather and disseminate information on this topic. The newly created website will provide resources and information on various strategies (i.e., loan forgiveness programs available to teachers ). Lastly, a third short -term metric that we use to assess progress toward our goals is the review of data submitted in the 2015 -2016 consolidated application for federal Title funding. New for the 2015 -2016 school year, all districts need to complete a narrative section and outline how they are ensuring equity and how they can demonstrate that all student s are being taught by a highly qualified and effective teacher. Districts will need to identify strategies that they will employ in the 2015 -2016 school year to address equity issues district -wide. Similarly, in the long -term, there are key performance met rics to assess progress toward achieving our goals. Some of these long -term metrics include reviewing reports, monitoring Title I and Title II programs, and reconvening the State Equity Initiative Planning Committee for review and input. Conclusion The NDD PI has submitted this State Equity Plan per a directive from the US DE consistent with the requirements outlined in the ESEA. This plan is intended to ensure that every student in every school is t aught by an excellent educator. In North Dakota, the process used to generate a State Equity Plan included the creation of the State Equity Initiative Planning Committee. Great care was taken to ensure that the Committee included broad representation from all of the various education stakeholder groups that are aff ected by the issue of teacher equity. Historically, North Dakota has had minimal gaps statewide among our schools with regard to the extent that poor students are taught by inexperienced, unqualified, or out -of-field teachers , as North Dakota put the feder al NCLB act teacher quality requirements into state law whe n the bill was enacted in 2001. As required under the directive, North Dakota has summarized the equity gaps that currently do exist and has provided charts that reflect the data available. 32 | P a g eThe State Equity Plan has identified four key gaps within the plan : Slightly h igher levels of new teachers teaching in high poverty schools than in low poverty schools Teacher and school leader recruitment and retention, Teacher shortage, and Equitable access to high quality professional development. For each gap identified, the state has outlined the selected strategies that will be employed to address the root causes . Going forward, the NDDPI will work to implement each strategy by leading the collective effort of the responsible parties. We believe the strategies identified are achievable and realistic and will assist in providing statewide equity in the distr ibution of highly qualified and effective teachers. Additionally, the plan has identified how North Dakota will continuously monitor and provide support on the strategies identified in the plan. The plan has identified the short -term and long -term performa nce metrics that will be reviewed and asses sed toward achieving our goals. It is our hope that this plan will help ensure that poor and minority students are not taught by inexperienced, unqualified, or out -of-field teachers at higher rates than other chil dren. The strategies outlined in the plan are intended to ensure that every student in North Dakota graduates from high school prepared to enter college or the workforce .

This is be considered year 0. Year one growth is determined after the 2nd annual ELP assessment. Therefore, students at a PL 1. 0-1.9 have until after the 5th year to exit. o Recommend beginning to gather data on students with limited formal education (SLIFE) in the 2017 -18 school year to determine if ND wants to allow additional time in the trajectory for SLIFE. We will be able to d etermine the extent to which another year would benefit SLIFE students after we can identify them and show growth compared to other ELs after the 2018 -19 annual ELP assessment. Long -Term Goals and interim progress goals \"Based on increases in the percentag e of ALL ELs making annual progress\" - discussed options of goals but discrepancy with new test and standard setting North Dakota is using a new annual ELP assessment as of the 2015 -16 school year. A standard setting process has been conducted which has increased the rigor of the assessment. o Recommend ND will determine long -term statewide goal for schools upon completion of the 2017 -18 administration of the assessment. This will provide the first year as a base year and the second year to determine student growth. o Recommend interim and long -term goals for schools: ND will determine interim goals by the percentage of students meeting their annual growth goals. This will increase annually to a state long - term goal after five years. o Recommend interim goal(s) for students - Upon the creation of a trajectory scale individualized for each student, the interim student goal is considered \"met\" when the student's composite language proficiency level as indicated by the annual ELP assessment, continually increases and remains at or above the trajectory line. This growth model will begin after the 2017 -18 annual ELP assessment to provide for consistency in accountability due to the new assessment and the standard setting process complete. o Recommend long -term goal for students - the long -term goal for stud ents will be to exit the program by attaining proficiency within the allowable time as indicated by the table above . Entrance Criteria Recommend the Home Language Survey form: Items on the first page are considered required and the second page would be recommended to schools . Recommend cut scores of 3.5 in each domain and 5.0 composite - ELPAC will revisit data to see how students come in after the 2017 test. Exit Criteria and procedures Recommend exit criteria cut scores to be 3.5 in each domain and 5.0 composite. Recommend an option for the EL team and IEP team to exit a student if the student has plateaued in their growth and the evidence including EL and IEP team documentation shows the student would not further benefit from additional English Languag e Development instruction but rather other services as appropriate.English Learner Advisory Committee Meeting Minutes February 6, 201 7 Welcome Review ESSA from previous meeting s Growth/Progress Measures - Reviewed data: averag e growth 2012 -2016 graph s oRecommendations for expectations of years to exit by PL - Based on 1st annual ELP assessment score (ACCESS 2.0) 1.0-1.9: 6 years 2.0-2.9: 5 years 3.0-3.9: 4 years 4.0-4.9: 3 years 5.0-6.0: 2 years oClarification: The growth trajectory chart would start at year 0 for a baseline score and year 1 would be after the 2nd test.

Refugee Student: Schools in North Dakota appl y for a Refugee School Impact Grant to provide services for newly arrived refugee students. A refugee student left their home country due to a well -founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationa lity, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion and has fled to another country to be resettled . Newly arrived is defined as within the last three years. 1. Would your child be considered a newly arrived refugee student? Yes No Immigrant Student: Immigrant students are mentioned specifically in the English Learner definition and may qualify for EL services.

In addition, student engagement may also refer to the degree in which students participate in the governance and decision-making processes in school, in the design of programs and learning opportunities, or in the civic lif e of their community (The Glossary of Education Reform). Research shows that student engagement is a key lever for increasing academic achieve - ment and learner outcomes. The very act of being engaged also adds to the foundation of skills and dispositions tha t are essential to live a productive and satisfying life. Amy L. Reschly and Sandra Christenson said it best in their research: engagement not only drives learning but also predicts school success. One of the most significant challenges that teachers face today is that students have be - come compliant workers who finish the task assigned to them but are not truly engaged in the le arning process. If students feel school is boring, too hard or has no connection to the real world, then every task, no matter how authentic or research-based it is, is regarded as \"busywork.\" However, engaging work is motivating work. Research shows that student engagement is associated with several positive outcomes. Student engagement improves academic performance, promotes school attendance and decreases the number of disci - pline referrals, just to name a few. When teachers use behavioral, cognitive and emotional (a ffective) engagement \"hooks,\" they help their students overcome some of the risk factors for dropping out that can be identified as early as sixth grade (Balfanz, Herzog, & MacIver, 2007; Linnenbrink & Pintrich, 2003; Rhodes, 2007; Skinner & Belmont, 1993).Power Accountability Indicators The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) provides an incredible opportunity for states to move accountability beyond test scores and look more holistically at school quality. At the same time, this is an opportunity that should not be taken lightly as we know that what gets measured and reported under state/federal accountability gets increased attention, funding and priority---as well as increased scrutiny. While many states have exploratory conversations underway, and some have already proposed a non-academic indicator for use in their ESSA plan, most are struggling to identify a valid and reliable measure of school quality and/or student success that meets the letter of the law AND leverages the flexibility provided under ESSA to incorporate meaningful measures to drive improved education quality and outcomes for all learners. More than 35,000 education institutions around the globe look to AdvancED\u00ae for forward-thinking educational leadership, guidance, research-based standards, expert external evaluation, professional services and improvement solutions. With more than 100 years experience and expertise in evaluating and improving education quality, we understand better than anyone the complexities and realities of schooling. We'll be the first to say that school quality cannot and should not be measured using a single indicator. This is why we've developed, tested and scaled a comprehensive suite of research-based diagnostic, survey, inventory, observation and evaluation instruments that together, paint an accurate and holistic picture of school quality. At the same time, we understand state/ federal accountability and have worked with several State Education Agencies (SEAs) to explore and consider a myriad of possible non-academic indicators for use in their state plan under ESSA. As an organization committed to helping states leverage the flexibility provided under ESSA to create non-punitive continuous improvement focused accountability systems, we encourage states to consider the following criteria, in addition to those outlined under ESSA, as they work to identify the best possible non-academic indicator(s) for use in accountability: >Can the indicator be clearly andc onsistently defined? stake- holders clearly understand what isbeing measured? >Is there a valid and reliable measuretha t can be applied to all school types/ classifications? >Will measuring this indica tor provide meaningful, timely and actionable dat a a t the classroom, school, dis trict and s tate to drive continuous improvement? >Is this a leading (vs. lag ging) indicat or? Is this wher e we want to invest our time and resources? >Does measuring this indicat or align with our s tate vision and priorities f or educ ation? >Will measuring this indica tor drive improvement for all kids? Having worked closely with states as the y've gathered data and feedback from stakeholders and weighed the pros and cons of various potential indicators, we understand now more than ever, the importance of helping states measure what matters most - not just what's easiest. As the leading expert in school quality evaluation and improvement, AdvancED encourages states to focus on Student Engagement as a leading performance and improvement indicator for accountability.AdvancED Expertise With more than 36,000 schools and districts around the world looking to AdvancED for educational leadership, guidance and expertise, we're committed to helping schools measure and improve what matters most - and student engagement is at the top of that list! As the world's leading expert in school improvement and accreditation services, we spend more time in more classrooms than any other organization in the world. We know first hand that engagement is a leading indicator of learning and personal development, and is correlated to improved attendance, reduced disciplinary incidents, school climate, and more. At the same time, we know that student engagement is multidimensional, influenced by context and responsive to intervention. Each year, thousands of AdvancED Certified Observers measure the extent to which students are engaged in learning environments through direct classroom observations using the Effective Learning Environments Observation Tool\u00ae (eleot\u00ae). This research-based observation tool focuses on students and their engagement and interaction in the learning environment. Using eleot, observers gather quantifiable evidence of student behaviors and interactions around seven key learning environments that research has shown conducive to effective learning and successful student outcomes: > E QUITABLE LEARNING > HIGH EXPE CTATIONS > SUPPOR TIVE LEARNING > A CTIVE LEARNING > PR OGRESS MONITORING AND FEEDBACK > WEL L-MANAGED LEARNING > DIGIT AL LEARNING Over the past four years, AdvancED has leveraged the data gleaned through these certified observations to refine the eleot instrument and created companion data collection instruments to effectively measure and quantify active student engagement. While eleot has been embraced by thousands of schools and systems around the world as a powerful formative improvement tool, it was not designed as an accountability measure. There are generally four ways in which to measure student engagement: self-report surveys, teacher reporting, interviews and observations. Of these four, surveys and observations are the most widely used and reliable. The Student Engagement Survey leverages the same research base as eleot, and provides a valid and reliable measure in which states can leverage for accountability.Appendix S EL Program Team Monitoring Tool Keep in mind the indicators labeled as \"Best Practice\" are not required. In the last column \"Evidence\", please list the documentation of evidence you find at the school and any comments you wish to add. It is so much easier to compile the reports at the end if you take LOTS of notes.

(Best Practice) Appendix T ESSA FEEDBACK COMMENTS Section One: Long -Term Goals The goal to reduce the number of non -proficient student by 33% in six years is a goal based on achievement and can be used with any assessment. A concern would be for the schools with a more transient population where it is more difficult to make those gains in a short period of time. Schools with transient populations may have more difficulty in meeting the goal. There are other factors that may be a challenge for schools to meet the goal as well. However, it is a goal to strive for and not tied to being selected for improvement. The 33% increase in students who meet proficiency (p.11) seems vagu e as it doesn't say what subject area(s) that it pertains to The subject areas are those on the NDSA; Reading, Language Arts, and Mathematics. A. Academic Achievement ii Provide the baseline and long -term goals - It is nice to see that the goals are set based on the starting point for the subgroups rather than one goal for each subgroup regardless of the starting point. However, page 45 of the National Evaluation of Title III Supplemental Report (https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/title -iii/implementation -supplemental - report.pdf) or page 10 of the CCSSO resource entitled Incorporating English Learner Progress into State Accountability Systems (http://www.ccsso.org/Documents/Incorporating%20English%20Learner%20Progress%20into%20S tate%20Accountability%20Syste ms_Final%2001%2012%202017.pdf) provides information on more realistic academic achievement expectations for ELs based on English Language Proficiency (ELP) and/or time in program. States like Colorado, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Virginia have alread y started using these methods. By definition, ELs are not proficient on the state assessment, so any system that compares them to English -only students would not be a fair comparison or reliable indicator of a school needing support. Would NDDPI consider h ow one of these three key approaches might be used to more fairly report subgroup performance? B. Graduation Rate - If the baseline academic achievement goals are able to take the starting point into consideration when calculating the long -term goal, is th is also possible for the graduation rate? Some ELs take more than 4 years to complete the graduation requirements and the field encourages schools to ensure that priority is given to ensuring students are choice -ready and potentially taking more than four years to graduate. It would be nice to take some of the pressure off of schools for the four -year cohort if it means that ELs would be more ready for college, career or military experiences. C. English Language Proficiency - The purpose of the WIDA screen er is to help schools determine whether or not a student qualifies for the EL program. Any other use, especially any use of those scores related to accountability is not recommended by the test vendor. ACCESS has a greater number of test items and has the validity and reliability studies that would allow for use in an accountability system. Additionally, the screener does not provide scores that are sensitive enough to measure growth over time. Finally, ELP growth is not linear and the screener is an on -demand assessment. These two factors would make any growth targets very difficult to set. Also, schools are accustomed to assessing all ELs in grades K -12 annually. This section does not speak to which grades will be included in the accountability. Be cause ELs in K -2 can be the fastest growers in terms of ELP, it would be advisable to include all grades in the ELP accountability measures. The North Dakota Department of Public Instruction is working on an RFP for the vendor of the ND State Assessment for spring 2018. The RFP applicants will be reviewed by a ND Assessment Committee. This is an appropriate topic to be addressed by this committee. Section Two: Consultation and Performance Management More attention needs to be towards cultural differences for Native American students Sharing information as well as seeking input and feedback has seemed to be a high priority on this ESSA plan. As discussed, there is a concern with the various reporting systems including NativeStar and AdvancEd. The commitment to supporting tribal language and culture is evident in the plan. NIEA's Top Priority: Timely and Meaningful Consultation : The most critical part of the North Dakota Plan is the requirements for the submission of state plans and tribal cons ultation as described in Section 2: Consultation and Performance Management on page 18 of the North Dakota Plan. The paragraph on that page that specifically focuses on meaningful tribal consultation is critical. We also applaud your work outlined on pages 23 to 25, consistent with our suggestions that you engage with tribes and describe that engagement. Consistent with the plan to this point, NIEA wishes to highlight the following areas of the North Dakota Plan which require meaningful consultation with tribal governments: Long-Term Goals and Measurement of Interim Progress Consultation and Coordination Challenging Academic Standards and Academic Assessments Accountability, Support and Improvement Supporting Excellent Educators Supporting All Students When considering the above areas of North Dakota's state plan, we look forward to working with you, the tribes, and Native advocates to make sure true dialogue occurs in the above areas. NIEA also wish to remind you of our definition of meaningful consul tation as consultation that: (1) occurs at earliest possible stage, (2) continuous process, (3) open communication & coordination, (4) process equally important as results, (5) minimum guidelines, expectations, & outcomes necessary. As you finalize the pla n, we respectfully recommend that you include the above elements in the process and in your final written document. We will be happy to work you to work with you throughout and hope you will continue to engage with tribal leaders, Native advocates, and NIE A. Local Consultation NIEA advocated strongly throughout the consideration of ESSA that the law should include a requirement that local educational agencies (LEAs) consult with tribal representatives on decisions that impact Native students. Section 8538, \"Consultation with Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations,\" is the result of that advocacy and congressional recognition of the importance of consultation with tribal leaders and tribal organizations. The language in Section 8538 applies to an LEA's \"subm ission of a required plan or application for a covered program under this Act.\"NIEA acknowledges NDDPI's commitment to hold ESSA Tribal Consultation Meetings with each of the four tribal nations through the state of North Dakota. From December 2016 till February 2017, NDDPI has meet with Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Mandan Hidatsa Arikara Three Affiliated Tribe, and Spirit Lake Tribe at least once through an official consultation. NIEA encourages this level of leade rship to leadership meetings to continue. Tribal Engagement Consistent with Section 1111(a) of ESSA, NIEA want to acknowledge NDDPI's commitment to hold Tribal Stakeholder Engagement Meetings with United Tribes Technical College Board of Directors and hol ding multiple ESSA Tribal Stakeholder Meetings. Both the tribes and NIEA asked for this step and we applaud your efforts to follow through. We believe that this type of engagement is critical to supporting Native students. The NDNAEU will address the cult ural differences of our NA students. We are provi ding training on our NDNAEU for teachers to implement in all schools in ND. Phase III of the NDNAEU will continue with the implementation and additional resources. The NDNDAEU will ensure accurate and culturally relevant K -12 lessons for all our student in ND. We will monitor the use of the NDNAEU through a Data plan that includes pre and post survey/evaluations for the NDNAEU project. North Dakota Native American Essential Understandings (Included in the ND State ESSA Plan) Transforming education through the Teachings of our Elders. In the Spring of 2015 the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction brought together Tribal elders from across North Dakota to develop the North Dakota Native American Es sential Understandings to guide the learning of both Native and non -Native students across the state. It is our hope that these Understandings will open up many more additional opportunities and awareness of our Tribal Nations in classroom practices throughout the state. The NDNAEU resource document and the Teaching of our Elders website, which includes elder videos, K -12 lesson plans and additional resources were developed to increase learning, understanding and well -being among all North Dakota students , educators and communities. We are currently in the roll -out and training phase of the NDNAEU projec t. For more information go to https://teachingsofourelders.org/ NDDPI will continue with Tribal Stakeholder and Tribal Consultation meetings with each Tribal Nation in ND. The ND State plan is the beginning, not the end. Consultation is an ongoing process with continuous feedback and collaboration. We will continue to work with Stakeholders during the implementation of the plan to build a collaborative effort. Section Three: Academic Assessments It is time that schools have different options for assessment but, we are using the same North Dakota assessments. This isn't true assessment for Nat ive children, many are still in two worlds . Local school districts have extreme latitude and flexibility to use whatever assessment they chose at the local level. Local districts need to select measures that assess the unique elements of their particular population and priorities. Changing the time period to assess at the high school level will also allow students and teachers to use that data to drive instruction for areas that need more support for student success. Identifying a new state assessment following the year 16 -17 is a priority. A new assessment RFP will be released in April 2017. B. Languages Other than English i - It should be noted that the ELPAC has discussed that the definition of \"significant language\" should include a process by whi ch the ELPAC would use their collective knowledge to give a recommendation on whether or not the population that met the 30% threshold has the academic language and literacy in their first language that would allow for more reliable academic achievement re sults. B. Languages Other than English iv - \"The next prevalent language is Somali, which is currently 15% of the EL population.\" Again, it should be noted that very few students with Somali as a first language have been educated in Somali and are literate in the Somali language (the written variety of Somali wasn't taught in school until the late 1970s). These items have been included in the ND ESSA Plan reading: B. \"In the future determination of offering assessments in other languages, the literacy rate of the students in their native language will also be taken into consideration.\" ESSA requires states to implement aligned assessments. How can we ensure that our student population is getting their needs met and is actually succeeding? Success in Native education looks different from success in mainstream education, as Native students have different needs. A few needs, based on the U.S. Department of Education, White House Initiative on American Indian and Alaska Native Education, School Environment List ening Sessions Report 2015: oGreater support of Native American languages oIn-depth, accurate instruction of Native American history and culture (for teachers as well as students) oPositive school policies that include culturally responsive strategies oMore op portunities, more choice, more flexibility, more access Studies on immersion education domestically and abroad have shown that children participating in cultural activities and language have high, positive outcomes for verbal and behavioral skills. More ge nerally, immersion programs directly correlate with fluency, high self -esteem and assurance in identity, lower rates of depression, and high student achievement.NDDPI will implement an aligned assessment to the ND state standards. LEA's will need to monitor and assess their data and other multiple measures to determine if their students' needs are being met and succeeding. We will include the USDE report in our ESSA plan Resources and Guidance. Research and resources on educational approaches for NA students will be included in our ESSA plan and guidance. How does the ND Department of Public Instruction plan to research which approach in education works best f or Native students? The Native American Languages Act (1990) supports that Native American students may be assessed in school in their Native languages. Native American language schools are grouped with schools in Puerto Rico in the ESSA (Title III, Sec. 3 127). Despite this, Native American language schools are not able to provide standardized assessments in their language, though Puerto Rican schools can assess their students in Spanish. How can we ensure educational entities like the Lakhol'iyapi Wahohpi/ Wih\u00e1kini Ow\u00e1yawa can implement assessments in the main language of instruction? The NDNAEU will address the cultural differences of our NA students. We are provi ding training on our NDNAEU for teachers to implement in all schools in ND. Phase III of the NDNAEU will continue with the implementation and additional resources. The NDNDAEU will ensure accurate and culturally relevant K -12 lessons for all our student in N D. We will monitor the use of the NDNAEU through a Data plan that includes pre and post survey/evaluations for the NDNAEU project. North Dakota Native American Essential Understandings (Included in the ND State ESSA Plan) Transforming education through t he Teachings of our Elders. In the Spring of 2015 the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction brought together Tribal elders from across North Dakota to develop the North Dakota Native American Essential Understandings to guide the learning of both Native and non -Native students across the state. It is our hope that these Understandings will open up many more additional opportunities and awareness of our Tribal Nations in classroom practices throughout the state.

The ND State plan is the beginning, not the end. Consultation is an ongoing process with continuous feedback and collaboration. We will continue to work with Stakeholders during the implementation of the plan to build a collaborative eff ort. Section Four: Accountability, Support, and Improvement for Schools Continue to support the growth of each student North Dakota's ESSA plan includes a growth model. Concern with using ACT test as accountability measure for high school. It simply does not make sense that we would use an assessment that is not aligned to our standards Whether to use ACT for accountability will be a local school district decision. The pie chart for high school doesn't include an Academic Progress Growth section - Is this rolled in with the CCR growth? Yes, it is difficult to show growth on the high school ND state assessment because there is a gap in testing between grade 8 and 11. We intend to include growth in the \"Choice Ready\" component. The \"Life Ready Indicators - More to come..\" is on Appendix J however is not mentioned or referenced on either page 8 or pages 36 -37 We are creating a small committee to further refine the \"Choice Ready\" component , and will address any inconsistencies in the plan. In reviewing the addition of the \"Choice Ready\" component of the accountability plan, the list of criteria that students can fulfill to be \"ready\" provides a lot of opportunities and options. While North Dakota most students, families, and educators are fam iliar with the ACT, would it be possible to include SAT scores in the academic and military ready criteria? This would provide an additional opportunity/option for students who may decide to take the SAT. The ACT scores that are referenced for the Academi c Ready criteria appear to be ACT's college readiness benchmarks. The College Board's SAT benchmarks are 480 Evidenced Based Reading and Writing and 530 in Math. These benchmarks are based on a 75% likelihood of earning at least a C in a first -semester, credit -bearing college course in a related subject. For the Military Ready component, a composite score of 17 on the ACT is concordant to a 910 on the SAT. Thank you for considering this request and I look forward to learning if equivalent SAT scores can be included as an option for students. Yes, ND can include SAT as well as ACT. The other recommendations will also be reviewed, as we are creating a small committee to further refine the \"Choice Ready\" component. The indicators support true achievement and growth in our schools. Creating the addition of growth on the assessment along with the climate and engagement goals support an active learning environment for 21st Century learners.Under Career Ready Options - the subcommittee talked about it as Develo ping a \"four -year rolling\" Career Education Plan - was there more discussion on this and it changed? We are creating a small committee to further refi ne the \"Choice Ready\" component, and will address any inconsistencies in the plan. As a parent, I wish to comment on your new plan - I happened to be in the local district office one day and overheard the secretary and the superintendent talking about how to fill out the superintendent's evaluation about himself. My concern is that every thing you are trying to accomplish will be viewed as just more needless paperwork by local administration. There are many new exciting and innovative components within our state's ESSA plan. We will work with local school personnel to support their effor ts to improve learning through ESSA a nd not see it as additional paperwork. B. Subgroups - the ELPAC has recommended that former EL students be included in the EL subgroup for 2 year. C. i. Minimum Number of Students - If accountability for ELs is done on the school level with n -size of 10, how many schools will be held accountable for EL student performance? Is there a possibility to roll up school -level data to the district level for EL accountability in the case that the school is N>9? Does double jeopa rdy come into effect with multiple year calculations since the students are likely to be the same in the ELP growth and attainment calculations? Our ND ESSA plan does include combining up to three years of data so that schools that are held accountable fo r the achievement of EL students. D. Annual Meaningful Differentiation iv. - What is the definition of \"significant gaps\" in subgroup performance? There is no one definition of \"significant gaps\" in subgroup performance. W e will look for the schools that have the most significant gaps by ranking them. Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on the ESSA plan. If you are looking for feedback on School Climate/Engagement measures I really like the data and dashboard from the Tripod 7C's survey. Thi s survey is research validated, nationally normed and offers measures on: the 7C's of effective teaching, peer support, student engagement, school climate, success skills and mindsets. This survey is well designed, easy to administer and has been impleme nted in entire states and many districts around the country. It was the best survey selected by the Measures of Effective Teaching (MET) project, a $40 million research funded by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. http://tripoded.com/districts -states/ The state ESSA planning committee has not yet decided which survey will be utilized to meet the climate factor as an additional school quality indicator.To date, what kind of input has the ND Depart ment of Public Instruction received from alternative schools? The lowest performing 5% of Title 1 schools entirely consists of public schools whose population is nearly 100% Native American. Is the State exploring alternative options for education, particu larly for the Native American populations of the State of North Dakota, whom the current education system is, and has been historically, failing? States have little options regarding the methodology to identify the 5% of Title I schools that are lowest pe rforming . This section of the law is very specific regarding the process states must follow. What does the ND Department of Public Instruction propose to do differently the lowest -performing 5% of Title I schools? Our plan to support the 5% lowest performing schools is addressed in section 4.3 \"Support for Low Performing Schools\" which begins on page 57. How can we work together to close the achievement gap and increase graduation rates? What is in the state plan under the ESSA that will allow our students to receive culturally relevant education? I would like to comment specifically on the \"choice ready\" concepts presented in the Supporting All Students sect ion. I am aware that this section of the plan is somewhat based upon the work of AASA's Re defining Ready project and I am very supportive of those concepts. I am concerned the Supporting All Students concept proposed in the ESSA plan gives the impression that it is a curriculum track choice system and not a \"choice ready\" system. I believe th e idea behind Redefining Ready is that a truly \"choice ready\" student meets the standards for both the College Ready and Career Ready domains, not just the indicators included in one of the domains. The Redefining Ready indicators are flexible enough and b road enough to meet both the college and career ready minimums. This should be the goal for \"all\" students. We need to move away from the idea that \"career ready\" is the career and technical education alternative to college ready, or a direct pathway into the workforce. Career Ready should not be viewed as an alternative path for non -college bound students. In the same sense, Military Ready should not be presented as the track for students who cannot reach the college level GPA or ACT standards. All student s need career ready skills, including college and military bound students. All students should graduate with college ready skills, including workforce bound or military bound students. \"Supporting All Students\" seems to present the military track as mainly for low achieving students without college or career ready skills or aspirations. We certainly don't want a military comprised only of students who were not pushed to develop college and career ready skills. Military service should be viewed as a prestigi ous option, even for our most high achieving students. It seems the \"Supporting All Students\" concept proposed in the plan moves away from the idea that students are, as Dr. David Schuler says it, \"more than a score\" or that all students should graduate choice ready. Instead it reads as if students are to pick one of three pathways; college, or career, or military at some point before they receive a diploma. A truly \"choice ready\" student should not choose a track beforehand, but instead choose after fulfil ling the requirements of a well -rounded high school curriculum. A \"choice ready\" student should be college, and career, and military ready upon graduation, not \"either or\" ready.The choice should not be \"which path do I choose?\" Choice ready should be the goal for \"all\" students entering high school as a freshman, knowing if they meet the minimum indicators in all categories by the time they graduate they will truly be \"choice ready\". We should we resist the urge to create a system that gives the impressio n that military, career, and college, are \"either, or\" choices. Graduating \"Choice Ready\" will not be accomplished by encouraging students to choose a single pathway. It will only be accomplished by encouraging them to choose all pathways. I am also concer ned that parts of the Supporting All Students model ignore the research base supporting Redefining Ready. Adjusting the indicators based upon feelings or opinion diminishes the value of Redefining Ready as the foundation of \"Supporting All Students\". I am specifically concerned with the attendance measure of 98%. The research cited in Redefining Ready uses 90% attendance as one of the career ready indicators. It does not differentiate between excused, unexcused, school related, medical, or other categori es of absence. It simply states the research indicates students who are present in school 90% of the time are most likely to succeed. The 98% indicator seems to imply that only unexcused absences would be considered. If that is the case the indicator shou ld be 100%. Why would we as educators endorse a system that recognizes any unexcused absence as positive career ready trait? NDDPI is creating a small subcommittee to review all comments received on the \"Choice Ready\" initiative and further refine and imp rove upon this component. All of these concerns and recommendations will be addressed. Section Five: Supporting Excellent Educators Thank you for including NDLEAD and NDETC - maybe this can bring back some fiscal support to this organization . Thank you for hearing the field and including Appendix K in the plan . The Leadership Academy and mentors for Principals and leaders is an excellent opportunity for new leaders and supports fresh ideas for all Principals and leaders based on research. The teacher evaluation system is a step in the right direction as so many need support for effective evaluation to identify successes and areas for improvement. The financial support for North Dakota is an opportunity to retain teachers and encourage new teachers. As a parent I ask that a comprehensive teacher and administrative evaluation plan include a way to remove ineffective teachers or administrators from the school system. Currently it is almost impossible to remove them even if everyone knows that they are in competent. North Dakota Century Code (NDCC) 15.1 -15 outlines specific requirements when school boards are considering non -renewal of teacher, principal, or superintendent contracts. Local school boards should also have district policies in place. Teacher and administrator evaluations should be a part this process. For more information, read NDCC 15.1 -15 and ask to see the policies of your local school. Would/could this provision, which is stated on Page 23 of the Plan, be considered for Tribal Colleges (TCUs) in ND as well or is it already being considered within the current wording? It would help the TCUs immensely, if our faculty could/would be in included especially in the statewide loan forgiveness initiative. The provision is written as follows: \"Rega rding recruitment and retaining educators in the state of North Dakota, the subcommittee is looking at criteria for statewide loan forgiveness for all educators, giving scholarships for higher education students pursuing a degree in teaching, and increasin g statewide loan forgiveness for new teachers who teach in rural school districts or a critical needs subject area. (Legislative info. Here)\" The teacher loan forgiveness provision is in response to the teacher shortage in ND. It is focused on recruiti ng and retaining teachers in rural areas and in certain subject areas. There are two Teacher Loan forgiveness bills currently in the Legislature SB 2037 - Higher Ed bill that would be administered by the State Board of Higher Ed SB 2243 - DPI Teacher Loan Forgiveness program that would include grade levels, content areas, rural or remote locations and if critical teacher needs are determined by teacher shortages. Immersion teachers are different from regular teachers and, thus, have different needs. In addition to teaching a subject, immersion teachers are also teaching language; the ultimate goal in an immersion setting is to teach our students how to speak about traditional and modern concepts in the main language of instruction (Lakota). How does the ND Department of Public Instruction plan to work with schools to modify teacher requirements/qualifications to meet our needs? How can our community make sure we are hiring teachers who have the knowledge that our students need (without being blocked)? The NDDPI does not administer licensure for teachers. You can contact the Education Standards and Practices Board (ESPB) about questions related to modifying teacher requirements/qualifications. The Education Standards and Practices Board (ESPB) does offer a Content Area Minor Equivalency Endorsement -Native American Language Education endorsement for Native instructors, this would include Immersion teachers since they also teach the language. ESPB Contact Information: Education Standards and Practices Bo ard, 2718 Gateway Ave. Suite 204, Bismarck, ND 58503. 701-328-9641 or espbinfo@nd.gov The Local LEA/District (school board) is responsible for hiring teachers according to their needs. Parents and community member s need to voice their input and concerns to their school district personnel and school board members. Please reconsider the use of Title II, Part A funds, or funds from other included programs, to conduct extensive training for teachers/educator prep. f or low -income and minority students (American Indian subgroup of students specifically). This is an absolutely necessary area of improvement. Many teachers do not know how to compassionately address our students' needs and provide behavioral support (suppo rt, not discipline). Some of the students in our public schools come from abusive homes or families, they do not have safe spaces. Isolating and punishing their behavior only perpetuates the problem and damages the child's academic development. Reprimandin g behavior may work for other student groups/subgroups, but not for our population. This issue directly affects teacher retention in addition to student achievement/success/graduation rates. The use and spending of Title II Part A funds is determined by the District/ LEA (local control). LEA's need to consider how to best use Title II Part A funds to ensure equity of educational opportunities and consider new uses of these funds that are innovative and evidence -based. The ESSA Planning Committee recomme nded that the state withhold minimal funding (1.2%) off the top of our allocation for REA professional development and principal mentoring. Information on Praxis II - test in licensure and impact on effective/excellent educators - what directly is being d one to support these new professionals (e.g., business professionals) w limited pedagogy and/or teachers in new content areas? Educators who have completed courses in higher education, received their teaching degree, and passed the Praxis testing have dem onstrated knowledge and understanding of education practices foundational related to the pedagogy and content area in which they are qualified to teach. However, new teachers have many challenges thus support for these new teachers is critical. There are several activities in place to assist teachers. The North Dakota Department of Public Instruction initiates support to all educators by disseminating information, coordinating various programs and providing technical assistance. In addition, local school d istricts are encouraged to have a plan in place to assist new teacher such as a mentoring program.Section Six: Supporting All Students Technology standards should be updated to be in alignment with new ISTE standards as soon as possible as technology is always evolving and those standards meet that criteria. The \"choice ready\" provisions in this ESSA plan are excellent. The NDDPI is working on a timeline for the review of all of our ND state standards . 6.1 B. State's Strategies - This section does not give any information about how the state will support equity for the underrepresented subgroups. The ND ESSA Plan has addressed this comment (see highlighted items), as it states: B. The State's strategies and how it will support LEAs to provide eq uitable access to a well - rounded education and rigorous coursework in subjects in which female students, minority students, English learners, children with disabilities, or low -income students are underrepresented. Such subjects could include English, rea ding/language arts, writing, science, technology, engineering, mathematics, foreign languages, civics and government, economics, arts, history, geography, computer science, music, career and technical education, health, or physical education. North Dakota recognizes all students deserve access to a broad and rich in content curriculum. Research shows that students \u2014particularly historically underserved students \u2014engage more deeply in learning when they are exposed to a variety of topics and can better connec t what they are learning in the classroom with the world outside of school. ESSA's focus on well -rounded education opportunities ensures all children receive fair, equitable and high quality education by addressing the academic and non -academic needs of st udents and students within subgroups. North Dakota believes all students should have equitable access to equitable academic opportunities. These program may include; preschool programming, advanced coursework, science, technology, engineering, arts, and ma thematics (STEAM) education programming, physical education promoting healthy lifestyles, career and technology education, 21st century skills, competency - based learning, as well as personal learning opportunities. Rigorous coursework and opportunities in all curricular areas, including but not limited to: English, reading/language arts, writing Mathematics, computer science Science, technology, engineering Foreign languages Civics, government, economics Visual arts, drama, dance, media arts, music History, geography, social studies Career and technical education programs Health, physical education The NDDPI will utilize 1% of the state's Title IV, Part A allocation to support the activities and initiatives addressed in 6.1.A and administrative costs associated with the Student Support and Academic Achievement program, which includes public reporting on how LEAs are using the funds and the degree to which LEAs have made progress towards meeting the identified objectives and outcomes. The NDDPI has, and will consider, the academic and non -academic needs of all students, including all sub groups of students, when developing strategies and implementing programs for well - rounded education. The NDDPI will use provide technica l assistance and capacity building to LEAs to meet the goals of this program. The NDDPI will award Student Support and Academic Achievement program sub grants to LEAs through a formula in the same proportion as to the prior year's Title I, Part A allocati on for each LEA. 6.1 E. Support for engaging parents, families and communities - This section does not give information about how the funds will be used to support parents, families and communities. The strategies mentioned are all programs that support schools to increase academic achievement. Section 6.1 E. of the ND ESSA Plan is displayed below. The plan states the decision was made by the committee to not allow those funds to be used for this purpose, therefore a description would not be applicable. Does the SEA intend to use funds from Title IV, Part A or other included p rograms to support strategies to support LEAs to engage parents, families, and communities? Yes. If yes, provide a description below. No. The State ESSA Committee elected not to set aside Title IV, Part A funds for state level initiatives. 6.2 B. ii. - The continuous improvement model mentions using ELP measures as part of the evaluation program, however the ACCESS test administration does not occur during the summer when ND migrant students are enrolled in migrant programming. Possible typo page 63 \"lab top\" vs \"laptop.\" The ESSA Plan states \"This continuous improvement model incorporates the use of state assessment scores in language arts, math and English language proficiency to assess need and indicate progress.\" This does not necessari ly refer to the WIDA products of assessment. The summer migrant program has their own ELP assessment utilized throughout the consortium. 6.2 B. v. - If the ACCESS test is used as an evaluation measure for the migrant program, English Language Development services should be one of the recommended services in the local programs and should be included as one of the Measurable Outcomes. The recommended services were provided by the SNA/Service Delivery committee and therefore not something the NDDPI Migrant program has the authority to change. English language development services are taking place and therefore this was not identified as a recommendation. 6.2 B vi. - The migrant program has not been part of an ELPAC agenda in many years, but I look forward t o learning more about this program since many students participate in both the EL and migrant programs in their districts. A possible reference to this is in section 6.2 B vii. The reference to EL Advisor Board and the PAC are not the state ELPAC, but rat her the migrant EL Advisor Board and Parent Advisory Committee. The ESSA Plan states: The effectiveness of the migrant program is assessed through scho ol administrators, teacher, parent surveys, migrant needs assessment, EL Advisor Board and the PAC meetings. 6.2 C. ii - NDDPI may want to consider providing EL services in this program. Correctional facilities staff come to EL related training and feel ill -equipped to educate EL students in custody. Perhaps if English Language Development (ELD) services were men tioned in the plan, funding could be used to help train staff and provide ELD services for youth in correctional centers. If this becomes part of the plan, the accountability should also include disaggregated data by EL status. Correctional facility staf f are invited to NDDPI EL related training. As far as funding the programs for service, that is the responsibility of the LEA and would only change with a legislative fiscal note and funding bill. 6.2 D. i. 3. - In the entrance criteria in the second bull et point, it is recommended to amend the statement to read \"overwhelming evidence of previous academic success.\" Without the word previous, schools may wait to make the identification until they determine whether or not the student is successful in school, which could lead to a loss in ELD services. In the fifth bullet, it is unclear when a teacher referral would come into play in the identification process. \"may allow teacher referral after a determination has been made\" makes it sound as if a teacher refe rral for ELD services trumps the screener score. I think the intent of this statement is to ensure that students who are not identified during enrollment under the initial screening process due to missing home language information have a process for being referred for this reason to the screening process. In the exit criteria area, the plan does not allow for any variance in exiting the program beyond taking the ACCESS test. Because some students are not enrolled during the ACCESS test window, there should be another process by which a student can use an ELP assessment to show they no longer qualify for services (screener, MODEL, etc). The comments listed above regarding entrance and exit will be provided in detail in guidance. 6.2 E i. - How does NDDPI p lan to address school eligibility for 21CCLC programs with the move to more schools becoming schoolwide Title I, regardless of their percentage of free and reduced student status? Page 72 possible typo - \"latte\" vs \"latter.\" Schools that have a poverty percent of 40 or have schoolwide status will be eligible for 21st CCLC funding. Local project sites may need to prioritize services to schools based on need if they are unable to serve all eligible schools. 6.2 E ii. 4. Under the Role of the Grant Administrator, the plan states that the \"grant administrator must have all employee files on hand for monitoring purposes.\" This would be very difficult to do in the case of subgrantees who have their own organizational system for ret aining employee records. Additionally, it may not be appropriate for the Grant Administrator to house the employee records for non -employees. Audit requirements mandate the fiscal agent maintain necessary records for auditing purposes. Would the ND Depart ment of Public Instruction be open to discussing an alternative means of education? Programs such as Wih\u00e1kini Ow\u00e1yawa need an alternative means to exist (e.g. satellite, pilot, demonstration, magnet and/or charter schools). Alternative means of schooling can be considered in SB 2186 - Innovative pilot program to improve student education and performance. If passed by the Legislature, schools can submit an Innovative education plan through NDDPI. Schools/Districts may also submit a waiver for alternative m eans of education and schooling through the School Approval and Opportunity Unit. Please consider alternative means of schooling, especially for student subgroups that are not performing as well as others. We recommend our immersion learning program to serve as a pilot program for alternative approaches to learning for the Native student population. Alternative means of schooling can be considered in SB 2186 - Innovative pilot program to improve student education and performance. If passed by the Legisl ature, schools can submit an Innovative education plan through NDDPI. Schools/Districts may also submit a waiver for alternative means of education and schooling through the School Approval and Opportunity Unit. College, career and community readiness Community Ready? Social health & wellness? Mental health & wellness? There is an infinite list of the areas where schools can strive to get students ready for post - graduation. In North Dakota's State ESSA plan, we have elected to include getting students \"Choice Ready\" post -graduation by focusing on academic, military, and work ready. Local school districts can expand this concept to include others areas as well. Recommend adding out -of-school time programming to 6.1 A Local Educational Opportunities. We will add out -of-school time programming to section 6.1 on Local Educational Opportunities. 6.2 A E. Title IV, Part B - Continuous Improvement - STEM should be listed as STEAM curriculum as Art was an added requirement to 21st CCLC last year by Josh Sha rp. We will revise this section to replace STEM with STEAM. *Additional Comments: Re-examine and consult the US Department of Education, White House Initiative on American Indian and Alaska Native Education's School Environment Listening Sessions Final R eport from 2015 (https://sites.ed.gov/whiaiane/files/2015/10/school -environment -listening -sessions -final-report.pdf ). The Report outlines maj or issues and recommendations for the American Indian/Alaska Native student population found in schools across the country. The failure to address the concerns that the report outlines limits our Native youth's opportunities and life outcomes and is ultima tely detrimental to our tribal government, our state government, and the U.S. as a whole. We can include this USDE Report in the ESSA Resources/Guidance The New ESSA State Plan Template: As you know, Secretary DeVos released a new State Plan Template earlier this week. The State Plan Template includes a new application for states to use in developing their accountability plans. NIEA has one concern regarding this new template that we wish to mention: the lack of lang uage around specific consultation and engagement efforts with stakeholders. Despite what we see as an oversight, we wish to complement you on your efforts in this area and ask that you continue to engage with tribal leaders and Native advocates. NDDPI believes strongly in collaboration with our many stakeholder groups. Even though the USDE has removed this section from their template, NDDPI will keep it in our plan and make consultation a priority. Appendix U 110 INFORMATION REGARDIN G EQUITABLE ACCESS T O, AND PARTICIPATION IN, THE PROGRAMS INCLUDED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED ST ATE PLAN The North Dakota Department of Public Instruction (NDDPI) adheres to Section 427 of the General Educa tion Provisions Act (GEPA). The NDDPI will ensure equitable access to, participation in, and appropriate educational opportunities for individuals served. Federally funded activitie s, programs, and services will be accessible to all teachers, students and program ben eficiaries. The NDDPI ensures equal access and participation to all persons regardless of their race, color, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, citizenship status, disab ility, gender or sexual orientation in its education programs, services, and /or activities. The NDDPI will hold LEAs accountable for ensuring equal access and providing reasonable and appropriate accommodations to meet the needs of a divers e group of students, staff, community members and other participants. All LEAs are required to provide a written narrative response within the local consolidated state application identifying the activities the district is undertaking to reduce barriers that would prohibit students, teachers, and other beneficiaries access to participation in federal programs. Appendix V 110 North Dakota State Plan to Ensure Equitable Access to Excellent Educators August 25, 2017 Update The North Dakota State Plan to Ensure Equitable Access to Excellent Educators was published August 2015. Data was reported from 2013 -2014 school years. The information below provides an update on the data collected from the 2016 -2017 school year . The following data sources were used to provide this updated report: 1. The North Dakota Department of Public Instructions (NDDPI) desk audit provides data on out -of- field teachers. The NDDPI collects annual data on each teacher along with the grade levels and courses taught by each teacher . This data is compared to the each teache r's qualifications through a n annual desk audit to assure teachers are teaching within their field and identif ies any out-of-field teachers . 2. The State Automated Reporting System (STARS) provides information on the number of inexperienced teachers , teachers that have been teaching for three or less years. Equity strengths and gaps are revealed as the data were analyzed. The key terminology, a percentage difference of >5.0% was considered an equity gap while a percentage difference of 5.0% was considered an equity strength. Below are graphical representations of the equity strengths and gaps base d on o ut-of-field t eachers and i nexperienced teachers. 1. To what extent are \"Ti tle I s chools\" being taught by out -of-field teachers\" compared to \"non - Title I s chools \"? There was a 0% difference between Title I school s compared to non -Title I school s being taught by out - of-field teachers for the 2016 -2017 school year . This is considered an equity strength. 2. To what e xtent are students in \"Title I s chools\" being taught by an \"inexperienced tea cher\" compared to students i n \"N on-Title I s chools\"? There was a 2.13% difference in Title I schools compared to non -Title I schools being taught by inexperienced teachers for the 2016 -2017 school year . This is considered an equity strength. 2016 -17 School All Teachers Out of Field Teachers Percent of Out of Field Teachers Non -Title I School 3,974 6 0.2% Title I School 4,906 10 0.2% Total 8,880 16 0.2% 2016 -17 School All Teachers Teachers With 3 or Less Years of Experience Percent With 3 or Less Years Non -Title I School 3,974 829 20.86% Appendix W 110 Psychometric Summary of AdvancED's Student Engagement Survey Purpose The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of the psychometric properties of AdvancE D's Student Engagement Survey. It is based on a pilot study AdvancED conducted with a total sample size of 20,494 students. The representative sample of students spanned three states: Alabama, Nor th Dakota, and South Carolina. The characterist ics of the sample are shown in T able 1 belo w. Special attention was given to the oversampling of minority groups within the original sampling framework in order to test for any bias that could have arisen between testing groups based on any demographic characteristic. Table 1. Sample Size of the P ilot Study with Race Percentages by Groups Race/Ethnicity High School Middle School Elementary School American Indian or Alaska Native 1.0% 2.0% 2.7% Asian Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 6880 7100 Overview of the Student Engagement Survey The Student Engagement Survey was designed to measure elementary, middle and high school student engagement through student opinions about their learning experiences. The 20 i tems are categorized under the three domains of engagement type (behavior, cognitive and emotional). These domains are then broken down further by three components of engagement quality - commit ted, compliant and disengaged. Finally, each component is aligned to two le vels. Thus, the committed component has an \"invested\" or \"immersed\" level; the compliant component has a \"strategic\" or \"r itual\" level; and the disengaged component has a \"retreatism\" or \"rebellion\" level. Results are categorized by engagement type and quality of engagement. Survey results provide a useful summary of the detailed information represented in students' respons es and provide s information relative to a benchmark. A respondent who finishes the survey is labeled as Committed, Compliant, or Disengaged for each of the three domains. This label is based on which component of engagement the respondent answers the major ity of the time within each factor. It should be noted that the Behavioral domain has six items which means it is possible that a respondent has an even number of responses across two or more components. In these cases, the respondent would be labeled as h aving a \"mixed\" engagement type. The percentage reported for each domain is calculated by counting the number of respondents in each domain out of the total number of responde nts taking part in the survey. The percentage reported for each component of eng agement is calculated in the same way. Reliability and Validity Data from the pilot were used to examine the reliability and validity of the three versions of the instrument - elementary, mid dle, and high school students. Reliability was tested using Cronbach's Alpha, with values of .7 and above representing adequat e internal consistency ( see Table 2 ). The Middle and High student groups of the Student Engagement Survey fall within the \"good\" range for reliability. The exception in this case is the Elem entary students where the reliability was found to be closer to \"adequate\". It is theorized that drop in reliability may actually be a byproduct of the r espondents ages and mental capacity as opposed to survey content. All three groups received survey ques tions that are similar in content with some differentiation among group s. Table 2. Reliability of Student Engagement Surveys. Group Reliability High School 0.80 Middle School 0.80 Elementary School 0.67 Construct validity was examined using confirmatory factor analysis. Table 3 below shows the results of the CFA acro ss several common fit indices. All values in Table 3 represent good fit of the data to the model across all of the fit indices. \"Good\" is defined as Root Mean Square Residual (RM SR) and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) less than 0.05 and Goodness of Fit Index (GFI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Normed Fit Index (NFI) between 0.90 and 0.95 . Table 3. Three Fact or Fit Indic es for Student Engagement Surveys . Each individual item was reviewed using a Rasch analysis, utilizing several fit indices to determine how well the items perfo rmed. Across all three forms, 3 of items on the high school form, 3 items fr om the middle school form, and 1 item from the elementary form were considered \"on bounds\" meaning their values were close to the threshold valu es used to determine item fit. All other items were within commonly accepted parameters and considered to be functioning exceptionally well within th e confines of the instrument . A table of these values is not presented given the large number of items but is available upon request. Differential Item Functioning Results Similarly, Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis was conducted to examine th e performance of items in relation to different demog raphic groups. As an example, Table 4 shows the results of DIF analysis for a single survey item that tests bias relative to two race categories . DIF tes t values for item # 12: \"The skills I am learning in class... \" are included in Table 4 . Mantel -Haenszel P-Values greater than 0.05 and e ffect sizes less than the absolute value of 0.25 are labeled as not having bias between the groups being investigated. In other comparisons w here DIF was indicated , we believe it is an artifact of sample size (for example, American Indian and Alaska Native) but AdvancED will continue to monitor this as more respondents use the measure.
