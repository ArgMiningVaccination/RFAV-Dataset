Please review our health and safety, security, and policy measures. Visitor Guidelines [Health and Safety Measures ](#si-field-collection-tabs-1175208105-0) Our current health and safety measures are based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local governments. These measures may change in response to changing CDC COVID-19 Community Levels, so we encourage visitors to regularly check our website before their visit for the latest guidelines. We ask that all visitors follow these safety measures to protect everyone's health. Visitors should also be aware that our museums get crowded, especially during peak visitation times. Visitors who wish to avoid crowds are encouraged to plan their visit during weekdays. If Sick, Stay Home We ask all visitors who are sick or feel unwell to please stay home. The Smithsonian is open 364 days a year and we look forward to welcoming you when you are healthy. Visitors are encouraged to wash and sanitize hands frequently during their visit. Hand-sanitizing stations will be available throughout our facilities. Masks Masks are not currently required to visit. While not required, all visitors who feel more comfortable wearing a face mask during their visit are encouraged to do so. [Security Screening](#si-field-collection-tabs-1175208105-1) At many of our museums, you'll be greeted upon entry by one of our security personnel who will conduct a thorough hand-check of all bags, briefcases, purses, and containers.
