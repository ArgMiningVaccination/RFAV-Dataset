Many people who have contracted Covid-19 experience post-illness exhaustion that can last for several months or even longer. But there is hope! Nature has much to offer in the way of natural remedies that can help you manage your symptoms and regain a sense of normalcy in your life. In this blog post we will discuss simple yet effective natural remedies, as well as lifestyle changes which will be beneficial in tackling tiredness brought on by long covid. Read on to find out more about treatments that don't involve pharmaceuticals - and may just give you back some of the energy you've been missing since falling ill. Natural remedies for post viral fatigue There are many supplements and natural remedies available for post Covid fatigue and long covid. Here's a selection you might want to consider - Magnesium Magnesium is essential for many bodily functions, and its role in both supporting relaxation and aiding energy production makes it a valuable tool in the fight against post viral fatigue. Research has suggested that magnesium deficiency can impair mitochondrial function and thus disrupt energy production - making it difficult for sufferers of chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia to regain their lost vigour. Fortunately, although it may be challenging, adequate levels of magnesium can be restored through supplementation or diet modifications. By replenishing reserves of this vital mineral, people suffering from post Covid fatigue can start feeling more energised and watch their symptoms recede slowly but surely. Olive Bach flower remedy Bach flower remedies are a series of 38 different natural remedies, each relating to a different emotion. They operate on the manner of healing through energetic vibrations. This process known as 'vibrational medicine' is based on the premise that emotions play an essential role in physical wellbeing and mental health. The remedies were developed by British physician, Edward Bach, in the 1930s. This system of alternative medicine involves the use of flower essences from wild plants and trees to treat a broad range of emotional ailments, such as fear and anxiety. Each remedy helps to restore balance by focusing on one specific emotional state. Olive is the remedy that's indicated for physical fatigue including sufferers of post viral fatigue, long covid and chronic fatigue syndrome. Olive Bach flower remedy can be a great post Covid fatigue treatment option for those whose minds, bodies and souls are at the end of their energy stores. People feeling drained, depleted and constantly fatigued should look into Olive as it can help to restore energy and vitality. CoQ10 If you suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome, you may be low on adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy currency of your cells. Coenzyme Q10 might just be the boost to production of ATP that you need. Studies support this, as a study of 155 people found that those taking Coenzyme Q10 supplement had an improved ability to exercise and reported feeling better in other ways too. Not only will it improve your energy levels, but also serve as an antioxidant to give your immunity a boost and reduce muscle pain. Curcumin Curcumin has shown to be a promising treatment for post Covid fatigue due to its powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. Studies have found curcumin to be able to modulate many inflammatory pathways in the body, providing relief from fatigue symptoms. Additionally, curcumin appears to increase cellular levels of glutathione, which is believed to strengthen the body's immune system and help combat fatigue. This natural compound is gaining increasing recognition among scientific circles as a safe, effective way to reduce post Covid fatigue and improve overall health. Quercetin Quercetin is a bioflavonoid found in a variety of plants such as onions, berries, apples, and capers that has been studied for its effects on post Covid fatigue treatment. It sets itself apart from other treatments because it has the ability to modulate inflammation while activating cellular defences against oxidative stress. What makes quercetin so special is that it can cross the blood brain barrier, allowing its neuroprotective qualities to protect neurons from oxidative stress and potential injury. Studies have revealed that quercetin may even help reduce the release of inflammatory mediators like histamine, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes which are commonly associated with MCAS. This makes it an excellent option for treating post Covid fatigue caused by MCAS. The impact of stress on the body & how Ashwagandha can help Feeling stressed and worn down can take a serious toll on the body, particularly when it comes to fatigue and long-term inflammation. Stress causes bodily responses intended to provide a burst of energy so we can address the issue at hand. Unfortunately, this burst can be too powerful, leading to exhaustion both mentally and physically and impeding recovery from post Covid fatigue. Additionally, high stress levels lead the body to become in an inflamed state, further aggravating any underlying issues such as long Covid. Incorporating certain stress relieving techniques into our daily routines is key in protecting physical wellbeing. Whether it be deep breathing exercises or simply taking some time to yourself on a regular basis, managing our stress proves vital toward our overall health. Ashwagandha is an herb used in traditional medicine for centuries to help with stress and anxiety. This powerful adaptogen helps the body to manage stress more effectively by encouraging relaxation and making it easier to cope with stressful situations. Taking Ashwagandha regularly can reduce cortisol levels and lower symptoms of stress, such as fatigue, irritability, and forgetfulness. Diet improvements to help with long covid or post viral fatigue With long covid and post viral fatigue, it is important to consider diet improvements that can help alleviate symptoms. Eating nutritious meals can provide energy and improve brain function. Choosing foods not only with high levels in vitamins C, D, E and B, but also anti-inflammatory ones like turmeric, omega-3 rich fish like salmon or avocado, or fresh vegetables and fruits filled with antioxidants may make a huge difference. Additionally, by avoiding processed foods that contain added sugars or unhealthy fats this can reduce inflammation as well as possibly support healthier gut health resulting in fewer potential health problems. Making dietary changes paired with adequate rest can have a positive effect on the body's ability to cope with these challenging conditions. The importance of the gut The gut has a major role to play when it comes to post Covid fatigue. Studies have shown that inflammation in the gut causes systemic inflammation throughout the body and can lead to long-lasting fatigue symptoms. To improve gut health and reduce post Covid fatigue, try eating a balanced diet rich in fibre, probiotics, and prebiotics can help keep your intestinal microbiome healthy while avoiding foods high in sugar and artificial ingredients can reduce flareups. Fresh Air & Exercise Getting fresh air and exercising are two important steps to overcoming post Covid fatigue. Not only does fresh air bring in much-needed oxygen, but it can also introduce more Vitamin D into your system. Spending time outdoors, in nature if possible, can help rejuvenate both your body and mind. To avoid overworking yourself however, it's important to practice pacing yourself when exercising. Too much too soon can lead to burnout and make fatigue worse, so be sure to incorporate both short bursts of moderate activity with breaks in between. Sleep The quality of our sleep plays an important role in helping us to fight post Covid fatigue. There are several steps that you can take to ensure you're getting the best sleep possible and maintaining your overall health. Firstly, make sure that you're winding down before bedtime by avoiding screens, overly stimulating activities and drinks with caffeine or alcohol. Secondly, create a comfortable environment for sleeping; this includes finding a temperature that is comfortable and using light blocking curtains or an eye mask if needed. And finally, carving out time for regular exercise during the day will help tire your body, making it easier to fall asleep faster at night. Additionally, practicing yoga or breathing exercises helps relax the body and mind which contribute to better sleep quality. Even small changes like these can lead to big improvements in both your mental and physical wellbeing. What's next? If you are struggling with post-Covid fatigue, consider trying some natural remedies like supplements and lifestyle changes. CoQ10, Bach flower remedies, and magnesium can all help boost your energy levels. In addition, making sure you get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet, spend time in nature, and exercise regularly can also make a big difference. The next time you are feeling exhausted, try one of these natural solutions before reaching for the caffeine.
