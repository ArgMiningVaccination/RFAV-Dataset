COVID-19 Frequently Asked Questions What is the difference between a COVID-19 screening and a test? A screening for COVID is really an assessment of a patient who is experiencing flu-like symptoms and worried they may have been exposed to the virus. A provider will look at the patient's symptoms and discuss their exposure to determine if they have potentially contracted the virus. If the patient meets the criteria mandated by the CDC, then we issue an order for the patient to be tested. Not everyone who is screened needs to be tested, and the decision is based upon the CDC criteria. To learn more, visit the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html). What is the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)? There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, cause by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not been previously seen in humans, which was first identified in Wuhan, China, in 2019. How does COVID-19 spread? Current understanding about how the novel coronavirus spreads is largely based on what is known about similar coronaviruses. The virus is spread mainly from person-to-person between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). What are the symptoms of COVID-19? People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after expsoure to the virus. According to the CDC, people with these symptoms or combinations of symptoms may have COVID-19: - Cough - Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing - Fever - Fatigue - Repeated shaking with chills - Muscle pain or body aches - Headache - Sore throat - New loss of taste or smell - Diarrhea - Congestion or runny nose How can I protect myself and my family from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)? While distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine has started, it will take time to be able to offer it to all individuals. The best way to prevent the illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus. However, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of illness, including: - Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 40-60 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. - If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. - - Avoid close contact with people who are sick. - Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. - Stay home when you are sick. - Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. - Clean and disinfect frequently touch objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. - Follow CDC's recommendations for using a face mask. What are the guidelines for quarantine and isolation for COVID-19? Below is the latest guidance (updated 12-2-20) from the CDC regarding quarantine and isolation, shared from the Tom Green County Health Department: Stay home if you might have been exposed to COVID-19 Quarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from others. Quarantine helps prevent spread of disease that can occur before a person knows they are sick or if they are infected with the virus without feeling symptoms. People in quarantine should stay home, separate themselves from others, monitor their health and follow directions from their state or local health department. Local public health authorities make the final decisions regarding how long quarantine should last based on local conditions and needs in the communities they serve. Follow the recommendations of your local public health department if you need to quarantine. While the CDC still recommends people who have close contact with someone who is COVID-19 positive to quarantine for 14 days, [Tom Green County Local Health Authority Dr. James Vretis announced on Dec. 3](https://youtu.be/fLag8pDCBuE?t=645) that, based off new guidance from the CDC on options to reduce the length of quarantine, that we would change our 14-day quarantine requirement to 10 days in some instances. Effective immediately, people who are quarantined and have had no symptoms can be released from quarantine after 10 days without testing via this [form](https://www.cosatx.us/Admin/Components/Page/EditDesign?navid=2812). CDC guidance: Am I at risk of contracting coronavirus if I come to visit the hospital or become a patient? We regularly treat patients with infectious diseases and have comprehensive protocols and supplies to ensure we are able to do so with the highest regard to the safety and protection of our patients, visitors, healthcare providers and staff. If a patient is admitted to Shannon under investigation for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), that patient will be cared for according our protocols for dealing with infectious diseases, including treatment in isolated areas in compliance with CDC guidelines.
