Overmyer, Associate Director December 17, 1964 Dr. Robert Shank Professor of Preven\u00ac tive Medicine Washington University St. Louis, Missouri Dear Dr. Shank: Thank you for returning my telephone call so that we could adjust the target dates for the mailing of your manuscript to us with a view to meeting the panel date as previously established for January 26 at 12:00 noon, here in Cleveland. According to the new time-table, we shall, expect to receive the manuscripts at our office no later than Monday morning, January 11th so that it can be transmitted that day to the printer. This would mean that the original copy and the one carbon copy which we need will be placed in the mail at least by Friday, January 8. Let me emphasize the importance of clearly marking the envelope as being first-class or air mail. (We have had delays when the postman assumed that a manila envelope was third class, despite the postage on the package.) For your convenience, let me repeat the point that the original copy is sent to the printer for photo-offset. Therefore, the completed copies reflect the characteristics of the original. It is our experience that sharp, clean type produces the most satis\u00ac factory result in the printed copies. I am sorry that the unexpected demands on your time to which you referred make it necessary for you to work on this task during the holiday period. It happens, as I explained, that your panel meeting is the last in the series of thirty, and therefore it represents the point at which the entire emphasis of the project turns to the next phase. This explains my comment that I really WELFARE FEDERATION MEETING HUMAN NEEDS FOR YEARS 1913 J*W < 1964 A RED FEATHER SERVICE SUPPORTED THROUGH THE UNITED APPEAL Dr. Robert Shank 2- December 1J, 1964 do not believe that further adjustments of the panel date would be possible or even fair to your material, since the Health Goals Committee will need to have this material in hand along with that from the preceding papers as it proceeds with the Model building process.

W. Middleton, Associate Director R. P. Overmyer, Associate Director October 2, 1964 Dr. Robert Shank Professor of Preventive Medicine Washington University St. Louis, Missouri Dear Dr. Shank: At a recent Staff-Consultant Conference for our Health Goals Project, thought was given to the tasks which must be carried forward this year in order to fit various parts of the Project together according to the design for this undertaking. It became clear that a number of important and time-consuming tasks require the attention of our Research Director, Dr. Joanne Finley, during the next few months. Therefore, we are trying to conserve her time as much as possible. Accordingly, we are writing to ask you and the other authors who still are working on position papers to hold to the minimum essen\u00ac tials any further requests for information about the specific situa\u00ac tion in your field here in Greater Cleveland. (Of course, we shall try to assemble for you the data already requested.) We regret that this request has become necessary. We hope that you will not feel hampered by it. Certainly two provisions which we have made should offset any inconvenience involved; first the provision of background information in the fact book entitled \"Greater Cleveland and Its Health\", and, second, the use of informed local people on your panel to react to the broad principles and recommendations in your account of the \"ideal\" for a metropolitan community. Our experience with previous panels leads us to believe that it is realistic to expect that the panel discussion will fulfill this re\u00ac sponsibility of relating your statement to the local situation. WELFARE FEDERATION A RED FEATHER SERVICE SUPPORTED THROUGH THE UNITED APPEAL Dr. Robert Shank -2- October 2, 1964 We know that this is an unusual technique for a community survey. However, we can give you assurance that it is working well and that the challenge which it poses to our authors has proved to be mutually worthwhile.

I am attaching a schedule which summarizes the target dates for all of us, so that arrangements will be completed in time for that meet\u00ac ing. In accordance with your own decision, I have set December 1st as the date when you will complete your manuscript, In connection with having your manuscript typed in final form, let me alert your secretary to the importance of furnishing us with as clear and sharp an original copy as possible. (For use in the of\u00ac fice while the original is at the printer, we ask that a carbon copy of the manuscript also be furnished to us.) We reproduce the posi\u00ac tion paper by photo offset process, both to eliminate the time in\u00ac volved in copying or typesetting, and to insure exact reproduction of the material furnished to us. Experience has shown that the best results are obtained when secretaries are aware of the impor\u00ac tance of their personal contributions to this undertaking. Looking forward to the date of your panel meeting, I should mention our request that our authors arrive the evening before the meeting so as to avoid any possible travel difficulties prior to the lun\u00ac cheon. We recommend that you stay at the Sheraton-Cleveland Hotel because this is convenient to our office. In this way you can meet the staff members during the morning and go out with them to Wade Park Manor. If you would like to have us make your hotel reser\u00ac vation, please let us know.

The enclosed scheduling form indicates the dates which need to be worked out in telephone discussion so as to take into account the commitments of a number of people. Another consideration must be the interval of about a month be\u00ac tween the receipt of your manuscript in this office, and the scheduling of the meeting with your panel members. During this interval, our printer must duplicate by photo-offset process, the original copy of your manuscript, and ample time must be al\u00ac lowed for your panel members to read and reflect upon your paper. Since we are anxious to conclude this phase of the Health Goals Project before the end of the year, it would be desirable from our point of view, to receive your manuscript by November 1st and to schedule your panel meeting during the first week in December. Of course, this time-table might not be feasible from your point of view, but perhaps these dates might be a base line in relation to which we could make whatever adjustments are neces sary. May I ask that you telephone me, person-to-person, collect, as soon as you can after your return, so that we can work out the exact dates in a manner satisfactory, not only to ourselves but also for the convenience of Dr. Sheps and other members of our Health Goals staff. kc ^-Uordially yours Rilma Buckman, Ph.

Shank Department of Preventive Medicine Washington University Medical School Euclid and Kingshighway St. Louis 10, Missouri Dear Bob: RE: Your Cleveland Health Goals Paper I'm writing to you pursuant to our telephone conversation. It's good that you are going to be able to start work on the paper. This will mean that it can be included for discussion later in the fall when we expect to complete this phase of our work. As I've thought about the nutrition area,\"^as I've discussed it with others, it becomes fairly evident that the neat divisions of subject matter which we set up originally need some revision. This has happened to us with regard to a couple of other fields where we have needed to separate or combine what had appeared to us to be a logical division. On further reflection, it becomes clear to me that it would be best to combine, in your paper, the prevention of nutritional deficiencies and abnormalities with recognition and early treat\u00ac ment. Nutritional abnormalities and deficiencies, as traditionally considered, lend themselves rather easily, it appears, to this combined treatment in a paper. Some attention to the need gener\u00ac ally seen in typical U.S. cities to\"'improve the handling of the clinical aspects of these problems would be helpful. As to the matter of diet and degenerative disease, e.g., obesity, arteriosclerosis, hypertension and perhaps also toxaemias of preg\u00ac nancy, I think it would be important for you to give this all the attention you believe it deserves. If others, e\u00abg., Stamler in dealing with cardio-vascular disease, deal with such elements also, that's all to the good. Dr. Robert E. Shank July 15, 1964 Page 2._ Don't hesitate to call me - Collect - (Area Code 412, MU 3-1620, Extension 2126) to discuss any aspect of this.

Shank, M.D. Professor of Preventive Medicine Washington University St. Louis, Missouri Dear Dr. Shank: A progress report from the Health Goals Project seems to be both timely and desirable. It brings into focus two observations: we are somewhat behind schedule, but we have important developments to report as shown by the following enclosures: 1) Outstanding people have agreed to prepare position papers as you will see from the enclosed list. At present the authorship for about half of the papers is definite and, for the remaining papers, is nearing decision. This selection has proceeded slowly because of our wish to enlist high caliber people with broad perspective. 2) A handsome brochure describing the Project has just come from the printer. This will receive wide distribution. We hope that you will share our enthusiasm for this publication. 3) Two one-page statements have been prepared briefly describing the assignments to the position paper writers and the panels. All requests for specific information about Cleveland from position paper writers have been filled immediately and the final source book material will be mailed this month. Despite this progress, we are becoming concerned with the tendency of the Project to drop behind its schedule. This could result in failure of an undertaking for which we all have high hopes. Therefore, I am writing to explain our scheduling problem to you and to ask your help as we now prepare a calendar for the next six months. WELFARE f FEDERATION Thirty position papers must be received, duplicated, distributed, and reviewed by panels before May 1st, 1964. (We estimate that a lapse of 2 to 3 weeks will occur between receipt of the manu\u00ac script and the date of the panel meeting.) MEETING HUMAN NEEDS FOR 1913 1963 A RED FEATHER SERVICE SUPPORTED THROUGH THE UNITED APPEAL > -2- . . . All of these papers must be considered by the Health Goals Committee before June 1st. This means that, after completing the above steps, six papers must be available for the committee each month from January through May in order for the Project to start its Model building on time. ... In order to allow reasonable time to the individuals whose participation is not yet definite, it is desirable to receive the other papers before the end of 1963 or early in 1964. . . . Therefore, if you have not already fixed a date with us for the deliver,' of your paper, will you please let us know how soon we can expect your manuscript and still allow you a reasonable period for its completion, (i am adding a post\u00ac script giving our understanding of the timing of your paper.) Finally, we are in the process of selecting people to serve on the panels. If you have any suggestions, either of people who might be included or of competences which might not occur to us in connection with your paper, please let us know. As you see, we are making good progress and, with care, will be able to achieve the unusual potentialities of this Project. Since one of its most exciting features is for us to meet and to share ideas with our position paper writers, we are anxious that our arrangements be made in an orderly and mutually satisfactory manner. It is for this purpose, as well as to bring you up to date on recent developments that we are writing you. With every good wish, I am WCT/EBimr ends. Sincerely yours /si* William C. Treuhaft, Chairman Health Goals Committee P.S. We seem to have no indication in our records as to when we can expect to receive your manuscript beyond a general notation--\"spring of 1964\". Therefore, would you send us a target date, preferably within the first three months of 1964, and a choice of several alternative dates about three to five weeks beyond that deadline when you could come to Cleve\u00ac land for the meeting with your panel? We then can arrange of all of us to hold the alternative time which proves to be most satisfactory. This will help to insure an interesting and stimulating discussion.

THE CLEVELAND HEALTH GOALS PROJECT To develop the MODEL of a healthy community For metropolitan Cleveland\u2014an urban, industrialized community of one and three-quarter million people Using the best available knowledge and experience about health Collected by national experts, molded into the model by Cleveland leaders with consultant help. To compare Cleveland's present health picture against the model And to determine how we fall short Then to set goals \u2014what we need to do to reach the ideal And to set priorities among these goals, based on importance, feasibility and the predict\u00ac ability of results So that the resources which our community can command will be used to maxi\u00ac mum benefit for the health of our people. To decide how these goals can be achieved * Thus to seek community agreement on the value of the model and the desirability of achieving the goals And to work for implementation of these goals in orderly fashion In accord with priorities Making full use of the programs which now exist But not hesitating to encourage change, to subtract or add or modify if such is in the community interest. 1 FIRST STEP in the study will be a look at Greater Cleveland now \u2014 a roadmap showing Greater Cleveland and Its Health \u2014 for use by all en\u00ac gaged in the project. This will be the initial research document compiled from existing local, state and federal data by the project researcher. It will cover the social and economic charac\u00ac teristics of Greater Cleveland and its people\u2014health facilities and services \u2014 health status \u2014 costs and financing of health care\u2014health manpower. V 2 IN THE NEXT step the word goes out across the country to over 30 carefully se\u00ac lected experts, inviting each to prepare a POSITION PAPER on the health topic assigned him. These papers are to cover the scope of the problem, the best knowledge about what to do, the resources required and the re\u00ac sults to be expected. Out over the country to these writers goes the Cleveland roadmap\u2014so that in preparingtheir position papers they will write for Cleveland. 3 NOW, IN STEP 3, back from across the country, will come the position papers. Each paper is to be reviewed by a local panel composed of pro\u00ac fessional and lay leaders who have knowledge of the particu\u00ac lar subject and the Cleveland situation. The panels will be ex\u00ac pected to point up the relation\u00ac ship of findings to Cleveland conditions, to identify major differences, and to highlight points for inclusion in the model. Findings of the panels will then be reported to the Health Goals Committee. THE POSITION PAPERS THE HEALTH MODEL GOALS AND PRIORITIES HEALTH: DESCRIBED AND CLASSIFIED In this project health is viewed broadly and on a spectrum, which ranges from severest disability to the potentials for optimum health. Traditional classifications by diseases or services have been discarded. The three major classifications for study are: Prevention of Disease and Injury Recognition and Early Treatment of Disease or Injury - Pre\u00ac vention of Disability, Social Isolation and Untimely Death Within these classifications, and in some instances crosscutting them, is an array of topics which include: Infections and parasitism Nutritional deficiencies and abnormalities Trauma (including safety) Non-infectious chronic diseases * Endocrine and metabolic abnormalities Cardio\u00ac vascular disorders Respiratory conditions Neoplastic disease Dental health Sensory diseases Loss of mobility Mental illness - Addictions Retardation Subdivisions of these topics are the subjects of position papers. The whole broad area of positive health\u2014the maximum potential for human development physically, intellectually, emotionally, socially, spiritually \u2014 is also receiving consideration. 4 THE HEALTH MODEL starts to emerge.The position papers are melded\u2014essentials are highlighted, the extraneous removed. The various aspects of health, separated earlier for study, are again merged. The design of a healthy community, THE MODEL, is formed. It is the master and ideal Health Goal which Cleve\u00ac land should seek. It includes the dimensions of health and also the resources which the Greater Cleve\u00ac land community should have to meet the health needs of its citizenry. 5 THE CLEVELAND COMMUNITY looks at the Model. Does it want it? Will it buy it and use it? Ac\u00ac ceptance of the Model is sought by the sponsoring groups \u2014 the Health Council and Welfare Federation \u2014 by the health organizations \u2014 by the community's strong decision-making groups. Members of the Health Goals Committee are key interpreters to their groups and the community, and back again. Hopefully the Model is acceptable as a goal for Cleveland. P NEXT COMES A weighing of ** the Model against existing con\u00ac ditions. The Cleveland health picture, updated and more explicit, is viewed against the Model. Health organiza\u00ac tions are examined so that present resources are used to advantage. Gaps are noted; outmoded or ex\u00ac traneous programs are earmarked for adjustment. The no-man's land be\u00ac tween what exists and what is desir\u00ac able becomes the field for cultivation. THE HEALTH MODEL GOALS AND PRIORITIES THE CLEVELAND TRADITION PROJECT ORGANIZATION It is in the Cleveland tradition for community improvement to result from the concerted efforts of its leaders and organizations. Indus\u00ac trial, educational and cultural achievements, and a position of eminence in health and wel\u00ac fare, have thus been realized. For 50 years the Welfare Federation has been a pace-setter in health and welfare planning \u2014 the medium for governmental and voluntary agencies to collaborate to meet human needs. Consistent with the Cleveland tradition, the Health Goals Project is initiated, directed and will be carried to completion by Cleveland leaders represent\u00ac ing many phases of community life.

This is the sourcebook of data pertinent to health and health planning for metropolitan Cleveland which I have been compiling for your use in the preparation of your position paper for the Cleveland Health Goals Project. The format of this book is as follows: Chapter I II III IV V Introduction The People of Greater Cleveland Health Services and Facilities in Cuyahoga County and Cleveland A Memorandum on Health Status The Cost of Health Care In Greater Cleveland You have received a book in which Chapters II and V are complete. These represent the major intent of the sourcebook and are studies in depth in their areas of coverage. Chapter II will give you nearly all data on socio economic and population characteristics we feel of especial pertinence to your understand\u00ac ing of Greater Cleveland. Chapter V was mailed you some time ago in separate covers. We suggest that you now destroy that earlier document, or return it to us. The book in its permanent binder is set up so that the subsequent chapters WELFARE / FEDERATION MEETING HUMAN NEEDS FOR A RED FEATHER SERVICE SUPPORTED THROUGH THE UNITED APPEAL January 22, 196k Page 2 to be sent to you can be easily inserted in their proper order. In the interests of time, and the needs we felt you would have in the role of position paper author, these chapters will not be major in their coverage. Nevertheless, let me indicate the plans for them. If there is material which these smaller chapters will contain that would be helpful to you at once, please write me to ask for it. I - Introduction - The geographic area, a bit about natural resources, transportation, utilities, meteorologic information. A descrip\u00ac tion of The Cleveland Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, and the data area for this book. Ill - Health Services and Facilities - An alphabetical listing by a class\u00ac ification scheme which fits the \"spectrum\" of the Health Goals Pro\u00ac ject and its position papers. Measurements of budget, manpower, service statistics and scope of program of these agencies and facilities, requires independent research and will be a subse\u00ac quent task to be undertaken locally after the \"model\" is con\u00ac structed from the various position papers. It is then that we will measure what Cleveland has and evaluate gaps. IV - Health Status - One of Greater Cleveland's problems in the health area seems to be in record keeping. Very little data for measur\u00ac ing health status is available by census tract for example, yet all demographic material in the sourcebook has been reported by this unit. Thus, this section will simply define what could be compiled for you on request. In the meantime, let me stress, that at least mortality from any cause in the In\u00ac ternational Classification can now be forwarded to you by census tract and the other standard variables such as age, sex, race, etc. for the entire county be\u00ac ginning with 1962. If material of this nature would be helpful please do re\u00ac quest it. It has been a pleasure to do this work for you. I hope it will prove inter\u00ac esting and useful. Please feel free to utilize my help in obtaining any other specific data you may need. Sincerely 'Joanne E.

Laymen as well as professionals will be included. Each of these groups will meet to discuss the position paper(s) in its field with the aut'nor(s), one or more representatives of the consultant team, the staff, and the Main Committee. The responsibilities of the panel are four-fold: 1) to point up the relationship of suggestions in the position papers to Cleveland conditions; 2) to give reactions regarding probable community response,* 3) to offer summarizing comments to assist the Main Committee as it develops the Model. These should consist of the most important facts and principles about the subject field plus possible suggestions for Greater Cleveland; 4) to call attention to any major differences of opinion in local professional circles from the point of view expressed in the position paper. On the basis of approximately thirty position papers and panel reports, as well as other material developed by the Project, the Model will be prepared by the consultants and staff working under the direction of the Main Committee.

Therefore, it is hoped that each position paper: 1) will give expert judgment regarding the best available knowledge about the topic; and will point out trends in the field, possible future developments, or emerging ways of handling the problem; in order to predict, insofar as possible, the results to be anticipated from full application as compared to partial or non\u00ac application of the foregoing knowledge; and 2) will indicate the resources needed to achieve these results and the approximate cost involved. (The degree of specificity will vary depending on the problem.) The primary responsibility of the position paper writers is to provide a sound professional basis for the local community to use in developing the specific recom\u00ac mendations for Greater Cleveland. Except for the request that a summary appear at the beginning, highlighting the main points of the paper, the method of presentation is left for the author to decide. However, since the paper will be discussed with a local panel which may include individuals from several disciplines, and since it also will be studied by members of the main committee, it should be developed in a way that will be understandable to these individuals. Of course, if a misinterpretation should occur inadvertently, the Research Associate, who is a physician, is available at all times to clarify any questions from non-medical participants. Because the Model will represent an ideal community health goal, it is desirable that position paper writers include the ideal goals for their fields, together with supporting information to show what might be achieved if the community better under\u00ac stood the situation and wanted to accomplish these attainable advances. Conversely, it is important to show insofar as possible what consequences can be anticipated if the community fails to utilize, or only partially applies, existing knowledge. Implied in this, of course, is the need for pointing out the type of evidence on which prediction of results is based. As mentioned above, the author will meet after completion of his position paper with a small panel of well-informed people from the Cleveland area for their reactions to both the content of the paper and the relevant local conditions which the Main Committee will need to weigh in preparing the Model and the subsequent specific recommendations for health services in Greater Cleveland. \"p /(py *> 7) ~ 'ijJisC---- _1 UL Jh JJL to nine branch laboratories of the State board of health.

Youmans, M.D., New York. Journal of American Medical Association, p. 672. Aug. 31, 1964. What impact does the changed face of nu\u00ac trition have on the practicing physician? While he must continue to be alert to the occasional case of classic deficiency disease, he must recognize that this is not the only kind of nutritional disease. He must give up the belief that in most cases nutritional-deficiency disease is subclinical and can be cared for by a multivitamin pill which, if it does no good, at least will do no harm, will com\u00ac fort the patient, and will fulfill the physician's responsibility. He must learn the mechanism of a whole new cate\u00ac gory of genetic diseases affecting nutri\u00ac tion, often with obscure symptoms. He must learn the effects on nutrition of a variety of procedures, ranging from sur\u00ac gery through the use of antibiotics and other drugs to manipulations of diet, so that when such procedures are necessary, he can institute measures to hold adverse effects in check. He must learn to adopt screening techniques in cases of geneti\u00ac cally induced disorders, including par\u00ac ticipation in public-health measures to detect genetic disease and prevent its untoward effect whenever possible. He must learn the genetic pattern of such diseases and their families concerning the transmission of hereditary defects. Finally, the practicing physician, and particularly the family doctor, has a unique and challenging opportunity and responsibility in the detection and elucidation of new forms of nutritional disease, especially those of genetic origin. With fuller knowledge of the pa\u00ac tient, his history, his family and back\u00ac ground, the physician is in the best posi\u00ac tion to observe abnormalities, to detect hidden symptoms, to relate them to diet\u00ac aries, to explore family situations, and to initiate and stimulate research stud\u00ac ies. Here again, in a new category of di\u00ac sease, are opportunities for a modern-day Jenner, a Withering, a Semmelweis. on a new set of CAMP data and a mobile sulfur dioxide sampling station is being used to obtain further test data at other locations in Cincinnati.

WATER THE FUTURE OF POLLUTION CONTROL IN FLORIDA -- Vincent D. Patton and David B. Lee, Florida State Board of Health. Journal of Water Pollution Control Fed\u00ac eration, p. 1129. Sept. 1964. The future of Florida will be decided by its resi\u00ac dents. If they want and are willing to pay for adequate waste treatment, this will be the result. At present, pollution con\u00ac trol is mainly vested in the State Board of Health. The main handicap has been a low budget for these activities and low pay scales. As an example, a case can be cited where a neighboring state hired a young engineer at $65 more per month than we were able to offer. Let's not forget in evaluating the picture that the common denominator of water use in water quality management. Pressures for changes are building up. Whether the State Board of Health stays in the picture to the same extent remains to be seen. This control activity could pass to another state agency, or a new agency created specifi\u00ac cally for the purpose. At present, Flor\u00ac ida is one of only six states in which water pollution control remains in the health agency. In quite a few states pol\u00ac lution control activities are handled by a water pollution control commission. WOOD APPLICATORS FOR THE CONFIRMATORY TEST IN THE BACTERIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF WATER -- 0. E. McGuire, Michigan Depart\u00ac ment of Health. Public Health Reports, p. 812. Sept. 1964. Three methods of inoculating brilliant green lactose bile for the confirmatory test in the bacteri\u00ac ological analysis of water have been com\u00ac pared. Of the 606 lactose fermentation tubes studied, 23 more tubes were con\u00ac firmed by the wood applicator method than by the wire loop method. Fourteen more tubes were confirmed by the pipette method than by the wire loop procedure. The wood applicator method always confirmed tubes that were confirmed by the pipette and the loop methods. Ten tubes were confirmed by only the wood applicator. Seventeen tubes that were confirmed by the applicator and the pipette were not confirmed with the loop method. The inoculation of BGLB tubes with the use of one loop requires approximately twice as much time as either the pipette or wood applicator method of transfer. This study suggests that Standard Methods should be modified to permit the use of wood applicators or pipettes for the inoculation of BGLB fermentation tubes.

A study was made from 1955 to 1961 on the occurrence of exposure to organophosphorus insecticides in the Colorado area. A reduction in blood cholinesterase activity was taken as evidence for significant absorption of these compounds in persons working with the organophosphorus insecticides. Of 419 blood samples submitted, 43% showed evidence of some absorption, while 19% showed evidence of marked absorption of the organophosphorus insecticides. In the latter group, all workers had symp\u00ac toms of toxicity. A total of 70 persons required admission either to the hospital or to the Emergency Room for treatment. In routine blood sampling of workers in airplane spraying groups, over 60%, showed reduced blood cholinesterase activity, which emphasizes a need for improving working techniques. Studies were presented to show how effective protective proce\u00ac dures could reduce significantly absorp\u00ac tion of the organophosphorus insecticides in persons working with these agents. A community approach designed to reduce organophosphorus insecticide toxicity in workers and to provide improved therapy was outlined.

Project Objectives In brief: to set health goals for metropolitan Cleveland, to develop better methods of providing community health services, and to find the means thereby the community can establish priorities and systematically implement its object\u00ac ives. This project is part of a large endeavor directed toward dynamic health and wel\u00ac fare planning in the metropolitan Cleveland area. To understand the project objectives, in the perspective of the whole, seme picture of organizational s-feguc- ture and over-all objectives and program is in order. Therefore, this section will contain: 1. Brief, general information about the structure, purpose, program, and developments of the applicant agency, the Welfare Federation, particularly as related to this project 2. Similar information about the Health Council, the organization within the Welfare Federation responsible for initiating, developing, and implementing the project 3. The Health Goals Committee which developed this project 4. The project objective 5. The significance of this project for out-of-hospital services 6. The reason for requesting partial project support from the Public Health Service The chart on the next page gives a picture of those parts of the Welfare Federation and Health Council organization which have direct bearing on this project as will be noted in the following pages of description. 1. The Welfare Federation / The Welfare Federation, an organization incorporated not for profit under the laws of the State of Ohio, is a voluntary federation of 220 govern\u00ac mental and private health, welfare, recreation, education, and civic non-profit organizations in the metropolitan Cleveland area- Its functions are health and welfare planning, coordination of health and welfare serv\u00ac ices, and the allocation of funds to most local agencies supported by the United Appeal. Geographically it covers all of Cuyahoga County and Geauga County and parts of two other counties. Direction of the Welfare Federation is vested in a Board of Trustees. Operations are carried on through five Councils and an array of standing and ad hoc committees. The Councils are Health, Hospital, Case Work, Children's, and Group Work. Each is a membership organization of agencies in a particular field of interest plus citizen members-at-large. Welfare Federation committees generally cover specific interest areas or are formed to cross-cut Council lines or to tackle particular community problems. Illustrative are committees on occupational planning, older persons, careers in social work, job and salary classifications, juvenile delinquency, vol\u00ac unteers, public relations, solicitations, field services, legislation, com\u00ac munity welfare policy, homemaker services. Within the past months the Welfare Federation has been working towards strengthening its community planning operations. A Joint Committee of Federation Board and Councils has developed a proposal to establish a Planning Unit within the Federation. This was adopted by the Federation Board and special financing has been secured from local sources. It has significance for this project as well as for the community and therefore is appended with other information about the Welfare Federation in Appendix A. u 2. The Health Council The Health Council (one of the five Councils of the Welfare Federation), under direction of its Planning Board, is the organization responsible for initiating, developing, conducting,. and implementing the Health Goals Project. It has appointed a Health Goals Committee, with a work\u00ac ing Steering Committee, to carry out these responsibilities. The Health Council is over 35 years old. In 1959-1960 it underwent re\u00ac organization. Considerations leading to the reorganization, and subse\u00ac quently to the development of this project, were described in a plan approved by the Council in the spring of i960. The plan and the new Regulations are appended (Appendix B). The Regulations state that the Health Council shall be the body within the Welfare Federation responsible for community-wide health planning. Membership is comprised of a) member organizations each represented by one lay and one professional (exclusive of hospitals which have their own Council but have representation on the Health Council through ex officio provisions); b) members-at-large (civic and professional leaders); c) ex officio members. The Regulations also call for establishment of a Planning Board which is the responsible, working group of the Council. The Planning Board mem\u00ac bership is so constituted as to be able to fulfill its function and thus is comprised of three types of members, namely: a) 12 selected from the representatives of member organizations, 6 lay and 6 professional; b) 12 members-at-large, the requisite for selection being knowledge, ex\u00ac perience, and leadership in community affairs; c) 8-12 ex officio mem\u00ac bers, such to be incumbents of positions of key importance to commun\u00ac ity health planning. (At present the ex officio members include the Deans, or their designees, of the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Dentis\u00ac try, and Applied Social Sciences of Western Reserve University; one representative appointed by the six health officers within the county; one member of the Board of County Commissioners; the County Controller of Chronic Illness and Tuberculosis; the executive of Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio; 2 representatives from the Hospital Council; one representative appointed by the Academy of Medicine (County Medical- Society); one representative appointed by the Cleveland AFL-CIO Feder\u00ac ation of Labor (temporarily vacant). In addition, the President and Executive Director of the Welfare Federation are automatically ex officio members. The Planning Board, charged by the Council with responsibility for community-wide health planning, started its job in the fall of i960 by reviewing the local health picture. It noted that the community has about 150 health and related organizations. It examined some of the major problems and noted the findings and recommendations of various local surveys, studies, and committee deliberations. It recognized pro\u00ac gress and roadblocks. It finally asked: Where are we heading? What is our goal? The health goals concept, formation of the Health Goals Committee, and development of the Health Goals Project resulted. 5 Before moving on to discussion of the health goals concept and the ob\u00ac jectives of the project, several other observations about the Health Council are in order. When the Health Council was reorganized, the Welfare Federation's Com\u00ac mittee on Chronically Ill was incorporated into the Council. This com\u00ac mittee had been extremely active for more than a decade and is credited with providing the community impetus behind such developments as estab\u00ac lishment of Highland View (County Chronic Illness Hospital), the Cleve\u00ac land Home Care Demonstration Program under administration of the Visit\u00ac ing Nurse Association, the Chronic Illness Information Center, and the newly established Chronic Illness Center under Coirnty auspices to which the Information Center has been transferred. Currently, a Health Facilities Survey is being conducted in the greater Cleveland area. Initially conceived as a hospital facilities survey, the Health Council encouraged broadening of the scope to include other health facilities because of conviction that hospital planning must be closely correlated with planning for other types of institutions and with ambula\u00ac tory and home service programs. This study will provide valuable data for the Health Goals Project. The Health Council, through direction of its Planning Board, is engaged in many other activities relative to community health activities. One, for example, is sponsorship with the Dental Society and the Western Reserve University School of Dentistry of an exploratory survey of dental needs and services. Others have to do with health education, a demonstration project for the parents of blind children, problems of home-bound respir\u00ac atory polios, a periodic review program of United Appeal supported health agencies, nursing home accreditation, etc. The Planning Board sees its responsibility as keeping all such activities in balance and in line with over-all objectives. To complete the picture of structure, the following observations are in order: a) b) The Hospital Council, also a Council of the Federation, plays a different role in planning than does the Health Council. It is principally concerned with hospital operations. Through ex officio representation on the Health Council Planning Board, through representation on the Federation Board of Trustees, and through other affiliations it par\u00ac ticipates in community planning endeavors. There are six official health districts in Cuyahoga County, namely: Cleveland, Cleveland Heights, East Cleveland, Lakewood, Shaker Heights, and the County (all other). All are member organizations of the Health Council and are represented on the Council. In addition, the six health officers elect one member of their group to serve in an ex officio position on the Health Council Planning Board. (Note: The chart on page 6 shows representation on Planning Board, not the direct representation hy all six districts on the Health Council.) c) A regional hospital planning organization, covering a geographic area considerably larger than metropol\u00ac itan Cleveland, has been under consideration and plans for its establishment have been formulated. It is contemplated that there will be some form of liaison with the Health Council so that health problems, and programs identified by the Council will become part of the working materials of the hospital planning organization. See Appendix B for additonal data about the Health Council. See Appendix C for membership of Health Goals Committee and Steering Committee and other data on health goals not contained in body of application. 3. The Health Goals Committee If metropolitan Cleveland were to \"be the best community in the nation health wise, what would we need to do? What is the model of a healthy community? What should we aim to achieve for our generation, for the next? Can we take the best that is known anywhere, integrate and adapt it for our community, emerge with a goal, and find a feasible approach to its attainment? Does our community have the imagination and the will to do this kind of creative job? These were the questions which the Health Council Planning Board asked in the fall of i960. It committed itself to find the answers and emerg\u00ac ed with a recommendation entitled \"Report of Special Committee Appointed to Develop Structure for Long Range Planning\" (Appendix C) which was approved by the Health Council in March 1961. The Report calls for appointment of a Health Goals Committee which: A. should be charged initially with the duty of determining for metropolitan Cleveland its major health needs, and prepare an ideal health program and its essential component parts, and thereafter report its findings for consideration and ap\u00ac proval of the Health Council and its Planning Board; and thereafter B. should proceed to: 1. compare the existing health program with the ideal it has found, to determine the needs, gaps, deficiencies or inefficiencies; 2. establish the most feasible approach to the attainment of the ideal, and in so doing should: (a) consider the feasibility of the utilization of existing facilities or agencies for service and their expansion, or the creation of new facilities or agencies for service; (b) suggest whether such facilities or agencies for service, whether to be expanded or created, should be developed under public or private auspices; (c) recommend the method for financing the improve\u00ac ment or expansionsappearing necessary; (a) determine an order of priority among the several recommendations it might make in light of the resources available for their promotion; 8 3. \"be recognized as constantly subject to change and im\u00ac provement because of population movement and the development of medical and social sciences with the result that any program should be subject to constant and regular review ...\" The Health Goals Committee was appointed, with additions being made from time to time as it was determined that other interests should be repre\u00ac sented. At the first meeting in June 19&L, the magnitude and difficulty of the task were recognized, as well as the challenge, and a small com\u00ac mittee (the nucleus of the present Steering Committee) was appointed to study and recommend on scope and method. The group was authorized to call upon consultants for advice. The Steering Committee* developed the following statement of Assumptions: \"Our primary goal is to provide for the health needs of the people in our community. Thus our first objective is to determine what for whom? Only after such is determined can we decide who should do what, how and when, and how can all this be achieved. More specifically, our focus is on a) promotion and maintenance of health, b) prevention of ill health, c) discovery and diagnosis of ill health, d) treatment and care of persons with ill health (towards restoration of health or maximum functioning). These we might term primary functions. \"Other functions are secondary, in that they are functions aimed at fulfilling the primary functions. These are a) education of pro\u00ac fessional personnel, b) research, and c) community planning. \"Functions are performed by a) personnel, who generally operate in or through b) facilities and agencies, which are under c) voluntary or public authorities. In order for functions to be performed d) financing is necessary. \"Functions differ in the extent to which they are available to people and are used by them. Determinants are many. On the recipient's part they may be travel mobility, financial ability, eligibility for service, availability of personnel, facilities or agencies. On the part of one performing the function the determinant may be limitations imposed by geography, law, personnel, finances, etc. \"At this time the geographical area of our concern is the Cleveland metropolitan area (not explicitly defined nor confined to Cuyahoga County). In other words, we are chiefly concerned with having pri\u00ac mary functions available to the people in this geographical area who need (or wish?) them. We recognize that others, outside the geographical area, may make use of these functions, also that pro- * Footnote: Originally called \"Subcommittee\" 9 vision of these functions is not solely hy agents operating within the geographical area. Furthermore, the secondary functions of professional education and research have a much broader geographical base. The geographical base for planning is local, but the 'local' may soon be 'regional.'\" In succeeding weeks the Steering Committee called upon three eminent consultants to review the general concept and to advise on method. From these discussions a proposal was developed for a three-year Health Goals Project which was subsequently approved, with minor modifications, by the full Health Goals Committee, the Planning Board and Health Coun\u00ac cil and finally by the Welfare Federation Board of Trustees on April 6, 1962. The Health Goals Project must be seen in the light of developments in the Welfare Federation and Health Council (the reason for the foregoing pages) because it is one part, both in time and scope, of a significant attempt on the part of the Cleveland community to meet the challenging problems of metropolitan life in a more dynamic and effective way. 4. The Project Objective 10 It is proposed that the Health Goals Committee, with the advice and di\u00ac rection of consultants and with technical staff help, would develop a model of a healthy community, make choices and establish goal priorities within the possibilities that Cleveland can mobilize, secure community agreement and support, and develop and implement a community health pro\u00ac gram. It is estimated that the project will take, and should be budgeted and financed for, three years; that a total of $200,000 should be sought for this purpose. The purpose is not only to set goals but to achieve them. Thus the pro\u00ac gression is seen as: a) Developing the model of an ideal health community based on optimum application of present knowledge b) Making adjustments and choices based on realities and setting desirable but attainable goals c) Establishing priorities d) Getting community agreement to work toward achievement of these goals e) Developing and implementing a program which leads toward achievement of these goals and which utilizes existing and potential resources most effectively. It is anticipated that all of the above will be completed during the three-year project with the exception of full implementation since that will take continuing work in the years ahead. The Health Council, through its Planning Hoard, Health Goals Committee or by other means, expects to continue to work on such implementation. It is hoped that through this project the community can reduce the pro\u00ac liferation of health organizations, the inequities and gaps in care, the categories and compartmentalism which confound the public, the over-use of institutions and unnecessary costs. It is also hoped that a way will be found to devise a more effective community health program with the best deployment of money, personnel, and facilities. Those engaged in this project believe that the best answer will not be found through traditional approaches, through surveying what exists and merely projecting additions on present programs. What is needed is a more comprehensive approach which starts with a goal and which involves community decision makers in the process of goal formation, change in community health structure, and implementation of an improved system of health services. 11 5. The Significance of the Project for Out-of-Hospital Services This project covers all aspects of health care of -which out-of-hospital services for the chronically ill and aged are a significant part. ' The significance of the project for out-of-hospital services is more meaningful than mere coverage of such services in an examination of health care programs. The project aims to find out the determinants of individ\u00ac ual and community health. Such findings will have value for programs of prevention which are community based. It is evident that wider application of rehabilitative and preventive measures must be aimed at people where they are and where they get their care, whether in their own homes, at work, in school or the doctors1 offices. This points toward getting away from concentration on hospital activity as an isolated episode and view\u00ac ing the whole environment and all community resources as parts of a total program of health care. Through an examination of maximum achievements elsewhere and their comparison with Cleveland's achievements, in a series of respects which would include a variety of out-of-hospital services, it should be possible to get a speci\u00ac fic as well as a comprehensive picture of the nature, extent and relatedness of out-of-hospital services in the total picture of community health care. Cleveland has a number of out-of-hospital services, including ones in demon\u00ac stration stage, and an examination of these against achievements elsewhere, as well as within the context of the total health community, should prove significant. The project should also have significance for out-of-hospital services because of its collateral focus on community organization. A shift from professional and lay emphasis on, and demand for, in-hospital versus out- hospital services requires more than development of a blue print or master plan. It requires acceptance of new patterns of service on the part of both the professional and lay community. Involvement by the community's decision makers and professional leaders should contribute significantly to such acceptance. 12 6. Reason for Requesting Partial Support for the Project from the Public Health Service The project requires a total grant of $200,000 for three years, of which $125,000 is requested from local foundations and $75,000 ($25,000 for each of 3 years) from the Public Health Service. Local foundations have approved the request for $125,000, have already appropriated one-third of the amount for the first year's operations and will make the remainder available when full project financing has been secured. The project has major significance for Cleveland; thus the major share of financing should be Cleveland's responsibility. There are reasons, however, why partial support from the Public Health Service is desirable. l) Cleveland's problem is shared by other -urban communities and is of national concern. The findings should be adaptable and of interest to other communities. A model of a healthy community, developed by one metropolitan area, can be tested, and adapted for use by others. Perhaps of more significance to other communities is the process, whereby one -urban com\u00ac munity seeks an effective way to involve its decision makers and its formal and informal organizations in establishment of mutually acceptable goals and priorities, based upon signif\u00ac icant determinants, and then effects a method of implementation, particularly when such process is documented and subject to eval\u00ac uation. A Public Health Service grant is valuable to the local community. It augments local funds, it is accompanied by consultation service, it carries recognition of project worth. 2) 13 B. Project Heed and Background Hie health picture nationally may be characterized by the following. . Fragmentation of the whole health service area - variety of public authorities, voluntary services, medical specialties, etc. . Resources are in short supply - costs rising, demands increasing, per\u00ac sonnel and funds limited. . Health is part of a total program of community living - health devel\u00ac opments affect and are affected by other developments in society: jobs, housing, education, industrial developments, the political structure, etc. . Society is demanding more and better health services, better coordi\u00ac nation, provisions for comprehensive care and for continuity of care, different systems for providing and for financing health care. . Scientific and professional progress, environmental, and social changes, necessitate continuing change and adjustment in public health and medi\u00ac cal services. . Technical knowledge, surveys and studies exist which, if assembled, ex\u00ac tracted and applied, could provide direction to the provision of health services. There is nation-wide concern about the health picture. Particular communities face crisis situations or recognize the inadequacies of their health systems. The Federal government and national voluntary organizations support research, not only in etiology, prevention, control and cure of disease, and in rehabili\u00ac tation and care of the patient, but in finding better community systems for the provision of health services. In the Cleveland community the health picture was described in March i960 at the time of the reorganization of the Health Council, as follows: \"The health field today is large and complex. Community-wide problems have emerged as an accompaniment to progress. The health problems of today cannot be viewed in isolation; they are inter-related and call for mobilization of professional knowledge and lay leadership to en\u00ac gage in systematized, intelligent and broad gauged community planning. \"In this metropolitan area we are aware of various problems and devel\u00ac opments which call for community-wide planning in the health field. \"The respective roles of voluntary and official health agencies need re-examination. Attention should be given to whether volun\u00ac tary agencies are performing functions more appropriate to offi\u00ac cial agencies and to whether they are challenged to venture into new areas of need beyond the scope of official responsibility. 14 \"Needs of the acutely and chronically ill, of convalescents and terminal cases, call for coordinated community planning on such matters as number and types of beds; in-patient, out-patient, and home patient care; methods and sources of financial support. \"The growth of specialized health funds and programs has resulted from public concern but has created the need for more effective coordination and for examination of desirable approaches to meet new health needs in both service and research. \"The lack of a strong, unified health district in the county has been recognized as a deterent to progress in public health and suggests the need for further community effort. \"Significant gaps in rehabilitation services require community at\u00ac tention . \"Health planning must concern itself with major barriers to health today, including chronic disease and disability (particularly among the elderly) and mental illness and alcoholism. \"Health planning must be cognizant of the total needs of individ\u00ac uals and of the inter-relatedness of health and other services. \"These are community problems rather than ones specific to a single health agency or to a particular professional group.\" As noted in Section A, the Health Council was reorganized to attack problems such as these and to do an over-all planning job. The Health Goals Project evolved as the principal method for undertaking such planning and action. The need for this project has been expressed by the three consultants. Dr. Cecil Sheps, who presented the consultants'1' joint report to the Goals Commit\u00ac tee, wrote in part: \"The aim of the study is important and timely. The heightened appreciation of the role of health services and programs as crucial elements in modern society, the increasing demand for such services, and the radical change in the nature of our leading health problems all bespeak the importance of a thorough review of activities, needs and potential in this vital segment of community life. The multipli\u00ac city of health programs and agencies and the need seen by each of these for larger budgets, underlines the timeliness of this study. \"There is a distinctive aspect of the proposed approach in this study which makes it likely to be of great potential value. This is the high degree to which the key and informed leadership of the Cleveland area, both lay and professional, is ready to explore the difficult fundamental matter of the choices that may be made in the delineation of long-term goals and the allocation of efforts and resources, both physical and human, toward the achievement of these goals. 15 \"The usual approach to planning future community health effort is to lay out what appear to be the next logical steps for each of the programs and institutions already in the field. There can be no doubt that each of these contributes to health improvement. On the other hand, an optimum total health program is probably not develop\u00ac ed by simply adding these individual program elements together. Problems of coordination, duplication, entirely new program needs and also priorities as between all elements in the spectrum, would still remain. \"The plan which is suggested does provide a broad basis upon which health goals for Cleveland can be delineated to meet the objectives listed immediately above. . .\" i6 C. Method, of Procedure The method of this project is essentially one of action research. There are two major aspects of the method which, although described separately, must be seen in combination. These two aspects are: 1) The method by which the ideal health goal is determined, exist\u00ac ing programs are measured against this goal, priorities are selected and implementation achieved. 2) The method whereby the community's decision makers are involved in the process of goal and choice determination, as well as implementation. This is an attempt to integrate study and implementation. Too frequently studies are placed on the shelf because the community's decision makers lack the understanding and commitment necessary to effect their implementa\u00ac tion. This approach is taken with the expectation that at the completion of the study implementation will be assured, and perhaps already begun, because those in a position to effect community change will have been partners in determining what is needed and how change should occur. The premise is that involvement by decision makers in goal and priority determination will re\u00ac duce community barriers to implementation. Without doubt a study to determine a model of a healthy community and to develop a systematic health program could be done more rapidly and perhaps more logically by a study or research team than by a committee. The imple\u00ac mentation phase, however, might take much longer. In the over-all this inte\u00ac gration of study and implementation should result in more rapid and effective progress. There is further rationale for the method proposed for this study, namely, the application of the multidisciplinary approach to community problem solving. Basic to the multidisciplinary concept is the conviction that the subject of study or treatment should be viewed as a whole and that all relevant know\u00ac ledge, from various disciplines, should be utilized in an integrated way. The health goals project is similarly based on the premise that health must be seen as a whole and in the context of total community life; that knowledge about determinants of health and about maximum health achievements must be collected from a variety of appropriate sources, integrated and applied. It might be noted that there has been a tendency in the past to use service pro\u00ac grams as the basis for diagnosing social problems. Treatment of the social problem is then provided by adding to the service program. This cyclical pro\u00ac cess has tended towards perpetuating the usual community health picture which is characterized by a proliferation of specialized agencies. Studies and sur\u00ac veys limited to like type agencies or particular areas within a broad field tend to focus on the problems as seen by those agencies. The solutions tend to focus on adding more resources rather than on any realignment of resources within the broader field on the basis of a rational priority system. Further\u00ac more, it is sometimes difficult to apply new knowledge most effectively in organizations structured around older knowledge systems. Hie method proposed for this study would start with the broad approach so that the specialized areas would be seen in the context of the whole and so that rational choices may be made within the total spectrum. 17 Against this backdrop, a more detailed description of study method and the process of community leadership involvement is presented. 1. Study Method Since the first objective is to develop a model of a healthy community, the committee sought a method whereby the best available knowledge could be col\u00ac lected, assembled, integrated, and applied to one metropolitan community, Cleveland. This community has been studied many times by traditional approaches. (A partial list of studies may be found on page Ij) The proposed approach for this study is a radical departure from the traditional, although it will make use of findings of previous studies. Information will be collected in a series of specific areas and will then be integrated into a model of a healthy community. This model, namely the result of transposing the best available knowledge upon the reality of a metropolitan community,will be the \"health goal\". The extent to which the Cleveland community approximates this goal will be examined. How big a gap exists between present program and goal? What bar\u00ac riers exist and what is their significance in making choices and determining sub-goals? Priorities will then be determined against the goal objective on the one hand and the reality situation on the other, with a series of criteria which will, in turn, suggest the timing and means of implementation. The procedure will be as follows: l) The Committee, with Consultant Team advice and staff assistance, will select the list of specific areas, starting with the more obvious and adding to the list through study and deliberation. This is the first order of business. Areas will vary in type and may total 30 to ko. The system recognizes two extremes, or poles, in the health field, a negative pole of extreme disability, social isolation, and untimely death, and a positive pole of maximum functioning, physical, emotional, and intellectual. Health services and a community health system must be concerned with both poles, retarding movement towards the negative and assisting movement toward the positive. At the various points between the two extremes, appropriate programs should be pro\u00ac vided which include prevention, treatment, restoration and education. The system provides, therefore, four major categories as follows: 18 I. Prevention of onset of disease or injury. II. Recognition and early treatment of disease or injury. III. Prevention of disability, social isolation, or untimely death. IV. Human development. Within each major category are sub-categories with further sub\u00ac divisions as needed. (The outline is appended to this Section C on Method. It is incomplete at this date. It will remain subject to revision as needed, and it is planned to delay final determination of sub-categories in Section IV, Human Development, pending further deliberation and the results of some experience in the first three areas.) 2) Specialized consultants (professionals of recognized competence) will be chosen by Consultant Team and committee. Each will be asked to develop a statement, or position paper, in the area of his specific competence and covering the subject area delineated for him. The paper will cover programs and resources needed by a community. It will take into consideration the situation in Cleveland, as exemplified by specific information collected and presented to the specialized consultants by the study biostatistician. Each specialized consultant will be asked to review his paper with Cleveland colleagues, following which he will submit his statement as part of total data collected for the project. The contributions of local colleagues will constitute supportive data. In addition, health organizations and professional personnel will be invited to submit proposals for committee consideration. Experiences from other communities will be contributed on a selective basis by the project statistician or as part of the position paper. A draft of a letter to be sent specialized consultants (appended with the outline at the end of this section) indicates what the consultants will be asked to do and what the committee expects the position paper to be. The specific assignment to each consultant will, of course, be developed and reviewed with him. 3) The committee, with Consultant Team and staff help, will be responsible for integrating the assembled data (position papers) into a model of a healthy community. The essence of this will be the Health Goal. Care will be taken to assure that the model or health goal will be formulated in terms comparable to those anticipated for the evaluation of the existing health status and health services. This is essential because a subtraction of the existing situation from the theoretical health goal must be possible, in order that the \"gaps\" may be appropriately identified and sub-goals established. 4) The committee with Consultant Team and staff will look at the Cleveland situation, as a whole and in specific areas, to determine the degree to which the existing situation approximates the goal. This examination will include: I. Health Status of the Community In measuring the health status of the community, greatest attention will he directed toward collection and utilization of existing local data. In those areas where local data are found to he deficient, estimates will he attempted hy one or more of the following techniques: 1) Application of estimates of prevalence rates known to the appropriate state and federal agencies. 2) Complete review of medical literature for estimates of prevalence. 3) Through utilization of known morbidity-mortality relationships, local mortality data will be demo- graphically analyzed to determine implications of these data as the community health status. In those areas where the techniques outlined above do not pro\u00ac vide adequate estimates of the health status of the community, these deficiencies may well he considered as potential sub- goals in the over-all plan. II. Existing Status of Health Services The primary method of carrying out the identification, description, and evaluation of existing health services will he a detailed analysis of these services, covering the areas of concern listed below. The project statistician will he responsible for the identification, description and analysis of data, Wherever possible, recently completed, or updated descriptions and evaluations of services will be utilized. (See Section I.) Where existing data are inadequate, they will be collected by staff personnel or the Welfare Federation Research Depart\u00ac ment. Evaluation of services to the extent necessary will be done by professional personnel, whose qualifications and back\u00ac grounds enable them to understand the problem and to evaluate adequacy and quality of services. All governmental and volun\u00ac tary agencies known or thought to be providing health services will be included. The precise information to be obtained will be worked out by the study group but will include,where neces\u00ac sary, the following areas of concern: 1) The type of services being rendered. 2) The qualifications of the personnel providing the service. 3) Quality of service being provided. In most instances this will have to be inferred from the qualifications of the personnel providing the service, but in other instances will re\u00ac quire professionsl judgment from members of the study group. 20 4) The segment of the population receiving the service. 5) Agency policies concerning eligibility for the service. 6) Financial resources of the agency. 7) Policies of the agency governing fees for service. 8) Policies concerning inter-agency cooperation and systems of referral for additional services. 9) Relationship of the agency to other governmental agencies and voluntary agencies providing health services. 10) The quantity of the service being provided and its adequacy with relation to the existing and potential need for services. 11) Future plans for the agency in relation to mainten\u00ac ance and expansion of services and the development of new services. 12) Problems being faced by the agency in relation to the provision of adequate facilities, equipment, and personnel to provide high quality service. 13) An estimate of the extent to which the lay and professional community are aware of the services being provided by the agencies. III. Existing Status of Environmental Health Hazards and Services for their Control The staff personnel will put together a picture of the environ\u00ac mental health program as it now exists in Cleveland, utilizing existing records available in a variety of agencies in the Cleveland Metropolitan Area, agencies at the state level having responsibility in this area, such as the Ohio Department of Health, and surveys which have been recently conducted or which are in the process of being conducted, such as the \"Lake Erie Comprehensive Water Quality Management Study.\" The environment\u00ac al health picture will, of course, include an estimate of the existing situation relative to programs for the provision of safe and sanitary food, milk and water; will also include such important areas as radiation, air pollution, accident preven\u00ac tion, housing and similar areas. It is anticipated that adequate data exists to formulate a picture of the environ\u00ac mental health status, but if necessary,a detailed analysis of one or more facets of the problem will be made by consultant personnel employed for this purpose. 5) Utilizing the above information, the committee, Consultant Team and staff will identify the nature and size of the gap between situation and goal. This will take into account specific areas of study, as well as the whole community health situation. This identification will include, but not be limited to: 21 a) The degree to which existing services approxi\u00ac mate (in quality, quantity and clientele served) the services recognized as significant goals. b) The factors which limit full utilization of ex\u00ac isting services and which, through adjustment, could lessen the gap between situation and goal, such as problems of interagency communication, cooperation, and referral, or problems of admin\u00ac istration and finance. c) Areas of duplication and over-lapping of services, and areas in which functions of agencies could be changed to meet changing conditions. d) Segments of the population not being adequately served (i.e. by age group, geography, socio\u00ac economic status, diagnosis). e) Areas of significant imbalance in the community health picture, for example, where dollar input achieves minimal results, where lack of facili\u00ac ties of one type creates over-utilization of in\u00ac appropriate facilities, where significant health programs have been overlooked because of apathy or insufficient knowledge. f) Areas in which quality or quantity of services are inadequate. g) Factors which have contributed to inadequate pro\u00ac vision of services such as lack of personnel, financing, community planning, administration. 6) The committee, having identified gaps, will determine needs and establish need priorities; namely, what is needed to fill the gaps between situation and goal and the relative significance of the various needs. This will provide the committee with a series of sub-goals rated according to significance. Related to this would be an examination of barriers to goal achievement and an assessment of the significance of such barriers with respect to possibilities for their removal or the need for adjustment to them. 7) Implementation priorities will be established by the committee, based upon the above. The priority system for implementation will take into account goal and sub-goal objectives, barrier significance and any other factors relating to need, effectiveness, feasibility, readiness and strategy. Consideration will also be given to organi\u00ac zational responsibility for implementation; namely, the community organizations which should appropriately be expected to implement particular priorities. 22 2. The Process of Community Involvement Implementation of the plan is essential. Implementation means change. The change involved in re-structuring a community's health system is of such mag\u00ac nitude and complexity as to require the best possible application of community organization methodology. The other aspect of the project method, therefore, is to apply and test commun\u00ac ity organization method, or aspects of it, in a situation composed of two high\u00ac ly complicated variables, namely a large urban community (Cleveland), and a large social phenomenon (health). The particular aspect of community organization which the project seeks to test, because it is inherent to the project itself, is the process by which lay and professional leadership of a community can be involved in the conduct of a com\u00ac munity study, the nature of such involvement, and the results of such involve\u00ac ment in effecting community change. Furthermore, the intention is to seek ways whereby the members of this leadership committee can effectively relate to their own formal and informal reference groups, and to examine the effect of such in\u00ac teraction upon study findings and program implementation. Opportunities will be sought to stimulate the leadership group, not only through the battery of consultation service already described, but through encouraging local organiza\u00ac tions and professional personnel to submit contributions. There will also be interaction between this project and other activities of the Health Council and Welfare Federation. It will be significant to observe the degree to which this leadership group is a factor in developing and sustaining such interaction on a positive basis. For example, can the leadership group influence the direction of other community activity so that it does not run contrary to the project goals as these emerge? References to the Welfare Federation, the Health Council, and the Goals Commit\u00ac tee in the body and Appendix of this application are to give some assurance that this process of community leadership involvement has a favorable prognosis, and that the Health Goals Committee is composed of community decision makers who can effect changes in community health if they so wish. The process of leadership involvement is implied in the foregoing delineation of study method. However, it can be described differently as follows: 1) A community leadership group (the Health Goals Committee whose members' qualifications are set forth in Appendix C) is committed to undertake this task and has already been involved through development of the project plan. It was appointed by, is re\u00ac sponsible to, and has the backing of a larger group, representa\u00ac tive of formal health organizations (the Health Council, see Appendix B), which in turn is a part of and has the support of the Welfare Federation, (Appendix A). Thus the area of influence, formal and informal, is widespread. 2) The central decision making group for the project is the Health Goals Committee; the working group is the Steering Committee. Consultants bring to the committee competent knowledge of content and advice on procedures. Staff brings technical assistance of two kinds, skill in assembling data for committee use (biostatis\u00ac tician) and skill in community organization method (community 23 organization staff.) Consultants and staff sub-serve the committee. This procedure is a departure from the usual one whereby a survey team makes the study and submits its findings for committee approval. Here the committee makes the study, as well as assumes responsibility for developing and implementing recommendations. 3) Because this procedure is unusual (namely, one whereby a community leadership committee undertakes a project of this magnitude), the plan provides for careful observation and recording of the process itself. Record will be kept of such matters as reactions to various aspects of procedure and content, evidences of cooperation or lack of cooperation, evidences of change during the process. Such observa\u00ac tion and recording will provide documentation of process, the means for evaluation of the method, and an opportunity to modify procedures if and when the situation demands new approaches. 24 8) The committee will then decide upon the method of implemen\u00ac tation, namely, the respective roles of committee, Health Council, Welfare Federation, organizations, professional groups, etc., in the implementation process, (it should be noted that the plan calls for reporting at various stages to the Health Council, specifically when the Health Goal has been delineated. This procedure is to elicit understanding and support and to identify areas of misunderstanding and lack of support.) 9) Finally, the committee will work, through appropriate channels and the means previously decided upon, for the achievement of the various sub-goals and towards a community health program which approximates the ideal Health Goal to the greatest possible extent. The Health Goal will set the sight for planning. In the years ahead it will require adjustment in order to continue to serve as an ideal as well as a realistic objective. The Health Council Planning Board, through this study project by its Goals Committee, expects to use the project findings as its chief planning guide. The time table for the above cannot be forecast with accuracy, but the pro\u00ac jected schedule is as follows: Step 1. Completed early in 1963, subject to modification, based on e:cperience. (Category IV scheduled for later development). Step 2. Several pilot position papers started by early 1963 and- completed within 6 month period; others in Categories I, II, III started during 1963 and completed during 1963 and 1964; Category IV developed and completed by end of second year. Step 3 Developed during first two years, completed by end of second year. Step 4. Material for special consultants doing pilot position papers to be collected and prepared early in 1963 (with help of the statistician from Ohio Department of Health, if project bio\u00ac statistician not yet available.) Other data to be collected according to phasing of other position papers, to be completed before end of second year. Step 5. Primarily during second year. Steps 6,7j8;9- Concentrated in third year and completed at end of third year. It should be noted that implementation will not occur with such logic as the procedural steps may imply. Some implementation will undoubtedly occur during the course of the project, some will require many years of endeavor. The over\u00ac all and continuing responsibility for implementation and for adjusting goals and priorities rests with the Health Council. However, the Goals Committee has a commitment for project implementation as indicated above and as elaborated below. 25 Appendix to Section C M OUTLINE OF SUBJECT AREAS FOR HEALTH GOALS STUDY For the purpose of this study, health is classified in four major areas or categories and then further subdivided as indicated in this outline. The scheme enables the study group to focus on community health as it can affect functioning and dysfunctioning of people. The four major categories were initially conceived as endpoints, representing severest malfunctioning (negative endpoint) or optimum functioning (positive endpoint). Achievement of health goals by a community was considered, therefore, to call for a plan of action directed towards: I. Prevention of onset of disease or injury II. Recognition and early treatment of disease or injury. III. Prevention of disability, social isolation and untimely death. IV. Human Development (achievement of optimum functioning, physical, emotional and intellectual). These four areas thus became the major categories for study, although later they will be integrated into the model of a healthy community. Sub-categories were developed by tracing back from the endpoints to various identifiable factors which could lend themselves to analysis and to program development. It was recognized that each sub-category of itself, or through further subdivision, should be of a type to enable a specialist to prepare a position paper which would cover known knowledge and the applicability of such knowledge to the Cleveland scene, and would also enable project staff to collect and relate data to the subject of the position paper. In selecting sub-categories, consideration was given to: a) coverage that is, whether all significant health subjects, including diseases, were in\u00ac cluded but without undue duplication; and b) usefulness, that is, whether a particular sub-category would lend itself, in toto or through subdivision, to accomplishing the desired task. It was recognized that the sub-categories in each major category could differ in type. The outline of categories (as developed to date and subject to revision) follows. Position paper assignments are noted. 26 I. Prevention of Onset of Disease or Injury 1. Infections and parasitism (total 3 papers) a.

We hope you will undertake to write a position paper as described below. First, a word about the auspices under which the Project is being conducted and the purpose of the study. The Project is under the Welfare Federation and its Health Council The Welfare Federation is a voluntary federation of 220 private and governmental health, welfare, education, and related non-profit organizations in the metro\u00ac politan Cleveland area. Its major function is the planning and coordination of health and welfare services. The Health Goals Project is a major three-year endeavor to develop the model of a healthy community based on the full application of present knowledge, a model which would seek the most effective balance of health services in a large metropolitan community. The plan, calls for developing a program which we hope will help us take the best that is known anywhere, integrate and adapt it for our community, and then emerge with a set of goals and find a feasible approach to the achieve\u00ac ment of these goals in Cleveland. From the professional point of view, we have been assisted and continue to be guided by a consultant team consisting of Dr. Cecil G. Sheps and Dr. Irvin J. Cohen. We have a formulation for our study of health goals which consists of four categories or types of achievements: I Prevention of Onset of Disease and Injury II Recognition and Early Treatment of Disease and Injury III Prevention of Disability, Social Isolation and Untimely Death IV Human Development (achievement of optimum functioning, physical, emotional and intellectual) These are set forth in greater detail in the enclosed plan. We suggest you refer to the outline which appears on pages 29-3^* We plan to evaluate each major health problem in these terms. This is being done through the medium of a position paper for each such problem area, to be prepared by a special consultant in that field. These position papers will then be assembled by the Project Team into the model. On the basis of this model, the Health Goals Committee will formulate specific objectives for the next decade and plans for their attainment. We would be most grateful if you would undertake to prepare the position paper on _(with notation as to reference source in outline). We are interested in putting the focus on the patient and upon the environment in which maximum health for people can be achieved. With the criterion of making full use of presently available knowledge, we wish 33 Dr. -2- Date to know the elements of an ideal program and the predictability of results from specific efforts. More specifically, we would expect the position paper to cover a) the nature of the problem, b) optimal programs and re\u00ac sources required, and c) predictability of results and the basis for these with reference to successful experience elsewhere. We would then ask you to review your completed paper with a small select group of persons in Cleveland who have special interest and knowledge of the subject. Your paper also will be reviewed with the Steering Committee on the same or a subsequent visit to Cleveland. Our consultant team and study staff will assist you. Our staff is preparing a basic document ''Greater Cleveland and Its Health\", as orientation for con\u00ac sultants and position paper writers. A brief outline of this guide is en\u00ac closed and a lengthy outline of its coverage, from which staff is working, is available. The services of the staff will also be at your disposal for such additional data about Cleveland as you may need. Dr. Sheps (Dr. Cohen) will serve as the liaison with you, interpreting the total project and the scope of your particular paper, and he will be glad to answer any of your questions. He will program our assistance to you and further define our expectations. The names and addresses of staff and consultant team are on the attached sheet. Please feel free to place a collect call to any of them at any time. The Cleveland Health Goals Project is supported by grants from local foundations and from the Public Health Service. There is available for the consultant preparing this paper an honorarium of $ . Also, of course, we shall reimburse you for travel expenses. We are convinced that you are eminently qualified to prepare this paper. We hope you will be interested in doing so and shall appreciate an expression of your interest and the approximate date you may be available. Sincerely, William C. Treuhaft, Chairman Health Goals Committee D. Staff and Facilities Available \u00bb* Since the success of this project depends as much upon the Health Goals Com\u00ac mittee as it does upon staff and facilities, and since implementation will depend upon the continuing interest and support of the groups to which the Goals Committee is responsible, namely 'and in order, the Health Council Plan\u00ac ning Board, the Health Council, and the Welfare Federation Board of Trustees, membership lists of all of these groups are appended.* Staff and Consultants 1.

Consultant Team: to provide continuing consultation for the overall study; to guide the work at all times, supervise the gathering and analysis of data, help develop the agenda for all phases, advise on the selection and assignment of responsibilities to specialized consultants and to biostatistician; and to work closely with Goals Committee and Project Director. The three consultants who assisted the Goals Committee with development of the project have agreed to serve as the Consult\u00ac ant Team (part-time basis), with the Chief Consultant giving more time and carrying more responsibility, including serving as chairman of the team. Since the three consultants are well known and their curricu\u00ac lum vitae readily available, detailed information is not included. All three, however, are engaged in professional work which makes this project of particular interest to them, and all three have demonstrated competence in broad aspects of health. The three are: Chief Consultant: Cecil G. Sheps, M.D., M.P.H. Professor of Medical and Hospital Administration, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 36 Associate Consultant: Irvin J. Cohen, M.D., Executive Vice-President, Maimonides Hospital of Brooklyn, 4802 Tenth Avenue, Brooklyn 19, New York Associate Consultant: William H. Stewart, M.D., Chief Division of Community Health Services, Public Health Service, Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Washington, D.C. (Resigned due to change of position, replacement being recruited.) 3- Research Associate is employed, full time, under the general direction of the Consultant Team with responsibility for collecting, tabulating, analyzing, collating and interpreting pertinent data; end drafting materials and reports for use by the consultants, position paper authors and the committee. Joanne E. Finley, M.S.P.H., M.D., joined the staff on March 1, 1963, as Research Associate for the Project. 4. Community organization worker will serve under the direction of the Project Director, working with lay and professional persons and organ\u00ac izations in the community in a liaison capacity between the Goals Committee and the community. Rilma 0. Buckman, Ph-D-, joined the staff on March 15, 1963, as community organization worker for the Project. 5 Other: 1) Two full-time clerical workers are to be added, a statistical clerk to help the Research Associate, and a general clerical worker 2) Specialized consultants (30-40) will be employed to do specific jobs as indicated (See Method, Section C). 3) The Associate Executive Secretary of the Health Council, Frank Kimber, who has a master's degree in Health Education, is also expected to assist with the project. 4) Research staff of the Welfare Federation, while not available to do major project research, mil be of assistance in providing data. 5) Bookkeeping and other financial matters will be handled by Welfare Federation staff. Facilities The facilities required are office space and office equipment. Provision is made for this in the budget. Plans call for renting space in the building which houses the Health Council office. Participation of Other Agencies The Health Council and the Welfare Federation Board of Trustees have endorsed this project with enthusiasm. In SectionsA and D reference is made to these groups and to appended membership lists. The Health Council (Appendix B) is composed of bo health organizations, tax- supported and voluntary plus members-at-large. Formal liaison with hospitals is provided by representation from the Hospital Council on the Planning Board and by membership of hospital representatives on various committees. The Welfare Federation (Appendix A) is composed of 220 health, welfare, recre\u00ac ation and civic organizations. Its Board of Trustees is representative of these interests and of community leadership. The Health Goals Committee (Appendix C) itself is representative of major seg\u00ac ments of the community, particularly as related to the broad field of health and to implementation of a community-wide health program. Persons were select\u00ac ed because of demonstrated leadership in: higher education, including profes\u00ac sional education; the professions, including organized medicine and dentistry; business, industry and labor; government - municipal, county and state; admin\u00ac istration of health and hospital facilities and civic affairs. The enthusiastic interest of these groups and the opportunity provided by the project for continuous involvement means that there is, and will continue to be, wide participation. The project lias been submitted for information to the Academy of Medicine (County Medical Society), the Cleveland Health Department and the County Board of Health. It is available for submission to other groups and some requests have already been received. All reactions to date are favorable. Drafts of the application have also been submitted to the Ohio Department of Health for review, and conversations with State Health Department officials indicate their interest and approval of the project objective. 38 F. Project Evaluation This project seeks a model of a healthy community, specific to the Cleveland metropolitan area. It seeks this through a method which has two major com\u00ac ponents: a) collection of the best available knowledge about health and its adaptation to the local community situation; and b) a process by which the community, through a group of decision makers, uses this knowledge to set community goals and to work for their achievement. More precisely this means that the factors which determine health, or conversely cause ill health, are identified and described by experts in the health professions, but are trans\u00ac lated into a community health model and are injected into the life of the community by those in the community who are in a position to effect change and elicit support. Such an undertaking does not readily lend itself to precise evaluation. There are, however, a number of measures which can and will be undertaken during the project, at its termination or at later times. These include an examination of the following: 1. Measurable changes in the community's health situation. The project includes provision for examination of the present health situation by the project biostatistician. (See Section C. Method, item 1.4). The Health Council, which expects to use the project findings as its principle guide in on-going community health planning, will require periodic up-dating of the community's health status. This can be provided through the Research Department of the Welfare Federation (whose serv- ' ices are available to the Council), as well as through local and state health departments. Changes in the health situation are measurable. The precise degree to which such changes are attributable to the project are, of course, difficult to measure. However, if changes are consistent with project goals, some positive correlation can be assumed. 2. Delineation of health determinants and its relationship to setting a community health model. The degree to which project method makes it possible to delineate, integrate and use knowledge about what makes or keeps people healthy and what retards, treats or cures illness and disability, can be described and evaluated by the project group or by others in such terms as: a. Was the system by which health was classified and studied (See Section C. Method Item 1.3) effective: 1) In covering significant health areas 2) In providing a useful framework for the development of position papers 3) In providing a useful framework for the collection of local data 4) In preparing and applying a health model? 39 / \\ b. Does the method whereby specialists prepare position papers in areas of their competence provide the community with sound knowledge about health determinants and a solid foundation of knowledge for a) integration into a master goal and b) application in service programs, as judged by: 1) Formulation of a goal inclusive of all significant aspects of health? 2) Acceptance by professional colleagues, project group, community and others? 3) Change in the community's health picture in a manner consistent with goal? 4) Consciously directed community health planning consistent with goal? c. Does the knowledge of health determinants challenge or sub\u00ac stantiate existing health programs and in what respects, such as: 1) Types of programs and program emphases 2) Allocation of resources 3) Training of personnel 3. Evaluation of project method in terms of acceptance of findings Assuming that there is a relationship between project method and community acceptance and that, therefore, the project method can be evaluated, at least in part, by getting evidence of community acceptance, evidence such as the following will be ascertained: a. Evidences of acceptance or non-acceptance (formal and informal action) by: . Project group (committee, consultants, staff) . Health Council and its Planning Board . Welfare Federation (various segments of) . Health organizations . Other significant community groups . Health and related professions Of the conclusions and decisions made with respect to: . Health determinants in various areas as presented in position papers . The Health Goal and sub-goals . The present health situation . Gaps between situation and goal . Need priorities and barriers to change . Implementation priorities ko b. Evidences of change in the community health situation (by one or more organizations) In direct and positive response to project findings and recommendations . In a manner consistent with project findings In a manner inconsistent with or in direct opposition to project findings c. Evidences of reaction to project findings by individuals and groups outside the community, particularly health professions, health organizations and planning groups. 4. Estimate of significance of community leadership involvement In Section C. Method #2, the plan for community leadership invo3.ve- ment is described. At the conclusion of the project, the actual involvement can be described and an assessment made of the signi\u00ac ficance of such involvement (or lack of it), in light of the assumptions made in the plan. It Is proposed that this be done through the following means, although further consideration of methods of evaluating committee process is contemplated. a. Subjecting staff records of the project, and any other data, to objective analysis b. Staff assessment of project results (i.e. acceptance of find- ings by particular community groups) in light of roles played by committee members within the project group and in communi\u00ac cation with outside groups. c. Consultant Team description and evaluation of committee role and its effectiveness. d. Project group's own assessment of its role and effectiveness in light of concrete evidences of success or failure. The measures planned to date, plus others which will develop., should provide objective evaluation to the degree possible in this type of project. Such evaluation will be valuable to the community, and specifically to the Health Council and The Welfare Federation, as a guide to other endeavors directed twoards effecting community change. Groups outside of the Cleveland community will be encouraged to make use of the project findings and evaluation. Of particular interest should be evidences of the degree to which a community can strengthen its planning efforts by setting goals first and in light of the best available knowledge, and of using this type of study method to establish and achieve goal objectives. The ultimate test of project value will not be evidenced, in all probability, for a number of years. Then it will be assessed in terms of whether it con\u00ac tributed in any observable and significant way, to the improvement of health in this community. kl G. Project Continuation As Indicated in previous sections, this project is part of a continuing process thereby the Health Council plans and works for improvement of health programs in the greater Cleveland area. The three-year project to determine goals, develop a program, and begin implementation repre\u00ac sents a new approach toward a concentrated effort in this on-going pro\u00ac cess. The project itself has been carefully planned and is expected, to be com\u00ac pleted within the three-year period for which funds are requested. Special areas needing further study or demonstration may be identified, or the findings may suggest other developments which Cleveland should take. If so, these would be developed as separate, although related, projects and special financing would be sought if necessary. I. Supporting Data and Other Information 42 1. Financial support The total grant needed is $200,000 for three years, of which $75;000 is requested from the Public Health Service. $125,000 was requested from local foundations, and has been approved.

Other funds ($125,000) are available from local foundations. The purpose is to provide, through action research, the means by which a group of the community's decision makers can develop community acceptable health goals and a model of a healthy community, identify and reduce gaps between present situation and goals, establish priorities, and set into motion a program of implementation. Health is broadly viewed, including out-of-hospital programs for the chron\u00ac ically ill and aged. The model is to be developed by applying to the local situation all available, pertinent knowledge about health determinants and achievements. The process calls for skilled application of community organ\u00ac ization methodology. The study is a departure from the traditional in that it starts with goal formulation and development of a model, is a total approach covering all aspects of health in a metropolitan community, utilizes a new system of classifying health areas, provides for substantial involvement of commun\u00ac ity leaders and extensive use of consultation service. The health picture, nationally and locally, challenges communities to find better community health systems. This project is such an endeavor. 1 4 THE WELFARE FEDERATION lAe tw/< 1001 HURON ROAD 781-2944 CLEVELAND 15, OHIO Bringing together more than 200 organizations for community planning in health, welfare and recreation Fred M.

Barry, Executive Secretary Frank Kimber, Associate Executive Secretary October 25, 1963 Dear Dr. Shank: While I do not like to continually ask you to make substitutions for pages in the study \"The Cost of Health Care in Greater Cleveland,\" I have found an error, at least in emphasis, in calculations previous\u00ac ly worked for me, from which the Summary of the whole document was prepared. Therefore - please remove your pages 38 and 39 and substitute the en\u00ac closed. You will also want, in order to make page numbers accurate, to delete the #42 at the bottom of the Appendix face page, and num\u00ac ber the Footnote pages 41 and 42. We still emerge with a picture of health care financing in Cuyahoga County that is certainly different from that of the generalised U. S. Our private sector of total expenditures is substantially larger, and the public sector less. This has been sharpened, clarified and ana\u00ac lyzed in more depth in the enclosed pages. Thank you for your forbearance. Sincerely, JEF/mm For clarity of text also please: a) on page 12 - line 3 - delete \"of 147\u00bb\" b) p. 15 - next to last line of inset paragraph add \"such form of health or hospitalization insurance.\" A RED FEATHER SERVICE SUPPORTED THROUGH THE UNITED APPEAL enc. WELFARE / FEDERATION MEETING HUMAN NEEDS FOR -I Joanne E. Finley, m/S.P.H., M.D. /Research Associate Health Goals Project 2 October 25, 1963 p.S. I would also like you to know that I have asked responsible officials of the Ohio State Department of Health to check over for me data from which I compiled tables on p. 26 and 27 of the study you originally received from me. For example, there is indicated a Cuyahoga County General Health District per capita health appropriation of $4.07. This is a figure that is considerably higher than the probable per capita. You will receive corrected tables when this work has been completed for me in Columbus. JEF SUMMARY CUYAHOGA COUNTY SHOWS A PATTERN OF EXPENDITURES FOR HEALTH AND MEDICAL CARE DIFFERENT IN CERTAIN WAYS FROM THAT OF OTHER PARTS OF THE NATION. Figure V-9, the table accompanying it, and other sections of this study, demonstrate certain things: . Private Expenditures - It has been estimated that Cuya\u00ac hoga County families, with 1960 wages, spent $200 million for personal health care and insurance premiums. Thus, out-of-pocket private expenditures accounted for 88.8% of the total \"health dollar,\" but in the whole U.S. they accounted for 78.6% of all expenditures. Another portion of the private sector - insurance bene\u00ac fit payments to hospitals accounted for 23.7% of total private expenditures in Cuyahoga County in 1960, but in the nation in 1961, 18.2% of private expenditures for medical care represented insurance benefits for hospital care. 8/ Medical care costs have risen steadily in the United States. Cleveland is no exception. It has been shown in this study that certain components of medical care costs to metropolitan Cleveland consumers may be some\u00ac what higher than they are in other major cities. Hos\u00ac pital daily service charges are a probable example. In Cleveland, as elsewhere, certain population groups spend more than the average 6% of their annual outgo on medical care. It is also a national truism that these same segments of the population spend rela\u00ac tively more on hospital bills. If so, Cleveland*s older population, retired workers and some low income families may be \"doubly hit.\" . Private Philanthropy contributed to the purchase of health care and services for Greater Cleveland's citizens in a proportion of total expenditures that was only slightly less than that estimated for the U.S. as a whole. . Public Expenditures - If the private sector carries a substantially greater proportion of expenditures for health care in Greater Cleveland than is true for the U.S., public expenditure must be relatively less. Figure V-9 demonstrates relative tax support of health care in Cuyahoga County to be about one-half that esti\u00ac mated for the nation. Ohio receives as much federal assistance to public health programs as do comparable states, but the pattern of public health financing is such that much of the balance of public monies is more likely to depend on local rather than state tax funds (see p. 19). 38 If the proportion of total expenditures that is tax funds is less than that of the U.S. as a whole, it would automatically follow that the percentage of all expenditures represented by various programs within the public sector, would be less. This is demonstrated in the Table accompanying Figure V-9. However, within the public sector, what other features may be noted that set Cuyahoga County apart from U.S. patterns? 7, Distribution of Total Public Expenditures of Certain Programs of Health Care Cuyahoga County U. S. Estimates 1960 for Fiscal Year 1963 General Medical and Hos\u00ac pital Care 55.0% 49.07, Public Assistance (all med\u00ac ical vendor payments) 23.7 18.5 Further, of the $7.9 million expended from public assistance programs in Cuyahoga County in 1960, somewhat over $6 million or at least 3/4 was spent for hospital care.* An analysis of U.S. - wide patterns of spending for medical care under public assistance programs in Table 14 of the valuable source - boon Medical Care Financing and Utilization (HEW) \u2014' . demonstrates a division that is about 367, for hospitalization and 107, each for physicians' services and drugs and supplies for example. Figure V-8 has demonstrated that the sources of funds for health care programs under public assistance in Cuyahoga County in 1960 were: 187, local tax funds, 457, state, and 367, federal funds. In the U.S. estimates for 1963, figures appear for all medical vendor payments under public assistance programs that show support equally divided (50-50) between federal, and state and local tax sources. 23/ Of the $15.9 million of Cuyahoga County public funds spent in 1960 for general medical and hospital care, $13.8 million or about 877, went to hospital care. It is not possible to draw a comparison with nation-wide patterns, but again the emphasis appears to be heavily on hospital care. With these comparisons between metropolitan Cleveland and the whole nation in mind, the following probabilities emerge: * Payments to hospitals under public assistance programs are not fcfeg only financial support tendered hospitals by the County. Since 1958, each year the County appropriates about $3 million from its General Fund to meet the net deficit of Cleveland Metropolitan General Hos\u00ac pital (County). It is obvious that much of this must, in effect, pay for hospital care of medical indigents who are not otherwise covered under public assistance mechanisms (p.32). This is an exam\u00ac ple of the need to clarify the basis upon which the costs of hospi\u00ac tal care of the indigent are to be met. 39 - . The private consumer in Greater Cleveland pays more in dollars for his personal medical care than the average U.S. consumer. This is also demonstrated between Cleveland and Detroit and Pittsburgh (Tables V-9 to V-12 in Appendix I.) Certain segments of the Cuyahoga County consuming population pay a greater percentage of their annual outgo for health care, but this, coming out of lower incomes, represents fewer dollars per individual. . A greater proportion of private expenditure appears to be represented in hospitalization insurance bene\u00ac fits in Cuyahoga County than in the U.S. as a whole. This may also affect the area's employers. That they are likely to be the purchasers of the insur\u00ac ance from which these benefits derive is demonstrated by a study of several employee health insurance pro\u00ac grams under collective bargaining agreements. Parti\u00ac cipation in greater Cleveland by employers was a con- kj sistent feature, and covered from 50-1007., of the cost. . While the proportion of total expenditures for health care represented by the private sector in Cuyahoga County is greater than the nation's, the public por\u00ac tion is half that of the country as a whole. In addi\u00ac tion, in certain segments of the public sector, there appears to be an increasing reliance on local tax support as against state assistance. . In the public sector, as in the private, there is some evidence that local financing goes to the support of hospital care to a greater degree than it does in the nation as a whole. This may infer gaps in care. There are clearly groups who cannot privately afford comprehen\u00ac sive care. In addition, those who do purchase health care privately appear to have had a greater proportion of their expenditure shifted to hospitalization. The financing emphasis for the publicly assisted person in need of medical care is also heavily on hospitalization. This could mean, in both groups, less spent for pre\u00ac ventive care, early treatment or some rehabilitation services. It is a major premise of Public Health that, unless disease and disability is prevented or reduced in all persons in a population, the apparently healthy are not adequately protected. It is a further premise that early diagnosis and treatment reaching the largest possible numbers affected, represents eventual economy. It can be as simple as the preservation of working and earning capacity of a family head vs. the assumption by the public of his long term care as an indigent. Finally, if both public and private financing have, in the main, supported the hospitalization or emergency care portion of the health care spectrum, rather than pre\u00ac vention, early treatment or rehabilitation, one may rightfully ask to what degree this earlier neglect contributes to the increasing cost of -- and need for -- hospitalization and the cost of the insurance that supports this form of care. - 40 - Table to Accompany Figure V-9 (In Millions of $) CUYAHOGA COUNTY (1960) % of Total 23/ U.

You may expect to receive the secticn \"General Characteristics of Greater Cleveland\" with a wealth of mapped demographic material shortly. Sincerely, e E. Finley, Research Associate, Health Goals Project JEF/jg The Cleveland Experience Medical care costs in Cleveland have climbed higher and faster than any other item in the consumer price index \u2014 from 95.0 in 1947 to 185.8 at the end of 1962. This is an increase of 95.6%, or nearly 12 per\u00ac centage points ahead of the national trend. All consumer prices for moderate income families in Cleveland have risen steadily since the mid 1940's. Rents increased sharply beginning in the early 1950's, but appear to have levelled off after 1958. Medi\u00ac cal care has continued to climb. (Table V-2, Figure V-l).

Two qualifications must, however, be considered: Pittsburgh's rate of increase was the greatest, 200% from 1956 to 1962 for all types of rooms. But in the year 1956, the reported room charges in Pittsburgh, in dollars, were the lowest of the three cities, and while they in\u00ac creased greatly by 1962, they are still lower than room rates in Detroit and Cleveland. One must also consider the fact that Cleveland's hospital costs are part of an increasing trend in that city toward \"semi-inclusive rates\". These may be fixed for a set number of days and then decreased, or decreased after the first day by a fixed amount. Such rates include many specified special services that have become routine procedure in hospitals, and may be billed elsewhere as additions to room, board and general nursing. Several Cleveland hospitals estimate special services 4/ to be 30% of the reported charge. Thus, while we can demonstrate that, of all components of the medical care index, hospital costs in Cleveland have risen by far the most of any health item which a family may have to buy, we cannot ascertain with certainty whether being sick in a hospital costs a Clevelander a great deal more than it does in Detroit or Pittsburgh. Examination of Table V-4 leads to the conclusion that certain costs of professional services have increased. No consistent pattern emerges between the three cities in the rates of change in these costs. As of 1962, however, house visits were considerably more expensive in Detroit, but appendectomies cost more in Cleveland. -9- Having a baby in all three cities now \"costs more\", but appears to be least expensive in Detroit and to cost the most in Pittsburgh. There is indication that certain dental services cost somewhat more in Cleveland in 1962. The overall percent increase in dental services is not as great in the three cities as it was for the nation as a whole. (Table V-l). Before 1960 the drugs priced in the survey cities were originally a small list of such items as an APC tablet, a narcotic prescribed as a cough remedy and a prescription for buffered penicillin. In the opinion of dispensing pharmacists and other professionals, this list did not seem adequate to represent the type and kind of prescriptions most frequently purchased. In 1960 the list was then considerably extended. The new specifications for pricing are now based on a sur- 5/ vey of the frequency of prescriptions by therapeutic end-use. Now priced are typical prescriptions within each of the following categories: anti-infectives (antibiotic and anti-spasmodics; and anti-arthritics. The examination of the average annual prices of these categories of drugs, especially prepared for the Health Goals Project, by the Cleveland Regional Office of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, reveals that, while there are wide fluctuations between years, both upward and downward, in each of the three cities, no marked difference in the price experience can be noted between them. One cannot make a case for stating that a drug purchaser in any typical prescription category found it necessary to pay more in Cleveland than in the two other comparable cities. -10 Hospital and surgical insurance has been priced somewhat differently by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, than have other items. Because of the variations from city to city in benefits provided by prepaid plans, the same specifications cannot be used in each city. Therefore, health insurance prices are collected from one major source only, and the type of service priced is the most widely held certificate in force in the specific city at the time of pricing. Because the BLS prices for average annual health insurance premiums are not available, it is more difficult to estimate the possible increase in the cost to families in Cleveland, and comparable cities, of their insurance. Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio estimates a family-group, semi-private hospitalization (120 days) plus $200 surgical allowance policy to have cost $108.00 annually in 1956 and $182.40 in 1962. This is an increase of 68.9%, while semi-private hospital room rates increased 44.1% in this same period. Insurance Coverage 6/ A personal expenditures study made by the BLS in 1960 does give us evidence that 8 out of every 10 families in Cleve\u00ac land are covered by some form of hospitalization or medical care insurance. An earlier wage survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that, as of September, 1960, 78% of office workers and 827. of plant workers in Cleveland had hos\u00ac pital insurance. About 80% of both groups were covered by some form of surgical insurance, 50% had some coverage for physicians' non-surgical services rendered in hospitals. Only 38% of office workers and 15% of plant workers had insurance beyond these types.2/ While insurance coverage of 80% of a sampled population in Cleveland does mean that a good portion of the employed population is assisted in meeting personal health care costs by insurance, this probably represents -11 method. The Cuyahoga County General Health District also provides services by contract to 25 Boards of Education. There are four municipalities in Cuyahoga County, plus the city of Cleveland, maintaining independent municipal health departments - Shaker Heights, Cleveland Heights, East Cleveland and Lakewood.* Table V-15 CUYAHOGA COUNTY HEALTH DISTRICTS 19/ TOTAL LOCAL BUDGETS - 1962 Citjr City of Cleveland Cuyahoga County (contracting cities) Cuyahoga County (Gen.

The purpose of this letter is to confirm this arrangement and to send you further information about the Project. First, a word about the auspices under which the Project is being conducted and the purpose of the study. The Project is under The Welfare Federation and its Health Council. The Welfare Fed\u00ac eration is a voluntary federation of 220 private and governmental health, welfare, education, and related non-profit organizations in the metropolitan Cleveland area. Its major function is the planning and coordination, of health and welfare services. The Health Goals Project is a major three-year endeavor to develop the model of a healthy community based on the full application of present knowledge, a model which would seek the most effective balance of health services in a large metropolitan community. The plan calls for developing a program which we hope will help us take the best that is known anywhere, integrate and adapt it for our community, and then emerge with a set of goals and find a feasible approach to the achievement of these goals in Cleveland. From the professional point of view, we have been assisted and continue to be guided by a consultant team consisting of Dr. Cecil G. Sheps and Dr. Irvin J. Cohen. We have a formulation for our study of health goals which consists of four categories or types of achievements: I Prevention of Onset of Disease and Injury II Recognition and Early Treatment of Disease and Injury III Prevention of Disability, Social Isolation and Untimely Death Human Development (achievement of optimum functioning, physical, emotional and intellectual) m jW- MEETING HUMAN NEEDS WELFARE FEDERATION A RED FEATHER SERVICE SUPPORTED THROUGH THE UNITED APPEAL Dr. Robert Shank -2- July 12, 1963 r These are set forth in. greater detail in the enclosed plan. We suggest you refer to the outline which appears on pages 25-30. We plan to evaluate each major health problem in these terms. This is being done through the medium of a position paper for each such problem area, to be prepared by a special consultant in that field. These position papers will then be assembled by the Project Team into the model. On the basis of this model, the Health Goals Committee will formulate specific objectives for the next decade and plans for their attainment. We are delighted that you will undertake to prepare the position paper on \"Nutritional Deficiencies and Abnormalities with emphasis on \"Prevention of Disease or Injury\" (l 2). We are interested in putting the focus on the patient and upon the environment in which maximum health for people can be achieved. With the criterion of making full use of presently available knowledge, we wish to know the elements of an ideal program and the predictability of results from specific efforts. More specifically, we would expect the position paper to cover a) the nature of the problem, b) optimal programs ana resources required, and c) predictability of results and the basis for these with reference to successful experience elsewhere. We would then ask you to review your completed paper with a small select group of persons in Cleveland who have special interest and knowledge of the subject. Your paper also will be reviewed with the Steering Committee on the same or a subsequent visit to Cleveland. Our consultant team and study staff will assist you. Our staff is preparing a basic document \"Greater Cleveland and Its Health\", as orientation for consultants and position paper writers. A brief outline of this guide is enclosed and a lengthy outline of its coverage, from which staff is working, is available. The services of the staff will also be at your disposal for such additional data about Cleveland as you may need. Dr. Sheps will serve as the liaison with you, interpreting the total project and the scope of your particular paper, and he will be glad to answer any of your questions. He will program our assitance to you and further define our expectations. The names and addresses of staff and consultant team are on the attached sheet. Please feel free to place a collect call to any of them at any time. The Cleveland Health Goals Project is supported by grants from local foundations and the Public Health Service. There is available for the consultant preparing this paper an honorarium of $500-00* Also, of course, we shall reimburse you for travel expenses. In accordance with usual practice, position papers will become the property of The Welfare Federation. However, permission can be given for publication with appropriate reference to the Health Goals Project. We are pleased that you will be working with us on this project. William C.
