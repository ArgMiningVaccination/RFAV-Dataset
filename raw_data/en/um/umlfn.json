Men C, PCV, Hib Suspension fluid - Fluid (water, saline, tissue-culture mixture) Preservatives, stabilisers, antimicrobial agents - Trace amounts used to stabilise vaccine - May cause allergic reactionVaccine Components Adjuvants - Aluminium salt used to increas e immunogenicity of vaccines containing inactivated micro- organisms or their products e . g . Hepatitis B vaccine Tetanus toxoid Diphtheria toxoidVaccine Failure Primary - Inadequate immune response to vaccine (e.g.MMR1) - Infection possible any time post vaccination Secondary - Adequate antibody response immediately after vaccination - Level of antibodies decrease with time - Booster doses usually required - Feature of many inactivated vaccinesTime intervals between vaccine doses Antigen combination Recommended minimal interval between doses 2 killed antigens No minimum interval Killed and live antigens No minimum interval 2 live antigens Four-week minimum interval if not administered simultaneouslyTime intervals between vaccine doses 2 Live vaccines - Minimum one month interval required - Allows each immune response to develop - Diminishes immune interference Interval between doses - Allows the next response to be a true secondary response - i.e. faster and bigger and with higher affinity IgGTime Interval between vaccine doses Exceptions include - Yellow fever and MMR Ideally separate by 1 month as may be suboptimal response to both if given together. - Rotavirus no interval needed Anytime before or after other live vaccine - Influenza and PCV vaccine in those aged 12- 23 months separate by at least 1 week due to slight increased risk of fever if given together Can vaccines overload the immune system? The human body is composed of 10 trillion cells and contains 100 trillion bacteria On average there are - 1000 bacteria on each cm2 of skin - 1,000,000 bacteria on each cm2 of the scalp- 100,000,000 bacteria per gram of saliva The maximum number of antigens in a vaccine was ~3000 (DTwP, most from wP) With the new vaccines this number is much lower still No evidence that vaccines can overload the immune systemAdverse Events Live vaccines: Frequency of adverse events falls with number of doses If antibody is made -> neutralises small amount of vaccine virus in any subsequent vaccine dose E . g . M M R Inactivated vaccines Frequency of adverse events increases with number of doses Good antibody levels ->good secondary immune response May be inflammatory (i.e. produce a sore arm) E.g. tetanus, pertussisHerd Immunity Only applies to diseases which are passed from person to person For each disease - a certain level of immunity in the population which protects the whole population because the dis ease stops spreading in the community Provides indirect protection of unvaccinated as well as vaccinated individuals. May be the most important aspect of how vaccines work - MMR given to infants protects pregnant women from rubella. - Can eradicate disease even if some people remain susceptible "}
