Herbal Pharmacological Categories Help Reveal Novel Molecular Mechanisms of Pain Disorder Subtypes 100 Pages Posted: 2 Oct 2018 [More...](javascript:void(0);) Abstract Chronic pain is highly prevalent and poorly controlled, of which the accurate underlying mechanisms need be further elucidated. Herbal drugs have been widely used for controlling various pain disorders. The systematic integration of pain herbal data resources might be promising to help investigate the molecular mechanisms of pain phenotypes. Here, we integrated large-scale bibliographic literatures and well-established data sources to obtain high-quality pain relevant herbal data (i.e. 426 pain related herbs with their targets). We identified three distinct herb categories with their specific indications of symptoms, targets and enriched pathways, which were characterized by the efficacy of treatment to the chronic cough related neuropathic pain, the reproduction and autoimmune related pain, and the cancer pain, respectively. We further detected the novel pathophysiological mechanisms of the pain subtypes by network medicine approach to evaluate the interactions between herb targets and the pain disease modules. This work increased the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of pain subtypes that herbal drugs are participating and with the ultimate aim of developing novel personalized drugs for pain disorders.
