Well-care visits enable your doctor to monitor your baby's growth and provide needed vaccinations, while giving you the opportunity to have any questions answered. During baby's first year, well-baby checkups are recommended at months 1, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12. Tracking Your Baby's Growth During each checkup, your pediatrician will weigh and measure your baby. The doctor will measure your baby's length and head circumference and plot the measurements on a growth chart. Y our baby's growth chart can provide a general picture of how your baby is developing physically. Y ou can compare your baby's measurements to those of other children the same age and sex through percentiles on your baby's chart. % %Understanding Percentiles Percentiles included on your baby's growth chart provide a basis for comparison to others in your baby's \"peer group. \" The higher your baby's percentile number, the bigger your baby is compared to other babies the same age. If your 3-month-old is in the 60th percentile for weight, that means 60 percent of 3-month-olds weigh the same or less than your baby, and 40 percent weigh more. But don't get too hung up on your baby's percentiles. A lower percentile doesn't mean there's anything wrong with your baby. What's important to remember is that your doctor is watching how your baby grows over time, not just how big she is. Well-baby checkups are recommended at months 1, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12.Your Baby's First Year - Pediatric Care Schedule How Babies Grow Babies tend to grow in unpredictable spurts. Some months, it may seem they are growing a lot. Other months, they may grow only a fraction of what they normally do. While your doctor will make note of individual peaks and valleys, the focus will be more on your baby's overall pattern of growth. Your Baby's Physical Exams In addition to measuring your baby at each well-care visit, your pediatrician will give your baby a complete physical at each appointment. Y our doctor will closely examine your baby's: Heart and lungs - using a stethoscope to listen for any abnormal heart rhythms or breathing problems. Eyes - checking for signs of congenital eye conditions, discharge and other problems. Ears - looking for signs of infection and observing how your baby responds to sound. Mouth - looking for signs of thrush (an oral yeast infection) among other things. Head - checking the soft spots (fontanels) and the shape of your baby's head. Body - checking your baby's reflexes and muscle tone, and examining the skin for jaundice, rashes and birthmarks. Belly - making sure the umbilical cord stump has fallen off and the belly button is healing well. Pressing gently on the abdomen, your doctor will also check for a hernia or any enlarged organs. Genitals - checking for signs of infection. If your baby is a boy, the doctor will see if his testes have descended into the scrotum. If your son was circumcised, the doctor will check his penis to make sure it's healing well. Hips and legs - moving your baby's legs around to look for problems in the hip joints.Vaccines Vaccines protect against serious illnesses ranging from polio and tetanus to measles, mumps and the seasonal flu. Injectable vaccines are normally given in a baby's leg using a thin pediatric needle to minimize any pain. One vaccine is given by the mouth without a shot. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the following schedule of vaccines, which is endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians, and is designed to give children the best protection against disease as early and safely as possible.

But there are some exceptions: A child who is moderately or severely ill on the day of vaccinations might be asked to come back for them at a later date. Any child who had a life-threatening allergic reaction after getting a vaccine should not get another dose of that vaccine. Tell the person giving the vaccines if your child has ever had a severe reaction after any vaccination. A child who has a severe (life-threatening) allergy to a substance such as latex should not get a vaccine that contains that substance. Tell the person giving your child the vaccines if your child has any severe allergies that you are aware of. A child with an immune deficiency might not be able to receive certain vaccines.Enjoy the Process Y our baby's first year is the busiest, by far, in terms of checkups and immunizations.
