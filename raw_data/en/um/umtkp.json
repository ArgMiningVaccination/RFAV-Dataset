HPV Vaccine Health Service carries Gardasil, one of two vaccines currently licensed for use against the human papillomavirus (HPV), the common virus that causes genital warts and cancer of the cervix, anus and throat. The Centers for Disease Control recommends vaccination for people up to the age of 45. In(Flu)enza Vaccine Information UPDATE 21-Jan-21: For up-to-date information please visit the University [website](https://coronavirus.tufts.edu/FluShot). Flu clinics are held every October, specific dates TBA. Seasonal influenza vaccines are available to students at Health Service at no cost and while supplies last. Flu season usually begins in October and can last through May. The university will be sending communications with details. Why should you get vaccinated every year? - The flu is an unpredictable virus, more serious than the common cold that can lead to complications such as pneumonia and bronchitis or make chronic health problems worse. - Flu viruses are constantly changing and so does the vaccine formulation. The more students get vaccinated the less flu there is to be spread within the Tufts community. - Seasonal influenza vaccines are recommended every year for all Tufts University students. Even generally healthy people can get the flu but students with any chronic illnesses, such as asthma, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, etc., are considered to be at high risk for complications of influenza. Where can I get vaccinated? - Tufts Health Service advertises flu clinics once our annual supply is received. - Come talk to us about getting your flu vaccine outside of Tufts Health Service or check with your insurance company by calling the number in the back of your insurance card. - If you have [Student Insurance](/health-insurance/student-health-insurance)you can visit a [Walgreens](https://www.walgreens.com/storelocator/find.jsp?tab=store+locator&requestType=locator)or a [CVS Pharmacy](https://www.cvs.com/store-locator/store-locator-landing.jsp?_requestid=3535057).

Cost of Immunizations Many major medical insurance policies reimburse for standard immunizations from your primary care physician but may not reimburse for vaccinations given at Health Service so it is important to check with your insurance company before getting a vaccine through us. Most insurances policies do not cover the cost of travel-related immunizations. The cost of immunizations varies -- some are inexpensive and others are costly. Our [business office](/health-insurance) can tell you how much the immunizations you need will cost. If you decide to receive an immunization at Health Service, and you have private insurance the charge for the vaccine will be put on your tuition bill. Please note, student insurance covers the cost of most immunizations. Travel immunizations, tend to be excluded from most insurance plans. You may download your statement on the [Patient Portal](https://tufts.medicatconnect.com/).
