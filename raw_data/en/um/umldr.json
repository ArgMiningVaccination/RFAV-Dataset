See you there! *A brief store tour at the end of the experience will involve going up and down one flight of stairs Testimonials \"I learned a lot and the sensory componant (being able to taste some items and smell/handle more items) makes Traditional Chinese Medicine accessible to the novice and shows that it is more diverse than commonly believed. I am glad I went and it is worth the price. It is a lot more \"hands-on\" than the initial description would suggest, and that was the \"fun\" part. It also demythologized and did a lot to dispel stereotypes about Chinese Traditional Medicine.\" -Laura \"The chance to see a new place - one that's well known and used by many but not part of my own experience\" -Ann \"I got the chance to learn a few things about Chinese medicine, that I didn't know\" -Kimberly \"Getting to know (smell, touch, was great.
