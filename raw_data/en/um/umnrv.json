We will create an account for you with our Patient Portal, and you'll receive an email to activate your account. From the Patient Portal, you will be able to fill out the following forms to speed up the appointment process: New Patient Forms Medication List Medical Records Release Form In-Network Insurance: Starting in 2022, we will no longer be in-network with any insurance, but we will be courtesy billing your insurance for the visit for you to be re-imbursed for our services (based on your plan's out-of-network coverage) FAQs What should I expect from a visit? A visit to a Naturopathic Doctor, or ND, will be similar to a visit to your family doctor. Your first visit will take approximately an hour, maybe a little longer. During this time, a very thorough history is taken, including questions about diet, lifestyle, stress, and environmental exposures. Next, the ND will perform an appropriate physical examination, which may require laboratory tests. Naturopathic Doctors treat the whole person, which means they consider a variety of factors before they diagnose and treat an illness. Does a Naturopathic Doctor provide Primary Care? Yes, a Naturopathic Doctor has been trained to provide Primary Care. We can diagnose, treat, order labs and imaging, and provide referrals to a specialist if needed. Do you accept insurance? Effective 2022, we will no longer be in-network with any insurance companies, but we do courtesy bill your insurance. Payment for the visit is due at time of service, but any payment your insurance company covers will be refunded to you. Can you prescribe medications? Yes, licensed NDs can prescribe the majority of medications in Oregon. The exclusion would be for some chemotherapeutic drugs and some anti-psychotics. Can you work with my current Primary Care Provider (PCP)? Yes, we have many patients that continue to see their current PCP due to insurance coverage, and we provide further education in diet, lifestyle and nutritional supplementation. How is Naturopathic Care different from the care I get from my medical doctor? NDs work to find the cause of disease, instead of just treating the symptoms. We look at what is missing from the foundations of health such as diet, exercise, stress management, as well as at any environmental or genetic influences on your health. We opt to use natural substances such as herbs, vitamins and minerals, and homeopathics before the use of pharmaceutical drugs.
