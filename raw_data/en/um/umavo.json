Great insight from the [Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network (DCVMN)](https://ch.linkedin.com/company/dcvmn?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card_reshare-text) on the benefits of Micro Array Patches: This innovation is cost-effective, safe, easy to distribute and requires less training to administer. The lower level of pain and lack of needle could also reduce vaccine hesitancy and encourage uptake. [Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance](https://ch.linkedin.com/company/gavi?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card_reshare-text) and its partners, [World [Bill & Epidemic Preparedness Innovations)](https://no.linkedin.com/company/cepivaccines?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card_reshare-text), GHIC, and BARDA have funded the development of this technology to date. Together we are calling for investments to fund pilot-scale manufacturing facilities to accelerate its availability. 1,152,184 followers 1/5th of the world's children aren't vaccinated for measles, but a breakthrough innovation could help change that - a virtually painless stick-on patch. By eliminating the fear of needles, blood, and infections, patches could change vaccine delivery, especially for children. That's not the only benefit: since patches don't need to be refrigerated, they'd be more accessible to low-income countries, and they would reduce medical waste. https://n.pr/3oY94Lo Thanks very much to [Brian Gormley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-gormley-5144685?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text) at [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-wall-street-journal?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text) for highlighting Micron's recently extended Series A funding, our positive measles and rubella vaccination results from the first clinical trial of [#microarray](https://www.linkedin.com/signup?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fmicroarray&trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text) injection-free [#vaccine](https://www.linkedin.com/signup?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fvaccine&trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text) delivery in [#children](https://www.linkedin.com/signup?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fchildren&trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text) and the opportunity to solve the 'last mile' challenge of delivering vaccines.

Needle-free vaccine technology has the potential to transform immunization, especially in lower-income countries: These vaccine patches are lighter, more temperature-stable and easier to administer than syringes. In one technological leap we could overcome many barriers that prevent us from reaching hard-to-reach populations, both in lower-income countries and in future pandemics.
