Symptoms often start near midnight, and may wake the person up. Bryonia This remedy can be indicated when the rash is slow to appear, and the chest is congested with a painful cough. The person's head hurts when coughing, and everything feels worse from motion, making the person want to stay completely still. Chills and shivering often come with fever, but warmth can make things worse. The person's mouth may be very dry, with a thirst for long cold drinks. Euphrasia When this remedy is indicated during measles, the eyes are swollen, streaming, and very sensitive to light. The tears can irritate the face, and the person's nose may run with a bland and watery discharge. Headache may intensify with fever. The person has chills, feels worse from warmth, and prefers to stay in a darkened room. Pulsatilla This remedy is often indicated when the rash is slow to develop and the symptoms of a cold are prominent. A stuffy nose producing yellowish mucus, a gagging cough (most often dry at night and loose in the morning), and plugging or inflammation in the ears are common. The person does not feel very thirsty, is worse from warmth and stuffy rooms, and improves in open air. People who need this remedy often want a lot of comforting and attention. (Pulsatilla is a very useful children's remedy.) Other Remedies Belladonna Fever that comes on rapidly, with a red flushed face, hot skin, dilated eyes that are sensitive to light, and a throbbing headache that is worse from jarring are all indications for this remedy. The rash is red and may be hot to touch. Many children needing Belladonna have nightmares during fever and talk or cry out when apparently asleep. Gelsemium A drowsy, lethargic feeling with fever, droopy eyes, and shaking chills running up and down the spine are strong indications for this remedy. The rash is itchy, hot, and dry. A headache that begins in the back of the head and neck is often seen when Gelsemium is needed. Kali bichromicum When this remedy is indicated in measles, cold symptoms worsen over time. Hoarseness, coughing up of stringy yellow mucus, earache, and sticky eyes may be seen. Symptoms can be worse in the morning, and the person feels best from staying in bed and keeping warm. Rhus toxicodendron An extremely itchy rash that feels better from applying heat may indicate a need for this remedy. The person is very restless, and may feel driven to get up and pace. Stiffness may be felt in all the muscles of the body, worse at night, from lying still in bed, and on waking in the morning. The person may have chills along with fever, and all symptoms are improved by warmth and motion. [] Dosage Homeopathy Dosage Directions Select the medicine that most closely matches the symptoms. In conditions where self-treatment is appropriate, unless otherwise directed by a physician, a lower potency (6X, 6C, 12X, 12C, 30X, or 30C) should be used. In addition, instructions for use are usually printed on the label. Many homeopathic physicians suggest that medicines be used as follows: Take one dose and wait for a response. If improvement is seen, continue to wait and let the medicine work. If improvement lags significantly or has clearly stopped, another dose may be taken. The frequency of dosage varies with the condition and the individual. Sometimes a dose may be required several times an hour; other times a dose may be indicated several times a day; and in some situations, one dose per day (or less) can be sufficient. If no response is seen within a reasonable amount of time, select a different medicine.

Measles must be diagnosed and treated by a medical doctor.Measles is a contagious viral illness most often affecting children. Early measles symptoms resemble a common cold, with weakness, mild fever, watery eyes, a dry or hacking cough, and eyes that are very sensitive to light. Over the next few days, the fever rises and little white spots like grains of salt show up on the inner surface of the cheeks. On the fourth or fifth day, a blotchy pink rash breaks out\u2014first on the face and neck, and later spreading to the chest and abdomen. Homeopathic remedies can be useful to soothe the fever and discomfort and to help recovery. Rarely, serious complications develop from a case of measles. If fever is very high or a painful pounding headache appears, if the cough is very painful with breathing problems, or if the person seems extremely ill in any other way, consult a doctor immediately.
