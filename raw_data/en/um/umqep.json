I have also come across patients of allergies and so thought that it is necessary to throw some light on the topic and see the scope of Homeopathy. Homeopathic treatment has shown very good results in immune system disorders and in allergies immune system is disordered and so Homeopathic medicines have a very big scope to help these people suffering from food allergies. Food allergy is an immune system reaction that occurs soon after eating a certain food. Even a tiny amount of the allergy-causing food can trigger signs and symptoms such as digestive problems, hives or swollen airways. In some people, a food allergy can cause severe symptoms or even a life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis. Symptoms - Food allergy symptoms usually develop within a few minutes to two hours after eating the offending food. The most common food allergy symptoms include: Tingling or itching in the mouth; Hives, itching or eczema; Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat or other parts of the body; Wheezing, nasal congestion or trouble breathing; Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting; Dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting. In some people, a food allergy can trigger a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. This can cause life-threatening symptoms, including: Constriction and tightening of airways; a swollen throat or sensation of a lump in throat that makes it difficult to breathe; a severe drop in blood pressure; rapid pulse; dizziness, lightheadedness or loss of consciousness; Emergency treatment is critical for anaphylaxis. Untreated, anaphylaxis can cause coma or even death. In food allergy, the immune system mistakenly identifies a specific food or a substance in food as something harmful. The immune system triggers cells to release antibodies known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) to neutralize the culprit food or food substance (the allergen). The next time you eat even the smallest amount of that food, the IgE antibodies sense it and signal your immune system to release a chemical called histamine, as well as other chemicals, into your bloodstream. These chemicals cause a range of allergy signs and symptoms. Common Foods allergies are to: Eggs, Milk, Dairy, Nuts, Peanuts, Tree nuts such as walnuts and pecans, Wheat (gluten), Shellfish, such as shrimp, lobster and crab, Fish etc Causes: there is increased risk of food allergies if asthma, eczema, hives or allergies such as hay fever are common in one's family; If one is already allergic to one food, there is increased risk of becoming allergic to another; Food allergies are most common in children, especially toddlers and infants. From observation it has been presumed that the factors probably responsible for the allergy response to develop, are mental stress; improper treatment of various day to day problems with medicines which do not cure but suppress the diseases; by medicines which have many side effects; self medication; vaccinations; use of preservatives in food; etc. Diagnosis: There's no standard test to confirm or rule out a food allergy. Keep a food diary of food eaten. A skin prick test and a blood test to measure immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. However, these blood tests aren't always accurate. Treatments: The only way to avoid an allergic reaction is to avoid the foods that cause signs and symptoms. However, despite best efforts, one may come into contact with a food that causes a reaction. Common medicines used in modern medicine for allergies are - Antihistamines, corticosteroids, immunotherapy [allergy shots] and they come with their side effects so they cannot be continuously taken for long period. Many people with severe allergies carry an epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen, Twinject, Auvi-Q) to prevent anaphylaxis. According to modern medicine there is no cure to this problem. Homeopathic treatment has successfully removed food allergy in many people. Homeopathic medicines are extremely safe, have no side effects, does not try to suppress the symptoms, but rather normalizes the disturbed immune system. In food allergy the immune system is disturbed and so it is not able to tolerate the substance which is 'normally harmless' to the body and so the treatment should be directed to bring the immune system to normalcy and not to suppress the expressions of immune system [symptoms of allergy]. Homeopathy makes the immune system healthy so it does not react to such harmless nutritious food items and also strengthen the immune system during the course of treatment. Homeopathic medicines can be taken by anyone from a new born to an old age for any and every kind of disease. We have seen 'Allergies' go away in patients and we are confident that homeopathic medicines can help patients with different kinds of food allergies mild or severe. Homeopathic medicines are not simply prescribed on the diagnosis of 'food allergy', but we as a homeopathic practitioner take a detailed history of the patient which includes past sufferings, family hereditary diseases, patients personal details, mental emotional state, etc. by doing this we are able to understand the health status and functioning of the body, constitution of the patient. Then a homeopathic medicine is prescribed. Homeopathic medicines do not counteract with any other medicines so the patient may take homeopathic medicines along with their other medicines depending on the intensity of allergy. The duration of treatment from our experience we can say it is anywhere between 12 months to 3 years or more depending on individual patient. If the patients give proper detailed history, if they follow the instructions given and if the medication is continued for the time period specified by us, then Homeopathy can surely help getting rid of the problem of food allergy.
