Here are some exercises to try!", "sitename": "Vosges Haut-Chocolat", "date": "2022-07-01", "cleaned_text": "It may come as a surprise that the energy in our bodies does not belong to us. It comes directly from the earth's magnetic field. We are so much more than our physical bodies and thus, it is important to remember that our spiritual life force needs attention for us to feel fully fed and nourished. When we require energy healing, which is also sometimes called energy medicine, there are exercises and items we can turn to right in our own spaces. While it is a blessing to have a Shamanic practitioner or healer to work with, it is also true that you already have many of the tools you need to practice energy medicine within yourself. Here are just some of the ways you can practice energy healing on your own. Crystals Heal Relying on crystals is an energy healing technique that's been around for thousands of years. Crystals can be used effectively to target physical, emotional and spiritual challenges. They draw out impurities and bring positive energy. Meditation Heals For thousands of years, meditation has been a part of energetic healing practices. All over the globe and in every culture, there are mantras and moments of silence, meditations, and murmurs sent into the ether in quiet prayer. Hands Heal Everyone's hands carry an electromagnetic charge, and thus our palms have subtle energy. This can be felt when they \"turn on,\" becoming tingly, warm, or cold. We can use our hands to pinch, twist, tap and massage specific energy points. Nature Heals We can gather healing energy by being in nature. Taking a walk or sitting amongst the trees, camping overnight or experiencing the dawn, all bring energy from the ground to us and, with it, healing. Exercise Heals Using exercise as a means of healing does not mean a sweaty, out- of- breath you (though it can if that is what feeds your soul). Simply bringing the energy of the earth up into your body, starting with the wiggling of your toes, can activate healing. Move every part of your body as the energy flows upwards. Twist your hips, shrug your shoulders, move your jaw, and blink your eyes. Full participation brings collective healing. Balance Heals Balancing ourselves is a way to reground our bodies and minds and correct any negative energy surrounding us. Create two triangles with your body by standing with your feet apart and your hands above your head stretched out to the sky. Hold this position and count to ten. As you do, relax your mind and still the chatter in your head. Repeat this until you feel relaxed. Then take five deep breaths. Inhale in and out slowly and feel your body in balance, above and below. Sound Heals Sound healing works on vibration. Everything is vibration and you can tune your body like you tune an instrument. Different instruments are set to certain frequencies. Sound healing allows your body to heal itself by slowing down your brain waves, and shift the gears from disease to ease. Reiki Treatment For those who are not familiar with Reiki treatment, it is a form of energy healing treatment that uses hand healing technique. This kind of physical therapy applies similar principles of removing blocked energy as acupuncture or acupressure. The Reiki practitioner uses Reiki energy or healing touch to improve the flow of energy and eliminate negative energy. And of course... Delicious Heals Using cacao in its purest form, eliminating dairy and focusing on superior sourcing are just some of the ways we produce [luxury chocolates](https://www.vosgeschocolate.com/) with healing benefits. That way, you experience all the raw cacao benefits, which is one of the foods that is good for your brain. And if you were wondering, is chocolate good for your heart? The short answer is yes. Here are some of our tastiest and most healing treats. By combining science and nutritional value with emotional and visceral value, we have created truly transcendent chocolate.
