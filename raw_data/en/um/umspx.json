We are dedicated to preventing illness, and empowering individuals to live healthier lives. We offer integrative medicine to patients who are coping with and healing from chronic illnesses, and to people who want to lead a healthy lifestyle and maintain well-being. Studies have proven that worry and stress, especially about things out of our control, can cause both physical and emotional problems that exacerbate health issues in patients who are facing life-threatening or chronic illness . Integrative medicine combines modern science, psychology, nutrition, and exercise physiology to enhance the natural healing capacities of your body and mind. Our full range of complementary therapies supports traditional medicine and teaches patients to harness their own healing power to improve their quality of life. Preventative integrative medicine is also a highly effective way to maintain health and strengthen the mind/body connection. In both situations, the resulting self-care is a key element to well-being. To create a comfortable, calming, soothing environment, we worked with a Feng Shui consultant, used low VOC paints, and installed a sophisticated heating/cooling system for superior air quality. Mind, body and even the environment, come together to foster healing at the Wellness Institute.Mind/Body medicine combines conventional medical treatment with an awareness of how behavior and attitude can affect health. The diagnosis of an illness can be overwhelming and stressful, affecting a person mentally, physically and spiritually. Our program is designed to supplement medical treatment by helping the participant cope with the stress of illness and make informed choices about treatment. You will understand the link between stress and physical/emotional problems and learn to use positive thoughts and beliefs to foster new behaviors and attitudes that will encourage healing. You'll develop skills to help you incorporate mind/body principles and practices into your life. Better nutritional management will put you on track for healthy eating and our therapists will help you identify the physical activity most beneficial to your circumstances. Each course consists of six weekly group sessions, 90 minutes in length. An initial medical evaluation is necessary and is covered by most insurance providers. Following the evaluation, course leaders tailor a program specific to your needs. During the program, your other healthcare providers and physicians will be aware of your progress as well as any issues of concern.
