Biden President of the Senate Washington, DC 20510 Dear Mr. President: January l 0, 2017 I am writing to transmit the Statistical Programs of the United States Government: Fiscal Year 2017 report, which is required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The report can be found atwww.WhiteHouse.gov /sites/defaultlfiles/omblassetslin{Ormation and regulatory affairs /statistical-programs-201 7.pdf, a published print copy of the report will follow. The data produced by our Federal statistical sources provide critical support for policymaking , program management , and evaluation. By placing evidence-driven decisions at the heart of its agenda, the Administration is underscoring the role that Federal statistics play in the policymaking process. As the Administration aims to tackle longstanding challenges in an era of scarce resources, it is especially critical that support for these relevant, accurate, and objective data is reflected in budgetary decisions. Having access to quality, unbiased data allows the Federal Government to make reasoned, disciplined decisions about where to target our resources to get the biggest possible return on our investment. The share of budgetary resources spent on supporting Federal statistics is relatively modest, but that funding is leveraged to inform crucial decisions in a wide variety of spheres. The 128 statistical programs described in this report are \"building new knowledge \" in support of the Administration's evidence-building efforts. These agencies support the use of evidence in decision making through a range of activities, from setting national benchmarks through official Federal statistics to performing the cost-benefit analyses used for policy making, budget planning, and evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal programs. In this constrained fiscal environment, 31 percent of the statistical programs described in this report were appropriated at least 5 percent less funding than was requested in the President's FY 2016 budget. Similarly, actual funding in FY 2015 decreased at least 5 percent for 28 percent of statistical programs, compared to requested amounts. To accommodate reduced funding levels while preserving core information products, these programs have trimmed or postponed statistical activities, and have cut staff hiring and training. Should these cuts continue, agencies' long-range plans for modernizing Federal statistical programs to improve the accessibility and timeliness of information may be adversely affected. i The Office of Management and Budget looks forward to working closely with the Congress to build a 21st Century system of statistical measurement for our Nation and to preserve the availability of relevant, accurate, and objective data on which Americans depend to inform their decisions.

This report fulfills a responsibility of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3504(e)(2)) to prepare an annual report on statistical program funding. The annual report provides Congress with a consolidated source for key budgetary and programmatic information about the Federal statistical system. The report has four chapters. Chapter 1 discusses the value of Federal statistics, describes the structure of the Federal statistical system, and provides a summary of the budget for statisti - cal programs, including purchases and reimbursements, for fiscal years (FYs) 2015 to 2017. Chapter 2 provides details about principal statistical agency programs, highlights the effect of congressional action on FY 2015 and 2016 budget requests, and identifies major program changes planned for FY 2017. Chapter 3 describes other significant statistical programs of Federal agencies and identifies major program changes anticipated in FY 2017. Chapter 4 describes ongoing efforts to maintain and improve Federal statistical programs, including the development and periodic revision of statistical standards and guidelines, selected inter - agency initiatives to improve the quality and usefulness of the Nation's statistical products, and various collaborations among Federal statistical agencies to promote efficiencies in sta-tistical production. The appendices include information on the staffing levels for the principal statistical agencies and a list of acronyms and websites for departments and agencies featured in this report. This report is available in electronic form. The electronic version can be accessed on the Inter - net through the OMB website: www.WhiteHouse.gov/omb/inforeg_statpolicy/. Users also may access editions of the Statistical Programs report from prior years. Suggestions to improve the electronic accessibility of this report may be sent to BlueBook@omb.eop.gov.

Mancini, Deputy Administrator, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Bud - get, Washington, D.C. 20503. 1 CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL STATISTICAL SYSTEM AND STATISTICAL PROGRAM BUDGETS This chapter describes the value of Federal statistics as a public good, the structure of the Fed- eral statistical system, and the budget for major Federal statistical programs for fiscal years (FYs) 2015 to 2017. It highlights the effects of congressional action on the President's FY 2016 budget request and anticipated differences in proposed funding for FY 2017. The chapter concludes with a description of statistical work performed by agencies on a reimbursable basis and agency purchases of statistical services and products. 1 THE V ALUE OF FEDERAL STATISTICS The Federal Statistical System engages in a wide variety of evidence-building functions . These functions include the collection, compilation, processing, analysis, and dissemination of data to create general purpose, policy- and program-specific, and research oriented sta-tistics and datasets. They also include program evaluation, performance measurement, and public health surveillance. 2 The share of budget resources spent on supporting Federal statisti- cal activities is relatively modest\u2014about 0.04 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in non-Decennial Census years and roughly double that in Decennial Census years. Yet, the evidence produced by Federal statistical programs provide critical support for both public and private-sector policymaking, program management, and program evaluation. A sense of this value can be obtained in some instances by comparing the dollars spent on providing key statistics to the dollars that such statistics drive in the economy and society. For example, the prices and cost-of-living programs of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) \u2014in-cluding the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Producer Price Index, the Consumer Expenditure Survey, and related activities\u2014had an estimated budget authority of $213.5 million enacted for FY 2016. 3 Output from the CPI component of the program is used for annual cost-of-living adjustments to payments for retirees and other beneficiaries under Social Security. Social Se-curity provided $74.7 billion in benefits to 60.5 million people in May 2016. 4 Eligible Social Security payments remained unchanged in January 2016, based on no cost-of-living adjust-ment in 2016 due to no increases in 2015 CPI data. 5 Annual changes in the CPI also affect changes in commercial and residential rents, public and private-sector wages, and components of the Federal income tax code. Reports of monthly changes in the CPI are a major input for Federal Reserve Board decisions in setting short-term interest rates and to financial decisions throughout the public and private sectors. 1 The FY 2017 budget information described here is drawn from the President's budget as submitted to the Congress and does not reflect actual appropriations. 2 Evidence-building functions described in this report also include the following statistical activities: the planning of statistical surveys and studies, including project design, sample design and selection, and design of questionnaires, forms, or other techniques of observation and data collection; training of statisticians, interviewers, or data processing personnel; publication or dissemination of statistical data and studies; methodological testing or statistical research; data analysis; forecasts or projections that are published or otherwise made available for government-wide or public use; statistical tabulation, dissemination, or publication of data collected by others; construction of secondary data series or development of models that are an integral part of generating statistical series or forecasts; management or coordination of statistical operations; and statistical consulting. 3 See www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/documents/general/budget/CBJ-2017-V3-01.pdf 4 See www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/stat_snapshot/index.html 5 See www.ssa.gov/news/press/releases/#/post/10-2015-1 . 3 Some statistical programs provide foundational evidence to inform policymakers and the public about the social and economic health of the Nation, States, Tribes, territories, and lo - calities. For example, the Bureau of Economic Analysis provides estimates of GDP not only for the Nation each quarter, but also for these smaller geographies each year. The Census Bureau's American Community Survey provides critical economic, social, demographic, and housing information for every community in the U.S. every year. The information is used to help determine how more than $400 billion in Federal and State funds are distributed each year by helping to plan community development projects, target programs and services, and inform transportation planning. 6 Other statistical programs provide empirical evidence for developing and evaluating Federal, State, Tribal, territorial, local, and private-sector programs. For example, the American Hous-ing Survey, sponsored by the Office for Policy Development and Research in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and conducted by the Census Bureau, provides valuable data on housing conditions and housing finance which inform housing policy. The Fatality Analysis Reporting System of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration collects data about every fatal motor vehicle crash in the nation to provide an overall measure of highway safety, to identify areas of concern, and to help provide an objective basis to evalu - ate the effectiveness of motor vehicle safety standards and highway safety programs. Still other statistical programs provide estimates of key variables for essential social science research that then informs the public and policymakers. For example, the National Long Term Care Survey, funded by the National Institute on Aging, produced unexpected findings of declining disability rates for older Americans over time, which have had implications for un-derstanding work-to-retirement transitions and the need for medical care for the elderly. The National Crime Victimization Survey of the Bureau of Justice Statistics enables researchers to estimate the likelihood of victimization by rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, theft, household burglary, and motor vehicle theft for the population as a whole as well as for segments of the population, such as women, the elderly, members of various racial or ethnic groups, city dwellers, and other groups. Federal statistics yield relevant, accurate, and objective information upon which government and private decisions are made. Absent the Nation's relatively modest investment to produce Federal statistical products, both public and private decision makers would have significantly less quantitative evidence on which to base their choices. THE STRUCTURE OF THE FEDERAL STATISTICAL SYSTEM The U.S. has a highly decentralized statistical system, spanning 128 agencies7,8 spread across the Government, all of which are engaged, to some degree, in conducting statistical activities. Principal Statistical Agencies A Federal statistical agency is an agency or organizational unit of the Executive Branch whose activities are predominantly the collection, compilation, processing, or analysis of informa - 6 See www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs. 7 This count is based on current records, and may not reflect newly emer ging statistical programs that meet inclu - sion criteria described in this section, and of which we are not yet aware. 8 Compared to the FY 2016 report, this volume omits one Federal agency (Maritime Administration of the Depart - ment of Transportation) that no longer meets the inclusion criteria of $500,000 in estimated or direct funding for sta - tistical activities in the forthcoming or either of the past two fiscal years. Two additional agencies (Chief Evaluation Office of the Department of Labor and Corporation for National and Community Service) have been added. 4 tion for statistical purposes.9 A substantial portion of our official statistics is produced by the 13 agencies that have statistical work as their principal mission. Excluding funding for the Decennial Census ($1,0293 million requested for the Decennial Census for FY 2017), ap- proximately 39 percent ($2,5157 million of the $6,4868 million total proposed for FY 2017 in the President's budget request) of overall funding for Federal statistical activities provides resources for these 13 agencies. The principal statistical agencies are: Bureau of Economic Analysis; Bureau of Justice Statistics; Bureau of Labor Statistics; Bureau of Transportation Statistics; Census Bureau; Economic Research Service; Energy Information Administration; National Agricultural Statistics Service; National Center for Education Statistics; National Center for Health Statistics; National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (of the National Science Foundation); Office of Research, Evaluation and Statistics (of the Social Security Administration); Statistics of Income (of the Internal Revenue Service). Other Statistical Programs of Federal Agencies The remaining 61 percent of total resources allocated to statistical work in the U.S. gov - ernment supports some 115 programs in the Executive Branch that represent a broad set of centers, institutes, and organizations that conduct a variety of evidence-building functions including program evaluation, research, data collection, policy and program analysis, and the provision of external funding and other support. These statistical programs are components within a Federal department or other agency. There are other Federal agencies whose statistical activities are excluded from this annual compilation because they are not part of the Executive Branch. These agencies include the Congressional Budget Office, which develops and applies projection models for the budgetary impact of current and proposed Federal programs; the Federal Reserve Board, which compiles the widely used Flow of Funds report and other statistical series, and periodically conducts the Survey of Consumer Finances; and the Government Accountability Office, which uses statistical data in evaluations of government programs. The Office of Management and Budget In addition to other responsibilities under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) coor - dinates the Nation's decentralized Federal statistical system. The 1995 reauthorization of the PRA of 1980 and other legislation give OMB the authority to approve all agency information collection requests, including all those for surveys and other statistical information. OIRA's Statistical and Science Policy (SSP) Office, headed by the U.S. Chief Statistician, promotes the quality of Federal statistical and scientific information that facilitates evidence-based poli \u00ad cies and programs To achieve this goal, SSP coordinates the activities of the Federal statistical system to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of the system, as well as the relevance, ac - curacy, objectivity, and confidentiality of information collected for statistical purposes. 10 SSP accomplishes this by establishing statistical policies and standards, identifying priorities for improving programs, evaluating statistical agency budgets, reviewing and approving Federal 9 Title V of the E-Government Act of 2002. Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act (CIP- SEA), PL 107-347, Section 502(7). 10 The work of Federal statistical agencies is guided by Statistical Policy Directive No. 1: Fundamental Respon\u00ad sibilities of Federal Statistical Agencies and Recognized Statistical Units (www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-12-02/ pdf/2014-28326.pdf), which is consistent with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics of the United Nations Statistical Commission, adopted January 29, 2014 by the United Nations General Assembly (with sponsorship by the U.S.), and reflects long-standing, established U.S. Federal law, regulations, policy, and practice. 5 agency information collections involving statistical methods, and coordinating U.S. participa - tion in international statistical activities. The U.S. Chief Statistician also promotes integration across the Federal statistical system by chairing the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy (ICSP)11, whose 13 member principal statistical agencies span 9 cabinet departments and 2 other agencies (denoted by underlined and italicized entries in Table 1). Some of these agencies report directly to the secretary or other high-level official of their cabinet department; others are one, two, or even more lay-ers further down in the hierarchy. Several of these agencies have Federal-State cooperative statistical programs that produce some of the Nation's most important statistics, such as na - tional birth and death rates from vital records maintained by State registrars and estimates of employment from wage records maintained by State employment security offices. ICSP began operating informally in the late 1980s and was authorized by statute in 1995. As required by the PRA, the U.S. Chief Statistician's office annually issues this report. It also prepares the chapter, \"Strengthening Federal Statistics,\" in the annual Analytical Perspec\u00ad tives volume of the President's budget. That chapter provides a cross-cutting analysis of the budget requests for the principal statistical agencies. Additionally, over the past several years, SSP has collaborated with OMB's Office of Economic Policy to prepare two other chapters in Analytical Perspectives that also feature official Federal statistics: \" Social Indicators\" and \"Building the Capacity to Produce and Use Evidence.\" 12 AN OVERVIEW OF STATISTICAL PROGRAM BUDGETS Statistical programs differ in organizational structure and in the means by which they are funded. Some statistical programs, such as those producing labor force or energy statistics, are carried out by principal statistical agencies (BLS and EIA, respectively). For the major - ity of principal statistical agencies, funding is a line item in the President's budget. In other cases, agencies have statistical programs that support their program planning and evaluation functions, or that are an outgrowth of their administrative responsibilities. In these cases, the budget for statistical activities is included in the total appropriation for that agency, including an allocation of the salaries and operating expenses for the statistical program. In addition, a statistical program is not always executed by the agency that sponsors it. In these instances, the work is done on a reimbursable basis by another Federal agency; a State, Tribal, or local government; or a private organization under contract. In some cases, funding for statistical activities may increase or decrease as a result of the cyclical nature of surveys. Such increases or decreases should not be interpreted as changes in agency priorities, but rather as the normal consequences of the cyclical nature of the pro-grams. Agencies also experience increases or decreases in their budgets because they conduct one-time surveys or studies in a particular fiscal year. In other cases, changes in an agency's funding for statistical activities can affect which surveys an agency maintains in its portfolio, the breadth of topics and the sample size of a particular survey, and the accuracy and precision of statistical aggregates estimated from data. This section describes direct funding, reimbursements, and purchases of Federal statistical activities in FYs 2015 to 2017. This description is limited to agencies that have direct funding for statistical activities of at least $500,000 in FY 2015 or estimated direct funding for statisti - cal activities of at least $500,000 in either FY 2016 or FY 2017. Using these criteria, the report includes the budgets for statistical programs and activities for 13 principal statistical agencies and 115 other agencies (inclusive of organizational units that in official nomenclature are 11 See Chapter 4 for more information on the ICSP. 12 See the complete report, www.WhiteHouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2017/assets/spec.pdf. 6 institutes, centers, services, and offices) that carry out statistical activities in conjunction with other program missions, such as providing services, managing and evaluating programs, or enforcing regulations. For purposes of this report, programs meeting these criteria are termed statistical programs. Direct Funding Whether statistical work is performed inside or outside the agency, the direct funding reflects the level of statistical activities in support of the agency's mission. Table 1 presents direct program funding for FY 2015, FY 2016, and FY 2017 for statistical programs, by department and agency. For FY 2015, the actual direct funding for Federal statistical programs was $6,6364 million ($6,081.0 million, excluding Decennial Census)\u2014within 1 percent of the estimated appro- priation reported for FY 2015 and about 3 percent higher than the FY 2014 funding received. Of the 126 statistical programs in both last year's and this year's report, 24 (19 percent) ex- perienced decreases of at least 5 percent in actual FY 2015 funding received compared with their estimated appropriation, 79 (63 percent) experienced less than a 5 percent difference in absolute value between their estimated appropriation and their actual funding, and 23 (18 percent) received at least 5 percent more funding than their appropriation estimate. 13 For FY 2016, Federal statistical programs were appropriated funding of $7,1899 million ($6,360.1 million excluding Decennial Census), an overall 29 percent decrease from the President's budget. Of the 126 statistical programs in both last year's and this year's report, 39 (31 percent) agencies were appropriated at least 5 percent less than was requested in the President's FY 2016 budget, 65 agencies (52 percent) experienced less than a 5 percent differ - ence in absolute value between their request and their appropriation; and 22 (18 percent) were appropriated at least 5 percent more than was requested in the President's budget. Among the 13 principal statistical agencies, 7 had their budgets reduced while the other 6 had essentially equivalent funding. 14 Many agencies receiving increased funds plan to implement statistical activities that had been postponed and to bolster staffing levels that had been curtailed in prior years. Agencies who faced budget cuts accommodated the reduced funding levels in a variety of ways including postponing statistical activities, delaying hiring of new staff, and limiting staff training and professional meetings. The estimated effects of these postponements, de - lays, and cuts to FY 2016 statistical activities are described in Chapters 2 and 3. For FY 2017, Federal statistical programs requested $7,5163 million in the President's budget ($6,4869 million, excluding Decennial Census), a 45 percent increase over the FY 2016 appro - priation. In this budget request, 16 (13 percent) of the 128 agencies in this report would receive at least 5 percent less funding in FY 2017 than was appropriated in FY 2016, 75 (59 percent) would receive essentially equivalent funding, and 37 (29 percent) would receive at least 5 per - cent more funding than was appropriated. Of the 13 principal statistical agencies, 1 agency pro - posed a budget decrease in FY 2017 compared with the FY 2016 appropriated level, 5 agencies requested budgets that are essentially the same, and the requests for 7 agencies exceed FY 2016 appropriated levels. Many agencies requesting more funds in FY 2017 than were appropriated in FY 2016 anticipate resuming implementation of previously postponed statistical activities, as well as fielding new data collection efforts deemed necessary to inform Federal policy. Chapters 2 and 3 describe statistical program planning in greater detail for FY 2016 and 2017. 13 Changes discussed in this report are based on unrounded numbers. In addition, percentages are presented as rounded figures, and therefore, summing individual figures may not equal 100 percent exactly . 14 Essentially equivalent funding refers to changes of less than 5 percent in absolute value. 7 Table 1 Direct Funding for Statistical Programs, FY 2015-2017 (In millions of dollars) DEPARTMENT Agency FY 2015 Actual Funding Received FY 2016 Appropriation

$422 million in FY 2015, FY 2016, and FY 2017, respectively for conducting the periodic Census of Agriculture 3 Expected WAOB FY 2015 spending did not reach the projected target because planned hiring was delayed by the reorganization of USDA' s HR functions 4 The difference between ITA' s estimates in last year' s report and the current report reflects a correction in the coverage of activities included 5 The difference between OCTAE' s estimates in last year' s report and the current report are largely due to errors which failed to account for the continuation of a contract action 6 The difference between ACL ' s FY 2016 estimate in last year' s report and the current report reflects continued efforts to integrate the programs transferred from the Department of Education including the costs of data collection, systems design, and program evaluations 7 The difference between NCI' s estimates in last year' s report and the current report reflects a correction in the coverage of activities included 8 This agency was formerly the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) 9 The difference between NHTSA' s estimates in last year' s report and the current report reflects a correction in the coverage of activities included 10 The Office of Policy and Planning (OPP) is transitioning into the Office of Enterprise Integration (OEI) The funding increase for FY 2017 is a result of the new OEI plan to add additional employees under the new 'Predictive Analytics and Actuary Service' to assist in predictive modeling 11 The FY 2015 and FY 2017 values for CNCS only include the Office of Research and Evaluation budget These values exclude programmatic funding allotted to statistical activities Programmatic funding for statistical activities for CNCS changes year to year depending on appropriated funding and agency priorities Reimbursable and Purchase Programs Agencies whose missions are primarily or entirely statistical often perform statistical work for others on a reimbursable basis. These reimbursements may come from other agencies within the same department or from other Federal agencies, State, Tribal, territorial, local governments, and occasionally the private sector or foreign governments. Sometimes data collected by one agency for its programmatic purposes can be used for a different program-matic purpose in another agency. Further, some agencies, like the Administration for Children and Families of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), have reimbursable programs but do not necessarily perform all the statistical work. Rather, they use part of the reimbursable program money to purchase statistical work from other Federal agencies. Agencies may also contract for statistical services with other Federal agencies; State, Tribal, territorial, and local governments; or private sector organizations. In certain cases, some agen- cies may purchase more than their direct funding for statistics allows because they receive the difference from other Federal agencies under their reimbursable programs. Reimbursable Programs During FY 2017, Federal agencies covered by this report would be reimbursed an estimated $963.1 million in statistical services, approximately 10 percent greater than FY 2016 esti - mated reimbursements. Similar to FY 2016 estimates, 86 percent of this reimbursable income would come from other Federal agencies. Census anticipates the largest reimbursable program in FY 2017, estimated at $336.6 million, about a 26 percent increase from FY 2016. Most of this work ($252.3 million) involves data collection and preparation of tabulations for other Federal agencies. In particular, the Census Bureau expects to perform approximately $84.3 million of reimbursable work for BLS to conduct the Consumer Expenditure Survey, the Current Population Survey, the Demographic Survey Sample Redesign, the American Time Use Survey, the Telephone Point of Purchase Survey, and other tabulations and surveys. Additionally, the Census Bureau expects to per - form work on the following surveys: for the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the Private Schools Survey, the School and Staffing Survey, and the intercensal estimates of 12 poverty; for the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), the National Health Interview Survey, the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, and the National Hospital Discharge Survey; for HUD, the American Housing Survey and the Housing Sales Survey; for the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), the National Crime Victimization Survey and the National Prisoner Statistics Program; for the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Pre-vention, the Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement; for EIA, the Manufacturing En-ergy Consumption Survey; and for the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), the National Survey of College Graduates. The Census Bureau also receives funds from other Federal agencies, foreign government agencies, and international organizations to conduct demographic, geographic, socioeconomic studies, and to strengthen statistical prac - tices around the world through technical assistance, training, and software products. The Geological Survey anticipates the next largest reimbursable statistics program in FY 2017, estimated at $280.9 million, 15 which is consistent with FY 2016 amounts. About 58 percent of the reimbursable income is from other Federal agencies. Reimbursable activities include research projects to provide results used in land and resource management decisions, maintaining long-term monitoring networks, and development of tools to make geologic and hydrologic information available for decision-making. HHS houses the next two largest anticipated reimbursable programs. Within the National In- stitutes of Health (NIH), the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) anticipates performing $91.5 million worth of reimbursable statistical work. NIDA partners with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study to enhance the evidence base that informs the FDA's regulatory actions under the 2009 Family Smok-ing Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. This is an increase of 50 percent over the FY 2016 estimates. NCHS, within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), anticipates performing $77.8 million worth of reimbursable statistical work. This work would be done for CDC and for NIH, and this amount is essentially equivalent to the FY 2016 estimates16. The National Death Index will continue to receive reimbursement from both CDC and non-Federal sources. Reimbursable work funded by non-Federal entities will also support the Na-tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Health Interview Survey . In FY 2017, BLS anticipates a reimbursable program of $32.2 million, about a 20 percent increase over the FY 2016 estimates. This includes funds provided by Social Security Admin - istration (SSA) for BLS to support the continued development of occupational statistics for use in SSA's disability programs. The next largest reimbursable program is BJS. BJS anticipates receiving $27.5 million in reimbursable funds for research, evaluation, and statistical services for the Office of Justice Programs. Intradepartmental transfers support much of the anticipated reimbursable statistical work con- ducted by the Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) agencies, which totals $35.4 million in FY 2017. Approximately $15.6 million (nearly 28 percent less than the FY 2016 estimate), or 87 percent of the National Agricultural Statistics Service's (NASS's) total reimbursable work ($18.0 million), is anticipated to support other agencies within USDA in FY 2017. In particular, NASS would support work with: the Economic Research Service (ERS) for the Ag-ricultural Resource Management Survey; the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) for the Conservation Effects Assessment Program; the Farm Service Agency for estimates of prices received by farmers, and county level cash rental rates; the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) to assist foreign countries with agricultural statistical services; the Risk Management 15 This amount includes $3.0 million from foreign governments, not shown in Table 2. 16 Essentially equivalent funding refers to changes of less than 5 percent in absolute value. 13 Agency for county estimates of commodity production and yield; and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service for the animal health monitoring system. In addition, NASS would work with the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the Department of Labor to produce agricultural labor statistics. Forest Service (FS) (at $7.9 million), ERS (at $5.6 million), NRCS (at $2.8 million), and FAS (at $1.0 million) also anticipate reimbursable pro-grams in FY 2017. Within FS, the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program allows part - ners to enhance the program by adding funds for FIA to collect additional data to meet local needs. ERS would partner with the Food and Nutrition Service to conduct the second round of USDA's National Household Food Purchase and Acquisition Survey. In combination, IES and NCES anticipate a reimbursable program of $33.1 million in FY 2017. IES anticipates receiving $20.9 million, a 58 percent increase over FY 2016 estimates, to conduct evaluations for Department of Education programs that are not in the IES account. NCES anticipates receiving $12.2 million in FY 2017 for reimbursable statistical work for other agencies, a 27 percent increase over FY 2016 estimates. This includes funds from the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) to provide funding to the Census Bureau for intercensal estimates of poverty and for the National Indian Education Study, and from the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) for work on the Civil Rights Data Collection. In addi-tion, NCES anticipates reimbursable statistical work from HHS, which co-sponsors the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study: Kindergarten Class of 2011. Purchases of Statistical Services Consistent with applicable law, agencies may also purchase statistical services from other Federal agencies, State, Tribal, and local governments, or private sector organizations. In certain cases, some agencies may purchase more than their direct funding for statistics allows because they receive the difference from other Federal agencies under their reimbursable pro-grams. During FY 2017, Federal agencies covered by this report anticipate purchasing an estimated $2,865.1 million in statistical services, an increase of about 11 percent from FY 2016. Con-sistent with FY 2016, about 62 percent of these services would be purchased from the private sector, about 21 percent from other agencies, and about 17 percent from State, local, and Tribal governments. 17 Agencies that expect to purchase more than $100.0 million in statistical services in FY 2017 are the Census Bureau ($673.6 million), NCES ($358.0 million), CDC (excluding NCHS) million), and NSF excluding NCSES ($131.0 million). The largest purchasers of statistical services from the State, Tribal, and local governments are CDC (excluding NCHS) ($163.5 million), BLS million), NASS million), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ($27.6 million), and NCHS ($24.3 million). Purchases of statistical services vary in scope. The Census Bureau anticipates major purchases in support of activities to implement a re-engineered 2020 Census, which has the potential to save approximately $5.2 billion compared with repeating the 2010 Census design; to acquire services to prepare for a 2017 Economic Census that includes 100 percent Internet response, reducing the burden for businesses, automating operations to increase productivity, and im-proving data products to reflect our ever-changing U.S. economy; and to enhance and add capabilities to the Census Enterprise Collection and Processing, which is the Census Bureau's integrated and standardized system of systems that offers shared data collection and process- 17 The term 'consistent' refers to changes of less than 5 percent in absolute value. 14 ing across all censuses and surveys. NCES provides funds to State educational agencies to support development and implementation of Statewide longitudinal data systems for collect - ing and reporting education data. The National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, Sexual - ly Transmitted Disease, and Tuberculosis Prevention of the CDC makes purchases in support of the collection of school-based data from State and local education agencies on youth risk behaviors and HIV/AIDS Surveillance and national level data collection on youth health risk behaviors and school health policies and practices. The National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion of the CDC funds states to maintain cancer registries. BLS funds support the cooperative labor force statistics program. ETA funds grants to States to col - lect and analyze labor market information on growth industries and occupations; to catalogue knowledge, skills and abilities required for standard occupations; and to support an electronic network of career information. The National Marine Fisheries Service in NOAA funds data collection activities used for monitoring total fishing effort, catch, economic value, and so-cioeconomic impacts in domestic commercial and recreational fisheries in all regions. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the Department of Transporta-tion anticipates making purchases in support of redesigned data collection sites for NHTSA's Crash Investigation Sampling System and Crash Report Sampling System to help improve NHTSA's primary crash databases, including the Fatality Analysis Reporting System and the National Automotive Sampling System. NCHS purchases vital statistics data on births and deaths from States, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. 18 Table 2 shows reimbursements and purchases for statistical activities covered in this report. 18 The U.S. territories covered are America Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 15 Table 2 Reimbursable and Purchase Programs, FY 2017 (In

Principal statistical agencies appear in underlined italics for ease of reference Component amounts may not sum to total amounts due to rounding 20 CHAPTER 2: PRINCIPAL STATISTICAL AGENCY PROGRAMS The programs that provide essential statistical information for use by governments, business- es, researchers, and the public are carried out by agencies spread across every department and several independent agencies. This chapter presents brief descriptions of the 13 principal statistical agencies covered in this report, followed by highlights of the programmatic impact of fiscal year (FY) 2016 congres-sional appropriations. FY 2017 Presidential budget requests are then presented with a sum - mary of anticipated major program changes for FY 2017. 19 Of note, the budgets shown here reflect the funds available to principal statistical agencies to meet their responsibilities to disseminate relevant and timely information; conduct credible, accurate, and objective statistical activities; and ensure the confidentiality and exclusive sta-tistical use of the responses of information providers. Complying with these responsibilities requires continuous modernization of data systems to maintain and extend data interoperabil - ity and access while ensuring confidentiality of statistical data. To ensure the credibility and accuracy of their statistics, agencies must hire, develop, and retain staff with a high level of expertise. For both staff development and information dissemination, time and funding must be devoted for staff to engage with colleagues in other Federal agencies, academic centers, and the private sector to discuss available statistics, including their strengths and limitations, and to pursue methodological improvements. Ensuring objectivity and protecting confidenti - ality, such as by maintaining a statistical publication schedule and review process independent from policy interests, need not be costly. However, other means to promote these responsibili - ties, such as retaining statistical agency authority to manage confidential data on secure serv-ers, can be expensive, especially for smaller statistical agencies and units. BUREAU OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS (BEA) BEA, of the Department of Commerce (DOC), is a principal source of Federal economic sta- tistics. BEA is responsible for the preparation, development, and interpretation of the Nation's economic accounts. National economic accounts cover GDP and related accounts. Interna - tional economic accounts involve balance-of-payments data critical to monetary, trade, invest - ment, exchange rate, and financial policies. BEA's direct investment programs (foreign and domestic) are required by law and are critical to understanding the impact of U.S. and foreign multinational companies on the U.S. and world economies. Other BEA programs include the regional economic accounts, the basis for virtually all States' spending and revenue forecasts, and industry economic accounts, which provide the infrastructure for other BEA accounts and many other key government statistics, such as BLS' Producer Price Index. Congressional Action on the President's FY 2016 Budget Request The FY 2016 appropriation of $105.1 million was $4.9 million less than the FY 2016 Presi-dent's budget request. This appropriation enables BEA to maintain core programs that produce statistics that feed into the estimation of GDP and related statistics, are required by law, or are required for the administration of Federal programs. The lower than requested appropriation for FY 2016 limits the extent to which BEA can implement its Small Business initiative. In addition to funding normal operations, BEA's FY 2016 appropriation covers FY 2016 costs associated with its relocation to join the Census Bureau at the Federal complex in Suitland, 19 See Appendix A for supplemental information on the staffing levels of the principal statistical agencies. 21 Maryland. Co-locating BEA and Census will reduce renovation and annual rent costs, and facilitate greater collaboration between BEA and the Census Bureau's Economic Directorate. Highlights of the FY 2017 Budget Request and Major Program Changes The President's FY 2017 budget request of $110.7 million would allow BEA to continue to improve the relevance, accuracy, and timeliness of the Nation's economic accounts and to keep BEA's statistics on pace with the ever-changing U.S. economy. Base funds would be used for work outlined in the BEA Strategic Plan, which provides a detailed plan for maintain - ing and improving those accounts. These activities include preparing and releasing GDP and National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) statistics. The requested $3.1 million in ad-ditional funds would support two projects. First, BEA plans to develop a Regional Economic Dashboard that will provide new tools to evaluate economic conditions at the most local level to aid in determining where, when, and for how long to provide assistance. Regional economic data are an essential tool for local governments competing for foreign direct invest-ment. Businesses need this information to identify well-developed markets or the particular skills needed for their operations. Households may consider relocating to areas with high de - mand for their job skills or lower costs of living. More detailed regional statistics will connect business with those households, encourage growth, and will give decision makers at all levels in government the tools to better target and monitor the allocation of scarce resources and assistance. Second, BEA will improve and accelerate the incorporation of key Census source data into GDP estimates, thereby reducing revisions; improving data value by removing the effects of seasonal trends from more industries; and expanding coverage to better measure key sectors of the economy. The result will be a full suite of enhanced macroeconomic indicators, delivered to end users more quickly and with more precision, with improved scope to drive decisions on investment, economic growth, and job creation. BUREAU OF JUSTICE STATISTICS (BJS) BJS, of the Department of Justice (DOJ), is a principal source of Federal crime and justice sta - tistics. BJS collects, analyzes, publishes, and disseminates statistical information on all aspects of the criminal justice system; assists State, Tribal, and local governments in gathering and analyzing justice statistics; and disseminates high value information and statistics to inform policymakers, researchers, criminal justice practitioners and the general public. BJS' current statistical portfolio comprises about fifty separate data collections composed of ongoing annual and periodic collections. Additionally, the statistical operations are complemented or supported by nearly two dozen ongoing research and development projects or activities. The suite of col - lections and other projects form an ongoing statistical information infrastructure that supports the production of timely, relevant national statistics. These statistics provide an evidence base for informing critical criminal justice decision making at all levels of government. Congressional Action on the President's FY 2016 Budget Request The President's FY 2016 budget request was $70.1 million. The FY 2016 appropriation for BJS was $50.2 million, which is $19.9 million less than the President's FY 2016 budget request. This appropriation allows the Attorney General to set aside 2 percent of Office of Justice Program funds made available for grant or reimbursement programs for use by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and BJS for research, evaluation or statistical purposes, without regard to the original authorizations for the grant or reimbursement programs. The ap - propriation together with the set-aside permit BJS to continue to collect and analyze statistical data on all aspects of the criminal justice system; assist State, local, and Tribal governments in collecting and analyzing justice statistics; and disseminate high quality information and statistics. 22 As a result of the FY 2015 and FY 2016 funding reductions (FY 2015 President's budget re- quest was $62.6 million and FY 2015 actual funding received was $47.1 million, a decrease of $15.5 million), BJS suspended work on some of its core, annual data collections, including collections on the public defense function and on indigent defense. BJS was also unable to implement studies of justice and regulatory systems' response to white collar crime and the collection of court case felony processing statistics because the request to increase the set-aside was not approved. In addition, BJS was able to do only limited work on enhancing the National Crime Victim - ization Survey methodology to develop subnational estimates, which is a critical part of the redesign work to enable BJS to generate State, metropolitan, and city-level area estimates of victimization and improve the measurement of rape and sexual assault and citizen satisfaction with police. Highlights of the FY 2017 Budget Request and Major Program Changes The President's FY 2017 budget requests $66.8 million for BJS. This request represents an increase of $16.6 million compared with the FY 2016 appropriation. The majority of ap-propriated funds would enable BJS to maintain continuity of series for core collections that produce key statistical trends, including National Prisoner Statistics, Annual Jail Survey, An - nual Probation and Parole Census, Jails in Indian Country, National Corrections Reporting Program, National Crime Victimization Survey, Capital Punishment Statistics, and Deaths in Custody Reporting Program. BJS would also support special projects such as the analysis of data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, studies of the justice and regulatory systems' response to white collar crime, analyses describing crime and justice on Tribal lands, and criminal justice employment and expenditures, as well as publication and dissemination activities. The additional funds requested would support new or major ongoing initiatives, including: BJS's redesign of the National Crime Victimization Survey to generate State, metropolitan, and city-level area estimates of victimization and improved measurement of rape, sexual as-sault, and citizen satisfaction with police; efforts to increase the use of administrative data for statistical purposes, including evaluating the impact of Office of Justice Program grant funding and partnering with the FBI to expand the National Crime Statistics Exchange; ex-pansion of statistical information about the public defense function to assess and improve the quality of indigent services in the U.S.; and reinstatement of core data collections that were suspended due to lack of funding, including those on pretrial outcomes, felony court sentenc - ing outcomes, and arrest-related deaths. The President's FY 2017 budget also requests an increase to 3 percent of the OJP set-aside for BJS and NIJ, which will be used to support new and ongoing projects including a multi-year evaluation plan for Bureau of Justice Assistance-funded grant programs, estimation of recidi - vism rates of Second Chance Act grantee program participants, implementation of a rapid law enforcement information system, and creation of a database linking criminal history informa - tion to other administrative data relevant to prisoner reentry and reintegration. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS (BLS) BLS, of the Department of Labor (DOL), is a principal source of Federal labor and price statistics to support public and private decision making. BLS is responsible for measuring labor market activity, working conditions, and price changes in the economy. BLS collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates data on: employment and unemployment; projections of the labor force and employment by industry and occupation; prices and inflation at various 23 levels of the economy; consumer expenditures; wages and employee benefits; occupational injuries and illnesses; and productivity and technological change in U.S. industries. Congressional Action on the President's FY 2016 Budget Request The FY 2016 appropriation of $609.0 million for BLS was $23.7 million below the President's FY 2016 budget request, but $16.8 million above the actual funding received for FY 2015 of $592.2 million. The increase in FY 2016 is sufficient to fund the International Price Program Export Price Indexes, as well as to partially fund inflationary costs. In order to maintain cur - rent production and core programs with this funding level, BLS is curtailing planned improve - ments and development and research projects temporarily. The FY 2016 appropriation did not include any of the program increases included in the President's request, such as funds for adding an annual supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS) to fill data gaps on particular important topics (e.g., contingent workers, workplace flexibility, and work-family balance) and an initiative for the Consumer Expenditure (CE) Survey Program to modify the CE Survey to support the Census Bureau in its development of a supplemental poverty mea-sure. Also included in the FY 2016 budget request, but not funded, was an enhancement for the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) to better understand U.S. labor market dynamics. The JOLTS enhancement would have enabled the expansion of the JOLTS sample to provide State level data and greater industry detail; the addition of questions on labor market issues; and the release of JOLTS data at the same time as The Employment Situation , thereby allowing for contemporaneous analysis of the change in U.S. payroll jobs each month. Highlights of the FY 2017 Budget Request and Major Program Changes The FY 2017 budget request of $640.9 million is $31.9 million above the FY 2016 appro-priation. This level includes $13.2 million for inflationary costs not provided in FY 2015 and FY 2016. The FY 2017 request also includes a program increase of $1.6 million to fund the annual CPS supplement described below, and $2.5 million to fund the CE initiative for the supplemental poverty measure. In addition, the FY 2017 request includes $3.0 million for first year activities for a new Survey of Employer-Provided Training, which would fill a key gap in knowledge about the workforce system by measuring the extent to which employers provide or sponsor job skills training for their workers. The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a primary source of data on characteristics of the labor force and emerging trends and changes in employment and unemployment among vari-ous groups of workers. The current collection allows BLS to produce high quality estimates; however, BLS cannot provide information on particular important subgroups, such as con-tingent workers, without support for CPS supplements. As a result, the demand for data on labor force trends is not being met fully. BLS proposes meeting this data need by conducting one CPS supplement annually, beginning with a Contingent Work Supplement (CWS) in FY 2017. With the requested funding, BLS would capture data on contingent work and alterna - tive work arrangements biennially through the CWS. Data on other topics would be collected in the intervening years, beginning with the Work Schedules and Work at Home Supplement (WSWHS), which would measure how much Americans' work times deviate from traditional 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday schedules. The WSWHS would provide additional infor - mation on the availability of flexible work schedules, shift work, work at home, and other related topics to allow analysts to study flexible working arrangements by occupation, age, sex, and race. These work schedule data would also help analysts study the possible impact of flexible work arrangements on earnings. Moreover, BLS would have resources to develop new supplements on emerging topics such as entrepreneurship. This information would allow data users and decision-makers to develop a more timely and fundamental understanding of developments in the labor market. 24 BUREAU OF TRANSPORTATION STATISTICS (BTS) BTS, of the Department of Transportation (DOT), is a principal source of Federal transpor - tation statistics. BTS compiles, analyzes, and disseminates information about the Nation's transportation systems, including the extent, use, condition, performance, and consequences of those systems. Programs address topics such as freight and travel statistics, transportation economics, geospatial information systems, and airline transportation statistics. BTS admin - isters the National Transportation Library, which maintains and facilitates access to statistical and other information needed for transportation decision making. BTS enhances the quality and effectiveness of DOT's statistical programs research, development of guidelines, and pro-motion of improvements in data acquisition and use. Congressional Action on the President's FY 2016 Budget Request The FY 2016 appropriations level for BTS was $26.0 million, which reflects the authorized funding level in the FAST Act, sec. 6002 (a)(6). This appropriation was $3.0 million less than the President's FY 2016 budget request of $29.0 million, and as a result BTS was unable to establish the Travel Data Initiative to fill data gaps in passenger travel and vehicle fleets. As a reimbursement element, BTS maintains the Airline Transportation Statistics Program (funded by FAA) and a Close Calls Reporting Program funded through various reimbursable agreements. At this funding level, BTS supports critical travel, freight, and safety statistics programs, as well as work important in geospatial information, transportation economics, and the information dissemination services of the National Transportation Library. Highlights of the FY 2017 Budget Request and Major Program Changes The President's budget request for FY 2017 is $26.0 million, consistent with the FY 2016 appropriation. At this level, BTS would maintain its priority core programs and pursue ef-forts to improve efficiency of the agency's data processing and publications systems, while incorporating more current information from alternative and non-traditional data sources into BTS products. In FY 2017, BTS would continue to maintain the Airline Transportation Statistics Program which would be reimbursed from FAA to collect and disseminate airline financial, traffic, performance, and operational data from 130 U.S. airlines. BTS would expand its Close Calls Reporting Program through reimbursable agreements with agency partners who seek better statistics and analysis on conditions that contribute to operational safety risks. BTS would also initiate a railroad tank car modification reporting program under the FAST Act (sec. 7308) with reimbursable funding from the Federal Railroad Administration and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. CENSUS BUREAU (CENSUS) The Census Bureau, within the Department of Commerce (DOC), is a principal source of Federal current and periodic demographic and economic statistics. Census measures and dis-seminates information about the Nation's ever-changing economy, society, and institutions. The statistical products provided by Census foster economic growth, advance scientific un - derstanding, and facilitate informed decisions. Census' major demographic programs include the 2020 Decennial Census, the American Community Survey (ACS), and the Intercensal Demographic Estimates. The Census Bureau is implementing the 2020 Census Operational Plan. The ACS is an ongoing survey providing updated demographic, social, economic, and housing data for every U.S. community every year. It is a key source of data for States, localities, and Federal agencies that need accurate, 25 reliable information on a wide range of topics to better serve the needs of groups such as veterans, retirees, and families with school-age children. The ACS is especially important to Americans who live in small towns and rural areas, as this survey often provides the only consistent source of information about local communities. The Intercensal Demographic Es-timates program develops updated population estimates in years between Decennial Cen - suses for areas such as States, counties, metropolitan statistical areas, and governmental units. These estimates are used in funding and planning, including the distribution of Federal pro-gram funds, as denominators for various Federal time series, as population controls for major household surveys, and for planning local transportation and health care services. The Cur - rent Demographic Statistics Programs include household surveys and population and housing analyses, which provide reliable social and economic data and historical perspectives on many current issues. Census' economic statistics include two periodic censuses conducted every five years, cover - ing the years ending in two and seven. The Economic Census is integral to BEA estimates of GDP and industry inputs and outputs. The Economic Census provides core information on virtually all non-farm businesses and related data on business expenditures, commodity flows, minority and women-owned businesses, and other topics. The Census of Governments col-lects State and local data on public finance, public employment, and governmental organiza - tion. It is the only source of comprehensive and uniformly categorized data on the economic activities of approximately 90,000 State and local governments, which account for about 12 percent of GDP and 15 percent of the U.S. workforce. The Current Economic Statistics (CES) program provides public and private data users with relevant, accurate, and timely national statistical profiles for every sector of the U.S. economy, including manufacturing, mineral industries, construction industries, retail and wholesale trade, service industries, and transpor - tation industries. The CES program significantly influences financial markets. Congressional Action on the President's FY 2016 Budget Request The FY 2016 appropriation of $1,368.4 million is $130.0 million less than the President's budget request of $1,498.4 million. The appropriation allows the Census Bureau to implement design decisions in the 2020 Census Operational Plan that have the potential to save $5.2 billion compared to the cost of conducting a 2020 Census using 2010 methods and opera-tions. The appropriation also provides support for tests of the re-engineered field operations and technology, continued systems development and integration testing, and the award of two major contracts to optimize self-response and provide assistance to households that need help responding to the census. The funding level also allows the Census Bureau to fund the enhancement of technology and systems for data collection and processing services. These en-hancements will enable critical cost-savings for the 2020 Census. However, due to the lower appropriation, Census is curtailing portions of the operations and systems tests associated with the 2020 Decennial Census. Highlights of the FY 2017 Budget Request and Major Program Changes The FY 2017 President's budget request of $1,631.0 million is an increase of $262.6 million over the FY 2016 appropriation. A critical priority for the Census Bureau in the FY 2017 budget is the 2020 Census. The 2020 Census is designed to cost less per housing unit than the 2010 Census (when adjusted for inflation), while continuing to maintain the highest stan-dards of accuracy amongst all population groups. The Census Bureau plans to achieve this by conducting the most automated, modern, and dynamic decennial census in history. The FY 2017 request includes a $182.1 million increase in the 2020 Decennial Census. Having iden - tified the major cost drivers of the Census and developed new, innovative methodologies to reengineer its operations, the Census Bureau now turns to implementing the Operational Plan. 26 In FY 2017, the Census Bureau will continue its focus on field-testing a suite of integrated operations that ensure the address list is up to date, encourage households to respond to the Census, and follow up with nonresponding households. The Census Bureau will also continue the development of production systems needed to conduct a successful Census in 2020. The development of interoperable production systems must be largely completed in FY 2017 to be ready for an end-to-end test in 2018. A key piece of enabling technology that underpins the 2020 Census is the Census Enterprise Data Collection and Process (CEDCaP) program. With CEDCaP, the Census Bureau is cre - ating an integrated and standardized suite of systems that offers shared data collection and processing services across the enterprise. An increase of $8.9 million in FY 2017 will sup-port the delivery into production of several capabilities, including enhanced automatic case assignment, real-time field activity monitoring, an electronic correspondence portal to help respondents, and completely refreshed Internet and mobile data collection that will support one or both of the 2017 Economic Census and the 2017 Census Test. An increase of $5.1 million in FY 2017 will support the continuation of planning for the 2017 Economic Census and the completion of 2017 Economic Census data collection instruments, respondent tools, mail files, and tracking system. The FY 2017 request supports upgraded data collection techniques such as Internet response; reduced burden for businesses, which will allow higher data integrity; automation enhancements to increase productivity; and expanded capabilities of data products to reflect the ever-changing U.S. economy. Other activities that would be funded by a total of $42.5 million include: Geographic support to acquire address and road data from government partners; reduction in the American Com - munity Survey current and emerging program risk through an enhanced respondent experi - ence, research on reducing respondent burden, and increased communications with stakehold - ers; accelerating and improving the quality of Economic Indicators through a joint initiative with the Bureau of Economic Analysis to produce a more precise measure of GDP; and the modernization of economic statistics to leverage and accelerate path-breaking methodological work to pilot several specific program enhancements using big data. ECONOMIC RESEARCH SERVICE (ERS) ERS, of the Department of Agriculture (USDA), is a principal source of Federal agriculture statistics. ERS provides economic and other social science research and analysis to inform public and private decision making on agriculture, food, natural resources, and rural America. ERS is a primary source of statistical indicators that gauge the health of the farm sector (in-cluding farm income estimates and projections), assess the current and expected performance of the agricultural sector (including trade), and provide measures of food security here and abroad. ERS provides evidence-based policy-relevant findings through its statistics, indica - tors, and research that inform USDA decision making. Congressional Action on the President's FY 2016 Budget Request The FY 2016 appropriation of $85.4 million fell slightly short of the FY 2016 President's bud-get request of $86.0 million, and remained at the same level as the FY 2015 appropriation. As with the 2015 appropriation, ERS fully funded the General Services Administration rent and the Department of Homeland Security security costs that were decentralized and transferred to the agency, while maintaining its highest priority core programs of research, data, and market outlook. In addition to continuing ERS' core program of research, $1.0 million funded an ini-tiative that is analyzing linkages between shifting water supplies, farming practices, and food production using enhanced agricultural-environmental models for more precise measures of key relationships and integrated data from survey and administrative sources. The goal is to 27 build a strong evidence base on public and private drivers of farm-level water use, responses to drought risk, and how drought resilience affects productivity growth and food prices. ERS also dedicated funds of $350,000 to a second initiative that is analyzing barriers to entry for beginning farmers and ranchers. A key focus of the analysis is identification of the extent to which USDA programs may help reduce those barriers. The funds for the initiatives were partially offset by reductions in both extramural research and in lower priority intramural program research. Highlights of the FY 2017 Budget Request and Major Program Changes The FY 2017 President's budget requests $91.3 million for ERS, an increase of $5.9 million over the FY 2016 appropriation. Funding will provide support to continue ERS' highest priority core programs, including research, data, and market outlook on the following: how investments in rural people, businesses, and communities affect the capacity of rural econo - mies to prosper in a changing global marketplace; economic issues related to developing natural resource policies and programs that respond to the need to protect the environment and the challenges of climate change while enhancing agricultural competitiveness; pro - duction agriculture, domestic and international markets, trade, and Federal farm policies to understand the U.S. food and agriculture sector's performance in the context of increasingly globalized markets; the Nation's food and nutrition assistance programs to study the rela - tionships among factors that influence food choices and health outcomes, including obesity, and to enhance methodologies for valuing societal benefits associated with reducing food safety risks. In addition, an increase of $4.0 million is requested to conduct a second round of the USDA's National Household Food Purchase and Acquisition Survey (FoodAPS), a nationally representative survey of American households to collect unique and comprehen - sive data about household food purchases and acquisitions. Detailed information will be collected about foods purchased or otherwise acquired for consumption at home and away from home, including foods acquired through food and nutrition assistance programs. In addition to the representative population of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants included in the first round of FoodAPS, the second round will include representative populations of participants in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and school meal programs and representative populations of children ages 2-5, 6-11, and 12-17. It will associate the purchased foods with their \"equivalent agricultural food commodities,\" which better link farms to food. ERS also requests $626,000 to support ongoing research in economic and policy drivers of drought resilience. ERS will expand the analysis to examine interactions with groundwater resources and to provide more regionally specific results, accounting for local variation in conditions and the institutions that govern farmers' access to water. Finally, ERS will dedi - cate $500,000 to another ongoing initiative that is analyzing barriers to entry for beginning farmers and ranchers. ERS will expand the analysis to examine differences in demographic characteristics of new farmers and ranchers, including the socially disadvantaged, women, and veterans. ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION (EIA) EIA, of the Department of Energy (DOE), is a principal source of Federal energy statistics. EIA collects, analyzes, and disseminates independent and impartial energy information to promote sound policymaking, efficient markets, and public understanding of energy and its interaction with the economy and the environment. EIA conducts a comprehensive data col - lection program covering the full spectrum of energy sources, end uses, and energy flows; generates short- and long-term domestic and international energy projections; and performs timely, informative energy analyses. 28 Congressional Action on the President's FY 2016 Budget Request The FY 2016 appropriation of $122.0 million was $5.0 million above the FY 2015 appro- priation and $9.0 million below the FY 2016 President's budget. The additional funding will be used to improve overall EIA programs. EIA will incorporate export data into EIA week-ly petroleum statistics using weekly data shared by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to improve understanding of market situation and balances. The disposition of U.S. crude oil supply, demand, and balances is of immense market interest, with export data becoming an increasingly critical component. EIA will also release consumption and expenditure estimates for the 2012 reference year Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey, publish en-ergy consumption estimates for manufacturing establishments from the 2014 Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey, and complete data collection for the 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey and national pilots. In addition, EIA will expand energy shipments by rail data. The rise of domestic crude oil production and shipment by rail has led to an associat - ed rise in rail shipment of other energy products, such as propane and ethanol. Dissemination of data on energy shipments by rail will help the public, government, and industry audiences better understand the volumes, origins, and destinations of a broader array of energy ship-ments. Finally, EIA will enhance mid-term and international energy modeling capabilities. EIA plans to complete the Extended Short-Term Energy Outlook project providing forecasts of medium-term oil production, consumption, and related statistics over a five-year period, and to incorporate deeper insights into electricity and oil demand growth in major developing economies, as well as more robust analysis of global hydrocarbon supply to help its audi - ences better understand U.S. markets within a broader international context. EIA is deferring implementation of some programs that were planned to begin in FY 2016 to FY 2017 due to the lower than requested FY 2016 appropriation. Highlights of the FY 2017 Budget Request and Major Program Changes The FY 2017 President's budget request of $131.1 million represents an increase of $9.1 million over the FY 2016 appropriation. This funding would enable EIA to conduct a data collection program covering the full spectrum of energy sources, end uses, and energy flows; generate short- and long-term domestic and international energy projections; and perform timely, informative energy analyses. Several specific initiatives would be supported by the requested increase. EIA would revamp petroleum data and analysis to provide more regional detail. EIA's petroleum data have historically focused on the five World War II era Petroleum Administration for Defense (PAD) Districts, an approach no longer sufficient to address many policy questions and market issues. EIA seeks to add more regional detail, which will require both one-time updates and a permanent increase in processing and review effort to produce more granular information. EIA is planning to provide additional analysis of regional refin-ing and product markets. EIA would also enhance commercial building energy efficiency data, building on new methodologies from its residential building data collection to realize efficiencies in its commercial building survey, such as better sampling frames, more efficient collection modes, and development of a new survey instrument for collecting commercial building energy characteristics. Additionally, in response to the Energy Efficiency Improve-ment Act of 2015, EIA would begin testing methods for tenant-level energy data collections. EIA would pilot a study to evaluate what sampling frames and techniques, survey instru - ments, collection protocols, and statistical estimation methods would support a \"Tenant Star\" energy efficiency rating system. In addition, EIA would expand international analysis, includ - ing Canada-Mexico collaboration and key economies in Asia. With rapid growth in U.S. oil and natural gas production there is an acute need for better understanding of domestic energy markets within the context of the world energy system, particularly export scenarios for crude oil, petroleum products, and liquefied natural gas. Additionally, EIA would continue to col - 29 laborate with counterparts in Canada and Mexico to improve the quality and transparency of North American energy data with the ultimate goal of harmonizing product definitions and classifications. Mapping of North American infrastructure and current energy flows also would be expanded to improve market transparency. Finally, EIA would collect transportation energy consumption data, by exploring options and partnerships to collect and analyze data on personal vehicle transportation related to macroeconomic, demographic, and behavioral changes, such as driver licensing rates and access to alternative transportation options, which have contributed to recent trends in vehicle miles traveled. These data would help in develop - ing projections of motor fuel demand, and would be useful to policymakers who assess, plan, and fund energy infrastructure needs. NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS SERVICE (NASS) NASS, of the Department of Agriculture (USDA), is a principal source of Federal agricultural statistics. NASS collects, summarizes, analyzes, and publishes data on the number of farms and land in farms; acreage, yield, production, and stocks of crops; inventories and production of livestock, including eggs and dairy products; prices received by farmers for products, prices paid for commodities and services, and related indexes; agriculture production and marketing data; cold storage supplies; agricultural chemical use; and other related areas of the agricul - tural economy. On a reimbursable basis with DOL funds, NASS conducts the Farm Labor Survey, which provides estimates of the number of hired workers; average hours worked, and wage rates at national, regional, and selected State levels. NASS conducts the Census of Agriculture every five years. The census provides comprehensive data on the agricultural economy, including farm size, characteristics of farm operators, current agricultural industrial reports, land ownership, aquaculture, horticulture, organics, local foods, and farm irrigation practices at the national, State, and county levels. Congressional Action on the President's FY 2016 Budget Request The FY 2016 appropriation represents a decrease of $4.0 million over the FY 2015 appropria - tion. The FY 2016 appropriation of $168.4 million reflects a net decrease of $11.9 from the FY 2016 President's budget request of $180.3 million. The appropriation reflects an overall increase for the Agricultural Estimates program, which enables NASS to continue chemical use and floriculture programs. This funding enables expansion of NASS' annual survey of bee keepers to provide improved data on the prevalence and extent of Colony Collapse Disorder. In addition, the FY 2016 appropriation reflects a decrease of $5.7 million for the Census of Agriculture program base associated with the customary, cyclical nature of the 5-year Census of Agriculture program. NASS continues the cyclical work of the five general categories of the census base: direction and planning, content determination and design, mail list develop - ment and mail out, collection and processing, and publication and dissemination. NASS also continues the annual Census of Agriculture Current Agriculture Industrial Reports and con-ducts the Local Foods Special Study to provide comprehensive geographically represented farm-level data. Highlights of the FY 2017 Budget Request and Major Program Changes The FY 2017 President's budget request of $176.6 million reflects a net increase of $8.2 mil - lion over the FY 2016 appropriation. At this level of funding, NASS would conduct essential Federal Principal Economic Indicator surveys; propose new survey instruments to collect data on cattle, hogs, and poultry to respond to the Combatting Antimicrobial Resistant Bacteria initiative; enhance the current satellite-based agriculture statistics monitoring to improve the evaluation of local level climate change on crop production; and conduct further analysis of the colony loss and pollination cost data to examine the causes and sequelae of Colony Col- 30 lapse Disorder. FY 2017 is the final planning year for the Census of Agriculture. This funding also enables continuation of the annual Census of Agriculture Current Agriculture Industrial Reports. This includes the Agricultural Coverage Evaluation Survey (ACES), which is a sepa-rate and vital pre-screener to the Census of Agriculture. ACES is used to update and improve the Central Mail List. NASS plans to reduce the sample for the National Agricultural Clas - sification Survey (NACS) as part of maintaining no change in funding level for the Census of Agriculture. NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS (NCES) NCES, of the Department of Education (ED), is a principal source of Federal education sta-tistics. NCES collects, analyzes, and disseminates education statistics at all levels, from pre-school through postsecondary and adult education, including statistics on international edu-cation. NCES collections include the Common Core of Data, the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, the National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey, the Early Child-hood Longitudinal Study, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, and the Program for International Student Assessment. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is NCES' primary tool for assessing what American elementary and second-ary students know and can do in academic subjects. NCES also administers the Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems program, which provides grants to the States for the management and analysis of individual student data to improve student academic performance and close achievement gaps. Congressional Action on the President's FY 2016 Budget Request The FY 2016 appropriation of $332.6 million, a decrease of $48.9 million from the FY 2016 President's budget request, included $295.5 million for the Statistics, Assessment, and State - wide Longitudinal Data Systems (SLDS) programs. This funding level allows NCES to con-duct comprehensive data collection on public elementary and secondary schools and districts; a survey of private elementary and secondary schools; the Integrated Postsecondary Edu-cation Data System (IPEDS), a comprehensive collection system that collects information on postsecondary institutions; the National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey (NPSAS); the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study: Kindergarten Class of 2010-2011; and work on inter - national assessments, including the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). FY 2016 funding also provides support for NAEP reading, mathematics, and science assessments in 4th, 8th, and 12th grades. Funds from this appropriation also support the SLDS program in improving student achievement. Because the appropriation was lower than the requested funding for FY 2016, NCES was unable to implement a pilot State-level PISA; collect more frequent NPSAS data regarding student financial aid; or provide additional support to States to improve early childhood data, expand data usage, improve information linkages between secondary and postsecondary institutions, or develop linkages to workforce data. Highlights of the FY 2017 Budget Request and Major Program Changes The President's budget request for FY 2017 of $391.2 million is $58.6 million above the FY 2016 appropriation. The majority of the budget request ($355.4 million) is to fund the Statistics, Assessment, and Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems (SLDS) programs. A $13.4 million increase in the Statistics program would allow NCES to collect critical and more timely information on a wide range of high-priority policy issues, including early childhood education and postsecondary educational costs and student progress. Specifically, the increase would fund the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study: Birth Cohort; an early childhood educa-tion study; the collection of administrative data every two years on student loan repayments 31 and defaults for the NPSAS; an international cross-sectional survey of teachers and school leaders in the Teaching and Learning International Survey; and statistical work on the My Brother's Keeper initiative. The request for the Assessment program of $156.7 million would provide support for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and the Nation-al Assessment Governing Board (NAGB). This level of funding would allow for 2017 4th and 8th grade national and State assessments in reading and math to transition to a digital-based platform; the expansion of the Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA) to additional urban school districts; and the administration of assessments in U.S. history, civics, and geography in 8th and 12th grades in 2018. The requested $81.0 million for Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems includes funding for $35.7 million in new grant awards, $27.2 million to support continuation costs of State grants awarded in 2012 and 2015, and $18.0 million to support activities to improve data coordination, quality, and use for all States. NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS (NCHS) NCHS, of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is a principal source of Federal health statistics. NCHS is responsible for the collection, maintenance, analysis, and dissemination of statistics on the nature and extent of the health, illness, and disability of the U.S. population; the impact of illness and disability on the economy; the effects of environ - mental, social, and other health hazards; health care costs and financing; family formation, growth, and dissolution; and vital events (births and deaths). NCHS has also placed emphasis on improving health and health care data systems and enhancing internationally comparable measures of disability. Congressional Action on the President's FY 2016 Budget Request The FY 2016 appropriation of $160.4 million represents a $5.0 million increase over FY 2015 actual funding received and is consistent with the FY 2016 President's budget request. This amount includes funds for the CDC Working Capital Fund for business services; in the past, these services were funded centrally at CDC. In FY 2015 about $17.0 million of the appropriation went to the Working Capital Fund. The funded level allows NCHS to: conduct the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to provide data for monitoring trends in illness and disability and to track progress toward achieving national health objectives; maintain full field operations for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to provide nationally representative data on the health and nutritional status of adults and chil - dren, including prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed conditions; conduct the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) to provide data on reproductive health, fertility, and family life that can be used to plan health services and health education programs; collect a full 12 months of birth and death records from States and territories to provide the Nation's official vital statistics; conduct selected components of the National Health Care Surveys to reflect changing patterns of health care delivery; research and evaluate statistical methods for use by NCHS and the broader scientific community; and enhance the quality and usability of data access tools. Highlights of the FY 2017 Budget Request and Major Program Changes The FY 2017 request of $160.4 million is level with the FY 2016 appropriation. This funding would support electronic reporting of deaths by the States to provide faster, better quality data on deaths of public health importance, including prescription drug overdose-related deaths. The FY 2017 budget request would maintain the capacity of NCHS to monitor key health indicators by supporting its ongoing, seminal health and healthcare surveys and data collec - tion systems, using personal interviews, healthcare records, physical examinations, diagnostic procedures, lab tests, and vital event registrations. In FY 2017, NCHS would continue the 32 more efficient NHIS sample implemented in FY 2016 incorporating information on popula - tion demographics from the Decennial Census and providing a more nimble platform for responding to changes in funding. Additionally, NCHS would test and implement modules to the NHANES to address the growing need for information on infectious and chronic health conditions. NCHS would continue to integrate data collected from three hospital and facility surveys into one survey called the National Hospital Care Survey (NHCS). The NHCS would continue to integrate inpatient data formerly collected by the National Hospital Discharge Survey; emergency department and outpatient department data including ambulatory surgery, collected by the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Survey; and data on substance-in - volved emergency department visits formerly collected by SAMHSA's Drug Abuse Warning Network. NCHS would continue transitioning from manual data collection to electronic data collection for the NHCS, which is expected to improve both timeliness and quality of data. NCHS would continue to investigate ways to incorporate administrative data and electronic health record information into the family of health care provider surveys. The role of the Na - tional Vital Statistics System in disease surveillance would continue to be developed as the in-creased use of electronic reporting systems has dramatically improved timeliness of mortality reporting. With the requested budget, NCHS would continue to explore ways to improve data availability for small populations, including innovative sampling methods and research on small area estimation techniques. The value and usability of NCHS data would be optimized through both online tutorials, which would provide analytic guidance and linkage with other data sets, and the development and improvement of online access systems. NATIONAL CENTER FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING STATISTICS (NCSES) NCSES, of the National Science Foundation (NSF), is a principal source of Federal statistics about the science and engineering enterprise and serves as the central Federal clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation, analysis, and dissemination of objective data on science, engineering, technology, and research and development. NCSES is called on to support the collection of statistical data on research and development trends, the science and engineer - ing workforce, U.S. competitiveness, and the condition and progress of the Nation's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education; to support research using the data it collects and on methodologies in areas related to the work of the Center; and to support the education and training of researchers in the use of its own and other large-scale, nation - ally representative data sets. NCSES designs, supports, and directs a coordinated collection of periodic national surveys and performs a variety of other data collections and research, providing policymakers, researchers, and other decision makers with high quality data and analysis on research and development, innovation, the education of scientists and engineers, and the science and engineering workforce. Congressional Action on the President's FY 2016 Budget Request The FY 2016 appropriation of $58.2 million represents a decrease of $0.2 million below the FY 2015 actual funding received. The FY 2016 appropriated amount is $3.8 million lower than the President's FY 2016 budget request. (These amounts include salaries and expenses that are not directly appropriated.) At the FY 2016 appropriation level of funding, NCSES is maintaining ongoing programs that provide the science policy community and researchers rel-evant, accurate, and timely information on the science and engineering enterprise. NCSES is implementing an enhanced Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) by expanding and recasting the survey sample to collect data and develop estimates for employment outcomes by STEM subfield, race, and gender. This also allows for developing and testing of measures to address data gaps related to understanding the relationship between graduate education and outcomes. 33 NCSES is also developing a survey of research and development funding and performance by nonprofit organizations and presenting a redesigned Science and Engineering Indicators to promote accessibility of data. Highlights of the FY 2017 Budget Request and Major Program Changes The FY 2017 President's budget request of $59.4 million represents a $1.2 million increase over the FY 2016 appropriation. With the FY 2017 requested funding, NCSES would main - tain its core programmatic data collection and publication activities. NCSES would invest in activities that support development of enhanced data access tools, techniques, and visualiza - tions including integration of the Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT) and WebCASPAR, into a combined database and interface to provide easy access to a large body of statistical data resources for science and engineering at U.S. academic institutions; new data collection techniques building on administrative data and other \"big data\" sources; and questionnaire redesign and survey improvements to enhance data on measures of innova-tion and educational and career pathways for scientists and engineers. Additionally, NCSES would continue to pursue significant and strategic targeted improvements in its statistical and analytic programs. NCSES would continue to develop and test new measures from the SDR that address data gaps related to understanding the relationship between Federal support for graduate education and student outcomes such as employment. NCSES would work to close a growing gap in its national estimates for research and development by fielding a survey of re-search activities in nonprofit organizations. Responding to recommendations in the Commit - tee on National Statistics report, Capturing Change in Science, Technology and Innovation, NCSES would develop a conceptual framework for and test potential indicators of innovation. Throughout, NCSES would work to increase international comparability, particularly on the science and engineering workforce and innovation metrics. OFFICE OF RESEARCH, EV ALUATION, AND STATISTICS (ORES) ORES, of the Social Security Administration (SSA), is a principal source of Federal labor, health, economic, and current demographic statistics. ORES performs demographic and socioeconomic research to assess the impact of program changes or alternatives. SSA also collects, tabulates, and publishes data on the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program; the Supplemental Security Income programs and their beneficiary populations; and earnings for people in employment covered under Social Security and Medicare. Congressional Action on the President's FY 2016 Budget Request The FY 2016 appropriation of $26.1 million is $0.7 million below the FY 2016 President's budget request. ORES continues to fund two Disability Research Centers through the Disabil - ity Research Consortium and to conduct disability-related research focusing on collaborative efforts with other government agencies and interagency groups. The agency also continues to fund retirement-related research through the Retirement Research Consortium. ORES funds the design, development, testing, and data collection for an SSA-funded supplement to the re-engineered Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Highlights of the FY 2017 Budget Request and Major Program Changes The FY 2017 President's budget request of $25.3 million is a slight decrease compared to the FY 2016 appropriation. This level of funding would enable ORES to continue its core extra - mural research functions, including: the third year of an initiative to develop and implement a business intelligence platform for research and data development; research and training 34 through the Disability Research and Retirement Research Consortia; supporting the Health and Retirement Study; collecting and coding data for the re-engineered SIPP; and publishing Social Security Programs throughout the World as part of a cooperative effort between ORES and the International Social Security Association. STATISTICS OF INCOME (SOI) SOI, of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which resides in the Treasury Department, is a principal source of Federal income statistics. SOI collects, analyzes, and disseminates infor - mation on the Federal tax system. In support of this mission, SOI annually conducts more than 100 different projects that involve data from tax returns and information documents. Three of SOI's largest projects produce annual income, financial, and tax data collected from individual, corporate, and partnership returns. Tax data reflecting U.S. and international eco-nomic activities are also collected annually from a number of other tax returns with smaller filing populations, including estate, gift, and excise tax returns. In addition, data are collected from information returns filed by tax-exempt organizations, issuers of tax-exempt govern-ment bonds, and fiduciaries of split-interest trusts, as well as from a wide range of informa - tion documents, such as Forms W-2 and 1099. The statistical data gathered, analyzed, and published by SOI are used by other Federal agencies, the White House, Congress, academics, researchers, and the general public to analyze tax policy, project tax revenues, and estimate the overall impact of tax law changes on the economy and the U.S. budget. Congressional Action on the President's FY 2016 Budget Request The FY 2016 appropriation of $36.9 million was $1.0 million less than the President's FY 2016 budget request. With the appropriated funds, SOI continues to support its critical base program requirements and provides all data files and other outputs to its primary customers. Specifically, SOI continues to develop statistical data visualizations, continues to modernize its data applications, and is starting several new projects under its Joint Statistical Research Program, which partners external experts with SOI staff on projects related to tax administra - tion. Further, SOI is releasing new public-use data files, which include anonymized informa - tion on individual taxpayers, and is developing and releasing expanded geographic data files. Highlights of the FY 2017 Budget Request and Major Program Changes The President's budget request of $34.3 million for FY 2017 is $2.6 million less than the FY 2016 appropriation. At this level of funding, SOI would conduct holistic assessments of its various projects to balance workload and resources while attempting to meet expanded statistical requirements resulting from changes in the tax laws. While some datasets may be expanded by supplementing them with administrative data, other series may be deferred or eliminated entirely. SOI would strive to identify linkages between existing data series in order to provide new insights into tax administration and economic issues across tax filing popu - lations. Additionally, SOI would continue work to redesign its public website and develop more interactive tools and data visualizations to improve the user experience. The agency would also expand its efforts to use social media to provide information to the increasingly technology-savvy public. To foster research with the potential to impact tax administration, SOI would continue to sponsor a robust research program, working with experts within and outside government, although resource constraints would potentially limit the scope of this program. SOI would use a portion of its budget for critical upgrades to its information tech - nology infrastructure. Finally, SOI would invest in critical data security features designed to ensure protection of confidential data. 35 CHAPTER 3. OTHER FEDERAL STATISTICAL PROGRAMS, BY DEPARTMENT In addition to the 13 principal statistical agencies, there are approximately 115 other pro- grams throughout the Federal Government that were engaged in statistical activities of at least $500,000 in fiscal year (FY) 2015, or estimated annual budgets of that amount in either FY 2016 or FY 2017. This chapter presents brief descriptions of these other statistical programs and a summary of major FY 2017 programmatic changes, organized by department or inde-pendent agency. 20 Appendix B provides a glossary of agency abbreviations and their department, as well as agency and department websites. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE In addition to two principal statistical agencies (ERS and NASS, discussed in Chapter 2), the Department of Agriculture (USDA) has seven other agencies that maintain statistical pro- grams. USDA produces current demographic; soil, forest, fish, wildlife, and public lands; agriculture; and labor statistics. Statistical Programs The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) monitors and assesses U.S. food consumption by conducting surveys and providing information for food and nutrition-related programs and public policy decisions. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) conducts surveys, program evaluations, and studies to evaluate the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; the Child Nutrition Programs; the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program; and other programs it administers. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) maintains a worldwide agricultural market intelli - gence and commodity reporting service to provide U.S. farmers and traders with information on world agricultural production and trade for use in adjusting to changes in world demand for U.S. agricultural products. Reporting includes data on foreign government policies, analysis of supply and demand conditions, commercial trade relationships, and market opportunities. In addition to survey data, crop condition assessment relies heavily on computerized analyses of satellite, meteorological, agricultural, and related data. The Forest Service (FS) conducts the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, which is the only program that collects, compiles, archives, analyzes, and publishes State, regional, and national inventory information on all ownerships for forest land in the U.S. FIA is man - dated to improve the understanding and management of our Nation's forests by maintaining a continuous, comprehensive inventory of the status, condition, and trends in the health and diversity of the country's forest ecosystems. FIA also monitors urban forests using special field surveys, monitors primary wood using facilities through statistical samples, and develops statistical techniques to query private forest landowners about their resource objectives and management strategies. 20 Compared with the FY 2016 report, this volume omits one Federal agency (Maritime Administration of the De - partment of Transportation) that no longer meets the inclusion criteria of $500,000 in estimated or direct funding for statistical activities in the forthcoming or either of the past two fiscal years. Two additional agencies (Chief Evalu - ation Office of the Department of Labor and Corporation for National and Community Service) have been added. 37 The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) provides information on the status, condition, and trends of the Nation's natural resources, including soil, water, air, plants, ani- mals, energy, and human considerations. NRCS conducts soil surveys to help predict how climate change may affect worldwide agricultural production, and provides snow survey and water supply forecasts to support informed decision-making in the western States and Alaska regarding water resources, including conservation practices. It also assists with the implemen - tation of natural resource conservation practices and systems that meet established technical standards and specifications. NRCS assesses, acquires, develops, interprets, and disseminates natural resource data and information to enable knowledge-based conservation planning and decision making at all landscape scales. The Risk Management Agency (RMA) conducts actuarial analysis for Federal crop insurance programs. The Strategic Data Acquisition and Analysis (SDAA) unit plays an integral role in the Agency's strategic goals to enhance and ensure the integrity of the Federal Crop Insurance program. SDAA directly supports RMA program units that are responsible for ensuring the program's product development, underwriting guidelines, and oversight activities are in ac-cordance with the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended. The World Agricultural Outlook Board (WAOB) serves as USDA's focal point for economic intelligence and the commodity outlook for U.S. and world agriculture. WOAB coordinates, reviews, and approves the monthly World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report, which provides USDA's comprehensive forecasts of supply and demand for major U.S. and global crops and U.S. livestock. WAOB also houses the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility, which monitors the weather and assesses its likely impact on crops around the world. Major Program Changes for FY 2017 FNS' FY 2017 budget request reflects an increase to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Pro-gram for Women, Infants, and Children program to help conduct longitudinal studies that examine longer-term impacts on key health measures like obesity. In response to the 2014 Farm Bill (PL 113-79, Sec. 8301), FS would continue to instruct FIA to revise its Strategic Plan and to address several new issues including an inventory of interior Alaska, improve forest carbon accounting, improve land use and land cover monitoring, and add an urban forest monitoring. NRCS would fully implement the Soil Data Joint Re-correlation Project. This project would include accelerating the collection of soil carbon samples, mapping and digitizing soil sur - veys, and measuring use-dependent soil properties to enable land users to predict how each kind of soil would respond to use, management, and treatment. NRCS would also develop and issue water supply forecasts. NRCS' lower request is due to the fact that an interagency agreement with the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) is no longer needed for the National Resources Inventory. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE In addition to two principal statistical agencies (BEA and Census, discussed in Chapter 2), the Department of Commerce (DOC) has four other agencies that maintain statistical programs. DOC provides current and periodic economic; national accounts; current and periodic demo - graphic; environment; soil, forest, fish, wildlife, and public lands statistics. Statistical Programs The Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) provides oversight and management of the Census Bureau (Census), the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), and the Office of the Chief 38 Economist. Through these efforts, ESA produces in-depth reports, fact sheets, and briefings on economic policy issues and current economic events. Topics range from foreign direct invest - ment in the U.S., the digital economy and trade, and broadband availability in the workplace. The International Trade Administration (ITA) collects and disseminates data on imports, ex- ports, production, prices, and foreign direct investment in the U.S., as well as other economic data to analyze domestic and foreign market situations. ITA also tracks data on international inbound arrivals and U.S. outbound air travel supplemented with spending data on Canadian and Mexican travelers to the U.S. The National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO) in ITA maintains a website to provide statistical data to U.S. companies on international travel to and from the U.S., and projections of international arrivals to the U.S. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) gathers worldwide environ- mental data about the oceans, earth, air, space, and sun and their interactions to describe and predict the state of the physical environment. In fulfillment of this mission, NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) maintains national data centers that preserve and disseminate the agency's climatic, oceanographic, and geophysical data and selected environmental information collected by other agencies. NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) sponsors a broad program of statistical activities to support its mission of environmental stewardship. These activities include the design and implementa - tion of statistical surveys to collect data, produce estimates, and disseminate statistics of total fishing participation, fishing effort, catch, and economic impacts in domestic commercial and recreational fisheries. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) compiles statistical information on patent activity by geographic origin, technological subject matter, ownership, and other characteristics; samples patent and trademark cases to measure quality aspects in the processing of applications; and undertakes customer survey activities. Major Program Changes for FY 2017 ITA has again requested additional funding in FY 2017 (after not receiving the additional funding requested in FY 2016) for NTTO to respond to mandates from the Travel Promotion Act that Commerce continue and expand its research on travel and tourism. The increase for NESDIS's National Centers for Environmental Information's (NCEI's) infor - mation technology (IT) security would improve data flow resiliency across NOAA's critical IT systems and infrastructure. This request is part of a cross-line office initiative with NOAA's Office of Chief Information Officer. NCEI will integrate three NESDIS moderate impact sys - tems into a single security boundary while allowing NCEI to identify and mitigate vulner - abilities; address security vulnerabilities and incorporate available Enterprise web services; automate continuous monitoring, detection, and patching; and sustain current operations at appropriate levels throughout the infrastructure integration. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE The Department of Defense (DOD) has three agencies that maintain statistical programs. DOD is a source of Federal current demographic, economic, health, and transportation statistics. Statistical Programs The Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) acquires, processes, distributes, and archives statistical data on domestic and U.S. foreign waterborne commerce and vessel operations on inland wa-terways and in ports of the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Statistical functions are handled by the Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center (WCSC), an element within the 39 U.S. Army Institute for Water Resources Navigation Data Center. WCSC uses these data to produce monthly, quarterly, and annual calendar year and fiscal year statistics summarized by port and by waterway. Additionally, WCSC maintains a U.S. foreign waterborne transporta - tion database by matching manifest-based data to the Customs and Border Protection vessel movement files for U.S. foreign traffic. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) evaluates TRICARE's health plan and performs design, data collection, and analysis of statistical surveys; prepares forecasts and projections; and develops statistical models for publication, research, and program management. DHA also collects and analyzes data from military hospitals and clinics to identify system-wide outcome measures, proven practices, and innovative methods for financing high quality health care. The Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) maintains the largest archive of personnel, man - power, and training data in DOD. DMDC has a family of analytical centers that provide a central source for personnel surveys, market research, cognitive testing, assessments, and research to support the decision making needs within DOD. Of these, DMDC's Research, Statistics, and Surveys Center is DOD's largest personnel survey program. DMDC's other statistical activities include market research; applied research to improve personnel suitability and reliability poli - cies and operations; and calibration and quality control for vocational testing programs. Major Program Changes for FY 2017 ACE would enhance its information systems to accept real time domestic electronic data in order to improve accuracy of domestic and foreign transportation statistics. ACE would also expand its water transportation data connection with landslide movements, and improve navigation information architecture to support national multimodal freight policy. ACE would collaborate with Customs and Border Protection to improve data communications systems to better target delinquent shippers for Harbor Maintenance Tax audits. DMDC would use the increased funding to provide information technology support for the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) test, including for the delivery of ex-isting operational cognitive ability tests and support for the development of new test items. Additional funding will also provide ASVAB information technology and psychometric sup-port for the delivery of new cognitive and non-cognitive ability tests and support for enhance - ments to the ASVAB Career Exploration Program. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION In addition to one principal agency (NCES, discussed in Chapter 2), the Department of Edu \u00ad cation (ED) has eight other agencies that maintain statistical programs and provide education and health statistics. Statistical Programs The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) conducts education research and evaluations. Its National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE) conducts large scale evaluations of education programs and practices supported by Federal funds; provides research-based technical assistance to educators and policymakers; and supports the synthesis and the widespread dissemination of the results of education-related research and evaluation throughout the U.S. The IES National Center for Education Research (NCER) supports rigor - ous research that addresses the Nation's most pressing education needs from early childhood to adult education. IES' National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER) supports surveys and research to expand the knowledge and understanding of the educational needs of infants, toddlers, and children with disabilities. 40 The Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education (OCTAE) (formerly called the Office of Vocational and Adult Education) administers programs that are related to adult education and literacy, career and technical education, and community colleges. OCTAE provides funding to collect State performance data for the Career and Technical Education program. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) supports the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC), for - merly called the Elementary and Secondary School Survey (E&S Survey), which collects data on key education and civil rights issues in our Nation's public schools. CRDC collects a variety of information, including student enrollment and educational programs and services, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, sex, limited English proficiency, and disability. The Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) supports evaluations of the im- plementation of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Titles I and II, the National Indian Education Study, an evaluation of the Comprehensive Assistance Centers, and an impact evaluation of principal support. In addition, OESE handles the Migrant Student Information Exchange, the technology that allows States to share educational and health infor - mation on migrant children who travel from State to State and who, as a result, have student records in multiple States' information systems. The Office of Innovation and Improvement (OII) manages programs that fund evaluations conducted by IES, including an evaluation of Investing in Innovation Fund. In addition, OII supports technical assistance to improve data quality. The Office of Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development (OPEPD) develops long term cost estimates for the Federal student aid programs, using such data as the Pell Grant applicant file, the National Student Loan Data System, Census data, and a range of longitudinal surveys conducted by NCES In addition, it oversees the Data Quality Initiative, an on-going project to improve data on elementary and secondary program performance The Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) formulates Federal postsecondary education policy and administers programs to increase access to quality postsecondary education. OPE collects participant data to assess the effectiveness of TRIO Upward Bound, a program to pre-pare low income elementary and secondary students for postsecondary education.

The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) supports the collection and dissemina - tion of local, State, and national occupational, wage, and other labor market information, as well as the production of Unemployment Insurance (UI) information, for the administration of employment, training, and UI programs. ETA conducts research and evaluation activities to inform development of workforce investment policies and guidance through research and evaluation. ETA also funds the annual National Agricultural Workers Survey which provides data on migration history, type of crops worked, unemployment, benefits, housing, health care, and use of public programs. ETA's statistical activities are funded through Training and Employment Services' annual set-aside for research and evaluations of employment and train - ing programs. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) collects and analyzes current informa- tion on employment, production, and accidents, injuries, and illnesses in the mining industry. The data provide current accident, injury, and illness information to MSHA's enforcement personnel, and to engineering, education, and training staff. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has overall responsibility for the national injury and illness recordkeeping system, which is based on employer records, and is used to provide the frame from which sample cases are selected in the annual BLS Oc- 53 cupational Safety and Health Survey. OSHA also maintains the OSHA Information System, a web-based application hosting detailed data on occupational injuries from employers that are inspected or receive consultation. The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) assists Federal contractors in meeting their equal employment opportunity and affirmative action obligations. Statistical activities include supporting the use of statistical methodology in agency desk audits, onsite inspections, and compliance evaluations; and advising partners on statistical matters relating to reconciliation, settlement, and litigation of cases. The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) supports surveys of occupational wages in selected industries. Data are used to determine prevailing wage rates and fringe benefits for service occupations in Federal procurement activity. Major Program Changes for FY 2017 DOL's evaluation set-aside authority was increased in FY 2016 to allow up to 0.75 percent of specified operating budgets to be transferred to CEO for evaluation projects, and although statistical and evaluation activities have not decreased, the set-aside process has decreased evaluation budgets within some DOL agencies, particularly ETA, reflecting the shift to CEO in FY 2017. OSHA's request reflects an increase which would allow OSHA to consolidate its database, make the database compatible with the DOL operating environment, and provide more avail - able data to the public. OSHA's request would also provide for staffing a new Data Analytics Unit, which would work on identifying strategies and tools to control exposure to workplace hazards through the collection of data in order to prevent occupational illness and injury. In addition, OSHA's request includes an increase to complete the development of an electronic, web-based system for employers to submit required data to the agency as part of the \"Im - proved Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses\" final rule provisions. DEPARTMENT OF STATE The Department of State (State) has one agency that maintains statistical programs. It is a source of Federal health statistics. Statistical Programs The Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) in the Department of State is re- sponsible for assuring accountability of The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. OGAC is also responsible for the development and communication of knowledge-based prac - tices to improve program performance, as well as the systematic definition, collection, stor - age, analysis, and reporting of information about the Emergency Plan's progress in reaching its goals and the impact of programmatic activities funded to reach these goals. Major Program Changes for FY 2017 No major program changes are expected. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION In addition to one principal statistical agency (BTS, discussed in Chapter 2), the Department of Transportation (DOT) has seven other agencies that maintain statistical programs. DOT is a source of Federal transportation statistics. 54 Statistical Programs The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) collects, analyzes and disseminates data and sta- tistics on a wide range of aviation airline and airport performance metrics, including infor - mation on aviation accidents, incidents and investigations; airlines and airports; airmen and aircrafts; aircraft activity; and aviation forecasts. FAA also manages the Aviation Safety Re-porting Program (ASRP), which compiles and analyzes safety-related reports and sends out Safety Alerts to FAA, airport authorities, manufacturers, airlines, repair stations, and others for the purpose of identifying safety hazards and promoting corrective action to prevent ac - cidents and incidents. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) collects, analyzes, and disseminates data on the Nation's highway system, including financing, travel, fuel consumption, vehicle registra- tions, highway system extent and safety, drivers licenses, and personal travel characteristics. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) collects and analyzes data on motor carriers and on commercial vehicle drivers and crashes. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) collects and disseminates data on the railroad system, including traffic, safety, and accident reports, such as intermodal safety data for the geographic information system, and information on grade crossings and inspections. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) maintains the primary database for statistics on the transit industry, known as the National Transit Database (NTD). NTD collects financial, operating and capital asset data from more than 700 transit systems operating in urbanized areas, and from over 1,300 transit systems operating in rural areas. The Drug and Alcohol Management Information System (DAMIS) collects annual drug and alcohol data from all FTA grantees and their contractors to determine the national random testing rate and candi - dates for compliance audits. The Transit Safety and Security Statistics Report and Analysis project collects, analyzes, and disseminates transit safety and security data. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) collects, analyzes, and dis- seminates information on motor vehicle traffic crashes as well as on vehicle and highway safety programs. NHTSA maintains primary crash databases, including the National Automo-tive Sampling System and the Fatality Analysis Reporting System. NHTSA publishes and distributes annual traffic safety assessment and national occupant protection use data as well as analytical reports on a wide range of traffic safety topics at the national and State levels. NHTSA also provides leadership in promotion of improvements in the quality and effective - ness of States' statistical programs through research, development of guidelines, and traffic records assessments. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) collects geographic information system (GIS), frequency of failure, and incident and accident data analyzing the causes and resulting consequences to improve hazardous materials transportation safety . Major Program Changes for FY 2017 FHWA's request reflects plans to acquire an Urban Congestion Report analysis contract and increased estimated costs for the National Performance Measurement Research Data Set data contract. FMCSA's request includes an increase to support an expansion of analytical capabilities in FY 2017 to improve data quality, expand the suite of analytical tools, and conduct analyses of key safety issues. 55 FRA would implement and e nforce upcoming safety regulations, including new data collec - tion and management requirements for the Railroad Safety Information System. NHTSA's request would allow the agency to continue the Data Modernization Project to im- prove its primary crash databases, including the Fatality Analysis Reporting System and the National Automotive Sampling System. NHTSA's funding would support redesigned data collection sites for NHTSA's Crash Investigation Sampling System, the Crash Report Sam \u00ad pling System, and statistical analysis and dissemination of data collected from the modernized system PHMSA would implement the Using Data to Improve Safety initiative which includes En- hanced Data Analysis for Better Decision Making where an Office of Planning and Analytics would be established to enhance pipeline safety analysis functions. This analysis would en-able PHMSA to identify trends in the industry and economy to become more predictive in de-termining regulatory priorities, risk-based enforcement decisions, research and development, and technology investments. In addition, PHMSA's request includes an increase to support the Information Sharing System which would record and report the results and findings from in-spections to all affected parties including Federal and State inspectors and pipeline operators. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has five agencies that maintain statistical programs. The VA is a source of Federal current demographic and health statistics. Statistical Programs The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) uses projected veteran death statistics to esti- mate future demand for burial space and other memorial benefits. NCA uses projected living veteran statistics to estimate the number of veterans residing in areas considered served by national and State veterans' cemeteries as well as the estimated number of unserved veterans in areas considered for development of new national and State veterans' cemeteries. NCA also conducts annual surveys of customer satisfaction with National Cemeteries, State and Tribal Veterans Cemeteries, and Memorial Programs Products and Services, as well as periodic sur - veys of veterans regarding their preferences related to burial and memorial benefits. The VA Office of Inspector General (VAOIG) provides detailed analysis, planning, and co- ordination of statutorily required audits, evaluations, and inspections of VA programs and facilities throughout the Nation. The Office of Policy and Planning (OPP) has two agencies conducting statistical activities. First, the Office of the Actuary (OACT) provides Advanced Modeling and Actuarial Services to VA. OACT provides official veterans population projections for VA planning and budget-ing; develops corporate predictive modeling and forecasts to support decision making about VA capital investments and future demand for VA services and benefits; and provides actuarial estimation for VA liability (such as Compensation, Pension, and Burial benefits, and for Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses, Medical Malpractice and Other Tort Claims). Second, the National Center for V eterans Analysis and Statistics (NCVAS) coordinates with other VA of- fices to collect, validate, analyze, and disseminate official statistics on the veteran population and VA programs. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) supports continuing analyses of veterans and VBA beneficiaries. The analyses cover VA compensation and pension, education, loan guar - anty, vocational rehabilitation and employment services, and insurance programs. Priority statistical programs include the ongoing collection, improvement, and analysis of core data in areas such as disability, income, economic security, homelessness, and poverty. 56 The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) performs research on health services and medi - cal conditions, including studies on veterans' care in VA health care facilities. VHA performs statistical activities in support of patient safety, clinical outcomes analysis, research oversight, dental care, health administration, and other business activities. VHA also conducts research in traumatic brain injuries, burn injuries, pain, and post-deployment mental health of veterans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom. VHA uses statistical analysis and statistical methods to measure characteristics of patient flow through emergency departments and inpatient settings to enhance access to care and minimize delays. Major Program Changes for FY 2017 NCA's funding increase would allow for significant program improvements, including an evaluation of the statistical analysis conducted with collected operational data. The Office of Policy and Planning (OPP) plans to transition into the Office of Enterprise In - tegration (OEI). OPP's funding increase for FY 2017 is a result of the new OEI plan to add additional employees and increase contractual costs for statistics and analytics services. VHA would continue the new Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients program that address requirements of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act to comprehen - sively assess veterans' experiences with VA care and community care (covered by VA). VHA would also provide capacity modeling and data queries in support of the new 20-day compen-sation and pension timeliness measure and the transition to the new VBA mandatory funds Medical Disability Exam (MDE) contract. The Health Eligibility Center within VHA would transition the National Enrollment Improvement pilot program to a nationwide operational program. In addition, VHA's request would allow the Palo Alto Healthcare System Women's Health Services to develop a multi-year database designed to efficiently and flexibly answer emerging questions of importance to Women's Health. STATISTICAL PROGRAMS OF OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) is a source of Federal social and demographic statistics. BBG oversees and coordinates the research and statistical functions for all broad - casting entities under its purview, including the Voice of America, Office of Cuba Broadcast - ing, Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks. BBG consolidates its research function into a centralized International Audience Research Project so that all entities and broadcasters can be assured of current, reliable, and statistically-valid market and audience research on a periodic basis. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is a source of Federal safety statistics. CPSC conducts data collection, analysis and dissemination activities on consumer product-re- lated hazards and potential hazards. As part of its statistical program, CPSC maintains the Na-tional Electronic Injury Surveillance System that provides national consumer product-related injury statistics based on reporting from a sample of hospital emergency rooms. CPSC col - lects data for non-consumer product-related injuries for other Federal agencies. CPSC's new public database, authorized under the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 and implemented in March 2011, collects consumer reports of potentially unsafe consumer prod-ucts and provides businesses with an opportunity to comment on those reports. Further, the database can be used to aggregate cases for analysis and view consumer reports and business responses for the public to use when making consumer-product related decisions. The Corporation for National and Community Service 's (CNCS) mission is to improve lives, strengthen communities, and foster civic engagement through service and volunteering. The Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE) advances the mission of the Corporation by build - 57 ing knowledge about the effectiveness of national service, social innovation, civic engage - ment, and volunteering as solutions to community needs. ORE collects data from its national service members and volunteers, its grantees, and, in some cases, the recipients of grantee services. In addition, ORE funds a research grant program that supports university-based civic engagement research. CNCS also sponsors a supplement on volunteering and civic engage - ment on the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is a source of natural resources, energy, and environment statistics. EPA monitors the quality of air; drinking, surface, and ground water; ecosystem status; and use and release of toxic or hazardous substances. Projects include State and local programs to report ambient air quality levels of pollutants and estimated emissions of pollutants from major stationary sources, and projection of future air quality levels through models that take into account past air quality monitoring data and emission data. Other sta - tistical activities develop methods to document the distribution and determinants of exposure to pollutants experienced by the population, and methods to measure the potential effects of pollutants on human health and ecosystems. The Gulf of Mexico Program engages in a variety of statistical activities to inform restoration of the ecological and economic health of the Gulf of Mexico. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is a source of current Federal de- mographic statistics. EEOC collects workforce demographic composition data from public and private employers, and membership composition data from union and labor organiza - tions. These data are used to carry out EEOC's enforcement activities under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and are also used by other Federal, State, Tribal, and local agencies charged with enforcement of equal employment opportunity laws. The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) is a source of Federal education sta- tistics. IMLS supports the collection and analysis of data about the public use of libraries, museums, and online resources to support lifelong learning. Projects include an annual sur - vey of public library collections, programs, and finance, and a household survey to examine the use of library and museum services across the Nation. The research is designed to iden-tify national needs for and trends in museum, library, and information services; to measure and report on the impact and effectiveness of library services throughout the Nation; and to strengthen national, State, Tribal, local, regional, and international communications and co-operative networks. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is a source of Federal environ- ment statistics. NASA collects remotely-sensed data to improve understanding of and con- tribute to improved predictive capability for climate, weather, and natural hazards. NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) conducts research and development ac - tivities to maximize the impact of satellite observations. GMAO supports the National Cli-mate Assessment (NCA) by providing tools that synthesize and integrate the existing satellite (and conventional) data streams to enable an ongoing, permanent assessment capacity and capability. The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports all fields of fundamental science and en- gineering, except for medical sciences. Accordingly, NSF is a source of Federal education, economic, health, and current demographic statistics. In addition to the work of NCSES (dis-cussed in Chapter 2), NSF is tasked with keeping the U.S. at the leading edge of discovery in a wide range of scientific areas, ranging from astronomy to geology to zoology. The Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) in NSF maintains biological science research databases that include scientific information used in the health sciences such as genetic map data, data on the anatomy and circuitry of the nervous system, and three dimensional maps of the human 58 brain integrated with neuroscience information. The Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) in NSF supports the Project and Program Evaluation (PPE) program for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education program evaluation. The EHR Directorate conducts program evaluations to assess the quality and impact of its pro-grams; supports international assessments of student knowledge and curriculum; and oversees contextual studies and indicators that monitor progress under NSF educational programs. The Social and Economic Sciences (SES) in NSF supports basic research on survey measurement, data collection procedures, and statistical issues related to survey design. The surveys, and other statistical products supported in SES, are national resources for research, teaching, and decision making and have become models for similar undertakings in other fields and in other nations. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) in the Executive Office of the President (EOP) is a source of Federal social and demographic statistics. ONDCP uses primary and secondary information collections to produce statistics that inform its management and evalu - ation of the Drug Free Communities (DFC) program. The Small Business Administration (SBA) is a source of Federal economic statistics. SBA supports the production of employer firm size data, including the Census Bureau's Statistics of U.S. Businesses and Business Dynamics Statistics; conducts policy, economic, and statisti-cal research on issues of concern to small business; and publishes statistics on small business characteristics and contributions. The Social Security Administration (SSA) is a source of Federal health and current demo- graphic statistics. In addition to the work of the principal statistical agency, ORES (discussed in Chapter 2), SSA collects, tabulates, and publishes data on the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance, and the Supplemental Security Income programs and their beneficiary populations. Additionally, SSA conducts in-depth statistical analyses to inform policymaking relevant to retirement and the economic security of older Americans. In FY 2014, the Office of Program Development and Research (OPDR) became the Office of Research, Demonstration, and Employment Support (ORDES). The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is a source of Federal health and current demographic statistics. USAID uses standardized surveys to collect information across countries to measure key indicators including infant and child mortality, fertility, fam - ily planning use, maternal health, child immunization, and malnutrition levels. Additionally, USAID supports capacity building in statistical offices in developing countries. USAID funds Famine Early Warning Systems Network, which brings together local, regional, and interna - tional partners from the government, private sector, and academia to provide early warning data on food security issues. Major Program Changes for FY 2017 BBG's request reflects an increase to invest in research on impact studies to engage next-generation influencers who use mobile, social, and digital media in areas experiencing violent extremism, to assist in developing audience loyalty and trust for BBG's expanding Russian media, and to increase the impact of digital media in Cuba and Latin America. CPSC's request reflects an increase in funding for the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) program to support data enhancements to the NEISS system, to increase hospital partnerships, and to support contract cost escalations. CNCS's ORE seeks to support an ambitious research and evaluation agenda capable of sys- tematically and directly assessing the implementation, outcomes, and impact of CNCS poli- 59 cies, programs and practices. CNCS would continue to expand its statistical program from one primarily focused on the collection and reporting of national population statistics (on volunteering and civic engagement) to one capable of generating scientific evidence for its grant programs and its grant-making strategies. As required by the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA would determine whether or not to regulate at least five contaminants on the current Contaminant Candidate List 4 by refining prelimi - nary findings, and later in the year, conducting analyses to respond to public comments on the proposed list. EEOC would conduct the annual EEO-1 Survey of Private Industrial Sectors and the biennial EEO-3 Survey of Local Referral Union and EEO-5 Survey of Elementary-Secondary School Staff. EEOC would also make needed system changes, develop edit checks and reports, and hire additional staff for possible collection of pay data for the 2017 EEO-1 Survey of Private Industrial Sectors. IMLS' new statistical projects would include developing the Museum Universe Data File and Visualization Tool, a list of known museums and similar organizations (e.g., zoos, botanic gar - dens, historic sites) in the U.S., from its current status as a static public-use file updated twice a year, and issuing a report in early 2017 on findings from the first National Household Survey about Public Needs for Library and Museums Services (PNLMS). IMLS's requested increase would also support research, data collection, and evaluation to address the needs of the mu-seum and library fields through grants, cooperative agreements, and interagency agreements. NASA's request reflects a decrease due to the need to fund higher priority Earth Science activities. NASA's remaining funds would support the creation of global climate and Earth system component models using data from Earth science satellites and aircraft. SSA's ORDES would increase funding for the Promoting Opportunity Demonstration (POD) project, which was mandated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. This increased support would be used for the design and development of a new demonstration to test whether a ben-efit offset of the Disability Insurance Program improves employment of beneficiaries and re-duces outlays. The ORDES request also reflects a decrease in Section 1110 because the Early Intervention Initiative would no longer need funding past FY 2016. 60 CHAPTER 4: STATISTICAL STANDARDS, INTERAGENCY GROUPS, AND COLLABORATIVE INNOV ATIONS This chapter is organized into three sections. The first section provides brief descriptions of directives, standards, and guidelines for statistical activities within the U.S. Federal Govern-ment. Given their nature, these items are revised only periodically. The next section describes various interagency groups and their efforts to improve the quality and utility of the Nation's statistical products. The final section describes ongoing and new collaborations among the Federal statistical programs to promote innovations and efficiencies in the production of Fed-eral statistics. STATISTICAL POLICY DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS, AND GUIDELINES Fundamental Responsibilities of Federal Statistical Agencies and Recognized Statistical Units Trust in the accuracy, objectivity, and reliability of Federal statistics is essential to the ongo-ing and increasingly complex policy and planning needs of governmental and private users of these products. These data must be objective and free of bias in their presentation and available to all in forms that are readily accessible and understandable. As part of an ongoing effort to improve the relevance, timeliness, accuracy, objectivity, and integrity of information collected and disseminated by the Federal Government, OMB published Statistical Policy Di- rective No. 1: Fundamental Responsibilities of Federal Statistical Agencies and Recognized Statistical Units in 2014, which affirms the fundamental responsibilities of Federal statistical agencies and recognized statistical units in the design, collection, processing, editing, com - pilation, analysis, release, and dissemination of statistical information. Prepared in response to requests from agencies across the Federal Statistical System, the directive is intended to provide a unified, concise framework for governance of official statistics. Throughout the directive, connections between the directive, related OMB policy, and pertinent professional guidance are underscored. Federal departments hosting a Federal principal statistical agency or recognized statistical unit responded to OMB Policy Memorandum 15-03 Department Support for Implementation of Statistical Policy Directive No. 1: Fundamental Responsibilities of Federal Statistical Agen - cies and Recognized Statistical Units describing how they support achievement of these re-sponsibilities by their relevant agencies. Responses identified best practices, new challenges, and areas in need of future support. These results have led to efforts to improve Federal guid-ance in these areas, as described further below. Statistical Standards and Guidance on Agency Survey Collections In 2006, OMB issued a revision to Statistical Policy Directive No. 2: Standards and Guide - lines for Statistical Surveys, which provides guidance for designing, conducting, and dis-seminating statistical surveys and studies sponsored by Federal agencies. The standards and guidelines are intended to ensure that surveys and studies produce reliable data as efficiently as possible and that methods are documented and results presented in a manner that makes the data as accessible and useful as possible. As part of its routine review of Federal statistical policy directives to ensure the continued relevance and accuracy of Federal statistics, OMB issued an addendum in 2016 to Statistical 61 Policy Directive No. 2. The addendum, Standards and Guidelines for Cognitive Interviews, establishes rigorous standards for the use of cognitive interviews in Federal information col - lections. These guidelines, which provide information on conducting, analyzing, and report - ing on cognitive interviews, are intended to ensure that the results of statistical surveys spon - sored by the Federal Government are as reliable and useful as possible while minimizing respondent burden. To assist agencies in preparing their information collection requests (ICRs) under the Paper - work Reduction Act (PRA), OMB issued guidance on agency survey and statistical informa- tion collections in 2006. This document, entitled Questions and Answers When Designing Surveys for Information Collections , is updated periodically and is intended for a broad audi- ence of personnel who prepare ICRs but may not be familiar with some survey and statistical concepts. The guidance provides answers to a host of frequently asked questions about the OMB clearance process and expectations for key elements in the design and documentation of Federal statistical surveys. More information regarding OMB's statistical standards and guidance is available at www.WhiteHouse.gov/omb/inforeg_statpolicy/. Directives on the Release and Dissemination of Statistical Products Statistical Policy Directive No. 3: Compilation, Release, and Evaluation of Principal Federal Economic Indicators, last updated in 1985, provides for the designation of statistical series that provide timely measures of economic activity as Principal Federal Economic Indicators, and requires prompt but orderly release of such indicators. The intent of the directive is to: strike a balance between data timeliness and accuracy, preserve the time value of the eco-nomic indicators, prevent early access to information that may affect financial and commod - ity markets, preserve the distinction between the policy-neutral release of data by statistical agencies and their interpretation by policy officials, and provide for periodic evaluation of each indicator. To further support the quality and integrity of Federal statistical information, in 2008 OMB published Statistical Policy Directive No. 4: Release and Dissemination of Statistical Prod- ucts Produced by Federal Statistical Agencies that is designed to preserve and enhance the objectivity and transparency, in fact and in perception, of the processes used to release and disseminate the Government's statistical products. Statistical Policy Directive No. 4 covers Federal statistical products that are not covered by Statistical Policy Directive No. 3: Com- pilation, Release, and Evaluation of Principal Federal Economic Indicators ; these include products that statistical agencies release in such areas as crime, education, health, and trans-portation. In 2016, OMB published a Federal Register Notice requesting public feedback on a proposed addendum to Statistical Policy Directive No. 4, which would further align Statisti - cal Policy Directive No. 4 with Statistical Policy Directive No. 3 by adding a requirement for systematic agency self-review of key statistical products. Statistical Confidentiality and Statistical Data Sharing The Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002 (CIPSEA) es- tablishes a uniform set of safeguards to protect the confidentiality of individually identifiable information acquired from the public for statistical purposes, and imposes strong criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure of such information. The legislation reaffirms that agen - cies collecting data will honor pledges of confidentiality and gives additional weight and stature to policies that statistical agencies have pursued for decades, assuring respondents who provide statistical information that their responses will be held in confidence and will not be used against them in any government action. CIPSEA also authorizes the sharing of busi-ness data among BEA, BLS, and Census. Thus, CIPSEA provides a framework to enhance 62 the efficiency of the Federal statistical system by reducing reporting burden on the public and strengthening the quality and usefulness of the Nation's Federal statistics. A companion legislative proposal would make complementary changes to provisions set forth in the \"Statistical Use\" section of the Internal Revenue Code. These changes would represent the first major revision of these policies in decades, reducing the amount of sensitive tax in-formation that will change hands to support statistical programs while substantially increasing the effectiveness of that support. A legislative proposal to accomplish these aims was devel - oped by BEA, BLS, and Census in collaboration with OMB's Statistical and Science Policy Office; endorsed by the Treasury Department; and cleared by the Administration. It is cur - rently forming the basis for discussion with relevant congressional committees and potential sponsors. To assist agencies in implementing the confidentiality provisions of CIPSEA, OMB issued implementation guidance in the Federal Register on June 15, 2007 (entitled, Implementation Guidance for Title V of the E-Government Act, Confidential Information Protection and Sta-tistical Efficiency Act of 2002 (CIPSEA) ). The Interagency Confidentiality and Data Access Committee (CDAC), which operates un-der the auspices of the Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology (FCSM), considers common issues involving data access, confidentiality, and disclosure limitation. The group has several products that are available on its website (fcsm.sites.usa.gov/committees/cdac/), including best practices for disclosure limitation. CDAC sponsors seminars and members conduct tutorials on confidentiality under the auspices of the Washington Statistical Society and other organizations to promote discussion of techniques and issues related to the protec - tion of confidential data. With the passage of the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 in December 2015, the Federal statistical community has an opportunity to welcome the further protection of its confidential data offered by the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Einstein 3A cybersecurity protection program. The DHS cybersecurity program's objective is to protect Federal civilian information systems from malicious attacks. The Federal statistical system's objective is to ensure that the DHS Secretary performs those essential duties in a manner that honors the Government's statutory promises to the public to protect their confidential data. Both DHS and the Federal statistical system need to find a way to balance both objectives and have successfully engaged in consultations to achieve these mutually reinforcing objectives. Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Area Delineations OMB delineates Metropolitan Statistical Areas, Metropolitan Divisions, Micropolitan Sta-tistical Areas, Combined Statistical Areas, and New England City and Town Areas for use in Federal statistical activities. To ensure their continued usefulness and relevance, the standards for defining areas are reviewed and, if necessary, revised in the years preceding their appli - cation to new Decennial Census data. Between Decennial Censuses, OMB issues periodic updates of the areas based on Census Bureau population and commuting data. The most recent Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Area delineations were published in Bulletin No. 15-01 . These 2015 delineations reflect the application of the 2010 OMB Stan \u00ad dards for Delineating Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas to 2012 and 2013 Cen- sus Bureau population data and 2006-2010 American Community Survey journey-to-work data. The 2015 delineations include the following current statistical areas in the United States and Puerto Rico: 389 Metropolitan Statistical Areas, including 11 Metropolitan Statistical Areas that have a total of 31 Metropolitan Divisions; 556 Micropolitan Statistical Areas; 174 Combined Statistical Areas; 39 New England City and Town Areas; and 7 Combined New 63 England City and Town Areas. Approximately 94 percent of the U.S. population falls within this classification\u2014about 86 percent in Metropolitan Statistical Areas and about 9 percent in Micropolitan Statistical Areas. 21 North American Industry Classification System The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) represents a continuing interna - tional effort by Statistics Canada; the Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda (INEGI) of Mexico; and the United States, through OMB's Economic Classification Policy Committee (ECPC), to foster comparability in the industrial statistics produced by the three countries. In 1997, NAICS replaced the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification and a process was es-tablished to ensure comparable implementation across all three countries. NAICS has been adopted by Federal statistical agencies that collect or publish data by industry. Like its prede - cessor, NAICS also is widely used by State agencies, trade associations, businesses, and other organizations. NAICS is scheduled for review and, if necessary, update every five years for years ending in two and seven. The 2012 revision to NAICS included changes focusing on clarifications for outsourcing and classification of establishments providing logistics services. In addition, industry level detail in the manufacturing sector was modified to reflect the dynamic nature of the sector's structure. A complete list of the final changes for 2012 is available on the NAICS website (www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/ ). The review and update of NAICS for 2017 was successfully negotiated with Canada and Mexico and will be implemented in statistical programs for data beginning with reference year 2017. The revision included a review and update of the industries for oil and gas extrac - tion based on the rapid changes seen in those areas. A complete list of all proposed changes for 2017 was published in the Federal Register and is available on the NAICS website. These changes were deemed final in OMB's Federal Register notice on August 8, 2016. Just as NAICS has facilitated comparisons of economic activity among its North American partners, there is also significant value in fostering comparability of industrial statistics from a variety of international, regional, and national classifications. Concordances provide a valu-able tool for such comparisons. A working group, including the ECPC, Eurostat, INEGI, Sta - tistics Canada, and the United Nations Statistics Division, developed concordances among NAICS United States 2002, the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the Eu - ropean Union (NACE Rev. 1.1), and the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC Rev. 3.1). NAICS, NACE, and ISIC were all revised in 2007. Continuing to build on the initial work, a concordance between NAICS United States, 2012 and ISIC Rev. 4 is complete and available on the NAICS website. North American Product Classification System Because a production-based industry classification system does not meet all of the varying needs of business data users, OMB proposed an initiative in 1999 to develop a comprehensive classification system for the products produced by NAICS industries. Like NAICS, this ini-tiative is a joint effort by Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The long-term objective of the North American Product Classification System (NAPCS) is to develop a market-oriented system for products that is not industry-of-origin based; can be linked to the industry structure of NAICS; is consistent across the three NAICS countries; and promotes improvements in the identification and classification of products across international classification systems, such as the Central Product Classification system of the United Nations. 21 Percentages may not add to the indicated total due to rounding. 64 BEA, BLS, and Census worked together to ensure that product data solicitations in the Eco- nomic Census are collectible, meet the needs of business and academic users, and also meet the needs of the Producer Price program and the National Accounts. Provisional NAPCS products were included on Economic Census questionnaires for all service industries in 2007. The 2012 Economic Census included provisional NAPCS products for manufactured goods, wholesale trade services, and retail trade services. The Census Bureau is planning to imple - ment NAPCS products for all sectors covered by the Economic Census in 2017. Canada, Mexico, and the United States agreed on a final aggregation structure for the NAPCS classification, and the structure and all trilateral products (common among all three countries) are posted on the NAPCS website (www.census.gov/eos/www/napcs). Each product carries a common title, definition, and product code across all industries that produce it, and the ag-gregation structure groups products (regardless of industry of production) in a manner that reflects how products are used from a demand-side perspective. The resulting classification will enhance analyses of market share, demand for goods and services, import competition, and similar studies. Standard Occupational Classification System The Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) is a system for classifying all jobs in the economy into occupational categories based on the work performed and, in some cases, on the skills, education, or training needed to perform the work at a competent level. The 2010 SOC classifies jobs in the private sector, public sector, and military into 840 occupations organized into 23 major groups. The SOC provides a means to compare occupational data across agen-cies and over time. It is designed to reflect the current occupational structure in the U.S. and to cover all occupations in which work is performed for pay or profit. OMB chartered the SOC Policy Committee (SOCPC) 22 to conduct SOC revisions for 2000, 2010, and 2018, and to support SOC users between revisions, ensuring that the SOC remains relevant and meets the needs of individuals and organizations. The next revision is scheduled for release in 2018; work on the 2018 SOC began in FY 2013. The SOCPC began soliciting public comment through the Federal Register on May 22, 2014. After reviewing the comments received, the SOCPC prepared its recommendations to OMB. These recommendations were published by OMB for public comment in the Federal Register on July 22, 2016 (www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-07-22/pdf/2016-17424.pdf ). Subsequent- ly, OMB and the SOCPC plan to review and evaluate comments received. Final decisions for the 2018 SOC revision would then be published by OMB in the spring of 2017. The planned 2018 SOC implementation follows the 2017 NAICS revision and coincides with the beginning year of the American Community Survey's set of surveys that surround the 2020 Decennial Census. After the SOC's revision for 2018 is complete, OMB intends to consider revisions of the SOC every 10 years thereafter. Information about the SOC, including updates on the revision process for 2018, is available at www.bls.gov/soc/home.htm. 22 The SOCPC includes members from the Department of Commerce (Census Bureau); Department of Defense (Defense Manpower Data Center); Department of Education (National Center for Education Statistics); Department of Health and Human Services (Health Resources and Services Administration); Department of Labor (Bureau of Labor Statistics; Employment and Training Administration); Department of Transportation (Bureau of Transportation Statistics); Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; National Science Foundation (National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics) 65 INTERAGENCY GROUPS Interagency Council on Statistical Policy An explicit statutory basis for OMB's council of statistical agency heads was provided in 1995 by the Paperwork Reduction Act reauthorization (44 U.S.C. 3504(e)(8)). Known as the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy (ICSP), this group enables OMB to obtain more di - rect participation from the agencies in planning and coordinating Federal statistical activities. Chaired by the U.S. Chief Statistician, the members of ICSP currently include the heads of the principal statistical agencies, as described in Chapter 1 of this report, plus representatives of other statistical agencies under rotating membership. Because the members have management responsibility for statistical programs in their respective agencies, their advice and coopera-tion are essential for effective implementation of OMB statistical policy decisions and for planning improvements in Federal statistical programs. ICSP is a vehicle for coordinating statistical work, particularly when activities and issues cut across agencies; for exchanging information about agency programs and activities; and for providing advice and counsel to OMB on statistical matters. In the past year, agenda top-ics included, among others: data systems modernization (e.g., Data Science concepts and approaches; increasing statistical agencies' visibility in policy discussions; alternative data sources for official statistics; the Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology Subcommit - tee on Administrative, Alternative, and Blended Data; Open Data Initiative; Statistical Uses of Administrative Records; the Commission on Evidence-based Policymaking; and train - ing the workforce for the 21 st century Federal statistical system); statistical confidentiality and cybersecurity (e.g., Implications of the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act; Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Einstein 3A Cybersecurity Memorandum of Agreement with other Federal Agencies: Incorporating Statistical Confidentiality Provisions; and Federal IT Acqui-sition Reform Act (FITARA) and its implementation guidelines); statistical guidelines and their communication (e.g., Fundamental Responsibilities of Federal Statistical Agencies and Recognized Statistical Units); and efficiencies in statistical production (e.g., joint funding of statistical activities; areas for collaboration with the DHS Office of Immigration Statistics; and Federal Research Data Center partnerships and governance). Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology The Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology (FCSM) was founded by OMB's Statisti - cal and Science Policy Office in 1975 to assist in carrying out its role in setting and coordinat-ing statistical policy. While the particular issues have evolved, the mission of FCSM remains to inform and advise OMB and ICSP on the need for and content of methodological and statistical policies and guidance; compile, assess, and disseminate information on statistical or survey methods and practices for Federal statistical agencies and components (e.g., survey measurement and errors, data collection methods and technologies, record linkage, and dis-semination of information) that affect data quality; provide a forum for statisticians across Federal agencies to discuss issues affecting Federal statistical programs; and promote and support cooperative research across agencies on issues relevant to Federal statistics. FCSM carries out a broad agenda of activities. It hosts subcommittees on a variety of topics, such as confidentiality and data access and adaptive survey design to facilitate agency discus-sions and development in these areas. Over the past year, its new subcommittee on Alterna - tive, Administrative and Big Data conducted a scan of Federal agencies focused on identifying common challenges, improvements to existing programs, facilitation of new programs, and increased efficiencies resulting from the use of alternative data sources; and its subcommit - tee on Questionnaire Evaluation Methods produced an inventory of Questionnaire Pretesting 66 Methods published by FCSM and recommended that OMB issue an addendum to Statistical Policy Directive No. 2 providing standards and guidelines for cognitive interviewing. OMB solicited public comment on this recommended addendum, and in 2016, published it ( www. WhiteHouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/inforeg/directive2/final_addendum_to_stat_policy_ dir_2.pdf). Over the years, FCSM has published a series of Statistical Policy Working Papers, as well as proceedings from FCSM seminars and conferences. FCSM alternates between holding statistical policy seminars and research conferences each year. In December 2015, FCSM held its 10 th research conference, and in December 2016, will hold its 13th Statistical Policy Seminar. These conferences provide forums for the Federal statistical community, including producers and users of Federal statistics, to engage on opportunities and issues affecting the Federal statistical system's ability to meet its mission. Working papers and proceedings from FCSM seminars and conferences, are available on the FCSM website (fcsm.sites.usa.gov/). Statistical Community of Practice and Engagement Increased sharing of statistical protocols and tools for the collection, processing, analysis, integration, storage, dissemination, and visualization of statistical data will provide oppor - tunities for improving data quality, information security, and operating efficiency through improvements in data interoperability and reductions in duplication of efforts among the prin-cipal statistical agencies. Such collaboration can ultimately increase the value of Federal sta - tistics by reducing unnecessary differences in definitions, formats, and means of access. It can also increase information security by pooling scarce personnel skills and IT resources across the participating statistical agencies. To demonstrate the potential of this approach, the principal statistical agencies initiated a Sta - tistical Community of Practice and Engagement (SCOPE) that has undertaken several coop - erative projects of widespread interest to the Federal statistical community. These include re- searching issues for statistical agencies in moving to a cloud environment; establishing a pilot virtual statistical dissemination facility in the \"cloud\"; assessing current practice and alterna - tive approaches for making statistical products more accessible to the disabled in compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act ; developing a joint statistical community response to implementation plans for Executive Order 13526 on Controlled Unclassified Information; monitoring cybersecurity legislation for challenges to continuing the statutory protection of confidential statistical data; developing a consensus metadata data dictionary; and identifying agency initiatives on mobile applications and Application Programming Interfaces (API) that can be shared and harmonized. Over the longer term, SCOPE will permit the Federal statisti - cal community to more easily identify and share best practices for Federal statistical activities, resulting in significant data quality, security, and operating efficiency and productivity gains in the statistical activities of our Nation. Interagency Committee for the American Community Survey The American Community Survey (ACS) is the Nation's primary annual source of communi - ty-level demographic, housing, social, and economic data. It provides data previously collect - ed only every 10 years in conjunction with the Decennial Census. As such, it is an important Federal asset. The content of the ACS is based on the needs and requirements of Federal agencies and is periodically reviewed to ensure that it is providing maximum utility and that the burden on the public is being minimized. To facilitate communication and collaboration among the more 67 than 20 Federal agencies that use data from the ACS for their programs, Census and OMB jointly chair the Interagency Committee for the ACS.23 In addition, the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy (ICSP) formed a Subcommittee for the ACS to provide advice to the Director of the Census Bureau and the U.S. Chief Statistician on how the ACS can best contribute to the portfolio of household surveys conducted across the Federal statistical system, with a focus on maximizing data utility and reducing respondent burden. Both the Interagency Committee for the ACS and the ICSP Subcommittee for the ACS were involved with the 2014 ACS Content Review, which expanded the understanding and documentation of known uses of the survey questions, and led to proposing changes to the 2016 ACS questionnaire. Both committees worked closely with the Census Bureau in de-veloping revised questionnaire content for the 2016 ACS Content Test which was conducted from March through June 2016. These committees are analyzing and reviewing the data and will publish a draft report in March 2017 on the results of the 2016 ACS Content Test. Interagency Council on Agricultural and Rural Statistics The Interagency Council on Agricultural and Rural Statistics (ICARS), established in 2010, is an effort of the U.S. Federal government's statistical agencies in support of the Global Strategy to Improve Agriculture and Rural Statistics, which was developed under the United Nations Statistical Commission. The impetus for the Global Strategy was the recognition that agriculture and rural statistics are declining across the globe at the same time that new data requirements are emerging. ICARS brings together experts from economic, demographic, environmental, and agricultural agencies that maintain statistical programs and from natural resource agencies to improve the coordination and production of national statistics related to agriculture, food, natural resource, and rural data. ICARS has issued reports on biofuels, land use and land cover estimates, and food-related data, which are available through the Economic Research Service's website (www.ers.usda.gov/about-ers/strengthening-statistics\u00adthrough-the-interagency-council-on-agricultural-rural-statistics.aspx). Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics The Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics (agingstats.gov), 24 established in 1986 by the National Institute on Aging in cooperation with NCHS and Census, fosters col-laboration among Federal agencies that produce or use statistical data on the older population. 23 The Interagency Committee for the ACS includes members from the Department of Agriculture (Food and Nutri- tion Service and National Agricultural Statistics Service); Department of Commerce (Bureau of Economic Analy - sis and Census Bureau); Department of Health and Human Services (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Administration for Children and Families, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, National Institutes of Health, and Indian Health Service); Department of Education; Depart-ment of Energy (Energy Information Administration); Department of Homeland Security; Department of Housing and Urban Development; Department of Interior (Fish and Wildlife Service); Department of Justice; Department of Labor (Bureau of Labor Statistics); Department of Transportation; Department of Veterans Affairs; Environmental Protection Agency; Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; Federal Communications Commission; Federal Reserve Board; National Science Foundation; National Telecommunications and Information Administration; Office of Management and Budget (Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs); and Social Security Administration. 24 The Forum on Aging-Related Statistics includes members from the Department of Commerce (Census Bureau); Department of Health and Human Services (Administration on Aging, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, National Center for Health Statistics, National Institute on Aging, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administra - tion); Department of Housing and Urban Development; Department of Labor (Bureau of Labor Statistics and Em-ployee Benefits Security Administration); Department of Veterans Affairs; Environmental Protection Agency; Office of Management and Budget (Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs); Consumer Product Safety Commission; and Social Security Administration (Office of Research, Evaluation, and Statistics). 68 The Forum played a key role in improving aging-related data by encouraging cooperation and information sharing among agencies, furthering professional collaboration across disciplines, and compiling aging-related statistics in a centralized location. In 1998, the Forum was re - organized and expanded to its present membership of more than 15 Federal agencies. The Forum's website hosts current and previous editions of the Forum's flagship chart book, Older Americans: Key Indicators of Well-Being , other Forum reports, detailed tables, and informa- tion on Forum agencies. As part of its routine efforts to ensure the continued relevance and accuracy of Federal ag- ing statistics, in 2015 Forum members completed a review of the Older Americans indicator framework, data measures, and data sources. Based on these findings, Forum members recom - mended a number of updates to Older Americans. Accordingly, the Forum's most recent pub- lication, Older Americans 2016 , reflects these updates, including four new indicators: Social Security Beneficiaries, Dementia, Transportation, and Long-Term Care Providers, as well as a special feature on Informal Caregiving. Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics The Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics (childstats.gov), 25 initially con- vened in 1994, fosters coordination, collaboration, and integration of Federal data on child and family concerns and conditions. In April 1997, the Forum was formally established through Executive Order No. 13045 to develop priorities for collecting enhanced data on children and youth, improve the reporting and dissemination of information on the status of children to the policy community and the general public, and produce more complete data on children at the State and local levels. The Forum's website includes previous America' s Children: Key National Indicators of Well-Being reports, detailed downloadable tables, general information about the Forum, and a \"What's New\" feature describing upcoming Forum events and infor - mation releases. The Forum's most recent publication, America' s Children in Brief: Key National Indicators of Well-Being, 2016, describes child well-being according to 41 indicators spanning family, physical, and social environment, economic circumstances, health care, physical safety, be-havior, education, and health domains. As an additional feature, the 2016 report describes well-being as it varies by child race/ethnicity for 28 of these indicators. Interagency Working Group on Expanded Measures of Enrollment and Attainment Education and training beyond high school are increasingly important for securing jobs in the U.S. Opportunities to obtain such education and training are provided both within and outside of traditional postsecondary education and are offered by a wide variety of public and private providers. This education and training also results in several kinds of credentials that may 25 The Forum on Child and Family Statistics includes members from the Department of Agriculture (Economic Research Service); Department of Commerce (Census Bureau); Department of Defense (Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense); Department of Education (National Center for Education Statistics); Department of Health and Human Services (Administration for Children and Families, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, National Center for Health Statistics, National Institute of Mental Health, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Plan-ning and Evaluation, Office of Adolescent Health, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administra-tion); Department of Housing and Urban Development (Office of Policy Development and Research); Department of Justice (Bureau of Justice Statistics, National Institute of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention); Department of Labor (Bureau of Labor Statistics and Women's Bureau); Department of Transportation (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration); Environmental Protection Agency (Office of Children's Health Protection); and Office of Management and Budget (Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs); and Consumer Product Safety Commission. 69 have labor market value, including industry-recognized certifications, occupational licenses, and educational certificates. Because of this complexity, it remains important to collect data on the training and credentials of out-of-school youth and adults through individual, rather than institutional, surveys. Until recently, no Federal surveys of adults captured this range of occupational training and credentials. In late 2009, the Council of Economic Advisers and OMB's Statistical and Science Policy Of- fice began an interagency collaboration with NCES, BLS, and Census to develop new survey items for Federal data collections to enumerate and describe education and training creden-tials. An Interagency Working Group on Certificates and Certifications oversaw this work. In 2012, the group's scope expanded to include Federal statistical measures of participation and enrollment in work-related education and training and its name changed to the Interagency Working Group on Expanded Measures of Enrollment and Attainment (GEMEnA) 26. GEMEnA comprises senior representatives from initial member agencies, plus the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics and the Office of the Under Secretary of Education. NCES provides staff and budget support for the group's survey development efforts. GEMEnA's multi-faceted, multi-year goal is to apply best-practice survey development principles to de-velop valid national measures of the participation in and credentialing of education and train - ing for work, and to build government-wide consensus for the adoption of these measures. The first official Federal statistics on the prevalence of certifications and licenses were re- leased in January 2014 by the Census Bureau based on a module included in the 2012 wave of the 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). In April of 2016, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released 2015 CPS data on the prevalence of certifications and licenses in the civilian noninstitutional population 16 years and over. In the fall of 2016, new data will be released from the re-engineered SIPP and the National Survey of College Graduates. NCES is currently fielding an Adult Training and Education Survey (ATES) for the first time as part of the National Household Education Survey with detailed data on up to three certifications and licenses for each respondent. ATES data are scheduled for release in the fall of 2017. NCES has also incorporated the new measures into its longitudinal surveys of students as they en-ter adulthood. Together, these new data sources provide a comprehensive national picture of U.S. adults with certifications and licenses. GEMEnA's final formal meeting will be held in September of 2016 during which its accomplishments will be acknowledged and celebrated. The group's members and their agencies will continue to collaborate informally to ensure the quality and availability of Federal data on non-degree credentials. For more information about GEMEnA, including links to survey questionnaires, released data, and developmental reports, visit nces.ed.gov/surveys/gemena/. Interagency Working Group to Improve Federal Survey Measurement of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity In recent years, there has been increased recognition of the need for robust Federal statistics describing the well-being of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) population. Some Federal surveys have collected information describing the LGBT population for well over a decade. However, some aspects of sexuality and gender identity have been more rou-tinely measured, collected, and extensively studied than others. Accordingly, in April 2015, OMB established an Interagency Working Group to Improve Federal Survey Measurement of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI IWG). 26 GEMEnA includes members from the Council of Economic Advisers; Department of Commerce (Census Bu- reau); Department of Education (National Center for Education Statistics and Office of the Under Secretary); Depart- ment of Labor (Bureau of Labor Statistics); National Science Foundation (National Center for Science and Engineer - ing Statistics); Office of Management and Budget (Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs). 70 Chaired by the Statistical and Science Policy Office at OMB, the group includes representa - tives from Federal agencies currently or planning to collect information on these populations, as well as agencies interested in using these statistics.27 During FY 2016, agenda topics includ - ed: the current practices of the Federal agencies for collecting, editing, and reporting SOGI data; the functioning of current measures, including item nonresponse rates, survey break offs, and (mis)use of \"don't know\" responses; the impact of proxy response on SOGI mea - surement; and methodological research on the impact of different survey question phrasing. The IWG prepared memoranda on the development and use of questions to more accurately measure SOGI. The first three of these memoranda were made available to the public in 2016 at fcsm.sites.usa.gov/reports/interagency-reports/. Interagency Working Group on Measuring Relationships in Federal Household Surveys The Interagency Working Group on Measuring Relationships in Federal Household Surveys (MRFHS) 28 was established by the Statistical and Science Policy Office in 2010 to address the long-term challenges in measuring household relationships, including same-sex couples. Because any major change to a fundamental measurement item such as household relation - ship would impact virtually all Federal surveys and have possible implications for policy, MRFHS was created to ensure that the full range of affected agency \"users\" and \"producers\" of household relationship data would be represented in discussions to identify the issues and possible action strategies moving forward. The Working Group includes approximately 30 representatives from a variety of Federal agencies involved in the collection, dissemination, or use of household relationship data. In 2014, the MRFHS Working Group released a report, Improved Measurement of Household Relationships in Federal Surveys , summarizing its initial work, which has focused on the measurement of same-sex married and unmarried couples living in the same household A 27 The SOGI Working Group includes members from the Corporation for National & Community Service; De- partment of Agriculture (Economic Research Service); Department of Commerce (Bureau of Economic Affairs and Census Bureau); Department of Defense; Department of Education (National Center for Education Statistics); De-partment of Health and Human Services (Administration for Children and Families, Administration for Community Living, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Indian Health Service, National Center for Health Statistics, National Institute for Child Health and Human Development, National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration); Department of Homeland Security; Department of Housing and Urban Development (Office of Policy Development and Research); Department of the Interior; Department of Justice (Bureau of Justice Statistics, Federal Bureau of Investigation); Department of Labor (Bureau of Labor Statistics); Department of Transportation (Bureau of Transportation Statistics); Department of Treasury (Bureau of Engraving and Printing); Department of Veterans Affairs; Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; Environmental Protec - tion Agency; Federal Reserve Board; Government Services Administration; National Science Foundation (National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics); Office of Management and Budget (Office of Information and Regula - tory Affairs); Office of Personnel Management; Social Security Administration (Office of Research Evaluation and Statistics); and United States Agency for International Development. 28 MRFHS includes members from the Department of Agriculture (Economic Research Service and National Agri- cultural Statistics Service); Department of Commerce (Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau); Depart-ment of Education (National Center for Education Statistics); Department of Energy (Energy Information Adminis-tration); Department of Health and Human Services (Administration for Children and Families, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, National Center for Health Statistics, National Institutes of Health, and Office of the Assistant Secre-tary for Planning and Evaluation); Department of Housing and Urban Development; Department of Justice (Bureau of Justice Statistics); Department of Labor (Bureau of Labor Statistics); Department of Transportation (Bureau of Transportation Statistics); Department of the Treasury (Statistics of Income of the Internal Revenue Service); Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; Federal Reserve Board; National Science Foundation (National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics); Office of Management and Budget (Office of Information and Regulatory Af-fairs); Office of Personnel Management, and Social Security Administration. 71 systematic review of the current measurement of relationships in Federal household surveys and the use of the resulting statistics by Federal agencies was supplemented by a series of qualitative and quantitative methodological tests to evaluate the robustness of current mea \u00ad sures Through its review of current measures, data uses, and research on measurement strate \u00ad gies, the MRFHS Working Group arrived at several suggestions for improved measurement of same-sex household relationships Since the issuance of the 2014 report, these preferred measures of same sex married and unmarried couples have been incorporated in several Fed \u00ad eral surveys, including the American Housing Survey, SIPP , ACS, and CPS Interagency Committee for Research on Race and Ethnicity OMB's Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity , issued in Oc- tober 1997, provide direction to Federal agencies collecting and presenting race and ethnicity information for statistical, administrative, or compliance purposes. 29 In addition to providing measurement direction regarding question format and response categories, the Directive also provides a minimum set of race/ethnicity categories for use when comparing results across Federal information collections. The standards encourage the collection and presentation of additional detailed categories for statistical, administrative, or compliance purposes, provided that the additional detailed categories can be aggregated into the minimum set to permit com - parisons. Supplementing this Directive are two additional guidance documents. Provisional Guidance on the Implementation of the 1997 Standards for Federal Data on Race and Ethnic \u00ad ity, which provides guidance in collecting and tabulating data, and bridging data collected under the 1997 Standards and the earlier 1977 Standards. OMB Bulletin No. 00-02 provides guidance to agencies as they continue to monitor compliance with legal protections for those who historically have experienced discrimination, and to minimize reporting burden for those providing aggregate data to Federal agencies. Since the implementation of the 1997 revisions, several Federal agencies have conducted methodological research to better understand how use of these standards has improved the quality of Federal statistics on race and ethnicity. In addition, Federal agencies have con-ducted outreach with stakeholder groups to better understand data and measurement needs in this area. Accordingly, in 2014, OMB formed an Interagency Working Group for Research on Race and Ethnicity to identify implementation issues, exchange research findings, and col-laborate on a shared research agenda to improve Federal statistics on race and ethnicity . Chaired by the Statistical and Science Policy Office at OMB, the Working Group includes rep-resentatives from ten cabinet departments and five other agencies 30 engaged in the collection or use of Federal race and ethnicity statistics. Building from stakeholder input and quantita - tive analyses to date, the Working Group has developed analysis proposals to improve current Federal measurement of race/ethnicity in particular areas, such as: use of separate Hispanic origin and race questions compared with the use of a combined race and ethnicity origin 29 In October 1997, OMB issued Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity, which superseded the standards originally adopted in 1977 (62 FR 58781-58790). 30 The IWG for Research on Race and Ethnicity includes members from the Department of Agriculture (Economic Research Service and National Agricultural Statistics Service); Department of Commerce (Census Bureau); Depart- ment of Education (National Center for Education Statistics); Department of Energy (Energy Information Admin - istration); Department of Health and Human Services (National Center for Health Statistics, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration); Depart-ment of Housing and Urban Development; Department of Justice (Bureau of Justice Statistics); Department of La-bor (Bureau of Labor Statistics); Department of Transportation (Bureau of Transportation Statistics); Department of Treasury (Internal Revenue Service); Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; National Science Foundation (National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics); Office of Management and Budget (Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs); Office of Personnel Management; and Social Security Administration. 72 question; classification of Middle Eastern or North African (MENA) heritage; and phrasing and terminology, including instructions, for the concepts of race, ethnicity, and origin. The Working Group requested public feedback regarding research areas and possible solutions with the overall goal to improve Federal statistics on race and ethnicity through a Federal Register Notice. Comments were received and analyses of available data continued; the Work-ing Group will request further public comment to inform its deliberations taking these inputs into account. Federal Statistical Research Data Center Governance Development Committee In February 2015, the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy (ICSP) recommended that the U.S. Census Bureau's Research Data Center program be rebranded as the Federal Statistical Research Data Center (FSRDC) program in recognition of the program's expansion to include participation from multiple Federal statistical agencies. The ICSP also recommended modify-ing the program's current governance structure to include representation from participating agencies. The FSRDC program provides secure access to restricted-use microdata to qualified research- ers working on approved research projects that are of benefit to the data-providing agency or agencies. Research data center locations are currently housed at academic research institu - tions or Federal Reserve Banks, and are managed by an on-site Census Bureau employee, or Administrator. The FSRDC Development Committee was established in January 2016 under the auspices of the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy. The Committee, including OMB, nine member representatives of principal statistical agencies, and two member representatives of the host-ing academic institutions, 31 is charged with proposing a cross-agency governance structure for the FSRDC program. The Committee expects to complete its work in mid-2017. Key areas of expanded FSRDC governance include program management, program expan- sion, and cross-agency coordination of research projects. Topics addressed in FY2016 in-cluded determining commonalities in agency-specific research requirements; developing con-sistent language and instructions for researchers applying to access participating agencies' restricted-data programs via the FSRDCs; adopting common project management practices across agencies; formalizing a pricing structure for participating agencies to provide their data through the FSRDC program; and reviewing legal requirements for researchers to access each agency's data in the FSRDCs. The Committee is also coordinating its efforts with the Census Bureau's initiative to facilitate a broader set of evidence building efforts, such as program evaluation. COLLABORATIVE INNOV ATIONS Statistical Uses of Administrative Data Administrative data are valuable resources for building evidence about the health and well-being of our society, economy, and environment and are helpful in assessing the impact of Federal policies and programs on businesses, families, households, and individuals. Smart co-locating, linking, and combining of administrative data with other administrative or sur - 31 The FSRDC Development Committee includes members from the Office of Management and Budget; Depart- ment of Commerce (U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis); Department of Labor (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics); Department of Agriculture (Economic Research Services); Department of Justice (Bureau of Justice Statistics); Department of the Treasury (Statistics of Income); Department of Health and Human Services (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention); Department of Education (National Center for Education Statistics); National Science Foundation (National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics); University of Michigan; and Duke University. 73 vey data can often help build a strong evidence portfolio and can reduce survey costs. The statistical system's ability to inform societal and public policy matters in an environment of rising survey costs, declining response rates, and constrained Federal budgets hinges to a large degree on its ability to access and use administrative data effectively. More fully integrating evidence and rigorous evaluation into budget, management, program- matic, and policy decisions is a priority of OMB's. 32 Better leveraging administrative data to support the Administration's evidence agenda, while ensuring that high data quality standards and privacy and confidentiality protections are maintained, is a crucial part of attaining this priority. In February 2014, OMB issued M-14-06 Guidance for Providing and Using Admin - istrative Data for Statistical Purposes, which promotes increased agency use of administra - tive data for evidence-building and improved data stewardship practices designed to enhance privacy and data quality. This Memorandum builds on the goals of three OMB memoranda (M-11-02 Sharing Data While Protecting Privacy , M-13-13 Open Data Policy-Managing Information as an Asset, and M-13-17 Next Steps in the Evidence and Innovation Agenda ) designed to increase the value of existing data. Specifically, M-14-06 extends the following goals: Federal Government data are an asset to be managed as a public good; agencies should make better use of administrative data for research, evaluation, analysis, and other statistical purposes in a manner that fully respects privacy and protects confidentiality; and the Federal Government should focus on ways to safely unlock the full value of administrative data that cannot be made publicly available because of legal or policy protections. The guidance in M-14-06 helps agencies address legal questions by explaining how a general program autho - rization is often sufficient to permit use and sharing of administrative data for statistical activi - ties, and it provides principles and practical tools for addressing data stewardship, data qual - ity, and requirements for negotiating interagency agreements (such as the FCSM data quality assessment tool for administrative data and the M-14-06 model interagency agreement). As part of the annual budget process, agencies report to OMB on their progress to identify and acquire datasets useful for statistical purposes, to build ongoing collaborations within and across agencies, and to implement good data stewardship practices related to the management of their administrative data and data quality efforts. In FY 2016 OMB staff, with agency staff assistance, used the information from these reports to help shape background materials for the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking. The FCSM's Subcommittee on Administrative, Alternative, and Blended Data was chartered in FY 2016 to research and examine methodological issues associated with alternative sources of data; the intersections of administrative data, open data, and survey data; their challenges and limitations; and their broader implications on statistical policy and practice. Consistent with OMB's Government-wide Information Quality Guidelines, a major aspect of the Sub - committee's work is to consider the statistical uses of administrative data and to examine attributes related to such purposes (e.g., collection methods, timeliness, periodicity, complete - ness, and other aspects of data quality) as well as the level of quality required for the intended statistical purpose. Enhancing Internationally Comparable Measures of Disability The Washington Group on Disability Statistics, 33 established by the United Nations Statisti - cal Commission, is an international cooperative effort among the national statistical offices of developed and developing countries, international organizations, and disabled persons' organizations to develop cross-nationally comparable disability measures for censuses and 32 See www.WhiteHouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2017/assets/ap_7_evidence.pdf . 33 See the Washington Group' s website for its papers and products. 74 surveys. Other goals of the group include: improving the collection and interpretation of infor - mation on disability, enhancing comparability with other national and international disability data collections, and providing more detailed information necessary to fully understand the complexities of disability. Sets of questions developed by the Washington Group have under - gone multiple rounds of cognitive and field tests and data compiled from countries using the measures show consistency in results when posed as intended. The Washington Group is also developing an extended set of questions on functioning that incorporate additional functional domains and detail regarding functioning with and without assistive technology or assistance. The need for robust statistical information on disability has been made more critical by the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which includes data and reporting requirements, as well as the selection of indicators which would be used to measure progress against the UN Post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals. The data that would result from universal implementation of the Washington Group short set of questions would allow for the disaggregation of outcome indicators (such as employment status or ac-cess to education) by disability status and meet the monitoring needs for both these initiatives. Accordingly, a July 2014 UNDESA/UNESCO report 34 recommended that the Washington Group short question set be included in censuses and ongoing periodic surveys conducted or financed by national statistical offices, government ministries and United Nations agencies. Both the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs and UN Economic Commission for Europe, in preparing for the 2020 round of censuses, are including text that specifies the Washington Group short set of questions as the method recommended for the collection of disability data cross-nationally. A survey module on child and youth disability has been developed and tested in close co- operation with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). Also, in collaboration with UNICEF, work is underway to develop a set of questions that would address facilitators and barriers to school participation for all children. In collaboration with the International Labor Organization, the Washington Group is developing a disability module that will address fa-cilitators and barriers to employment among the adult population and would be suitable for inclusion in Labor Force Surveys. Finally, the Washington Group is currently developing questions to measure environmental barriers and facilitators to participation among the gen-eral population, and measures specific to mental health. Expanding the Timeliness and Utility of Health Data through Record Linkage and Extraction To remain effective, data systems must meet the challenge of maintaining current operations while retooling to meet new data needs and more fully utilize new technology and methods. Collectively, these mechanisms gather information that people can provide in interviews; in - formation that people do not know or cannot describe adequately, but that can be obtained through examinations, medical records, and program service records; and information on the circumstances of significant health events that can be obtained through birth and death records and the compilation of data on medical encounters. NCHS is working with CMS, Census, HUD, and SSA to maintain and improve the core capacity of ongoing data systems. For example, NCHS continues to lead a record linkage program designed to maximize the sci - entific value of its population-based surveys. Linkage of NCHS' surveys with administrative data sources enables researchers to better examine the factors that influence disability, chronic disease, health care utilization, morbidity, and mortality. Through collaborative agreements, NCHS links several of NCHS' population-based surveys with the National Death Index, en - 34 See The United Nations Expert Group Meeting on Disability Data and Statistics, Monitoring and Evaluation: The Way Forward---a Disability-Inclusive Agenda Towards 2015 and Beyond. 75 rollment and claims data from CMS, and benefit data from SSA. NCHS has also linked survey data with End Stage Renal Disease data obtained from the United States Renal Data System, Florida Cancer Data System data, and with administrative records of HUD's housing assis-tance programs. In addition, NCHS continues to explore ways to more efficiently and accurately incorporate electronic health record (EHR) data collection into its suite of health care provider surveys. In 2015, the National Health Care Surveys were recognized as means by which eligible providers could meet Meaningful Use requirements for public health reporting, and NCHS anticipates increasing survey participation and submission of electronic health records. NCHS continues to work with the EHR vendors to develop interfaces that will enable hospitals to streamline the extraction of their inpatient and outpatient data. The Health Level Seven International Implementation Guide for the National Health Care Surveys, developed by NCHS, serves as the national electronic standard for reporting data to NCHS' provider surveys. NCHS' collaboration with State Departments of Vital Records (and reporting areas) has fostered significant improvements in the timeliness and quality of birth and death statistics. NCHS continues to maintain the timeliness of the release of data with the 2014 vital statistics, releasing preliminary birth data five months after the end of the data year and launching a vital statistics rapid release program in 2015. The program provides access to the timeliest vital statistics for public health surveillance through the release of quarterly provisional esti-mates for a number of leading causes of death. Using provisional data, the program provides timely estimates of important health indicators for public health practitioners, researchers, and health policy makers. In addition, the National Death Index (NDI) continues its Early Release Program, allowing health researchers to more quickly determine vital status of their study participants. Through the NDI Early Release Program, death records for a particular calendar year will be available for searches when approximately 90 percent of the year's death records have been received and processed. Improving Measurement of Health Disparities The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) collects, analyzes, and reports data on health disparities and the health of vulnerable populations, and continues to make invest-ments in its data systems and infrastructure to improve the measurement of health disparities. The CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), conducted the Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander (NHPI) National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/ nhpi.html), which aims to enhance the availability and quality of data on the health outcomes and health care utilization of NHPIs. With the information collected, it will be possible for policymakers, community leaders, researchers, and health professionals to understand NHPI health problems, strengths, and needs and to plan policies and programs to improve NHPI health and well-being. To support participation in the survey and increase response rates, NCHS, the HHS Office of Minority Health, and the Census Bureau partnered to provide out-reach and education on the project to NHPI stakeholders. Data will be publicly available in 2016. In 2013, NCHS began implementing data collection on sexual orientation into the full NHIS after extensive research on alternative measurement approaches (www.cdc.gov/nchs/ nhis/sexual_orientation/index.htm ). The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) developed an interactive web based Mapping Medicare Disparities (MMD) tool (www.cms. gov/about-cms/agency-information/omh/OMH-Mapping-Medicare-Disparities.html) in 2016 that contains health outcome measures for disease prevalence, costs, and hospitalization for 18 specific chronic conditions, emergency department utilization, readmissions rates, mortal - ity, and preventable hospitalizations. With the MMD tool, geographic disparities can be ex - amined by state or county of residence, sex, age, dual-eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid, and race and ethnicity. In addition, in 2016, CMS released Racial and Ethnic Disparities in 76 Health Care in Medicare Advantage (www.cms.gov/About-CMS/Agency-Information/OMH/ Downloads/National-Level-Results.pdf ), the first publicly available national and contract level quality of care and patient experience measures stratified by race and ethnicity. HHS, in 2016, asked the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine's Committee on National Statistics to conduct a workshop to explore ways to improve the collection of indicators of criminal justice system in population health data programs (sites.nationalacad - emies.org/DBASSE/CNSTAT/DBASSE_170301), and will be cognitively testing questions to improve measurement of disparities in the justice involved population. Improving Federal Measurement of Poverty Poverty is a critical indicator of how widely prosperity is shared in our economy and is a key benchmark for targeting resources toward the disadvantaged. Yet, the U.S. poverty measure methodology has not been substantially updated since it was first developed in the 1960s. It has been widely criticized for decades since it is based on outdated assumptions and does not take into account the availability of many economic resources. In particular, the official measure does not include many government transfer programs. Because of these shortcom - ings, the U.S. official poverty measure cannot be used to evaluate the impact of anti-poverty programs; presently, there is no production level statistic that can be used for this purpose. In 2010, the OMB Chief Statistician established an Interagency Technical Working Group (ITWG) to develop a Supplemental Poverty Measure that would offer a complementary per - spective on the distribution of economic deprivation. 35 The result is the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), which has been vetted through systematic research and now requires expan - sion into production to fully contribute to understanding poverty in the U.S. The SPM comprises two parts: thresholds of spending and household resources. The work to produce these two parts is split between BLS (thresholds) and Census (resources). Cur - rently, the SPM thresholds are produced as an experimental research product of BLS using Consumer Expenditure (CE) Survey Interview data. BLS is requesting resources in FY 2017 to modify the CE Survey to collect additional data supporting the production of SPM thresh - olds, to implement rigorous review and statistical procedures that result in production-quality thresholds, and to conduct research to continuously improve the measure to meet professional, economic, and statistical standards. As part of this initiative, BLS would add questions to the CE Survey to account for items such as receipt of Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) benefits (food only), participation in National School Lunch Program meals, receipt of Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program benefits, and information about work-related expenses such as transportation and child care. If funding is received in FY 2017, BLS would begin development of such questions and procedures needed for the FY 2020 release of production-quality SPM thresholds. In addition, the CE Survey would improve its processing systems in order to release publication tables beginning in FY 2020 to coincide with the release of the Census income and poverty report. To obtain the household resources data needed for the SPM, Census will continue to use ITWG's recommendations for family resources as the basis for a definition of income that is much broader than that of the current official measure. Several of the components of this im-proved measure were not historically collected by Census in the Current Population Survey's Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC). In 2010, Census added questions to the CPS ASEC on mortgages and property value, childcare expenses, child support expenses, and out-of-pocket medical expenses and expanded its modeling and estimation techniques to produce the necessary additional resource components on a timely basis. The Census Bureau will continue to assign permanent staff to work with stakeholders to ensure that the SPM re- 35 The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) 1995 report, Measuring Poverty informed the initial work of the SPM. 77 flects best practices and takes full advantage of the information available to the Census Bureau and continue research to include the SPM on other surveys, such as the American Community Survey (ACS), so that States and localities can take advantage of this supplemental poverty measure for their own policy decisions. With the requested funding noted above, by FY 2020, the CE Survey would support the September release date of the SPM by providing the supplemental poverty thresholds to the Census Bureau in early August each year. With continued adequate funding, Census could develop the components of the resources measure based on data from the CPS ASEC (and eventually ACS). Thus, with the funds requested in FY 2017 for BLS, and continued adequate funding for Census, BLS and Census could complete the ITWG's road map and produce the production-quality SPM in FY 2020. Improving Accuracy of Demographic Surveys through More Timely Data The Demographic Surveys Sample Redesign Program provides new, updated, and coordi - nated samples for major ongoing household surveys across the Federal statistical system. In close collaboration with other Federal statistical agencies, the Census Bureau selects new samples to reflect shifts in the location and characteristics of people based on the most recent information about the population. This program is an efficient way to sustain the accuracy of Federal household statistics. Until recently, this program produced 'refreshed' samples only after each Decennial Census. This meant that the accuracy of the estimates produced could diminish as the sample \"aged\" in the 10 year interval between Decennial Censuses. Now, the Census Bureau has begun draw - ing 'refreshed' samples annually using the continually updated Master Address File and ACS data, rather than rely on the once-a-decade availability of Decennial Census data. This is a major advancement to the accuracy of Federal survey statistics. Annual sampling activities continue for the Current Population Survey, the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the National Crime Victimization Survey, the Consumer Expendi - ture Quarterly and Diary Survey, and the American Housing Survey. Twice a year updates to the Master Address File provide new housing unit growth to the samples and yearly ACS data continue to sustain improvements to statistical accuracy. In FY 2016, the National Health In-terview Survey fielded new annual samples based on a commercial vendor file of housing unit addresses, purchased specifically for this survey, and updated with new housing unit growth twice a year by the United States Post Office files. Improving the Timeliness, Accuracy, and Accessibility of International Trade Statistics Official U.S. export and import of goods statistics record the physical movement of goods between the U.S. and foreign countries. International trade statistics are used to develop the goods trade estimates in balance of payments accounts. In addition, trade statistics are used to appraise and analyze major movements and trends in international trade, to plan and evaluate programs such as export expansion and agricultural development and assistance programs, and to measure the impact of tariff and trade agreement programs. In an effort to improve the relevance and usefulness of the international trade statistics pro- gram and other economic indicator programs, the Census Bureau modified the Advance Re- port for International Trade in Goods first published in July 2015. In July 2016, the Census Bureau began releasing the Advanced Economic Indicators Report (www.census.gov/econ/ indicators), which continues to contain advanced data on international trade, but also includes advance monthly retail and wholesale inventories for select aggregate levels. The format change allows the Census Bureau to add advanced indicators as research shows their quality 78 and consistency are sufficient to publicly release. The new format also presents the advanced estimates as a point in time snapshot and does not display the advanced estimates as separate series. The Advance Economic Indicators Report allows both public and private organizations, who rely on Census Bureau statistics, to make important decisions through an earlier look at key economic activity as close to real-time as possible. This new report allows BEA to incorporate export, import, and inventory data into the advance quarterly estimate of GDP, thereby pro - ducing a more complete quarterly estimate for the broadest measure of how the U.S. economy is performing and potentially reducing revisions to the advanced GDP estimate. Releasing this information publicly allows all data users the access and ability to include the same informa - tion into their economic projections. Beginning later this year, international trade statistics will be included in the Census Bureau's Application Programming Interface (API), allowing access to data elements previously found only on USA Trade Online and in static data products. This improvement provides data us-ers with more flexibility in the way they retrieve detailed export and import statistics and promotes the open data concept and development of customized applications by the private sector. United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals Indicators In September 2015, the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (sustain- abledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld) was adopted by the UN General Assembly. A core element of this Agenda is the agreement by all UN member countries to achieve 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 associated targets. In its 70/1 resolution, the UN General Assembly tasked the UN Statistical Commission (UNSC) to iden-tify global indicators so that progress against each of these goals and targets could be mea - sured. With contributions from the United States and other countries, in March 2016 UNSC endorsed the 238 indicators proposed by its Interagency and Expert Group on SDGs. The U.S. began reporting national statistics for global indicators in September 2016. The offi- cial reporting platform can be accessed at sdg.data.gov. The U.S. will continue to contribute to UNSC's High Level Group on Partnership, Coordination and Capacity-building for Statistics (HLG-SDGs) (unstats.un.org/sdgs/hlg) in its ongoing work to assess methodological needs of the indicators, review capacity-building in statistical areas relevant to goal monitoring, and facilitate a process to address technical needs and capability gaps to allow more robust reporting. Facilitating Innovations in Survey Methodology The National Science Foundation's Division of Social and Economic Sciences, in collabora - tion with a consortium of Federal statistical agencies, continues to fund basic research on survey measurement issues, data collection procedures, and statistical issues related to survey design. These activities have substantial potential to benefit the Federal statistical system as it prepares to meet future challenges in gathering relevant and reliable data. Although proposals submitted for this funding can address any aspect of survey or statistical methodology, priority is given to basic research proposals that have broad implications for the field in general and the greatest potential for creating fundamental knowledge of value for the Federal statistical system. Because methodological problems often require knowledge and expertise from multiple disciplines, this funding opportunity encourages collaborations among the relevant sciences, including the social, behavioral, economic, statistical, and com - puter sciences. 79 In FY 2016, NSF funded three research projects to improve estimation from large-scale design based surveys. The cost of conducting these surveys has increased dramatically during the last decade while response rates have declined. Meanwhile interest in rare populations and sub-populations has increased. One research project provides a new class of tools to improve stability and precision of survey estimates and can be applied to several survey methodologi-cal areas of practical interest including estimation for sub-populations, post-stratification, ad-justing for nonresponse and small area estimation. Another research project provides an em - pirical investigation into respondent driven sampling (RDS) data collection, a new method for sampling rare or hidden populations. This research project will conduct an empirical assess-ment of RDS within the Total Survey Error framework. The third research project develops a unified framework for survey weighting and may be applicable to problems resulting from integration of surveys from multiple sources, analysis of streaming data and RDS. 80 APPENDIX A. Principal Statistical Agency Staffing Levels This report focuses on the budgetary resources devoted to statistical activities by Federal agencies. For additional perspective, this appendix provides information on the staffing levels of the principal statistical agencies. Staff engaged in statistical activities span a range of professional backgrounds. In addition to statisticians and mathematical statisticians, professionals such as economists and research scientists (e.g., health scientists, epidemiologists, and educational research scientists), also en-gage in significant statistical work.
