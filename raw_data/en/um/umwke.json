You have those who are completely against, those who are completely for, and then there are those who are either on the fence or who basically get themselves and their children vaccinated because it's \"the thing to do.\"But are vaccines \"the thing to do\"? Is there any other way - and perhaps, better ways - to protect our health and keep our bodies free from disease? The Theory Behind Vaccinations When our bodies come in contact with a foreign substance (antigen), our immune system produces immunoglobulin (antibodies). If that antigen is a bacterium or a virus (pathogen), our body's white blood cells will then create an anti-body (T-cell) that helps fight off that bacteria or virus that can or is making our bodies sick. The T-cells remember that particular pathogen, and that T-cell then stays in our body should we ever come in contact with that pathogen ever again. This is what happens every time we get the cold or the flu. It's thought that if we give our body small little doses of a particular antigen that our body will then create those T-cells so that in the event that we come in contact with that harmful bacteria or virus, our body will be able to quickly and effectively fight off that ailment. Vaccines give our bodies a minimal dosage of harmful pathogens and are believed by many in the medical community to help create an immunity against those particular ailments. But Do Vaccines Work? Those who are opposed to vaccines can quickly point to the annual flu vaccines as evidence that vaccines don't work. As a matter of fact, several studies have come out recently that prove that the flu vaccine can actually make an individual sicker than if they didn't get the vaccine. Why? Because the particular viral strain that scientists use when creating the vaccine is almost always wrong. If the viral strain that they \"guess\" is going to be going around this season is wrong, one is basically just willingly injecting themselves with sickness. Now here's an argument that one will often hear: \"But if it weren't for vaccines, we'd still have polio!\" or \"We'd still have measles!\" or any other number of diseases that, while once rampant, have now basically become extinct in first world countries. It's important for people to consider the fact that these infectious diseases were on the decline before vaccines were introduced. Arguably vaccines had little or nothing to do with the disappearance or reduction of the disease; the viral or bacterial infection had run its course and was on its way out the door before vaccines had even been introduced.

For example, most vaccines contain thimerosal, a seemingly clever code name for the heavy metal \"mercury.\" The purpose: to help preserve the vaccine so its shelf life is extended. But what's the result on our health? Many will say that the mercury in vaccines causes [autism](https://www.naturalnews.com/027178_autism_vaccines.html). Mercury isn't the only material that one has to be concerned about. Other [dangerous materials](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/additives.htm) that are contained within [vaccines](https://organichealthadviser.com/archives/vaccines-are-bad-for-you) include: - Aluminum (Can cause several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease) - Formaldehyde (Carcinogen, known to cause upper respiratory tract problems and can be harmful to our lymphatic and hematopoietic systems) - Monosodium glutamate (MSG) - Sorbital (A potential liver and gastrointestinal toxicant) - Ammonium sulfate (A neurotoxicant and a potential liver, gastrointestinal, and respiratory toxicant) - Diploid cells (From aborted fetuses) - Macerated cancer cells - Detergent (Triton x100) - Animal tissues (such as rabbit brain, horse blood, and pig blood) Most frightening of all is the fact that the side effects and fatalities that are caused by vaccines are grossly [under reported](https://www.vaccine-side-effects.com/content/vaccination-side-effects-the-under-reporting-of-v/), so the public hasn't been adequately informed about just how dangerous vaccinating themselves and their children in particular is. Natural Vaccination Alternatives What's the purpose of vaccinations? To help strengthen the immune system. So why do we need to inject ourselves with disease and other poisonous materials in order to attain a stronger immune system? One thing that we can begin doing today is strengthening our immune systems through a variety of different methods. Breastfeeding If you plan on having children, the best way to boost their immune system is to start their life off by breastfeeding them exclusively if possible. When a mother breastfeeds her child, she's passing her [immunity](https://www.nrdc.org/breastmilk/benefits.asp) to her young one, thus protecting him or her from a number of diseases that formula fed babies are not protected from. A recent study from the British Medical Journal also showed that mothers who naturally built up an immunity against a pathogen had [three times](https://www.guerillahealthreport.com/post.php?id=341) the antibodies in her body to protect both her and her baby against disease, and was protected four times longer, than those moms that were vaccinated. Even more frightening was the fact that over one-fourth of all mothers in the study who had been vaccinated didn't show having any sign of antibodies to protect themselves at all. Probiotics If you want to stay healthy, then consuming probiotics will help keep a number of bacterial diseases at bay. Probiotics can naturally boost your immune function and beat out any nasty diseases that may otherwise attack your respiratory tract, your intestines, and your urinary tract. Stock up on foods like kimchi, yogurt, and sauerkraut, or choose a quality probiotic supplement that can be found in a number of natural health food stores. Vitamin Supplements Vitamin D is the first supplement that should be on anyone's list. Unless you're out in the sun frequently for short periods of time during the day - something which is nearly impossible for most of us in the Northern hemisphere - then you're probably vitamin D deficient. Vitamin D can help protect the body against a number of ailments, such as cancer, asthma, and autoimmune diseases, and it will protect us against infectious diseases. Other vitamins and herbs that you may want to consider either supplementing in your diet or ensuring you're getting enough of include vitamin A/beta-carotene (10,000-20,000 units a day), vitamin C (500-1000 mg a day), and echinacea (10-20 drops, three times daily). Red Reishi And Maitake Mushrooms A non-toxic option that anyone can start taking today is a red reishi or maitake mushroom supplement. Both mushrooms have the remarkable ability to help restore the body to its normal state, so not only are you restoring your immunity to taking these supplements, but you're also [restoring](https://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/mushrooms.shtml) the functionality of all of the organs of the body. Manuka Honey Less than 100 years ago, every household had honey in it. Not only is [manuka honey](https://www.livestrong.com/article/217129-what-is-manuka-honey-good-for/) a great natural and healthy way to sweeten up foods, but it could also treat a number of ailments, such as colds and bee strings. It has the unique ability to support the immune system, and it can be taken in a number of different ways, such as straight out of the jar, spread on bread, or even used in tea. Your Diet The best way to protect yourself is to eat right. Having a diet that isn't loaded with preservatives, refined sugars, and unhealthy fats is just what your body is crying out for, and just what will help keep your immune system functioning at its best and protect you from a number of ailments and diseases. Really focus on consuming five to ten servings of vegetables and fruits a day, choosing foods that come in variety of different colors to ensure that you're naturally consuming all of the nutrients that your immune system needs in order to function properly. Eating enough grains ensures that you're detoxing your intestinal system (something which is a leading cause behind a number of illnesses). Most important of all is remembering to do your research before you take any action towards safeguarding your health. Whether you're trying to protect yourself against ailment and disease through vaccinations or through natural means, always study your options and consider speaking to a person in the medical community and a homeopath to help determine which course of action is right for you and your family. \u00a92012 Off the Grid News "}
