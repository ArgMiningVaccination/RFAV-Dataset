Valmet's Interim Review, January -September 2017 | 3 Valmet reiterates its g uidance for 2017 Valmet reiterat es its guidance presented on April 12, 2017 , in which Valmet estimates that net sales in 2017 will increase in comparison with 2016 (EUR 2,926 million) and Comparable EBITA in 2017 will increase in comparison with 2016 (EUR 196 million). Short -term outlook General economic outlook The global upswing in economic activity is strengthening, with global growth projected to rise to 3.6 percent in 2017 and 3.7 percent in 2018. Broad -based upward revisions in the euro area, Japan, emerging Asia, emerging Europe, and Russia more than offset downward revisions for the United States and the United Kingdom. While the baseline outlook is strengthening, growth remains weak in many countries, and inflation is below target in most advanced economies. And while short -term risks are broadly balanced, medium -term risks are still tilted to the downside. (International Monetary Fund, October 10, 2017) Short -term market outlook Valmet estimates that the short -term market outlook has decreased to a satisfactory level in energy (previously good level). Valm et reiterates the good short -term market outlook for services, board and paper, and tissue, the satisfactory short -term market outlook for automation , and the weak short -term market outlook for pulp . President and CEO Pasi Laine: Continued growth in the P aper business line and improvement in profitability \"The market activity has been high especially in the Paper business line, where orders received for the last 12 months exceed EUR 1 billion. Both Board and Paper, and Tissue have enjoyed exceptionally high levels of activity, and particularly China, follow ed by North America and EMEA, have been good markets for us. In addition to the Paper business line, we have been able to grow orders received in our stable business, meaning Services and Automation business lines. In January -September , Valmet's orders rec eived have increased by 11 percent . In the third quarter of 2017, Valmet's Comparable EBITA margin was 7.9 percent. This is the highest quarterly margin since becoming an independent company, and close to the lower end of our long -term margin target of 8 -10 percent. However, the 6.8 percent margin for the first nine months of the year shows that there is still room for improvement. Valmet was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) for the fourth consecutive year and reconfirmed as a constitue nt of the Ethibel Sustainability Index Excellence Europe. These achievements indicate Valmet's strong focus and consistent progress in sustainability. Inclusion in these indices is an acknowledgement to our 12,000 employees globally, as our world -leading s ustainability performance is the result of their daily work. Sustainability is at the core of Valmet's business, and we will continue the systematic work through our sustainability agenda.\" Valmet's Interim Review, January -September 2017 | million Q3/2017 Q3/2016 Change Q1-Q3/ 2017 Comparable earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (Comparable EBITA) 59 52 15% 150 140 8% % of net sales 7.9% 7.5% 6.8% 6.5% Earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) 53 49 7% 146 135 8% % of net sales 7.0% 7.2% 6.6% 6.3% Operating profit (EBIT) 45 41 % of net sales 6.0% 6.0% 5.5% 5.0% Profit before taxes 41 38 10% 113 98 15% Profit / loss 30 26 15% 81 69 19% Earnings per share, EUR 0.20 0.17 14% 0.54 0.46 19% Earnings per share, diluted, EUR 0.20 0.17 14% 0.54 0.46 19% 5.95 5.68 5% Cash flow provided by operating activities 78 122 -36% 203 158 29% Cash flow after investments 62 108 -42% 157 116 36% Return on equity (ROE) (annualized) 12% 11% Return on capital employed (ROCE) before taxes (annualized) 14% 12% 1 The calculation of key figures is presented on page 39. 2 At the end of period.

The reward for the 2012 performance period was paid during 201 5. For the 2013 performance period, the performance criteria were not met and therefore no rewards were paid for the 2013 performance period. From the performance period 2014 a gross number of 262,980 shares were earned. The reward was paid partly as C ompa ny shares and partly in cash in March 2017.

The reward paid on the basis of the discretionary period 2015 corr esponded to a total of 540,035 shares, including the matching share rewards. The reward of the plan for the discretionary period 2016 was based on Comparable EBITA % and orders received growth % of the stable business, that is, the Services and Automation business lines. The reward was paid partly as Valmet shares and partly in cash in March 2017.

The reward paid on the basis of the discretionary period 2016 corresponded to a total of 556,049 sha res, including the matching share rewards. The Board of Directors of Valmet decided in December 2016 to continue the share based incentive program approved in December 2014 for Valmet's key employees.

In compliance with the resolution of the Annual General Meeting on March 23, 2017, Valmet paid out dividends of EUR 63 million for 2016, corresponding to EUR 0.42 per share, on April 6, 2017. Risks and business uncertainties Valmet's operations are affected by various st rategic, financial, operational and hazard risks. Valmet takes measures to exploit emerging opportunities and to limit the adverse effects of potential threats. The assessment of risks related to sustainable development holds an important role in risk management. If such threats materialized, they could have material adverse effects on Valmet's business, financ ial situation and operating result or on the value of shares and other securities. The objective of Valmet's risk management is to ensure the implementation of an e ffective and successful strategy for achieving both long - and short -term goals. The task of Valmet's management is to regulate risk appetite. In assessing risks, Valmet takes into consideration the probability of the risks and their estimated impact on net sales and financial results. Valmet's management estimates that the company's overall risk level is currently manageable in proportion to the scope of its operations and the practical measures available for managing these risks. Valmet's Interim Review, January -September 2017 | 21 Financial uncertainty in the global economy, coupled with fluctuations in exchange rates and tightening financial market regulations, may have an adverse effect on the availability of financing from banks and capital markets and could reduce the investment appetite of Valmet's cu stomers. Valmet estimates that the high proportion of business derived from stable business (Services and Automation) and the geographical diversification will reduce the possible negative effects that market uncertainties may have. If global economic gro wth weakens, it might have adverse effects on new projects under negotiation or on projects in the order backlog. Some projects may be postponed, suspended, or canceled. In the case of long -term delivery projects, initial customer advance payments are typi cally 10 -30 percent of the value of the project and customers make progress payments as a project is implemented. This significantly decreases the risks and financing requirements related to Valmet's projects. Valmet continually assesses its customers' cre ditworthiness and their ability to meet their obligations. As a rule, Valmet does not finance customer projects. If economic growth slows down significantly, the markets for Valmet's products may shrink, which may lead to, for example, tougher price compet ition. Changes and uncertainty in future regulation and legislation can also critically affect especially the energy business. Large fluctuations in energy prices can affect the global economy. These fluctuations can also affect Valmet and its customers, e specially in the energy business. Changes in labor costs and the prices of raw materials and components can affect Valmet's profitability. Wage inflation is continuing, but Valmet's goal is to offset this at least partly through increased productivity and strict price discipline. It is possible, however, that tough competition in some product categories will make it difficult to pass on cost increases to product prices. On the other hand, some of Valmet's custo mers are raw material producers and their abili ty to operate and invest may be enhanced by strengthening commodity prices and hampered by declining commodity prices. To ensure a high level of quality in both production and services, it is important to sustain a high level of competence and talent avail ability. This includes, for example, maintaining efficient recruitment programs, utilization of existing talent and sharing knowledge globally. Through acquisitions Valmet may become exposed to risks associated with new markets and business environments. T he actual acquisition process also includes risks. Other risks associated with acquisitions include, but are not limited to, integration of the acquired business, increased financial risk exposure, retention of key personnel and achieving the targets set f or the acquired business. Management of project business risks important An important part of Valmet's business consists of project business. Pulp business projects in particular are large, thus project -specific risk management is crucial. Key risks relate d to projects are project cost estimation , scheduling , project risk management, quality and performance risks, and materials management risks. Risk analysis shall, as a minimum, take place for all significant project quotations. The work concerning threat and opportunity assessment continues during the execution phase of the project. Risk management is based on careful planning and on continuous, systematic monitoring and evaluation . Project risks are managed by improving and continuously developing project management processes and the related systems . Valmet's Interim Review, January -September 2017 | 22 There may be changes in the competitive situation of Valmet's individual businesses, such as the emergence of new, cost -effective pl ayers in the markets. Valmet can safeguard its market position by developing its products and services, and through good customer service and a local presence. Availability of financing crucial Securing the continuity of Valmet's operations requires that sufficient funding is available under all circumstances. Valmet estimates that its liquid cash assets and committed credit limits are sufficient to secure its immediate liquidity and to ensure the flexibility of financing. The average maturity for Valmet's non-current debt is 3.5 years. Loan facilities include customary covenants and Valmet is in clear compliance with the covenants at the balance sheet date. Net working capital and capital expenditure levels have a key impact on the adequacy of our financin g. Valmet estimates that it is well -positioned to keep capital expenditure at the level of total depreciation. Of the financial risks that affect Valmet's profit, currency exchange rate risks are among the most substantial. Exchange rate changes can affect Valmet's business, although the wide geographical scope of the company's operations reduces the impact of any individual currency. Economic insecurity typically increases exchange rate fluctuations. Valmet hedges its currency exposures linked to firm deli very and purchase agreements. Changes in legislation and the way authorities interpret regulation, for example regarding taxation, can also have an impact on Valmet's financials. At the end of September 2017 , Valmet had EUR 616 million (EUR 620 million) of goodwill on its statement of financial position. Valmet assesses the value of its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that a risk of impairment exists. Valmet has not identified any indicatio ns of impairment dur ing the reporting period. The principles used for impairment testing are presented in the Financial Statements . Events after the reporting period There were no subsequent events after the review period that required recognition or disclosure. Valmet reiterates its g uidance for 2017 Valmet reiterat es its guidance presented on April 12, 2017, in which Valmet estimates that net sales in 2017 will increase in comparison with 2016 (EUR 2,926 million) and Co mparable EBITA in 2017 will increase in comparison with 2016 (EUR 196 million). Short -term outlook General economic outlook The global upswing in economic activity is strengthening, with global growth projected to rise to 3.6 percent in 2017 and 3.7 perce nt in 2018. Broad -based upward revisions in the euro area, Japan, emerging Asia, emerging Europe, and Russia more than offset downward revisions for the United States and the United Kingdom. While the baseline outlook is strengthening, growth remains weak in many countries, and inflation is below target in most advanced economies. And while short -term risks are broadly balanced, medium -term risks are still tilted to the downside. (International Monetary Fund, October 10, 2017) Valmet's Interim Review, January -September 2017 | 23 Short -term market outlook Valm et estimates that the short -term market outlook has decreased to a satisfactory level in energy (previously good level). Valmet reiterates the good short -term market outlook for services, board and paper, and tissue, the satisfactory short -term market outl ook for automation , and the weak short -term market outlook for pulp .

Valmet Oyj is domiciled in Helsinki, and its registered address is Keilasatama 5, 02150 Espoo, Finland. The Company's shares are listed on the Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd. These Conde nsed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements w ere approved for issue on October 24 , 2017. Basis of presentation These Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for the nine months ended September 30 , 2017 have been prepared in accordance with I AS 34, 'Interim financial reporting' and in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The financial information presented in these Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements has not been audited. The Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Group's Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. Since January 1 , 2017, the Group has adopted new standards and interpretations into its accounti ng and reporting, including but no t limited to, amendments to IAS 12 'Income taxes' and IAS 7 'Cash flow statements'. These amendments did not however, have a material impact on the results or financial position of Val met Gr oup or the presentation of these Interim Financial S tatements. Settin g aside new pronouncements, the accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements are consistent with those followed in th e preparation of the Group's Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. In the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements the figures are presented in million euros subject to rounding, which may cause some rou nding inaccuracies in aggregate column and row totals. New accounting standards IFRS 15 - Revenue from contracts with customers Starting January 1, 2018 , Valmet will adopt IFRS 15, 'Revenue from contracts with customers '. In the expectation of adopting th e new standard governing revenue recognition, Valmet management has decided to no longer use the milestone method as the preferred method for measuring progress in contracts where revenue is recognized in proportion to the stage of completion of contract a ctivity . As of January 1, 2017 , the cost -to-cost method is used as Valmet's primary method for measuring progress of contract activity. Management estimates that for some contracts this change will defer revenue recognition in the beginning of the project. This is however, not expected to have a significant impact on the amount of gross profit recognized in any interim reporting period. Update to information provided in the year -end 2016 annual financial statements on the impact of the implementation of th e key concepts of IFRS 15 is provided below. Identification of performance obligations In long -term capital projects, involving delivery of both equipment and services, Valmet management expects to identify one or more performance obligations under the new standard. The identification of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements Valmet's Interim Review , January -September 2017 | 31 performance obligations depends on the scope of the pr oject and terms of the contract and will largely follow the level at which quotes are being requested by the customers on capital projects. In service contracts involv ing delivery of combination of equipment and services, depending on the scope of the cont ract and terms attached thereto, Valmet management expects to identify one or more performance obligations. When scope of the contract involves services provided at the customer site, such as installation, maintenance, technical support or mechanical audit s, these are typically considered a separate performance obligation from delivery of significant equipment and services provided off -site. On the other hand, when services in the scope of the contract are performed at Valmet premises only , such as workshop services, material and services typically cannot be identified separately, and consistently only one performance obligation is identified. In long -term service contracts where Valmet's activities are la rgely performed at the customer s' site, depending on the contract and terms attached thereto, Valmet management expects to identify one or more performance obligations. When the scope of the contract involves various services elements that are separately sold on stand -alone basis, these elements would typica lly be determined to consist of performance obligations on their own. Recognition of revenue Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service. A customer obtains control when it has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the good or service, either over time or at a point in time. When Valmet determines that control on goods or services is transferred over time, this is typically based on either that customer simultaneously receives and consume s benefits as Valmet performs, or that Valmet's performance creates an asset with no alternative use and Valmet has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Deliverables from within Valmet's product offering that have the charact eristics of the first criterion include mill maintenance services or other field services provided under long -term contracts, in which the receipt and simultaneous consumption by the customer of the benefits of Valmet's performance can be readily identifie d. Deliverables with the characteristics of the second criterion include capital projects where the scope of the contract involves design and construction of an asset according to customer specifications. The assets created in these projects do not have alternative use because the design is based on specific customer needs . When revenue is recognized over time, progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation is measured using the cost -to-cost method. The cost -to-cost method is estimated to result in a revenue profile that best depicts the transfer of control on the deliverables to the customer. In customer contracts where revenue is currently recognized upon transfer of risks and rewards associated with the deliverable to the customer, Va lmet management does not expect to see a significant change in the amount of revenue or gross profit recognized in any interim reporting period when moving into recognizing revenue upon transfer of control. Recognition of revenue at a point in time is appl icable, among others, in contracts where services are performed at Valmet's premises and deliveries of spare -parts and components. Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements Valmet's Interim Review , January -September 2017 | 32 Other steps of the revenue recognition model Valmet management does not expect the new guidance on identification of a customer contract or allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations identified in the contract to affect the amount or timing of revenue and cost recognition. However, Valmet's contracts often involve elements of variable consideration and management estimates that the reassessment of the transaction prices at each reporting date, requiring significant amount of judgment, could affect the timing of revenue recognition following the adoption of the new standard . Valmet management has sele cted the full retrospective restatement approach when adopting the new revenue guidance as of January 1, 2018. The cumulative effect of applying IFRS 15 will therefore be recognized in retained e arnings for the date of January 1, 2017. Management is in pro cess of preparing a quantification of the impact of the new standard as at the transition. IFRS 9 - Financial instruments IFRS 9, 'Financial i nstruments ' includes guidance for recognition and derecognition, classification and measurement, impairment and he dge accounting for financial assets and liabilities within the standard's scope. Application of the new standard is mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and it replaces current guidance included in IAS 39 , 'Financial instr uments: recognition and measurements' . IFRS 9 establishes three separate measurement categories for financial assets, including amorti zed cost, fair value through other comprehensive income and fair value through profit or loss. The basis of classification depends on the entity's business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Under IFRS 9 classification and measurement of financial liabilities continues wi th the two categories of amortiz ed cost and fair value through profit or loss similar to currently. For Valmet, new classification and measurement guidance presents changes in terminology used for finan cial instruments, yet impact to reported figures will be limited. New impairment model is expected to present most significant changes arising from implementation of IFRS 9. The new model is based on expected credit losses while the current model is based on incurred losses, resulting in an increase in allowance for doubtful receivables recognized as at transition. IFRS 9 includes a simplification from the general impairment model for trade receivables and contract assets, under which allowance amounting to lifetime expected credit losses is recognized at the time of the initial recognition of the asset. Majority of Valmet's financial assets within the new impairment model's scope are subject to above mentioned simplification. Hedge accounting requirements i n IFRS 9 allow entities to better reflect risk management ac tivities in the financial statements by requiring economic rela tionship to be demonstrated between hedged item and hedging instrument, instead of current bright line hedge effectiveness tests. W hen hedging for future changes in commodity prices, option to designate one or more risk components of non -financial risks as hedged items is expected to both expand utilization of hedge accounting and decrease volatility in profit or loss due to increased hedge effectiveness. Valmet management is in process of quantifying the transition date impact arising from implementation of IFRS 9. Valmet has decided not to restate prior periods and any change at transition will be recorded to opening balance of reta ined earnings on January 1, 2018.

Valmet's four business lines are highly integrated through complementing product and service offering and joint customer projects. Thus, the operations and profitability of Valmet is reported on as a single reportable segment with the key operative decisions being made by the CODM at the Valmet Group level . One key indicator of performance reviewed is EBITA (Earnings before interest, taxes and amortization). The performance is also assessed through Comparable EBITA, i.e. with EBITA excluding items, such as capacity adjustment costs, impairment of assets, an d other infrequent events, as these reduce the comparability of the Group's performance from one period to another.

On September 16, 2016, Valmet announced by stock exchange release of arbitration proceedings initiated by Suzano Papel e Celulose S.A. (Suzano) against three Valmet legal e ntities related to the construction of a green field pulp mill in Imperatriz, Brazil, claiming approximately EUR 80 million. In Q2/2017, a payment of EUR 23 million was released by the bank to Suzano from on -demand performance bonds provided by Valmet as p erformance security. Valmet management disputes the claims brought by Suza no and their right to the funds . Management has determined not to disclose any further information on the case on the grounds that it can be expected to seriously prejudice the ongoi ng legal procedures. As at September 30 , 2017 , Valmet entities are subject to tax audits in several jurisdictions. Liabilities and assets are recognized with respect to income tax amounts management is expecting to pay and recover, respectively. No liabili ty is recognized when it is considered probable that items reported to tax authorities can be sustained on examination. Complex and constantly changing regulations in multiple jurisdictions where Valmet operates create uncertainties relating to tax obligat ions towards authorities. Changes in the tax authorities' interpretations could have unfavorable impact on Valmet's financials.
