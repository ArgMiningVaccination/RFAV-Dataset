With focus and determination, I had been able to overcome many obstacles\u2014with the exception of one. Over the years I gradually bloated up, becoming 50 pounds overweight. I could not maintain weight loss. I am a psychotherapist, so my clients would often ask me to help them lose weight. Although I am an expert in facilitating behavior change, I would tell them frankly: \"I can help you overcome your depression and anxiety, and teach you self-control strategies. But the research on weight loss shows that even with major medical problems people generally can't lose weight and maintain the loss. If they do shed pounds, they gain them back. Only about 5 percent are consistently successful. Furthermore, I myself can't slim down, so how can I help you? When you are feeling better and figure out how to lose weight, please let me know!\" In 25 years of practice, no one had taken me up on the challenge. Finally, someone did. Jack's father had lost 50 pounds on the Atkins low carbohydrate diet years before it became the latest craze, when the medical establishment still viewed it as unhealthy. So my client and his wife tried the Atkins diet and both lost about 30 pounds. That's a lot of pounds for one family! I was intrigued and excited. After all these years, one of my clients had taken my quip seriously and actually brought me a weight loss success story. I read the Atkins diet book voraciously, cut back the carbohydrates, and very quickly lost over 20 pounds. I became a true believer. I thrilled at eating eggs again, steak, and delectable desserts of sugar-free cheesecake with nut crust and chocolate truffles. This is too good to be true, I exclaimed to myself\u2014and to anyone else who would listen. I am enjoying my favorite foods, can eat to satiation, and never have to feel hungry. I even found my cholesterol went down\u2014and it hadn't been high in the first place. I became convinced that Atkins was a modern hero who had single-handedly bucked the medical establishment. It had erroneously foisted low-fat diets upon us, only to yield the horrendous obesity problem we battle today. I persuaded a physician friend, and he began to tentatively recommend the Atkins diet to his patients. I enthusiastically initiated other friends with a sample of my Atkins-style, nut crust cheesecake! But then something familiar happened: I reached a plateau and couldn't lose more than the initial 20 pounds. But at least I could maintain that loss and wasn't gaining. Then something worse happened: Almost imperceptibly, I began to follow the way of all flesh and the diet slipped away from me. Through bad times and good times, my eating increased and the pounds followed. Even though I biked long distances several times weekly, I regained all the weight I had lost. After a magnificent cruise in the Caribbean, with food that to my hungry eyes surpassed the islands' beauty, I added an additional 10 pounds during one week. I climbed ashore with an increased girth that topped out at 230 pounds, more than my weight before the diet. Sound familiar? My bubble of enthusiasm burst and I had to face the fact that I had been wrong. I reverted to thinking that perhaps, as some believe, I was ruled by a biological set point that could only be fooled temporarily. My ability to apply a generally strong willpower to dieting had failed me yet again. The long-awaited epiphany from my client had turned out to be a false prophecy. He and his wife also regained the weight they had lost\u2014and then some. The truth is simply this: In the long run, diets alone don't work. Not the low fat diet, not the Grapefruit Diet, not the Atkins diet, not the Next Diet, whatever it may be. The English scriptwriter Dennis Norden summed it up best: There was only one occasion in my life when I put myself on a strict diet and I can tell you, hand over heart, it was the most miserable afternoon I have ever spent. Is there any hope, I wondered, for the hopelessly overweight? There must be some solution. It simply didn't make sense that so many would be doomed to the myriad medical problems associated with obesity. This is not the way it was intended to be. This cannot be part of the cosmic plan. There must be an answer. Eventually, I had a breakthrough\u2014through a combination of confrontation and awareness. On a walk through the woods with a dear friend, the conversation turned to addiction. \"Of all the problems I've had, addiction hasn't been one,\" I asserted. My friend, who knew me well, gently suggested otherwise: \"But you use food.\" The notion that food was comforting to me was hardly new. My Jewish upbringing revolved around food: It meant celebration, family connection, and love. I recall the double-thick, extra-lean corned beef sandwiches that my father prepared lovingly and brought home Sunday nights from the New York deli where he worked to supplement his government job. The family gathered around the TV to watch Ed Sullivan\u2014and ate. But the notion that I was using food the way an addict uses a drug hit me with harsh clarity: I was addicted to food. I am an observant Jew, and I realized that if I was addicted to a substance, I was not dedicated to God with my entire self. Traditional Judaism teaches that you should love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your power. If I let something other than God control me, my allegiance was divided. It occurred to me that we are taught to emulate our holy role models. I was certain that this was not the way our great prophet Moses would eat, nor his saintly sister, Miriam. The sages taught that we should be exceedingly humble because Moses was exceeding humble, and that we should emulate him. I realized that there was something unholy about my use of food. With this awareness, I turned away from diets and towards God. I became intrigued about whether the Bible would provide clues to how Moses and Miriam ate so that we could follow their model. I re-discovered the long known, but rarely applied, solution to the intractable problem of being overweight\u2014Eating with holiness. As I learned more, I discovered that this ancient wisdom is contained in the Bible and traditional spiritual practices rooted in Kabbalah. Although it is a simple truth, it has remained a secret for two reasons: First, for centuries the teachings of the Kabbalah were considered too esoteric for most people and were shared with only a small group of initiates. Second, for psychological reasons, people prefer not to talk about linking eating to holiness: They want to eat according to their own desires rather than follow God's will. Once this secret was revealed to me and became alive, I began losing weight easily\u2014even joyfully\u2014and with mounting confidence that something truly different was happening this time. The problem is that during the obesity explosion of the last half-century, we have been desperately looking in the wrong direction for a solution. A notable exception is the 12-step program for weight loss. The originators of this program brilliantly intuited that a spiritual void and the need to turn to a Higher Power are at the core of disorders of desire, such as alcoholism and food addiction. But most modern strategies become preoccupied with diet\u2014with what we eat. This preoccupation directs our gaze downward towards the earth where food grows rather than upward towards the source of the food itself\u2014towards God and the deep connection between body and spirit, between eating and holiness. The idea of Holy Eating was crystallizing. As I shed the first 25 pounds, many friends began to notice and comment, You look great. How did you do it? I need to lose some weight too. This time I initially declined to start bubbling about my new enthusiasm. I am not prepared to discuss it, I demurred. Being a psychotherapist, I would have loved to help. But I had learned that the more I spoke to convince others, the less likely it was that I was secure in my own practices. At this early stage, I felt this new approach was between God and me. Also, I didn't want to waste my friends' time with yet another intriguing\u2014but short-lived\u2014way to lose weight. After all, I could have paraphrased Mark Twain's comment on quitting smoking: Losing weight is easy: I have done it dozens of times. Before I spoke out, I needed to see whether I would maintain the new weight. The turning point came when I realized that I was focusing more on a closer relationship with God and less on food, or even on the gratifying weight loss itself. These became secondary benefits, not the preoccupations they used to be. When people who are dieting share a meal, they tend to talk ad nauseam about food: what they eat, what they don't eat, how this diet is really the one. They are still obsessed with food, as I was. As more weight came off, the same good friends kept approaching me. When they asked a third time, I could no longer turn them away. If you are really interested, I now replied, let's sit down and talk for an hour or so. I am ready to share the secret. I was surprised that some people were able to grasp the idea of Holy Eating and make it work after as little as a single hour of discussion\u2014and go on to lose 10, 15, even 25 pounds. But most needed a more intensive program. While the core concept of Holy Eating continued guiding me toward both spiritual and physical transformation, I formed the idea of writing this book to share my experience with the many people seeking a solution. At this time, the spiritual leader of my community told me he had been cleaning his office and found a book that belonged to me. He had no idea why he had it and I did not recall giving it to him. But it had my name on it. The book, Jewish Spiritual Practices, by Yitzchak Buxbaum is a treasure trove derived from Kabbalah and Chassidic (pietistic) sources that aims to elevate everyday activities by infusing them with spirituality. One chapter dealt with eating and inspired me to develop some of the strategies included here. Although Buxbaum does not apply these eating concepts to weight loss specifically, this volume indicates that there is nothing new in the approach that I describe here. Some of these ideas have been followed for hundreds of years, others no doubt for thousands. But today more than ever there is a need to apply them specifically to weight loss. Happily, the wisdom of Kabbalah is, for the first time in history, becoming more widely available. For the past 200 years, the secrets of the Kabbalah have been distilled and revealed to the average person. Increasingly, non-Jews are also turning to this source of time-tested Jewish spiritual wisdom for guidance about how to live. I recall a popular New York advertisement for Levy's rye bread that showed smiling, multi-cultural individuals holding a large sandwich with a caption stating: You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy Levy's Real Jewish Rye. Similarly, you don't have to be Jewish to benefit from Holy Eating because the universal teachings are totally consistent with the major world religions that grew out of Judaism. But why look to Jews for insight into how to eat? The impression exists that many religious Jews are overweight. In fact, a Purdue University study found that obesity is associated with higher levels of "}
