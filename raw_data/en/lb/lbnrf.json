These same inmates, whether predatory or impulsive, often show poor decision making skills and lack behavioral self regulation. And importantly, they tend not to respond to conventional treatments in spite of their greater need for intervention. Yet, few correctional facilities have the knowledge or resources to attempt to more effectively treat these inmates given that the supportive research is lacking. Many triage them into 23-hour segregation units to minimize the safety concerns they pose and to avoid consuming scarce treatment resources on a population that does not respond to conventional approaches. Research suggests that a significant number of these inmates have psychopathic characteristics that further complicate treatment efforts and worsen their post-release outcomes. In response to the inability to effectively treat these inmates, several stat es screen for psychopathy to exclude them from treatment in an effort to avoid waste of precious resources on those who are not likely to respond favorably. For example, some states disqualify drug abusing offenders with high scores on the Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R) (Hare, 1991) from treatment programs. Overall, there are few concerted attempts to treat these inmates, and most efforts have not fared well (Hare, 1999). Correctional administrators see clear public safety benefits to being able to accurately identify these inmates and more effectively direct treatment resources. In the absence of a thorough understanding of what underlies inmates' persistent misconduct and treatment resistance, we will continue to fail to reach this very important subgroup, which is responsible for the majority of serious, violent crimes in our communities. Evidence is mounting from interdisciplinary research and clinical investigations to implicate dysfunction of the thinking process, perception of social cues, and regulation of emotional responses to stressful or provocativ e situations in this difficult and unresponsive subgroup. In particular, impairments in higher order cognitive skills, called executive cognitive functions (ECF), and emotional regulation are thought to play a significant role in violence and psychopathy and to potentially explain the seemingly callous disregard for threats of punishment, rules and values, and future consequences, as well as an excessive need for stimulation and reward. Because ECF impairments are malleable, there is potential for affected individuals to respond favorably to treatment approaches that are specifically targeted to existing deficits. Incorporation of this knowledge into criminal justice policies and practices could alter their course substantially to dramat ically improve the ability to assess, detect, and treat offenders who are currently considered intractable. A primary goal of the research reported herein was to identify fundamental differences in ECF function and emotional perception and regulation between inmates who respond favorably to standard correctional therapies, which are often cognitive-behavioral in approach, and those who respond poorly. Studies suggest that ECF and emotional dysfunction is prevalent within the inmate population, in some cases the result of a high incidence of head injury and in others possibly due to suboptimal child development, genetics, or a history of adversity. This research further shows that offenders with relative deficits in cognitive and emotional regulatory did not respond well to a standard correctional treatment, as reflected in low retention, poor engagement and compliance, repeated institutional infractions. This knowledge may serve to inform the field as to individual characteristics that distinguish between inmates positively affected by various interventions relative to those least affected and determine what components are needed to design an effective interv ention strategy (e.g., intensive cognitive rehabilitation). This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.The second purpose of this research was to develop an assessment tool that can be readily used within both correctional and clinical settings to identify aggressive, psychopathic and otherwise high risk offenders with cognitive deficits. The ultimate goal is to develop a knowledge base that would allow for triaging inmates to targeted treatments on the basis of underlying ECF deficits. Because the subgroup of inmates that does not respond to conventional treatments often possess underlying individual vulnerabilities and adverse social conditions that compound their problems and are particularly at risk for persistent serious criminality and substance abuse, this subgroup likely requires more intensive and customized approaches. Accordingly, inmates will be better equipped to maintain control over their own behavior rather than requiring severe methods of external restraint that are suddenly terminated upon release. Consistent findings indicate that far fewer crimes are committed when individuals are actively in treatment (see Fishbein, 1991; Fishbein and Pease, 1996). At present, the only instrument that reliably predicts institutional misconduct, poor treatment response and post-release commission of serious offenses is the Psychopathy Checklist- Revised (PCL-R; Hare, 1991). Unfortunately, however, while this instrument is highly predictive, others without psychopathy who are also at high risk for serious offending are not covered and the PCL-R is not indicative of underlying mechanisms for poor treatment and post-release outcomes which might direct future treatment approaches. Instead, development of a sensitive and specific screening test is necessary to predict recidivism, institutional misconduct, and/or drug abuse relapse for a variety of inmates and which also provides information about what deficits may be preventing positive outcomes. This development would constitute an important advance for treatment planning. This research may further enhance the potential to improve criminal justice policies. Informing the criminal justice, mental health, and public health systems of this genre of research findings is critical to address the triggers (both causal and exacerbating) in the social environment that can contribute to violence and psychopathy in susceptible individuals. Incorporating this knowledge regarding underlying generators of misconduct and aggression into criminal justice policies has potential to reach a greater proportion of the population than will individual treatment programs and may contribute eventually to large-scale, system-wide policy changes, such as in processes affecting bail, pretrial detention, sentencing, and release decisions, as well as child rearing and school practices. The availability of more effective treatments for various antisocial behaviors will offer policy makers additional tools in preventing and responding to criminal conduct. An understanding of underlying mechanisms in misconduct has the potential to produce more favorable treatment outcomes in offenders and to improve the prevention of behavioral problems . This manual constitutes the final product of this study. Given the unique potential for practical use of these findings, this manual describes neuropsychological techniques used in the present study which can be practically employed in correctional settings for characterizing inmates, predicting treatment response, and designing effective treatment strategies. This manual delineates procedures and tests that best predict treatment response and for which inmate subtypes, along with a discussion of interventions that have the most potential to address ECF deficits in aggressive and recalcitrant offenders for eventual implementation and evaluation.

There is invariably a su bstantial an d \"influential\" subgroup t hat does not respond to t reatment favorably, e xhibiting hig h levels of a ntisocia l and disruptive b ehavior within and outsid e of the correctional environment . It is cr itical that under lying mechanisms for these differential effects are identifie d to improve treatment efficacy. Integrity of neuropsychological funct ion and its control over emotional responses ma y repres ent key dimensions of regulatory processes involved in persistent misconduct an d may play a principal r ole in differe ntial respon ses to treatment related t o higher-order executive cognitive functions (ECF) are of particu lar interest given their role in impulsivity, sensitivity to consequen ces, decisio n making, attention, and social skills. There is str ong evidence for ECF and emotional impairment in a significant proportion o f antisocial o ffenders, which may b e related to t heir recidivism and resist ance to auth ority and standard treatments. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie poo r responses to treatment will maximi ze the return on investment that correctional administrators direct to ward interve ntion strateg ies by making it po ssible to triage inmate subgroups ba sed on prog ramming ne eds. This project was designe d to identify ECF and emotional deficits in inmates with poor behavioral outcomes in a standard b ut high quality correction al therapy. A program with a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) b ase was selected given its widespre ad use in U. S. prisons. Although there is evide nce for its ef ficacy, a sig nificant subgroup does not respond well, as indicated by high recidivism and relapse rates, a s well as po or attendance, complian ce, and retention rat es. The Maryland Public Safety and Correctional Services Administratio n provided their approval to conduct a study of over 200 in mates entering CBT programs in three Maryland institutio ns. Psychological, behavioral and background questionnaires w ere administered and ECF and emotional deficits a ssessed using se nsitive and specific n europsychological tasks. Emotional stress respon ses (via the hormone cortisol) to a stressful ta sk were monito red. Also, a virtual reality techniqu e was employed to mea sure actual r isky decisio n making pre- and post- intervention. It was hypothesized th at inmates who do not respond favorably to CBT would be those with r elative deficits in ECF and emotional regulation. Thus, this study assesse d the predictive validity of the se instruments and, importantly, attempted to elucidate some underlying mechanisms in subtype s of inmates that will be i nstructive in developing targeted treatment strategies. Antisocial Behavior Defined Antisocial behavior or persistent misconduct ar e complex concepts defined variably in different discipline s and arising from widely diverging origins. No single mental disorder is uniquely associated with antisocia l behavior, nor are specific beh avioral patterns, childhood e xperiences, or social circu mstances. From the array of characteriza tions, however, emerges a subgroup of individuals who persist ently engage in impulsive and This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

This group is typified not sim ply by the b ehavioral outcome but by relatively s table person ality and temperame ntal traits, including in sensitivit y to consequence s, negative affect, and cognitive deficits. Displays of antisocial beh avior are, hypothetically, an outgrowth of these traits in interaction with aggression-prone situations. B y contrast, individuals who exhibit only isolated displays of a ntisocia l behavior ma y be more influenced by social and situational facto rs and probably do not possess the requisit e condition s to produce a true \"vulnerability\" to a destructive behavioral pattern. This depiction corresponds with the patter n described by Moffitt (1 993, 1994) who characterizes a subgroup of chronic of fenders by \"life-course p ersistent ant isocia l behavior culminating in a pathologic personality. \" Impulsivity is the most common beh avioral and psychological in impul sive aggression gical arousa l; committ ed primarily to intimidat and dominate others; and (c) not planned beh avior. Impulsive antisocial behavior or misconduct may be u niquely generated by impairmen ts in the ability to accurately perceiv e emotional cues and the n to regulate responses to th em. These regulatory ab ilities are modulated by the prefrontal cortex and its com munication with lower structures in t he limbic system which is responsible for emotional reactions to social inform ation (see Figure 1) (Davidson et al., 2000). Low scores on ECF tasks h ave been reported in nu merous studies of impulsive-aggressi ve subjects relative to various cont rol groups ( Atkins et al., 1993; et al., 1998; Houston & Stanford, 2001; Mathias & Stanford, 1999). Understanding mechanisms in impulsivity is relevant to the treatment of antisocial behavior (Davidson et al., 2000). T hus, the research described h erein explored the possi bility that th e neuropsychological correlates of im pulsive misconduct influence tre atment outcomes. In contrast, predatory antisocia l offe nders who are provocative and relatively unemo tional rather than reactive and highly emotional (as in impulsive aggressive offenders) in their aggression are kno wn as \"psychop aths.\" Psychopathy is a personality trait thought to characterize about 1% of the general pop ulation and about 20% in the prison population. Psychopaths are though t to be responsible for over half of all violent crimes (Hare 1991). And importantly, they are characterize d by cognitive, emotional and physiological deficit s (Blair et al 2001; Dawes et al., 2000; Lorenz et al 2002, Brower et al 2001, LaPierre et al 19 95) that are manifested as poor decision ma king, insensitivity to consequences, b ehavioral disinhibit ion, inattention, a e motional responses (McCloskey et al 2005, Campanella et al 2005, Blair 2003). These dimensions of E CF underlie social competenc y skills that, when in deficit, ma y contribute to high risk behaviors. Ample research has rep orted a high incidence of ECF deficit s in populations that typically engage in h igh risk be haviors, inclu ding drug ab users (Fishb ein et al., 2005; Tarter et al., 1999) , alcoholi cs (Sullivan and Pfefferbaum, 2005), children with conduct disorder (Bauer & Hesselbrock, 2001 ), and criminal offenders (Brower and Price, 2001 ). ECF deficits in psychopaths may contrib ute to the re gulatory dysfunction of cognitive and affective processes t hat may und erlie both th eir risky decision making and their e motional detachment. Importantly, psychopaths do not respond favorably to standard treatments for either antisocial behavior or for drug abuse (Hill et al. , 1996; Shin e & Hobson, 2000; Rice, 1997). Thus, it is essential th at tendencie s toward psychopathy a re considere d in the assessment of inmates and This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The following review discusses the role of ECF and emotional deficits in persistent misconduct and the confounding role of substance abuse. Evidence for Neuropsychological Impairments in Antisocial and Unresponsive Inmates Recent research on underlying mechanisms in antisocial behavior and also psychopathy may be applicable to developing more effective correctional treatments for subgroups that tend to be unresponsive to standard approaches. These inmates are largely responsible for (a) a disproportionate amount of aggressive crimes against persons, (b) high recidivism rates, (c) a significant number of institutional rule violations, (d) high rates of substance abuse, and (e) poor treatment outcomes (Hill et al., 1996; Shine & Hobson, 2000; Rice, 1997). Repetitively conduct disordered offenders are often diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD), and a subset of these as psychopaths. Their personal histories are typified by childhood aggression, insensitivity to punishment, emotional dysregulat ion, risk taking, and sensation seeking. These inmates are recommitted more often than other inmates, a majority of them recidivate with aggressive offenses (Hare, 1999; Hare & McPherson, 1984; Hart et al., 1988; Lynam, 1996), and they are more likely to develop an early and more severe course of drug abuse (Hubbard et al., 1989). Treatments appropriately targeted to the generators or triggers of antisocial behavior may make prisons safer, reduce the public risks of releasing these inmates untreated, and establish humane and effective treatment procedures (Fabiano et al., 1990a, 1990b, 1991; Robinson, 1995; Serin, 1994). Executive Cognitive Function and Impulsive Misconduct Studies have consistently found that deficits in certain neuropsychological functions correlate with aggression, impulsivity, and other forms of persistent, serious misconduct. Most investigations have used traditional neuropsychological tests whose reliability and sensitivity for dysfunction have been variable (Rogers & Robbins, 2001). Newly developed neurocognitive instruments detect specific cognitive deficits with more sensitivity to produce results with potential for practical use. Measurement of ECF, a subset of neuropsychological abilities, has become more refined (but is not without methodological and conceptual controversy) (Lyon & Krasnegor, 1999). ECF deficits implicated in antisocial behavior are thought to be responsible for poor social skills and decision-making ability , insensitivity to punishment, impulsivity, and inability to regulate emotional responses (Dawes et al., 2000). ECF deficits contribute to personality traits and disorders often cited as antecedents for antisocial behavior, most notably early and persistent aggression, psychopathy, substance abuse, conduct disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Fishbein, 2000a; Giancola et al., 1996, 1998; Paschall Fishbein, 2001; Tarter et al., 1999). Prevalence of neuropsychological dysfunction is significantly higher in these populations than in offenders who do not engage in persistent misconduct (see Rogers & Robbins, 2001; Reiss et al., 1994; Raine, 1993; Volavka, 1995). Antisocial behavior is typified by several antecedent behavioral and psychological traits associated with ECF deficits (e.g., impaired goal-directed behavior, history of conduct disorder, sensation seeking, attention deficits, and poor pr oblem solving) (Barratt et al., 1997; Mirsky & Siegel, & Henry, 1989; Schonfeld et al., 1988). Impairments in ability to assess consequences and act on that assessment, as reflected in the personality trait of impulsivity, may underlie these traits (Barratt & Patton, 1983; Gray, 1983; Gray & McNaughton, 1983; Newman, 1987; Shapiro et al., 1988). Thus, the link between brain function abnormality and aggression may be explained by altered cognitive capacities. Impaired ECF may compromise the ability to interpret social cues during interpersonal interactions, which may lead to This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

As a result, difficult ies ar ise in gener ating sociall y adaptive behaviors and executing responses to avoid aggre ssive or stressful int eractions. A lso, compromised cognitive control over behavior ma y permit hostility, negative affective st ates, and other maladaptive responses to dominate Studies cog l behavior implicate the PFC, as m entioned above (Bryant et al., 1984; Elliott, 1992; Moffitt & He nry, 1989), located in fro nt of the brain and respo nsible for h igher intellectual function. Be cause certa in regions of the PFC play a role in forethought, b ehavioral inhibition, and capacit y to learn from et al., 1994; Bechara et al., 1996; Damasio et al., 1990), n europsychological fun ctions known t o be executed by the PFC are of particular interest (see figure 2). The PFC also plays a rol e in the regu latory system controllin g emotions and moods, which can b e measured in hormonal responses ( e.g., cortiso l) (Brutus et al., 1986; Elliott, 1992; Volavka, 1995). There is evidence t hat a discon nect between the PFC and structure s in the limbic syste m (an emoti onal center) for d isinhib ited b ehavior, inability to act on an assessment of consequences, and poor e motional perceptions and regulation (Davidson et al., 200 0). The novel and sensitive test battery proposed for use in prisons focuses on f unctions tha t have been linked to a ctivity in the PFC and its connection s with the limbic system. Evidence for PFC-related neuropsychological dysfunction in antisocial behavior, particularly ag gression, is compelling ( Moffitt and Henry, 1991 ); numerous studies h linked PFC activity with specific cog nitive deficit s found in ungas, 1988; Seguin et al., 1995). Psychopaths who have been characterized as a ggressive h ave been distinguishe d from nonpsychopaths on the basis of neuropsychologica l functioning of the PFC (Gorenstein, 1 982). Prefrontal lobe da mage was reported in 73% of subjects with a h istory of violent crimes compared wit h 28% of th ose with no such damage (Bryant et al., 1984). Studies that use neuroimaging techniques to monitor b activity (e.g., PET, fMRI) have found diminished brain activity in the PFC in individuals with persistent violent behavior (Goyer et al., 1994). Raine et al. (1997) examined 41 murderers an d 41 age-matched controls using PET and a contin uous perfor mance task that produce d increases in glucose me tabolism in t he PFC of control subje cts (Buchsb aum et al., 1990). Murderers exhibited reduced gluco se metabolism during cognitive performance in the PFC and other region s that modulate emotions and cognit ive processes. Raine e t al.

These measures predict ed group membership with an accu racy of 76.9%; 71.4% of the group had been arrested.

Studies using neuro psychological tasks and biological measures of the neur al circu itry between the PFC and limbic system show that a combination of a propen sity to negative affect and inability to shift behavi oral strategi es in response to anticipated negative consequences of acting ag gressively is associa ted with antisocia l behavior (Davi dson et al., 2000). The abilit y to accurately perceive emotional cu social settin gs and regulate behavioral response s to them is equally as important as higher order neuropsychological skills in understandin g persistent misconduct. Tests that assess th ability to ide ntify emotion in facia l expressions, for example, are particula rly good at in measuring emotional perception and have been s hown to discriminate between aggres nonaggressive subjects (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2 001; Stevens et al., 200 1). The research described h erein measured ability to perceive emotional cu es (emotional task) and emotion reactivity (cortisol respo nses), which are believed to be impaired in a variety of antisocial behaviors, including ag gression an d substance abuse. from research on acute and chronic effect s of social st ress (e.g., child abuse o r family dysfunction) on biological systems that regulate hormone release (Meaney et al., 1996), as depicted in Figure 3. T he function of the hypothalami c-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis involves glands that reg ulate release of stress hormones (e.g., cortiso l), is particularly relevant to behavior that is emotionally driven. For example, ph ysiological r esponses to stress been related to persisten t aggression (e.g., McBurnett et al., 2000).

Such deficits are considered to reflect an underarousal of emotional systems that regulate the ability to process, interpret, and react to social cues (Walker et al., 1991). Involvement of the PFC in low emotional arousal among psychopaths and other aggressive offenders may contribute to blunted behavioral an hormonal responses to various tasks, outward ly expressed as reduced responsiveness to socially meaningful stimuli. Supportive car egiving in early childhood is essential for proper development of the PFC, which must be fully functioning to inhibit inappropriate emotional responses (Bremner, 1999). Thus, the dual presence of a lack of proper parenting and socadversity, which is common in the inmate populat ion, increases the likelihood of ECF deficits and emotional dysregulation. This research assessed release of cortisol in response to an emotionally stimulating task and found that these measures were useful in predicting treatmresponse (e.g., readiness, institutional misconduct), as described later. d ial ent he Role of Stress and Adversity ources of damage to neural circuits that may disrupt ability to assess consequences and regul g that the l an , ry ress d erhaps not coincidentally, the incidence of adverse social (e.g., child abuse) and physica P, in s wn in the T S ate impulses include head injury, prenatal drug exposure, neurotoxins, childhood deprivation, and chronic drug use. Many of these factors are environmental, suggestin brain, especially the prefrontal cortex, is exquisi tely sensitive to physical and social influences. Environmental conditions directly influence brain function and behavior, affecting functions of the brain and determining the level of vulnerability to high risk behaviors. Adversity or stressfuconditions, particularly those experienced in early life, may compromise social, behavioral, cognitive and emotional functioning in profound ways. There is evidence that early stress cproduce developmental delays of the prefrontal co rtex and its connections with limbic structures potentially compromising these regulatory functions in adulthood (Bremner et al., 1999; Bremner et al., 2000; Critchley et al., 2000; Davidson, 1994; de Haan et al., 1994). Exposure to chronic stressors can further alter hormonal systems that modulate these functions (Huether, 1998); chronically elevated levels of these hormones like cortisol have potential to reduce volume of areas of the brain responsible for learning, memory, and emotions, potentially impairing memoand decision making (Nelson & Carver, 1998; Sapolsky, 1996). The functional consequences of alterations in these neurobehavioral processes are poor stress adaptations manifested as impaired social, cognitive, psychological, and emotional responses thought to be critical in propensity to various high risk behaviors. Piazza and LeMoal (1998) have proposed that st\"primes\" the brain's reward pathway and thus enhances the positive (mood enhancing) and negative (stress relief) reinforcement of continued drug use and other high risk and novelty seeking behavior. Antisocial behaviors may therefore occur as a maladaptive behavioral an physiological coping response to stressful stimuli (Shiffman, 1982). P l (e.g., head injury) experiences is high in offender populations (Martell, 1992; OJJD 1998; Volavka et al., 1992). Those with brain dysfunction are significantly more likely to have been indicted for violent crimes (Martell, 1992; Raine et al., 2000). Identifying the origin and significance of these deficits is essential to designing targeted prevention and treatment strategies. Treatment effectiveness relies on understanding the relationships among bradysfunction, cognition, impulse control, and propensity for aggression. Table 1 provides a breakdown of mechanisms believed to underlie behavioral problems, with the first two boxeshowing factors that contribute to alterations in physiological responses which can be manifested as deficits in executive cognitive and emotional regulatory functions, as sho third box. In turn, such deficits often result in behavioral problems. The table concludes with a few suggested interventions that may be indicated, based on deficits which an inmate presents.

Higher neuropsychological function has been associated with better treatme ). n h y ble ates who tend to be refractory to conventional treatments. Intact ECF and its regulation of emotional tone may, in fact, be a prerequ th tinct eir this nship between ECF, emotional deficits, and various forms of misconduct such as aggression and noncompliance; (2) al ll et al., 1999; Wilson, 1997). With an intervention appropriately targeted, as unde problems begin to improve, so does ability to regulate behavior and emotions. Sevecognition-based treatments have been developed to prevent aggression and drug abuse, manage behavioral disorders resulting from head inju ry or learning disabi lity, and improve self- control (Fishbein, 2000b). For example, individuals who exhibit disruptive behaviors due to head injury do well in cognitive neurorehabilitation programs that focus on problems with impulsivity (Stuss et al., 1999). Development of a test battery to characterize underlying deficitsin subtypes within the inmate population will substantially advance our ability to determine anappropriate treatment. The task at hand, then, would be to either develop new interventio redirect existing interventions for the inmate population based on these characterizations. Treatments with proven effectiveness in noncorre ctional settings may become a viable option for correctional administrators who are desperately seeking solutions to the management of these inmates. For example, correctional programs in Canada that characterize aggressiveoffenders for targeted treatment purposes demonstrate the potential for more effective treatme approaches than those commonly used in corrections (Fabiano et al., 1990a, 1990b, 1991). Although no study has assessed ECF in the context of a correctional intervention, several studies show that neuropsychological function plays a role in treatment outcomes for nt outcomes in offenders in the community (e.g., less recidivism, reduced sexual offending) and in substance abusers (e.g., lower relapse rates, more attendance in aftercare) (Bauer, 1997; Blume 1999; Winterer et al., 1998Measures of PFC activity are reported to predict relapse to substance abuse far better thaclinical or behavioral measures (Bauer, 2001). Cognitive correlates of ECF appear to have a direct impact on treatment outcomes. For exam ple, children with concentration problems did not respond as favorably to a school-based intervention for delinquency as those without sucproblems (Rebok et al., 1996). Early signs of aggressive behavior played a role in moderatingintervention outcomes, including drug use (Kellam & Anthony, 1998; Rebok et al., 1996). Earladolescent drug use is believed to trigger developmental delays in ECF, exacerbating resistance to interventions (Scheier & Botvin, 1995). Delineating the ECF and emotional substrates of aggression may provide valua insights for developing therapeutic interventions for inm isite for a favorable response to any treatment program that involves cognitive processing of curriculum materials, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. Participants wi these skill deficiencies are not as likely to benefit from programs that do not first target these deficits. Reliable tools can be applied toward the identification and treatment of the dis characteristics of these recalcitrant inmates to reduce their misconduct in prison and lower threcidivism. This knowledge should eventually inform the field as to characteristics of inmates least affected by various interventions and identify components of an effective intervention strategy (e.g., intensive cognitive rehabilitation). This research project applied four critical findings demonstrated in clinical settings to study of correctional treatment responses: (1) the well established relatio the feasibility and efficacy of using a noninvasive test battery to identify high-risk inmates; (3) the utility of these tests to predict institutional misconduct; and (4) the role of ECF and emotion deficits in poor responses to treatment. An assessment was conducted of inmates volunteering for standard CBT treatment using a battery of ECF, emotional perception and reactivity tasks.

Previous studies that examined general neuropsychological ability did not produce measures with the high level of specificity and sensitivity as do recently developed novel ECF tasks (Rogers et al., 2001). Also, no study has predicted institutional misconduct using these measures in an incarcerated population in the context of an intervention until now. Integrity of ECF and emotional perception and regulation were measured using noninvasive, specially designed tasks to establish the role of ECF in poor responses to treatment of aggression among inmates and to demonstrate the utility of these measures in correctional populations. This study examined the premise that performance deficits in ECF tasks and emotional responses will characterize disruptive inmates and predict treatment response. All inmates were examined using noninvasive behavioral, psychological, ECF, emotional perception, and stress tests. The analyses made adjustments for age. Several other background measures were also included, such as general neuropsychological function, prior drug use, and total amount of time previously incarcerated (which af fect ECF), but they did not play a significant role and, thus, adjustments for their influence was not necessary. Inmate Participants: Selection and Recruitment The Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services supports the confinement of about 25,000 men with approx imately 10,000 new intakes each year. Approximately 224 male inmates were recruited during intake into the cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program in Roxbury (RCI) and Western Correctional Institutions (WCI) and the Maryland Correctional Training Center (MCTC). Selection of these facilities was based on programmatic rigor as well as similarities between prisons to ensure continuity and uniformity of treatment, duration, type and modality of the program, treatment provider staff, and other environmental factors. Participants were between 21 and 49 years old with a minimum of 1.5 years left on their sentence to ensure an adequate length of stay to evaluate treatment outcomes, and avoid the stress of pre-release preparations and potential for transfers. Inmates who volunteered provided their consent to complete the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery as an estimate of IQ which is considered to be culture neutral; those with an IQ below 80 were excluded. Older subjects were also excluded due to cognitive decline that occurs naturally over time and the effects of chronic drug abuse on ECF. Those with mental retardation, dementia, amnesia, or delirium and those who are illiterate were excluded because these conditions interfere with performance and because of inability to understand the implications of consent. Although attention defic it disorder is prevalent in this population and may interfere with task performance, it was not exclusionary. The sample was ethnically diverse and representative of the offender population in the state; however, race was not expected to affect results of this study. In Table 2, a description of the population, including inmates from all three prison facilities, is provided as the results of this project may apply specifically to this sample; a replication is needed in other types of prisons and different types of inmates to determine whether these results apply more globally. In addition to the data provided below, 16.3% (n=41) were Caucasian, 68.1% (n=171) were African American, and 5.2% (n=13) fell into other ethnic/racial categories. A total of 28.3% (71) reported severe head injury and the following This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Importantly, there were no IQ differences (verbal, spatial or full) for any of the treatment variables; thus, adjustments were not made for IQ in the analyses. Table 2.

In addition, interactive virtual reality vignettes were used to assess actual pre- and post-treatment change in decision making. The first half of the test session lasted about 2 hours and the second half was about 1.5 hours and occurred in the afternoon when salivary cortisol is more stable. The Director of Health Services in the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services provided approval to survey their Management Information System (OBSCIS) to determ ine inmates' history of violent crimes and institutional infractions (e.g., dates of prior arrests and convictions, offense types, conviction status, sentence, and present incarceration length). Cutoff scores were derived from each survey instrument and official record to categorize inmates into clinically relevant subtypes (e.g., drug abuse, impulsivity, psychopathy, violent, etc.) and assess correlations between them. The variable set that best discriminated between inmates who performed well and poorly in treatment were then assembled into an assessment battery with high predictive value. This chapter describes the study and results and, in t he next chapter, a test battery is described that is recommended for evaluations of inmates to determine the most effective course of action. 2 It is important that generalized neuropsychological function be assessed to make adjustments for possible differences between groups and to specify the role of ECF independent of gross neuropsychological dysfunction.

All inmates were examined using nonin vasive behavioral, psychological, EC F, and hormone tests. Adjustments were made for age in all analyses. I n linear regr essions, general neuropsychological fu nction, prior dr ug use, total amount of time previous ly incarcerat ed (which affect ECF), and other b ackground f actors were also con sidered. Specific hypotheses included the following : H1. ECF pe rformance (neuropsychological ta sk performance), emotional perception (emotional task performance), and e motional regulation (corti sol respon se to a stimul ating task) will be interrelated. H2. These independent variables will predict trea tment outcomes among inmates participating in a cognit ive-behavioral therapy program. Ou tcome measures include d treatment readiness, responsivity, and gain, change in executive decision making and aggression, rates o f institutio nal misconduct, noncompletion, and oth er specific p erformance indicators of treatment response. H3. These independent variables will be asso ciated with psychopathy, a history of aggressive crimes against persons and an aggressive personality style. H3a. ECF, emotional perception, a nd em otional regulation will discr iminate between subtypes of inmates (drug abusers vs nonusers, psychopathic vs nonpsychopathic).

Behavioral, Neuropsychological, and Psychological Test Battery Questionnaires were administered after the EC F and emotional tasks to avoid the effects of fatigue on cognitive functioning. These tests characterized inmates to (a) adjust for their independent and interactive effects on aggression and other forms of misconduct, (b) correlate them with performance on cognitive tasks to dete rmine whether they are related to misconduct, and (c) relate them to treatment performance. Given evidence that these characteristics can complicate treatment efforts (e.g., psychopathy), interactive effects were analyzed. Each of these instruments appears in the appendix. General Neuropsychological Function. The Multidimensional Aptitude Battery (MAB) was administered to identify general intellectual deficits that may have resulted from head injury or other causes and to isolate the contribution of ECF to aggression, given that higher cognitive abilities rely on the integrity of general intelligence. When these more basic functions are impaired, ECF can be expected to suffer as well. This helps us to determine what level of treatment may be necessary. The MAB was developed by Jackson (1984) to be an altern ative to the WAIS-R to measure general intelligence in a group setting for participants aged 16 and above (Carless, 2000). Due to time constraints of testing in a prison setting, the short form version of the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery was chosen for this study. The short form version by Hill and Jackson (1984) consists of the comprehension, similarities, digit symbol and spatial subscales and very aptly predicts full scale IQ (Hill & Jackson, 1984). Questionnaires A revised version of the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) (McLellan et al., 1992) was used to assess nature and extent of prior drug use, background factors such as socioeconomic status (Hollingshead rating), religious preference, race/ethnicity, family history of drug use, alcoholism, and mental illness, head injuries, child abuse, medical and psychological status, and other demographic factors. The Psychopathy Checklist-Screening Version (PCL-SV) (Hare, 1991; Hart et al., 1995) is a self-report version of the PCL-R showing high correlation with the original test (Hart et al., 1995). This test was used to characterize inmates on the basis of psychopathic personality traits so that those with high scores could be separated from the rest of the population to determine whether their treatment outcomes were related to different factors. In analyses, the effects of psychopathy and its relationship with neuropsychological status on treatment outcome was examined. The Reactive-Proactive Questionnaire (RPQ) (Raine et al., in press) enabled us to assess neuropsychological differences between predatory (proactive) and impulsive (reactive) aggressive inmates and determine the extent to which these distinctions interact with ECF to contribute to treatment outcomes. Given evidence that the brain function and behavior differ between those who are impulsive differ from those who are deliberate, we anticipated that these subtypes would also differ in factors that contribute to their treatment outcomes. A Success Inventory was developed for two purposes. First, this instrument allows us to determine whether their treatment progress is related to the inmates' feelings of failure due to parental admonishments or insults, or earlier experiences in school that may contribute to This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.frustration with classroom-like settings. Second, this instrument asks inmates about their reasons for volunteering for treatment, how they feel about being in treatment, and whether or not they have tried treatment in the past. In some cases, inmates have reasons other than seeking treatment for volunteering or they hav e had negative experiences in the past. Thus, a full evaluation of factors that underlie treatment response includes this type of assessment. The Early Trauma Questionnaire (Bremner et al., 2000) assesses traumatic events, including accidents and serious family illnesses, parental loss, murder of family member or friend, and violent crime victimization. Inmates rate the frequency with which events occurred to them before the age of 18 on a scale from 0 (never happened) to 2 (happened 2 to 10 times). This instrument was included to assess lifetime adv ersity which is known to impair development of the prefrontal cortex and, in turn, neuropsychological function. Because the offender population is characterized by an unusually high rate of adversity such as child maltreatment and other severe stressors, the intent was to determine the role of adversity in their cognitive and emotional functioning as it relates to treatment outcomes. ECF Tasks Cognitive tasks are computerized and non-intrusive - they do not produce physical or emotional discomfort and most participants enjoy completing them. Inmates were tested at a time that did not interfere with meals, lock-downs, or counts. Each task takes 10-20 minutes and is described in full in the appendices. The Cambridge Decision Making Task (CDMT: Rogers et al., 1999a, 1999b) was developed to dissect the cognitive components involved in decision making and measures willingness to take risks and sensitivity to consequences. It has been found to have sensitivity and specificity in high-risk populations (Fishbein et al., 2001) and reliably activates a portion of the PFC involved in social skills, impulse control, and sensitivity to rewards. The subject is told that the computer has randomly hidden a ring inside one of 6 red or blue boxes arrayed at the top of the screen and to decide which box contains the ring. This decision involves gambling a certain number of points associated with each choice (odds are 10 vs 90, 20 vs 80, 30 vs 70, 40 vs 60, and 50 vs 50). If the subject chooses the correct color, the points associated with that choice are added to the total points score; if the subject chooses the wrong color, the same points are subtracted. The ratio of colored boxes (5:1, 4:2, and 3:3) and the balance between the associated rewards vary independently between trials according to a fixed pseudorandom sequence. This sequence ensures that each balance of reward and each ratio of colored boxes co-occur equally, with the restriction that on all trials with an unequal ratio of red and blue boxes, the larger reward is associated with the least likely outcome, thus capturing the conflict inherent in risk-taking situations. Subjects with ECF impairment take more risks in pursuit of a large reward and tolerate a higher probability of a large loss; this tendency often describes inmates who engage in impulsive offenses. Performance scores generated by this task include percentage of choice of the most likely outcome and mean deliberation times as a function of the balance of rewards. The Logan Stop-Signal Task measures impulsivity and distractibility (Solanto et al., 2001). The task begins with the computer displaying an asterisk or a circle, alternatively. When the asterisk is displayed, subjects are instructed to quickly press the left mouse button. When the circle is displayed, they are instructed to quickly press the right mouse button. Incorrect responses elicit a beep and the subject must correct the response. This slows their reaction time recording. If they respond slowly, the screen reads \"too slow\". If they respond before the stimulus is presented, the screen reads \"too fast\". Next, they are to press the corresponding mouse buttons for the asterisk and the circle, but if a tone sounds after the stimulus is This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.presented, they must alter their response and quickly press the middle mouse button. If they press the right or left button before the tone is presented, they receive a notice that they responded incorrectly and the task continues. The rapidity with which the tone is presented changes throughout the task and is also affected by how fast their initial reaction time was, as recorded in the first portion. This task requires deep concentration, impulse control, and timing ability. This task takes approximately 15 minutes. The Stroop Interference Task uses previously learned information to assess the 3 attributes of executive frontal lobe function: complexity, a \"nonroutine\" nature, and the novel use of old information. Patients with frontal l obe damage are typically influenced by stereotypical thinking, which would interfere with the ability to produce the atypical responses required on the Stroop (Luria, 1980; Mesulam, 1986), and often experience difficulty with mental flexibility (Stuss & Benson, 1986). Studies suggest that the anterior cingulate (believed to be involved in aggression) is involved in performance on the Stroop (Pardo et al., 1990; Bench et al., 1993). The Stroop includes presentation of 3 individual forms (Reeves et al., 1991). The first displays the words \"red,\" \"green,\" and \"blue\" as black letters on a white background. The subject reads the words as quickly and accurately as possible. The second form presents 4 X's in 3 randomly repeating colors, and the subject must quickly say the color aloud that corresponds to the color of the X's. The third form displays the words \"red,\" \"green,\" and \"blue\" in colors that do not match the meaning of the word. This is the interference task and requires the subject to say the color of the letters as opposed to the color indicated by the word. The measures for this task are the Word Score, Color Score, Predicted Color-Word Score, and Interference Score. Each score reflects the total number of responses completed in 45 seconds for each form. This task is well documented as a reliable test of prefrontal function, with high discriminant ability (Audenaert et al., 2001; Baxter & Liddle, 1998; Nathan et al., 2001). Emotional Perception Task Research suggests that emotion-processing deficits lead to a distorted perception of social cues that has been associated with aggressive behavior (Crick & Dodge, 1996; Dodge, 1980). PFC impairment reduces inhibition of emotional behaviors that may be generated from these distorted perceptions. Thus, measurement of emotion perception is critical. An Emotional Expression Task using a facial expression technique was used due to its high level of validity and reliability and its consistent activation of the amygdala, a limbic structure involved in emotion and aggression (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2001; Stevens et al., 2001). Inmates viewed faces in various emotional configurations and indicated what emotion they believed was being expressed. Computer-generated images of faces were created based on universal features of facial affect (Ekman & Friesen, 1975; see Morris et al., 1998, p. 49) and depicted happy, fearful, threat, sad, surprise, disgust/contempt, and angr y expressions. For each emotional category and each face, a range of 6 intensity levels was produced by computer graphical manipulation, which is more realistic and engaging than photos or still copies. The 25%, 50%, and 75% faces were interpolations created using computer morphing procedures (Perrett et al., 1994) to shift the shape of the 0% (neutral) face toward the emotion expression prototype (100%). Explicit recognition, categorization, and intensity discrimination (on a 7-point scale) of the emotional expression was required. In a separate test, images were paired and subjects were asked to select the more intense expression. Expressions that were named quickly, with few words, and with high accuracy were designated as high per ceptual ability, while those that involved lengthier reaction times using more words, lesser intersubject agreement, and low accuracy were rated as low perceptual ability. Scores were related to performance on ECF tasks to assess their relationship and relative contributions to treatment outcomes.

Inmates were instructed to make a 10-minute persuasive speech providing justificat ion to an ostensible parole board for an early release. They were told that the research assistant would judge the speech according to how compelling and effective it was, and in terms of its formal aspects and content. Cortisol levels were measured noninvasively in saliva-the most va lid assessment of cortisol responsivity (Yao et al., 1998). Salivary cortisol is not affected by rate of saliva production or cigarette smoking. Saliva (2ml) was collected before, during, and after the speech by placing a cotton swab inside the cheek for 3 minutes. Cortisol tends to rise about 20 minutes after a stressor and then falls precipitously, thus we were able to evaluate the curve to determine whether inmates who performed better in treatment showed a more effective rise and fall in cortisol than inmates who did poorly. The task was conducted in the afternoon for all inmates when cortisol is at a stable level. This test assessed the inmate's stress response to emotional stimuli, which is essential when measuring ability to process and regulate emotions. In order to evaluate the inmates' present emotional state, which may have an effect on their stress response, the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) was administered immediately before this task (Derogatis et al., 1973). This instrument evaluates a broad range of psychological problems and current symptoms of psychopathology using nine symptom scales plus a global index of severity. In the present study we used 6 of those scales which were most relevant. The instrument is useful in measuring patient pr ogress or treatment outcomes, including evaluation of patients at intake as a method for symptom screening; measuring patient progress during and after treatment to monitor change; outcome measurement for treatment programs through aggregated patient information; and clinical trials to help measure the changes in symptoms such as depression and anxiety.

CBT was the focus of this research to identify underlying differences between responders and nonresponders to this popular correctional program. Findings from this research suggest that some inmates with deficits in functions being measured were less likely to progress in treatment and more likely to drop out early and commit infractions during treatment. It is possible that these inmates will be more effectively impacted by targeted, neurocognitive-based treatment regimens suitable for administration within an institution to reduce violence among prison inmates. CBT is designed to help inmates develop impulse control, manage anger, and learn new behavioral responses to real-life situations. The underlying assumption is that learning processes play an important role in the development and continuation of antisocial behavior and can be used to help individuals enhance their ability to exert self-control. CBT is designed to help patients recognize situations in which they are likely to become agitated or aggressive, avoid these situations when appropriate, and cope more effectively with a range of problems and behaviors associated with aggression. CBT is a short-term, relatively brief approach well suited to the resource capabilities of most prisons. CBT has been extensively evaluated in clinical trials and has empirical support as treatment for violence and related behavior. In the three facilities where this study was conducted, the Maryland correctional system offers a series of 3 groups that meet for 90 minutes twice a week, totaling 50 sessions. The first group is called entry point and involves curricula on \"Thinking, Deciding, Changing.\" Entry point blends a decision making and cognitive restructuring modality (a self-reflective process to search for triggers of misconduct) into a cognitive-behavioral modality (an external, skill-building process) for self change. It is asserted that \"high risk\" inmates with multiple incarcerations, a history of violence, poor institutional adjustment and/or very impulsive behavior are most likely to benefit from this curriculum due to its focus on skills that tend to be particularly in deficit in this subgroup. The second group is called \"Communication\" and is designed to orient members to the importance of effective communication in one's everyday life and encourage the experience of group cohesion and ownership by enabling members to create their own goals and rules through the use of dyad interviews. The third group is called \"Relationships\" and is designed for clients who have successfully completed the first two groups. The focus is on the examination of the way elements in the envir onment are dealt with or related to, including persons, places and things. These latter two groups are based on cognitive-behavioral principles. Inmates are referred into the voluntary program by correctional case managers, mental health professionals, or themselves. To avoid the transfer of inmates participating in this study to different facilities during programming, they consented to be held in the same facility to ensure treatment continuity. The sole requirements for retention in the programs are that inmates do nothing to undermine the group process and remain infraction free. Those who commit infractions while in the program are considered unfavorable responders. Inmates who complete the program received a certificate but no other compensation or reward. The intake interview focused on the inmate's goals for program participation. Processing of curriculum materials from CBT relies on the ability of participants to (a) be cognizant of and responsive to potential negative consequences of their behavior, (b) inhibit inappropriate behavioral responses, and (c) understand and act on the benefits of deliberate and cautious decision making. Participants with deficiencies in neuropsychological and emotional regulatory skills are not as likely to benefit from programs that do not first target these deficits. Although correctional treatment programs are considered effective for particular This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

It was further expected that \"nonresponders\" would constitute that subgroup of inmates who repeatedly engaged in misconduct (as measured in institutional infractions), posing the greatest danger within and outside the prison environment. These findings (see next chapter) suggest that a targeted cognitive rehabilitation strategy, not the standard approaches used routinel y in prisons, would potentially remediate these malleable functions, thereby reducing institutional misconduct. Follow Up Testing to Evaluate Treatment Outcomes Immediately after inmates completed the CBT program, treatment performance was evaluated by staff and the inmate. Institutional records were reviewed to assess level of responsiveness to the program, as measured by performance indicators, program completion, and the commission of institutional infractions. Change in risky behaviors was assessed by administering the CDMT, Reaction to Provocation scale, and the interactive virtual reality vignettes (see below) both during baseline and following treatment. Adjustments in the analyses were made for age but other background variables were not influential. Treatment Performance Indicators There is much concern regarding the use of self-report to assess correctional treatment efficacy, particularly among violent offenders (Novaco, 1994; Bellemare & McKay, 1992; Hughes, 1993). Thus, this study used primarily behavioral performance measures, taken at baseline and post-intervention, which do not rely so lely on self-reports. Evaluations from Social Workers were also collected. Thus, measures of differential treatment efficacy used in this study demonstrate the extent to which participants were able to transfer knowledge gained in the program to change in behavior. Treatment performance was evaluated by the Social Workers using the Treatment Responsivity and Treatment Gain scales develo ped by Ralph Serin (Director of Programs Research, Correctional Service of Canada). (This instrument is being adopted by the Wisconsin DOC for evaluation of their cognitive program.) These scales were designed to assess CBT performance (Kennedy & Serin, 1997, 1999; Serin, 1998; Serin, in press) by a variety of staff and across a range of programs. To ensure reliability, scoring is straightforward. Each domain is represented by a description, questions to be incorporated into therapists' semistructured interview formats, and a 4-point rating scale with behavioral examples for each level (see Appendix I). This evaluation was conducted after each of the 3 CBT groups. The Novaco Reaction to Provocation (RP) inventory was given at baseline and again after each of the three treatment groups. There are two parts, the first assessing cognitive, arousal and behavioral domains and the second assessing impulsive reaction, verbal aggression, physical confrontation and indirect expression. This instrument is sensitive to behavioral change particularly in response to an intervention. The CDMT was readministered after completion of the treatment program to determine whether executive cognitive decision making behaviors changed and in which subgroups. Decision-making vignettes, using RTI-developed virtual reality assessment architecture, was employed to measure pre- and post-intervention decision-making and problem-solving ability. Vignettes consist of short, focused interactions to examine dialog, behaviors, and decisions made in a real-world context. Each vignette invokes a specific This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.cognitive function consistent with relevant EC F dimensions measured in the task battery: risky decision making, impulsivity, and sensitivity to penalties. They require processing of information, judgment, and selection of appropriate and effective decisions. One vignette allows for choices that involve risks where a harmful consequence is possible and includes 2 virtual characters: a correctional officer and a peer simulate the common situation whereby peers are influential in reactions to officers. A second vignette allows for choices after a penalty has been dispensed to determine whether inmates learned to shift strategies. A third vignette measures whether inmates choose a decision before adequate information has been provided, to reflect impulsive decision making. Such instructional designs differentiate between \"knowledge\" and \"skills\" that may be acquired during exposure to the experimental stimulus (Hubal & Helms, 1998); that is, the vignettes will assess inmates' situation-specific behavior rather than merely test their understanding of risk, impulsiveness, or sensitivity to penalties. Analysis of decisions made in each vignette take into consideration actual behavior of the inmate, comments by the inmate, how the inmate responded to the virtual character, whether or not the inmate tailored responses to the situation, outcome of the situation, and degree of assistance needed to complete the scenario. Stimuli were presented in a highly uniform fashion and tracked a variety of response characteristics, such as appropriateness of the response, latency time from exposure to response, and pathways taken. Decision-making responses in these scenarios were related to baseline ECF and emotional measures and used to gauge changes in risky and impulsive decision making induced by the CBT program. Inmates who did not respond favorably to the treatment program are expected to show lower baseline levels of ECF and emotional perception and regulation and not demonstrate change in decision-making responses. See results section for findings. Measures of institutional misconduct were gleaned from inmate files. Although many types of misconduct were considered (e.g., infractions repeatedly committed, noncompliance, defiance of authority), the following offenses will be classified as \"serious\" to assess degree of aggressive and antisocial behavior: homicide, attempted homicide, aggravated assault, possession of a dangerous weapon, fighting, threatening bodily harm, simple assault, setting a fire, taking hostages, drug use or possession, or 3 or more segregation episodes due to aggressive behavior. Inmates generally receive segregation time for these offenses and thus were placed in the \"noncompletion\" category. Noncompletion of the program due to disinterest, commission of an infraction, disruption to the group, or a related reason will be considered a treatment failure. Noncompletion due to obtaining a job, mandatory transfer, or other reason unrelated to noncompliance will be excluded in analyses. Table 2.

For most variables, the relevant measure is one of number correct or incorrect in performing the task. Reaction time (RT) is also measured and it should be noted that RT during test administration can be interpreted differently for various tasks and with respect to specific responses. For example, a shorter reaction time with a greater number of risky decisions selected may indicate impulsivity or insensitivity to consequences. While a longer reaction time on the Stroop task or the FEEST may indicate cognitive inefficiency. Each one is discussed and interpreted below. Hypothesis 1: Neuropsychological and Emotional Functions will Co-Occur As a test of the first hypothesis, to determine whether neuropsychological deficits tended to co-occur in inmates or whether they were distinctive and relatively unrelated, central variables from each neuropsychological task were included in a correlation matrix. Not all of these variables were significantly related to one another, suggesting that a smaller level of co-occurrence existed between these deficits in this population than expected. In short, impulsivity (SCT) was related to cognitive interference and shorter reaction time (Stroop) and the inability to accurately assess emotion in facial expressions (FEEST). Risky decision making (CDMT) was also related to an inability to assess emotion in facial expressions and lengthier reaction times while making risky decisions was related to a higher average baseline cortisol level and greater cognitive interference (Stroop). Interestingly, impulsivity and risky decision making were not significantly correlated, suggesting they are separable constructs. Also noteworthy, cortisol levels were not related to most tasks with the exception that higher baseline cortisol is related to lengthier reaction times during decision making which may be an indication that higher levels of anxiety may lead to the need for greater deliberation while making decisions. Hypothesis 2a: Neuropsychological and Emotional Function will Predict Treatment Outcomes. The first portion of the second hypothesis involved analyses to determine whether neuropsychological functioning predicted various treatment outcomes. Other background measures were also assessed to determine whether neuropsychological functions or background measures had the most explanatory power. Treatment Readiness The Treatment Readiness scale is self administered; thus, inmates complete this test by indicating how treatment ready they view t hemselves. Those who misperceived disgust, anger and then all facial expressions combined showed lower treatment readiness. Also, indicators of risky decision making were related to treatment readiness; i.e., choosing options associated with higher potential rewards but greater chance of losing a larger amount of points was associated with lower readiness scores. It is noteworthy that no background measures (e.g., months in prison, education, drug use history, IQ, etc.) significantly discriminated between groups. Also, change in cortisol response from baseline to the stress task was significantly predictive of treatment readiness, controlling fo r both age and body mass index (BMI; important to analyses of cortisol data). The figure below shows that those with higher self-reported levels This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.of treatment readiness h ad a greater cortisol re sponse to an acute stressor than those with low treatment readiness, wh o showed a relative decrease in cort isol from baseline. Base d on the discussion in chapter 1, we ma y interpret this to suggest that those with lower perceptions of treatment readiness ma y either have experienced more lifetime adversity, leading to a lower stress respo nse, or that t hey ma y be constitut ionally less responsive to stressful situations. Change in Salivary Cortisol Respons e During Stress Task -0.25-0.2-0.15-0.1-0.0500.050.10.150.20.25 Not Tx Ready Tx Ready Treatment Readiness Baseline Stress Task Treat ment Gain For the treatment gain scale, which r eflects evalu ations by so cial workers, the results indicate that several neuropsychological con structs predict tre atment outcome. Higher levels of both impulsivity and risk decision ma king predict ed low treatment gain. For both measures, the high treatment gain grou p performed better and with longer reaction time s, suggest ing greater deliberation times. For the facial ex pression ta sk, however, the high gain group misperceived the emotional expressio n of surprise more often than the low group, which was unexpected. On the Stroop, the measure of cognitive flexibility and error monitoring, the in terference score did not discriminate between groups but reaction tim es were sig nificantly lon ger for the low gain group sugge sting greater cognitive in efficiency. No differences were found in cortiso l response s to the stress task. With respect to treatment readiness, none of the background variables were predictive. But for treatment gain, the number of days in the last 30 tha t the inmate reported experiencing psychological problems was related to less ga in, and a histor y of physical abuse specifically predicted le ss gain. Treat ment Responsivity Treatment responsivity is also evalu ated by social workers f or each inmate who completed the groups. Those with lower scores on the treat ment responsivity scale differed significantly from the high group, having a great er history of physical abuse and number of days in the last 3 0 that they experienced psychological problems. No other group differen ces were found in background measures or co rtisol respon ses. With re spect to neu ropsychological function, the poor treatment responsivity group p erformed significantly worse on the impulsivity and risky de cision makin g tasks and had shorter reaction times during bo th tasks, indicative of impulsivity or insensit ivity to penalty or risk. Con versely, the low group had longer re action times during two sets of the Stroop task, again suggesting cognitive inef ficiency. Treat ment Co mpletion This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. For inmates who completed at least t he initial treatment group, and excluding those who began treatment but dropped out fo r legitimate reasons (e.g. , transfer, work, etc.), a lesser history of physical abuse and psychological prob lems was found. No other backgrou nd measures significantly di scriminated between groups. On neuropsychological measu res, completers showed sign ificantly less impulsivity and longer r eaction time s in respon se to risky trials on the CDMT. On the other ha nd, in respo nse to all thr ee trials on t he Stroop, noncompleters had sign ificantly long er reaction ti mes, again indicating cognitive inefficiency. Treatment completers also showed a somewhat (marginally significant) different patt ern of cortisol re sponses to t he stress ta sk. Controlling for both age and bod y mass index, z-scores of cortisol le vels were subjected to a n ANCOVA repeated measures ana lysis. Inmates who did not drop out of treatment showed a moderate relative increa se in cortisol levels from baseline to the acutely stressful situ ation. Inmates who dropped treatment for \"negative\" reasons showed the opposite pattern, with cortisol dropping precipitously fro m baseline. Change in Cortisol Response to Stress Task -0.0500.050.10.150.20.25 Drop O uts Tx Completion Treatment CompletionCortisol Z-Scores Baseline Stress Task Institutiona l Infractions Institutiona l infractions constituted a nother type of outcome measure, reflective of misconduct within the in stitution dur ing treatment. The number of infract ions prior to treatment was subtracted from the number of infractions committed du ring treatment to produce a score indicating the extent to which behavior changed in response to treatment. Inmates showing a reduction in infractions were less likely to have a history of emotional or sexual abuse. They also have spent fewer months in prison through out their live s and report ed fewer psychological problems in the last 30 d ays. There was also a t endency for a greater reduction in infractions to be related fe wer high risk choice s and a greater number of correct respo nses on the facial expression t ask. And fin ally, change in infrac tion numbers was related to greater cha nge in cortisol re sponse to an a cute stresso r. Thus, overall, those inmates who showed improvement in behavior in response t o treatment performed better in the n europsychological ta sks, had a more robust stress re sponse, and h ad less adv ersity in bot h the recent and distant past. Segregations Segregations resulting from institutio nal infractio ns const ituted another t ype of outcome measure, reflective of in stitutiona l behavior. The number of segregation s prior to tre atment was This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.subtracted fr om the number of segre gations com mitted during treatment to produce a score indicating the extent to which behavior changed in response to treatment. Similar to the more overarching measure of infractions, I nmates with a reduction in segregations were le ss likely to have a history of emotio nal or sexual abuse. They also have spent fewer months in prison throughout t heir lives an d report fewer psycholo gical proble ms in the la st 30 days. There was a tendency for a greater reduction in segregations to be related fewer high risk cho ices on the CDMT and a greater number of correct responses on the happiness expression on t he FEEST. And finally, change in segregation n umbers was related to g reater chan ge in cortiso l response to an acute stressor. Virtual Reality: Risk Ta king Behavior The virtual reality data did not show adequate variation for an alyses as an outcome measure. This appeare d to be due t o the lack of familiarity with and comfort of inmates in usin g interactive computer techniques, as well as the p ossibility that there may have been fear that their record ed response s to risk taking scenario s may become accessib le to prison staff. Thus, this particular technique is not reco mmended fo r assessme nt of behavioral change in inmates. Hypothesis 2b: Change in neurops ychologic al function w ill predict response to treatment. In order to t est this hyp othesis, the exec utive Risky Decisio n Making Task (CDM T) was administered twice; once at baselin e and once again following treatment. Inmates who dropped out of treat ment early received the CDMT on th e same timeline as tho se who completed. Thus, inmates were asked to complete the CDMT after the treatment period, de spite variable participation times to determine whet her change in executive decision ma king was incurred in response to treatment. Differences in the magnitude of chan ge were exp ected between those who responded well to t reatment ve rsus those who did poorly or dropped out. Outcome measures for these analyses include d treatment responsivity, gain, completion, infract ions and segregation s. It is notewor thy that a large proportio n of inmates who did not complete treatment for negative reasons did not complete the second C DMT; thus, those with lo w treatment responsivity scores were so much le ss likely to h ave received the post-CDMT that several of the analyses co uld not be conducted. T his both validates our measure of tr eatment responsivity and complicates our test of th is hypothesis. Using a mean split was not possible, so in stead correlational analyses were conduct ed. Results are reported below for those analyse s with much smaller sample sizes than the analyses re ported above and includ es those wh o completed at least the f irst treatment group (df=72). Change in the extent to which inmates selected the riskie st choice was significantly related to tr eatment readiness and change in risky choices overall was marginally related to readiness. I n both case s, treatment readiness w as related to the select ion of a great er percentage of risky choices from before to afte r treatment. Treatment gain was significantly related to ch ange in reaction time when select ing risky choice s with short er RTs in th e second administration than the f irst. Gain was also margi nally relat ed to chang e in risky ch oices overall, suggesting t hat fewer risky choices were related to greater gain. Treatment responsivity was significantly related to ch ange in reaction time and marginally to change in risky choices overall, showing the same direct ionality as with the Gain scale. The se results are interesting in the context of the outcome measures: treatment readi ness is self evaluated prior to treat ment while responsivity and gain are evaluated by social workers during and after treatment. Thus, those This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.with percept ions of high readiness a ctually exhibited more risky decision making in response to treatment while those w ho responde d more favo rably to treatment according to social workers showed sign ificantly gre ater improve ment in decision making . neither institu tional infra ctions nor seg regations w ere related t o change in the CDMT measures. Also, the virtual reality scena rios were also presente d at baselin e and post- treatment, however there was not sufficient vari ability to det ermine whether change i n this measure occurred. The Reactio n to Provocation (RP) inventory was also administered at ba seline and a fter each treatment group to assess cha nge in aggre ssive behaviors and attit udes. Treat ment responsivity scores were not related t o RP scores at baseline or after the f irst treatment group. RP scores b ecame significantly relat ed to treatment responsivity, howe ver, after the second and third groups suggesting t hat those who responde d well to tre atment showed a significant trend toward less aggressive behavior over time. Again, it is important to not e that as tre atment progressed, fewer inmat es were retained and a g reater number dropped out of the st udy; thus, the latter cor relations in clude fewer numbers and specifically t hose who performed better in treatment. There were no significan t relations b etween change in RP and treatment readiness or gain sca les. More releva nt to the pre sent study, RP scores were contrasted between high and low cognitive fu nctions inclu ding only one central measure from each task. A significa nt difference was found between high and low sco rers on the r isky decisio n making measure of sa fe choice s; those who selected few er safe choices showed a steeper de cline in ag gressive beha viors than those who selected grea ter safe choices. This may suggest that participa ting in treat ment ma y be more beneficial t o those with po or (i.e., risky ) decision m aking than t hose with b etter decisio n making abilit y. RP scores were then broken into su bscales, including the following \"provocation\" domains: co gnitive, arousal, behavio ral, and ang er relating to specific types of provocations. Two administrations aft er the first a nd second g roups were included in a repeated measures ANCOVA us ing a mean split for ea ch primary measure on th e neuropsychological t asks as well This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.as a mean split for the measure of str essful exper iences durin g treatment. Those of self reported str essful exper iences had higher baseline levels of arousal and then a larger declin e in arousal after the second treatment group and a greater reduction in angry reactions to specific provocations. Similarly, inmates who selected fewer \"safe\" choices on the risky decisio n making task showed a higher base line and gre ater decline in arousal af ter the first treatment group than tho se selecting fewer safe choices. Hypothesis 3. Neurops ychologic al functions will be as sociated with ps ychop athy, a history of aggressive crimes against persons and an aggressive personality style. Inmates sco ring high on the psychopathy m easure performed significantly worse on several background and neuropsychological me asures than inmates with lower score s. High scorers sho wed greater impulsivity (SCT). They also had a greater number of extra presses on the CDMT a nd a shorter reaction tim e; these part icular score s on this ta sk are not dir ect measures of risky decision making but may also more appropriately reflect impulsivit y. High scorers also were less a ccurate in th eir appraisals of the expression disgu st and overall on the FEEST they responded with significantly fewer co rrect perceptions. And finally, there was a marginal finding for a lo nger reactio n time on the Stroop during the inco ngruent trial; given that groups did n ot differ in te rms of numb er correct, t his slowness may suggest greater cognitive inefficien cy. No backgro und measures distin guished between high and low scorers, however, high scorers had substa ntially highe r scores on both proactive and reactive aggression, as well as number of segregatio ns and infra ctions within the institut ion, as expected. There was also a tenden cy for psychopaths to sh ow a decrease in cortisol response to a stressor whil e the nonpsychopaths showed an increase, cont rolling for ag e and BMI, similar to findings for t reatment readiness. A few of the neuropsychological me asures were significantly related to self-reported history of eit her proactive or reactive aggression. The greater the reactive aggressio n reported, the fewer the safe choices made during the risky decision making task. Also, the ability to discern the f acial expression of disg ust was rela tively impaired in those with higher level of reactive aggression. Th e proactive aggression measure wa s also rela ted to misperceptions of disgust. Hig her levels of proactive aggression w ere associat ed with two measures on the impulsivity task, but in the opposite direction of what was expected. The re were no significant relationship s with the Stroop. With respect to a history of aggressiv e crimes, th ere was an insufficie nt number of inmates who committed only property crimes in these three p risons to per mit an analysis of ways in which crime types may be related to ne uropsychological fun ction. The overwhelming majority of those who did not commit a crime against person s were charged/convict ed of drug crimes, which is not an a dequate co mparison group. Thus, an analysis was undertaken to determine whether self r eported hist ory of \"viole nt behavior\" (none vs any) was related to neuropsychological fu nction. Those with such a history performed some what worse on the Stroop, showing greater cognitive int erference, f ewer safe choices on th e CDMT, an d greater impulsivity on the SCT. The implicat ions of this finding are th at inmates with a histor y of violent behavior ma y present with deficit s that need to b e addressed in order for treatment to be effective. And, in fact, t hose that re ported violent behavior tended to score lower on treatment gain and responsivity (p = .06 and .0 7 respective ly). H4. Inmates with ECF/emotional deficits who have either high ps ychopath y scores or a history of substance abuse will respond less favorabl y to treatment. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. Those with high score s on the LPS showed poorer responsivity to treat ment. This relationship remained significant aft er controllin g for central ECF measu res from each task, suggesting t hat psychopathy alone, with or with cognitive de ficits, interfe res with trea tment effects. Unexpectedly, high scor ers on psychopathy showed a tendency toward greater improve ment in decision making, irrespective of t reatment response, se lecting more safe choices after participatin g in treatment than befo re. Low psychopathy scorers did not significantly change in th eir decision making re sponses from baseline to post-treatment. Similar, although even more pronounced, results were found for anothe r CDMT measure - percentag e of select ions of the hig hest risk ch oice. Again, like the re sults for a history of violence, th ose with the highest lev els of psych opathy appeared to benefit most from treatment in terms of decision making even though they began treatment with much higher levels of risk taking. A ca veat, however, is below. Consistent with these findings, the r epeated Reaction to Pr ovocation in ventory also showed cha nge conting ent upon psychopathy score s. Specifically, although high psychopathy scorers had a greater tendency toward aggressive reactions to provocation at baseline, both high and lo w scorers re ported less r eaction to pr ovocation as treatment progressed. Importantly, however, higher psychopathy score rs showed gr eater improvement than lower scorers. Also, although psychopathy and baseline RP scores are strongly related, the degree of correlation suggests that these concepts are sep arable. The se results o nly apply to those inmates who remain in treatment and the study long enough to provide data. In order to f urther disse ct these une xpected findings, the eff ects of the interaction between ECF measures and psychopathy (using mean splits for both con structs) on tr eatment outcomes were examine d. The only significant finding was t he interactio n between perceptions of emotional expressions (FEEST) on number of infractions. Inmates with high psychopathy scores and lower accuracy in attribut ing emotions to facia l expressions had a greater number of infractions t han the othe r three groups (i.e., low psychopathy - low accuracy; low psychopathy - high accura cy; high psychopathy - high accura cy). Similar analyses were conducted for the effects of prior drug use on various measures of treatment outcome and to determine whether there was an in teractive effect of drug u se and ECF on treatment outcome. No significant relat ionships wer e revealed, suggesting t hat neurocognitive function has a greate r effect on tr eatment outcomes than does prior d rug use. This findin g was surprising, particula rly given the impact of drug use on th ese neuroco gnitive functions. Summary M odel In order to identify those factors tha t best predict treatment responsivity, a linear regression a nalysis was conducted including bot h backgroun d and ECF measures. The table below shows that age, p sychological problems and history of abuse are t he only background measures that significant ly predict tre atment response (all oth er backgrou nd variables were included but did not add anything to the model). Of all the ECF variables, the SCT measure of impulsivity most highly predicted ou tcome. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

It is possible that these in mates will be more effectively impacted by targeted, neuroco gnitive-based treatment regimens suit able for administration within an inst itution to redu ce violence among prison inmates. The followin g items summarize the results of th is study: z Neuropsychological de ficits, e specia lly invo lving impulsivity, significantly predicted treatment response, gain and retention. The type of impulsivity measure d in this study is relevant in it reflects an inability to sh ift response s based on new informa tion present ed. Treatment should focus on behavioral self-regulat ion, attentional focus, consequences of actions, pro blem solving through lan guage development, and self monitor ing, amongst other strate gies. Other measures were also sig nificantly related to treat ment response, including r isky decision making and the ability to accurately perceive emotional expressions in faces.

It is also relevant that an elevated cortisol respo nse to a stressor typified those who evaluated themselves as being highly treatment ready. This finding may reflect a hig h level of responsivity to social stimulation. The implications of this find ing for treatment will be explored in further r esearch; z IQ was not different bet ween treatment readiness, gain, resp onsivity or completion groups, sug gesting that higher order cognitive fu nctions p layed a direct r ole in treatment outcomes. If IQ was related to treat ment outcomes, then one might suggest that executive functions are in deficit due to impai rments in more basic co gnitive functions, as reflected in I Q. As IQ did not play a significant r ole, we can assume that higher orde r executive functions are t he primary p layers and not such sup portive functions; z There were no differences between treatment groups on measures of prior drug use. This result was surprising given the ample literature showin g that drug users have a significantly worse track record in tre atment and can be more recalcitrant . Additional analyses were run to determine whet her history of drug use played a more prominent role when viewed in the context of psychopathy or aggressio n, but it did not. Thus, in this particular po pulation, wh ere the majority of inmates have a history of drug use, it did n ot play an important role in treatment responses; z None of the background variables discriminated between treatment groups, including education, d uration of tot al prison tim e, family history of criminality, mental illness, and drug abuse, aggressive behavior, stressful event s that occurr ed during fir st treatment group, and attitudes ab out treatment. This fin ding was also unexpected, yet import ant in that it highlights the sig nificant role of neuropsychologica l functioning ov er and above other inmate characterist ics; z The extent to which psychologica l problems were experience in the past 30 days distinguishe d between low and high treatment responsivity groups.

It is crit ical that treat ment provid ers take into account psychological distress a s possib le concomitant factors that can disengag e inmates from treatment and cause th em to be less amenable to the program's deman ds. These findin gs suggest t hat certain individual ch aracteristics distinguish between offenders po sitively affected by correctional CBT-based interventions relat ive to those least affected and may be info rmative with respect to what treatment components are nee ded to design an ef fective inter vention strategy (e.g., intensive cogni tive targeted re potentiall y remediate these malle able functio ns, thereby improving o verall treatment outcomes and potent ially reducin g institut ional miscondu ct. In a variety of settings, evide nce is moun ting to implicate dysfunction of the thinking proce ss, emotional perceptions, and regulation of emotions in offend ers who do not respond to conventional treatments.

Because su ch deficits a re malleable, these inmates may respond favorably to targeted treatment approaches.

The overriding goal is to provide either treatment readiness p rograms for these inmates that target underlying deficits or to design or adapt ne w treatment s for this mo re challenging population o f offenders. Because the subgroup of offenders th at does not r espond to conventional treatments often posse ss underlyin g individual vulnerabilitie s and adverse socia l conditions t hat compound their pro blems and are particularly at risk for persistent serious criminality and substance abuse, this subgroup r equires more intensive and customized approaches. Accordingl y, offenders will be bette r equipped t o maintain control over their own behavior rather than requiring severe methods of external restraint that a re terminated upon release. Co nsistent f indings indica te that far fewer crimes are committed when individuals are actively in treatment (see Fishbein, 1991; Fishb ein and Pease, 1996). Similarly, in the present study, those inmates who remained in treatment longer showed fewer behavioral maladjustments. Accor dingly, development of a sensitive an d specific screening test to predict recidivism, institutiona l misconduct, and/or treatment outcomes would constitute an important advance for treatment planning.

Several studies have shown that neuropsychological fu nction plays a role in treat ment outcomes for related populatio ns. Higher levels of fun ctioning in the form of better executive cognitive abilitie s has been associ ated with better treatment outcomes in offenders (e.g., le ss recid ivism, reduced sexual offending) and in substance a busers (e.g., lower relapse rates, more attendance in aftercar e) (Bauer, 1997; Blume et al., & McCrad y, 1991; Wint erer et al., 1 998). For example, measures of prefrontal cognitive functions are re ported to predict relap se to substan ce abuse far better th an clinical or behavioral measures (Bauer, 2001). ECFs in particular app ear to act as mediators of treatment outcome. For exampl e, children wit h concentrat ion problems did not respond as f avorably to a school-ba sed intervention for delin quency as those withou t such problems (Rebok et al., 1996). Early signs of ag gressive be havior playe d a role in moderating intervention outcomes in cluding drug use (Kellam & Anthony, 1998; Rebok et al., 199 6). Early adolescent drug use is believed to trigger developmental delays in ECF, exacerbating resistance to interventions (Scheier & Botvin, 19 95). In the present stud y focusing specifica lly on inmates in a prison-b ased treatment program, poor neuropsychological function a lso predicted re sponses an d outcomes. And in addition, emotional regulatio n for the first time was evaluated in such a stud y and it was also found t o play a sig nificant role in treatment responses. From a practical persp ective, the kn owledge that an intervention can not only produce behavioral change but also measurable change in brain funct ion suggest s that these conditions can be alter ed and, thus, improved. Evidence fr om clinical studies of hea d injury, learning disability, and cognitive disorders su ggests that ECF and related behaviors are amenable to appropriate treatments (Hermann & Parente, 1996; Manchester et al., 1 997; Rothwell et al., 1999; Wilso n, 1997). Consistent with findings reg arding the r ole of cognit ive and emo tional functions in antisocia l behavior, interventions with a cognitiv e therapy component reportedly produce the most effective results (Bell et al., 19 98; Crits-Cristoph et al., 1999; Maude-Griffin et al., 1998; Lo chman, 1992). Similarly, programs that appear t o be most effective with behavioral disorders rel ated to ECF deficits are those that fo cus on improving or restoring cogniti ve ability. With a targe ted intervention, as unde rlying problems begin to improve, so does the ability to regulate beh avior and emotions. For example, individuals who exhibit disruptive behaviors due to head injur y do well in cognitive ne urorehabilita tion progra ms that focus on proble ms with impulsivity (Stuss et al., 1999). Seve ral effective cognition-ba sed treatments have been developed to prevent behavioral dysregulation, aggression a nd drug abuse, manage behavioral disorders re sulting from head injury or learni ng disability, and improve self-control (Fishbein, 2000b). Inte rventions for disruptive inmates that address impaired impulse control, th us, hold particular pr omise. This conclusion is not only based on stu dies of ind ividuals with h ead injury who develop impulsivity and other socially inapp ropriate beh aviors, but also based o n the present stud y that indica tes an inability to r egulate impulses is at the hear t of poor tre atment responses. Identifying the ECF and emotional underpinning s of treatment outcomes including institutio nal misconduct provide valuable insigh ts for developing therapeutic interventions for offenders who tend to b e refractory to conventional treatments. Intact EC F and its reg ulation of emotional tone may, in f act, be a pre requisite for a favorable response to any treatme nt program, such as cogn itive-behavioral therapy, that involves cognitive pr ocessing of curriculum materials. Participants with these skill deficien cies are not as likely to ben efit from programs that do not first t arget these deficits. Knowledge about underlying generators should ev entually inform those in the field as to the ch aracteristics of offenders least affect ed by variou s This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Enhancing the Effectiveness of Treatment The general public, men tal and public health officials, an d the criminal ju stice system are concerned a bout this sig nificant per centage of in dividuals who do not respond to curr ent treatment approaches f or prison in mates. Unfortunately, the absence of effective preventive interventions for young people who are at particu larly high risk for eventual criminal offending and severe drug abuse has resulted in a substa ntial populat ion of crimin al offenders, many of whom end u p in a correctional institut ion at some or several points in the ir life. With in these institutio ns, those who are considere d most unmanageable e xhibit repetit ively aggressive and impulsive behavior or psychopathy (Rice, 1997). These inmates are resistant or unr esponsive to authority and generally impervious to punish ment. Man y institutions attempt to identify these inmates to segregate them and reserve resources for inmates thought to be more amenable to treatment. This approa ch does not alter these h igh-risk beh aviors, nor help staff manage the risks the se inmates present. It ties u p custodia l segregation space before the inmate is released an d transfers t he untreated risks t o communities. Fortunately, this study a nd others suggest that reliable tools can be ap plied toward the identification and tre atment of the distinct characterist ics of these recalcitrant inmates to reduce their misconduct in prison and lower their recidivism (Fabiano et a l., 1990a, 19 90b, 1991). Several bodies of resear ch indica te that a single treatment approach will not likely sui t all antisocia l inmates. The inability to ef fectively treat large numbers of these offenders may be due to our la ck of knowle dge about u nderlying traits and mechanisms an d to differen ces in the ir interplay among offende r subgroups. Three consistent find ings that have yet to be related in this populat ion were considered in th e present study and are informative for developing new treatment approaches: ( 1) impulsive and aggressive offenders have been exposed to a disproportio nate amount of adversity, including head trauma, social d eprivation, child abuse, and family dysfunction; ( 2) psychoso cial adversit y has a direct impact on the development of the brain, particularly the prefrontal cort ex (PFC), which is re sponsible for h order neuropsychological skills; and (3) a ggression, p sychopathy, and substa nce abuse h ave been associat ed with neuropsychological and emotional deficits. The links between these findings must be considered in light of evidence that such deficit s appear to compromise intervention outcomes and, thus trea tment responsiveness.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. This figure illus trates that for mos t high ri sk population s, parti cularly involving antiso cial be havior and substance abuse, conventi onal intervention s only work for a minority of pa rticipa nts. Th e majority do n ot resp ond fa vorably. Given that this gro up is hetero geneous in term s of risk factors and speci al need s, it is importa nt to subtype them in orde r to identify an approp riate a nd effective treat ment. Subtyping th e Population on the Basis of Underlying Conditio ns Evaluations of a number of interventions provide evidence for their effectiveness in preventing or treating various forms of antisocia l behavior. Moreover, those who participate in treatment exhibit much more favora ble outcomes than those who do not, particularly in terms of recidivism and relapse. However, as discussed in this manual, in all cases substant ial benefits have been experienced by only a subset of participants. Ind ividuals with neuropsychological and emotional deficit s may be at greatest risk for repetitive misconduct a nd antisocial behavior and also lea st likely to benefit from treatment interventions that do not fir st includ e a targeted cognitive co mponent. In order to develop a variety of interventions that are effective in a wider group of inmates, it is crit ical to id entify which subgroups of pa rticipants are most likely to benefit from which programs and, importantly, what di fferentiates th ose who respond favorably to interventions consid ered to be effective from those who do not. Research on vulnerability factors sugg est that tailo red, targeted interventions will be most effective when social and environment al manipulations are \"matched\" to an individual's special ne eds, thereby reinforcing more adaptive and normative behaviors. Once the pop ulation ha s been subtype d on the basis of a co mpre hensive asse ssment of potential unde rlying m their antisoci al behavio r, more ta rgete d treatment approa ches can be provide d. A growing body of research reveals ident ifiable subgroups of behaviorally disordered inmates with distinct ive characteristics and under lying pathologies. For example, those with This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

They also will differ in terms of the types of neuropsychological de ficits they may suffer from. Thus, ther e is a critical need to identify underlying processes that interfere with the ability o f some inmates to respo nd favorably to treatment intervention curricula. Dysregulation of emotion, behavior, and cognition , particularly involving exe cutive functions, have been implicat ed in antiso cial behavio r and drug abuse vulnerability (Ayta 1 999; Deckel Peterson and Pihl, 1990; Giancola et al., 1 996) and propensity to relapse and r ecidivism (Bauer, 1997; Self, 199 8; Winterer et al., 1998). Measures of emotional regulation a nd perception o f social cues have also been related t o antisocial behaviors (Finn et al., 19 94; Taylor et al., 1999). Thus, ECF and its regulation of emotional response s to processin g of social stimuli represent d imensions o f brain f unction that shou ld be consid ered in the d esign and assignment of inmates to correction al treatments. The atte mpt to understand the in teractive contribution of biologically based processes and interventions to reduce a ntisocia l behavior problems has been discussed for de cades, but o nly recently have studies such a s this one been designed to test these in teractions. Overall Go als and Objectives for Correction al Treatments The overriding goals for correctional interventions that focu s on underlying deficit s are: Improved se lf control; Less need f or external controls; Better and more effective services for inmates; Continuity in service delivery within the prison; Complete continuance of services post-release ; Comprehen sive and multifactoria l treatments that address several aspects of an in mates psychological, socia l and neurological needs; Interagency cooperation and operatin g agreements so that correctional off icers, so cial workers, religious instru ctors, psych ologists, courts, and post -release age nts (e.g, probation off icers) coord inate service s and requir ements; Platform for prevention and early intervention referring to the implications of this research for reducing th e number of individuals with behavioral problems overall (e.g., prevent child abuse, pro vide nurturing env ironme nts and community supports, etc.). It is also important that manipulations used to improve in mate behavior are conduct ed in a real world conte xt; they have greater effects for a lo nger period of time than interventions that are contrived and do not occur in a socia l context. Also, services that are provided under artificia l conditions ( e.g., in priso n) do not te nd to have long term effects unle ss they are continued in their post-release environment. At a minimum, b ooster sessions should be provided in the community.

Rehabilitatio n programs developed for head injur ed patients, such as cognitive and behavioral \"neurorehabilitation\" strat egies, also have potential for application in the treatment of inmate misconduct.

Repeat performances of these instruments appear to ifficulty d by dition to New les where individuals with aggressive, disinhib ited and socially inappropriat e ehaviors were treated. These patients were previously considered \"hop eless\", often times unable e underlying impulsivity, executive cognitive dysfunction, aggressive behavior, inability assess consequences, b ehavior disinhibition an d poor copin g strategies, is a viable t arget for rehabilitatio n (see Bech ara et al., 19 96; Frith an d Dolan, 1997; Kandel & Freed, 1989; Pos Weiss, 1997 ; Volavka, 1995). In addition, patient s who have suffered an injury to the prefrontal cortex commonly ha ve impaired decision-makin g and other neurocognitive deficits ( Damasio e al., 1994). I n brain injur ed individuals, a function al disconn ection between frontal ical regions and limbic struct may un derlie these deficits. In turn, these impairments may influence th e choice to initiate aggre ssive behavior and other forms of misconduct. T argeting interventions to such impairments may thus diminish risk reg ardless of th e origins of t he ex deficits. An approach th at combines learning the ory, cognitive psycholog y and neuropsychology to focus on the e motional, motivational, and cognitiv e functions involved in psychopathology ma y be used to id entify and remediate cognitive and behavioral difficultie s (Wilson, 199 7). Thus, n eurorehabilit ation strateg ies applied to treat traumatic br prefrontal co rtex ma y be effective for prevent ing behavioral problems and reducing recidivism the long run. Another possible approa ch for impulsive is behavior-mo dif number of tokens which can eventually be exchanged for ta ngible rewards (e.g., can dy or cigarettes). Whenever a negative behavior is ob served, however, the individual is pro mpted to give staff one token back and state t he reason fo r its loss. T he advantages of this pr ocedure are that it he lps to dire ct the person's attention to aspects of their behavior that they are no monitoring and it helps t hem to recognize import ant feedback they are getting from others in the environment . It also app ears to facilitate lear ning and increase awareness. This te chnique ha been used successf ully in drug abusing populatio ns (Higgins et al., 2000) and head injured patients (Ald erman & Kni ght, 1997). Interestingly , it is po ssible to employ the same tools used to assess neur opsychologica function (i.e. , neuropsychological t asks improve neu ropsychological abilitie s by teaching techniques t o delay gratification, inhibit impulsive responses, shift strategies to produce more advant ageous con sequences, and reinforce self-regulated mood and behavioral controls.

The present findings suggest that p articular neu rocognitive measures were more likely to terfere with treatment effects than others. For example, risky decision making was associat ed ty. Risk taking on this task ha s been consist of the prefrontal cortex (PFC: Fishbein et al., 2005a; are prison , e reaction time, the great er the time would be for eliberation of choice s and consequ ences, rathe r than impulsive decisio n making.

Measures of impulsivity included both e ability to respond cor rectly in spit e of a distra cter stimulu s and reacti on time (which was signific & of ivity may e in with reduce d treatment readiness, g ain and resp onsivi ently shown to activate the orbital portion Rogers et al., 1999) which regulates planning skills, sensitivity to consequences, impulse con trol, and oth er complex social beh aviors. As the entire PFC is underdeveloped relative to other regions of the brain until at lea st age 21 (Giedd, 2004), risk takin g behaviors developmen tally expected in adolescence. Yet, it appears fro m these findings that ad ults who persistently engage in high levels of risk taking a re less resp onsive to CBT approaches in that attempt to reinforce skills involving impulse control, verbal negotiatio ns, problem solving and cautiou s decision making. If the basic c ognit ive and emo tional skills t hat underlie these behaviors are in deficit, t hen interventions that do not first in still the prereq uisite bui lding blocks will be ineffe ctive. Interventions may be more beneficial t o this subgroup i f they first assess the sophisticatio n of an inmate's decision making and planning skills and the u se of techniques for weighing co nsequences. Then, training in the p rediction of outcomes and development of a future orient ation, among other relat ed skills, may help these inmates to be better eq uipped to make decisi ons involving risks (Trad , 1993). In addition t o risk ta king on this task, shorter rea ction times when selecting a risky decision u nder conditio ns of the hig hest risk also lessened t he impact of the intervention. Intuitively, one would su rmise that the longer th d s, those who deliberated more quickly made riskier de cisions and exhibited worse behavioral outcomes, su ggesting im pulsivity. The subgroup t hat made more risky decision had shorter reaction times while making those d ecision s received less b enefit from the intervention. Reaction time ma y therefore be indicative of the quality of in dividuals' de cision making under these cir cumstances. Thus, treat ment program strategies to help inmates \" down and think\" and con trol impulsive reactions may so mewhat effective given that the subgroup most like ly to be unrespon sive to treatment ma y be impulsive, resulting in a counterprod uctive decisions. These data suggest that a more effective approach, on ce again may be to te ach inmates how to accurately evaluate the risks associated with their d ecision s and act on t hat assessment. Consistent with reactio n times during the dec ision making t ask, measur es of impulsivity generated by the Stop Change Task specifically compromised effects on all treatment scales (readiness, gain and responsiv th antly shorter in poor responde rs). Impul sivity has been shown to act as a sig nificant risk factor in a w ide range of high risk b ehaviors (Butler et al., 200 4; Dawe & L oxton, 2004; de Wit Richards, 2 004; Dawes et al., 2000). Interestingly, however, impulsivity was related to treatment specific measu res but not t o number of infraction s or segregations. Development the brain cir cuitry underlying impulse control is in transition th roughout adolescence and into early adulthood, suggesting that insults during t his period, fr om stress to head injury to drug or alcohol use, may delay or impair impulse cont rol (Chambers et al., 2003) . Thus, impuls also play a r ole in treatment responses which rel y heavily up on the abilit y to resist i mpulses to engage in b ehavior that has yielded immediate in trinsic rewar ds (e.g., the high from aggressiv behavior or illicit drugs) despite long er term negative conse quences. I mpulsivity h as been shown to sig nificantly pr edict aggression, dr ug use and treat ment retention, suggesting the need for targeting impulsivity in intervention programs in general ( Moeller et al., 2001).

The incr eased number of errors on this task in the context of a participation in treatment suggests th at inmates who are less apt behavior in response to t reatment may be impair ed in accura tely perceiving negative emo due to either compromised amygdal a function or PFC modul ation. Beca use perception of emotional cues and expressions is a prerequi site for regulatio n of emotion and adaptive responding in a socia l context (Ochsner, 2004; Battaglia et al., 2004; Sku se et 03; Bar-On et al., 2003), such misatt ributions may cause affected individu als to misre ad situation s, react inappropriat ely, and/or miss important socia l signal s that may predispose them to aggressiv otherwise maladaptive behavior. Interventions that provide training in re ading social cues enhance the ability not o nly to respond appropri ately in chall enging situa tions, but al so may improve verbal commun ications which are highly reliant upon perception of emotion in others. Cognitive flexibility and error monitoring, as measured by the Stroop Task, was significantly related to po or treatment outcomes but also not t o institut ional behaviors such as infractions a nd segregations. There were no differences in p erformance between good and p performance, suggestin g cognitive i nefficien cy. Cognitive rehabilitation approaches, as mentioned above, ma y address this deficit specif ically. Remediation targ ets areas of learning, attention, pr oblem-solving, and visual-spatial skills using two approaches: repeated e xposure a task and/o r the deconstruction of complex tasks into their simpler component parts. For example, components of a complex task such as scanning or psychomotor speed are tra separately and then inte grated into p erformance on the complex target task. The training also focuses on memory and problem-solving, stressing the use o f strategies such as for ming images or drawing diagrams. Stress reactivity as meas ured by cortisol was also predictive o f treatment readiness an d institutio nal behaviors. In all cases, t hose who performed less well in trea tment showed lo cortisol rea ctivity. Although hig lo or a dampening of stress response s that can occur after chr onic exposu re to stressf ul situations. This study cannot determine the origins of low stress respon ses in tho se who performed less well in treat ment. However, given t hat stress is known to (a) produce co gnitive impairment, (b) dysregulate emotional responses, ( c) increase th e likelihood of recidivism and relapse and (d) interfere with treatment benefits, ap proaches to minimize the impact of stress may be a critical part of treat ment for affected inmates. Unfortunately, there are no kno wn treatmen ts for low stress rea ctivity. If low responses ar e due to chronic adversity or trauma , then a number of stress redu ction progra ms ma y be effective for these inmates. With these findings in mind, the follo wing components in a tr eatment approach are recommend ed: 9 Delayed reinforcement exercises 9 Psychoe 9 Speech and language th erapy This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Using multivariate (mea suring several variables at once) assessment instruments, offenders ca n be triaged or subtyped on the basis of underlying disorders f or targeted treatments. Because off enders who do not resp ond to conventional treat ments often possess underlying susceptibilitie s and adverse socia l conditions that compound their problems, and are particularly at risk for pe rsistent serious criminality and substance abuse, this subgro up requires more intensive and customized approaches. Accordingly, of fenders will be better eq uipped to maintain co ntrol over their own behavior rather than requirin g severe me thods of external restraint that are terminated when they are released. The neuropsychological instruments used in the present stud y are noninvasive and easily administered on la ptop computers with the appropriate training. Ap pendix II provide few screen shots of the se instruments to illustr ate wha a tment providers interested in developing assessment batteries to be used in p risons to identify underlying defici ts in anti social inmates would be well advised to familiarize th emselve with several of these ne w test instru ments. These tools are more specific to ECF and are not a contaminated with measures of othe r cognitive components as more traditional batt eries. Newman's Card Task (Newman, 1 987), the Gambling Task (Bechara et al., 1997), t he CDMT (Rogers et al., 1999) and several derivations of the Go/No-Go Task (Brown, Fenwick, & Howard, 1989) are excellent examples of cognit ive instrume nts specifica lly designed to measure dimensions of ECF with a particula r emphasis on decision-ma king, assessment of consequences, reward/punishment sensitivity, and impulsivity. There is e vidence that ECF components measured by Newman's, Bechara's, Roger's and the Go/No-Go tasks discri between violent and non violent subje cts as well a s drug abusers and non users. The presen study suggests that they are also useful in di scriminating between those likely and le ss likely respond favorably to correctional tre atments. Each of these noninvasive tasks ha s been imaged and findings de monstrate differences in activity in particular area s of the pref rontal cortex between experimental and co ntrol particip ants. However, more re search is needed with non-clinical samples to validate these noninvasive instrume nts with respect to subclinica l impaired ECF. More basic resear ch is also needed to furth er specify re gions of the prefron cortex that are associa ted with cial behavio r, and that may be diffe rentially associated with other high-risk behavior s such a s alcohol and dr ug abuse.

I ncorporating this knowle dge regarding u nderlying generators of antisocia l behavior into CJ policie s will reach a greater proportion o f the populat ion than will individual tr eatment programs, and will contribut e eventually to large-scale system-wi de policy ch anges, such as in bail, p retrial detent ion, sentencing and release decision s, as well as ch ild rearing an d school pra ctices.

INTRODUCTION Treatability is a multi-faceted concept that we consider encompassing an individual's readiness for and responsivity to treatment intervention. It is suggested that the assessment of treatability be an integral component of correctional planning to facilitate the appropriate placement of offenders into correctional programs. The purpose of this scale is to assist staff to systematically assess an offender's readiness and responsivity to treatment and to subsequently measure the degree to which gains have been made. These items have been selected based on a review of the relevant literature and discussions with clinicians and program staff. The items that comprise the TRRG:SV were selected based on a factor analysis with the original scale of 50 items in a sample of 265 male offenders entering a cognitive skills program. Principle components analysis revealed one underlying factor for both the treatment readiness and responsivity domain. A reduction in items from 22 to 8 reduced the overall consistency for both domains from .90 to .82, still within the range for excellent internal consistency. Each item has a specific behavioral anchor and description to assist in scoring. Questions for each item are provided simply as a guide for those staff wishing the format of a semi-structured interview. We recommend the questions simply be incorporat ed into existing interview-based assessment strategies. Individual items are summed in order to provide a total score that represents an individual's readiness and responsivity for treatment. A higher score on this scale reflects greater readiness or responsivity for treatment while a lower score reflects less readiness or responsivity for treatment. The construct of treatment readiness and responsivity are not conceptualized as trait specific but rather as a process that reflects a continuum of change. For this reason it is recommended that the ratings be completed prior to treatment and at the conclusion of the treatment program. These ratings, to be completed by program staff, may then be used as a measure of change. Although it is impossible to predetermine how much contact is required before you can complete the pre-treatment assessment, it may be that up to 3 sessions will be necessary. Treatment readiness and responsivity are critical in the process of determining treatment needs and placement. For instance, offenders who score low on readiness and responsivity may benefit from a treatment primer session in order to prepare them for a treatment program, maximizing the potential treatment gains. Treatment Readiness Treatment readiness is a domain that captures an individual's willingness to engage in the treatment process. For some, they see themselves as having very few problems that require therapeutic intervention and do not have any desire to make changes. These individuals tend to be forced into treatment and are reluctant to put forth any effort into changing. Others may be aware of the problems in their lives but are hesitant to make a commitment to change. On the other extreme are those who are committed to changing and are enthusiastic about modifying their behaviors. The treatment readiness domain is intended to operational ize this continuum in an effort to assist clinicians in determining treatment placement. This domain has excellent internal consistency producing an alpha of .83 in a sample of 265 male offenders entering a cognitive skills program. The items produced factor loadings in the very good to excellent range (.60 to .77) with a mean of .67. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. Treatment Responsivity The items that comprise this domain have been select ed to represent potential responsivity factors in offender's compliance with, and response to, therapeutic intervention and treatment programs in general. These items are intended to tap into the offender's general interpersonal style and are not necessarily specific to treatment. These item s include callousness, denial, procrastination, intimidation, power and control, rigidity, victim stance and procriminal views. The treatment responsivity domain has excellent internal consistency producing an alpha of .82 in a sample of 268 male offenders entering a cognitive skills program. The items comprising the treatment responsivity domain produced factor loadings in the ve ry good to excellent range (.59 to .75) with a mean of .67. Treatment Gain The items incorporated into this domain represent a combination of knowledge, participation and competencies. Although many programs include specific measures of gain for particular program targets, the purpose of this domain is to provide an overall estimate of an offender's performance in a correctional program. Currently, data do not exist to support the predictive validity of this domain. Until such data are available, however, the items provide a useful and defensible overview to utilize in a post-treatment report. Norms Incarcerated men offender. Among incarcerated men offenders in cognitive skills program ( n = 58 to 268) the following scores were obtained: Domain N Mean SD Range Treatment Readiness: Readiness - Pre 268 12.54 5.03 1 to 24 Readiness - Post 207 16.61 4.95 3 to 24 Readiness - Change 207 3.59 3.58 -11 to 14.5 Treatment Responsivity: Responsivity - Pre 268 13.68 4.61 2 to 24 Presponsivity - Post 207 17.21 4.29 2 to 24 Reponsivity - Change 207 3.05 3.73 -12 to 14.5 Treatment Gain: Total Gain 58 15.15 4.84 7 to 24 Incarcerated women offenders .

Problem Recognition This item assesses the offender's appraisal of their current situation. This is assessed in terms of their understanding and ownership of their problems. Those who accept full responsibility without rationalization would score a \"3\". Those who deny responsibility would score a \"0\". Possible Questions: \u0089 Did you hear a victim impact statement read in court? If so, how did that make you feel? \u0089 How do you feel about yourself? Would you say you are satisfied or unsatisfied with who you are? 0 Views the problem is solely the result of others or circumstances (no ownership). 1 Views the problem as mainly the result of others or circumstances (marginal ownership). 2 Views self as a part of the problem (some ownership). 3 Views self as the major part of the problem (ownership). 2. Macro Treatment Benefits This item is intended to tap into an offender's views regarding the overall benefits of participating in treatment. An offender who describes the long term benefits (e.g., lifestyle stability such as employment, relationships, no crime) and short term benefits (e.g., earlier release, fewer release conditions) of treatment would score a \"3\". Those who are unable to generate any benefits would score a \"0\". Possible Questions: \u0089 What do you think will happen if you do not participate in treatment? [or if you drop out] \u0089 If you finish this treatment program, what types of benefits might you gain? 0 Sees no benefits of treatment. 1 Able to identify at least one long term and short term benefit of treatment. 2 Considers limited long term and short-term benefit of treatment. 3 Accurately considers long term and short term benefits of treatment. 3. Micro Treatment Benefits This item addresses an offender's views about treatment. Those who describe treatment as beneficial to themselves and to others (e.g., family, friends, community) would score a \"3\". Those who cannot identify any benefits would score a \"0\". Possible Questions: \u0089 Why do you think someone would participate in a treatment program? \u0089 What are your views about treatment in general ? Do you think people benefit from it and how? 0 Not able to perceive benefits of treatment. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 1 Perceives treatment as only beneficial for self. 2 Perceives treatment as beneficial for self or others. 3 Perceives treatment as beneficial for self and others. 4. Treatment Distress This item is intended to address an offender's state of emotional distress regarding treatment. Offenders whose commitment to treatment is accompanied or prompted by emotional distress (notably anxiety or depression) warrant a score of \"3\", but only if they recognize the distress. Those who appear emotionally unconcerned and indifferent about the need for change score \"0\". Possible Questions: \u0089 How does the idea of participating in treatment make you feel? [If you are in treatment how did you feel before beginning treatment] \u0089 What motivated you to consider participation in a treatment program? [looking for distress cues not cost/benefits] 0 Indifferent (absence of emotional distress) and sees no need for treatment. 1 Distressed, but does not motivate to consider change. 2 Distress motivates them to consider changing. 3 Evidence of emotional distress and wants to participate treatment. 5. Treatment Goals Goal setting assesses the ability to identify and realistically create treatment goals. This item considers the knowledge and skills necessary for treatment gain. For example, someone with a lifelong history of substance abuse would score a \"0\" if their goal was abstinence without lapses following a 4 month program and a \"3\" if they are realistic about the new skills and knowledge necessary for treatment gain. Possible Questions: \u0089 If you were to participate in a treatment progr am what would you say were the issues you would need to address? How would you go about addressing these issues? \u0089 How would you describe the treatment process? [try to get at whether they think that showing up for group will suffice or that more work is required than that] 0 Unable to set realistic treatment goals. 1 Unaware of skills and knowledge required for treatment gain. 2 Somewhat able to set realistic treatment goals. 3 Able to set realistic treatment goals. 6. Treatment Behaviors This item assesses the offender's motivation for treatment. Behavioral indication of good motivation should reflect, where applicable, timely attendance at interviews and/or groups; This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. homework completion; compliance with prior treatment; and/or positive comments about treatment as a process not an outcome. More than one of these must apply to warrant a score of \"3\". Possible Questions: \u0089 Have you participated in treatment before? If so, what is different this time? \u0089 How did you find out about treatment? [i.e., what steps did he/she take in order to pursue treatment?] 0 Consistent behavioral indication of poor motivation. 1 Inconsistent indication of good motivation. 2 Somewhat inconsistent indication of good motivation. 3 Consistent behavioral indication of good motivation. 7. Behavioral Congruency This item highlights the importance of an offender's verbal statements and their actions regarding treatment. If an offender has not previously participated in treatment then this item refers to behavioral consistency outside of treatment (e.g., meets caseworker, etc...). Offenders who state they are motivated towards treatment, but show incongruence by poor attendance (late or infrequent), failure to complete homework, and/or state low motivation to other staff or offenders, warrant a score of \"0\". Those who consistently follow through would score a \"3\". Possible Questions: \u0089 [If you have participated in treatment before] How would the counselor or other group members describe you with respect to your participation? Did you go to all the sessions? \u0089 [If you have not participated in treatment] How would your caseworker describe you? Have you attended all planned meetings with him/her? 0 Verbal and behavioral expressions of motivation are inconsistent. 1 Often inconsistent between stated motivation and actions. 2 Somewhat inconsistent between stated motivation and actions. 3 Complete congruence between verbal and nonverbal expressions of good motivation. 8. Treatment Support This item assesses the degree of support for change by others significant to the offender. Allow the offender to determine who is important to them (preferably family, friends, employer, or clergy) and then probe for degree of support from them. Those having no support would score a \"0\". Those reporting strong support would score \"3\". Possible Questions: \u0089 Who would you say is the most significant person (s) in your life? \u0089 What kind of support do you want from this person (s)? Would you say they are providing this support for you? How do they demonstrate this support? \u0089 Does this person (s) believe you can change? 0 Reports no external support for changing.

TREATMENT RESPONSIVITY: SHORT SCALE 1. Callousness This item describes offenders who have no concept of the injury they have caused others. Generally, they lack concern for others except when it can serve them. They present an air of ownership of others, with an expressed right to do as they please with impunity. Those who always put their own needs above those of others would score a \"0\". Those who are able to be other centered would score a \"3\". Possible Questions: \u0089 Can your family depend on you? Give an example of your dependability. \u0089 You are in the desert and have one drink left...how would you feel about sharing it with your cellmate? With a friend?

Rigidity This item considers an offender's ability to effectively problem solve. Those with the demonstrated ability to generate alternative solutions and be flexible would score \"3\". Those who repeat ineffective solutions to problems and refuse to consider alternate solutions would score a \"0\". This item should not be restricted to criminal behavior. Possible Questions: \u0089 Are there any concerns you have at the moment? How have you tried to deal with this problem? Are there any other ways of approachi ng this problem that you have yet to try? \u0089 What kind of things have you tried in the past to stay out of crime?

Evidence of Increased Skills From Program This item considers the specific skills the treatment program is intended to impart to the offender. Again, A higher score indicates the offender can do more than simply repeat in group that which has been demonstrated in previous group sessions. 0 None 1 Rote repetition of skill(s) 2 Accommodates to reflect broader understanding 3 Shows/reports successful skill use in other situations 2. Disclosure in Program Disclosure is intended to consider the extent to which the offender shares information. Since offenders sometimes differ with respect to their comfort and willingness to share in group versus individual sessions, both should be considered when scoring this item. The highest score is reserved for those offenders who freely discuss issues and who also share incriminating information, recognizing such disclosures reflects treatment engagement and gain. 0 Resistant (denies, refuses to participate, obstructionist) 1 Marginal (uncommunicative) 2 Satisfactory (opens up in group) 3 Full (candid, revealed extra information in group) 3. Application of Knowledge This item considers the extent to which an offender is able to consider and apply knowledge from the program to his or her own situation, not just other group members. The highest scoring is reserved for those offenders who are able to apply the information n a reflective and systematic manner. 0 Poor (unable to apply) 1 Able to apply to others' situation 2 Able to apply to own situation and others' 3 Able to be reflective and problem-solve in many situations (insightful) 4. Application of Skills This item considers the range of skills gained through group participation. These skills need not be restricted to role-play situations, however, this may be the most convenient for staff to consider. 0 Poor (unable to apply) 1 Can role play as confederate only 2 Can participate as self in role play 3 Applies role play skills to other situations This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 5. Depth of Emotional Understanding of Program Content This item is intended to ensure the offender is emotionally connected to the program content and treatment change requirement. The offender who appears to be simply going through the motions and saying the right words without emotional connectedness would receive a score of '0'. 0 Poor (no emotional commitment to treatment) 1 Marginal (simply saying words) 2 Satisfactory (some emotional investment) 3 Very good (treatment is an emotional but rewarding challenge) 6. Appropriateness of Behaviour in Group This item focuses on an offender's failure to abi de by certain rules and ignores personal boundaries of staff and other group members when these have been brought to the individual's attention. For the purpose of scoring this item it is necessary to distinguish between those offenders whose inappropriateness is due to skill deficits or malicious intent. Again, those scoring highest would be effective role models by challenging peers whose behavior exceeds boundaries. 0 Poor (asked intrusive, personal questions of staff, verbally abusive) 1 Marginal (sarcastic remarks towards staff and offenders) 2 Satisfactory (no problems within group) 3 Very good (rebuts inappropriate behaviour of others) 7. Participation This item is an overall estimate of an offender's participation over the duration of the program. It should consider group behavior, attendance, timeliness of homework completion, and quality of work done. 0 Poor (minimal effort; begrudgingly attended) 1 Marginal (did not actively participate in a positive manner) 2 Satisfactory (did what was required, but no more) 3 Very good (completed all assignments, active in group, asked for extra work) 8. Therapeutic Alliance This item considers the relationship between the offender and program staff. Those offenders who score high will demonstrate an attachment to the t herapist, regardless of the nature of challenges throughout the treatment program or the recommendations contained in the final report. What is to be avoided is simply rating offenders based on their respons e to their treatment report. Rather, this item attempts to determine if there was any kind of connection or engagement between the offender and therapist. 0 Poor (confrontational, resistant) This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 1 Marginal (perfunctory disclosure, still us versus them views) 2 Satisfactory (good disclosure, sense of cooperation with therapist) 3 Very Good (evidence of emotional attachment to therapist) This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.
