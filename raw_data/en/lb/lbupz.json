The most common responses to the COVID-19 vaccine are injection-site reactions (sore arm for example) and general symptoms such as 'flu-like' illness, headache, chills, tiredness, nausea, fever, dizziness, weakness or aching muscles. Generally, these potential responses happen within a day or two after the vaccination and are not associated with more serious or lasting illness. These types of reactions reflect the normal immune response to this vaccine. Not everyone experiences this type of response. They are more likely after the second dose and tend to resolve within a day or two. Pain relief, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, is not recommended to be taken before having the vaccine but can be used after it if required. In addition, as with any vaccine or medicine, there is a risk of allergic reactions shortly after the vaccinations. Because of this people should wait at a vaccination centre as instructed after having their vaccine. Those with previous allergic reactions or anaphylaxis should tell their vaccinator before going ahead.
