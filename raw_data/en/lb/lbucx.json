Our bodies have a natural detoxification system in place that filters and removes toxic substances from our bodies. Our bodies detox every single day through organs including the liver, kidney, and the lymphatic system. While our bodies are incredibly intelligent, sometimes they need help with detoxifying due to the inescapable toxins brought on by our lifestyle and environments. What a Detox is Not As much as social media would like us to believe, a detox is not something that we \"do\" to our body, it is a natural process, that we can support. Supporting the Body's Detoxification System The perfect gut health vitamins . Featuring Aloe Vera, Anise Seed and Rhubarb Root for detoxification support, Beautifully Nourished's Detox tablets aim to support the body's natural detoxification process as the body naturally cleanses toxins and impurities . It does this by providing key nutrients that can offset pollutants, neutralise free radicals and support digestive enzymes. Beautifully Nourished's Detox supplement additionally supports gut health, with probiotic Lactobacillus Acidophilus, which can help to maintain a healthy balance of bacteria within the digestive tract. How it Works The liver is the main organ involved in detoxifying the body, as it filters the blood, helping to rid it of impurities and disabling toxins such as ethanol, environmental poisons and pesticides. Beautifully Nourished's Detox formula features vitamin C, which protects cells from oxidative stress, Aloe Vera and Calcium, which contributes to the normal function of digestive enzymes. No alcohol should be consumed whilst taking this supplement to further support the detoxification process. Key Ingredients Vegan Probiotic, lactobacillus Acidpophilus: Lactobacillus acidophilus is a probiotic bacteria.

Psyllium Husk: Detox herb, Psyllium Husk comes from a shrub-like herb called Plantago psyllium. The husk is the outer coating of the psyllium seed. It's a rich source of fibre, making it beneficial for gut health. Psyllium also works by helping your bowels to retain more water. By binding to food, more liquid is absorbed in the intestines. This helps the body to form a heavier, softer stool that's easier to pass. Calcium Carbonate: Calcium carbonate is used as an antacid to relieve indigestion and upset stomach. Cranberry Extract: Supports digestive health.

Ascorbic Acid: Vitamin C, also known as L-ascorbic acid, is often used as the first line of defence to ward off a cold, however not many people know about its powerful detoxifying capabilities, especially when it comes to heavy metals such as lead and mercury. [Studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0891584900004135) have shown that vitamin C can reduce the build up of lead in the liver and kidneys.

These antioxidants have anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. [Rhubarb](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-rhubarb#1) contains natural fibre to help keep things flowing through the digestive tract, preventing digestive issues such as constipation.
