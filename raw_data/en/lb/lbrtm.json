(AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty) Dealing with climate change requires us to address not just our carbon emissions but also the disconnection with ourselves and our planet which fuels ecological destruction. It is clear that some public trust in public health, science and government has been lost in Canada and around the world. (Shutterstock) Now is the time to learn from the COVID-19 response through an action-oriented independent inquiry focused on accountability. Reforms to data generation, access and use are essential. Narrow-leaved kalmia is an invasive plant typical of boreal ecosystems. Its proliferation can hinder the reforestation of areas subject to disturbances. (Jacques Ibarzabal/iNaturalist) Boreal plants produce molecules that are valued by traditional medicines and inspire the development of medicinal products by contemporary chemists. Canada forward Janine Beckie watches after attempting a shot during the first half of a SheBelieves Cup women's soccer match against the United States, Feb. 16, 2023, in Orlando, Fla. (AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack) Gender disparities in sport extend to injuries too. Female soccer players are at greater risk for ACL tears than males and it is clear immediate action is needed to address the non-biological factors for the injury. The HeLa line of immortal human epithelial cancer cells was derived from cells taken from Henrietta Lacks when she was a cancer patient in 1951. (Wellcome Collection: Anne Weston, Francis Crick Institute) The settlement is a long-awaited moment of victory for Henrietta Lacks and her family. But the battle for justice in genetic and medical research is not over yet. A Yazidi refugee woman's upper body is tattooed with the names of her missing family members and fianc\u00e9. (Leah Hennel) A Calgary refugee health clinic documented the stories of 242 Yazidi genocide survivors, recounting enslavement, slaughter and forced indoctrination. The perinatal period can be hectic. It's understandable that sex may be on the back burner for a little while. (Shutterstock) Sexual challenges during pregnancy and postpartum are common, but couples often don't know what to expect when it comes to their sex lives during this time. The good news is that information helps. Synthetic human embryos mimic the development of \"natural human embryos,\" those created by fertilization. (Shutterstock) In June, the possibility of synthetic embryos was announced at a conference. This allows some research to extend beyond the 14-day rule, which restricts experimentation on embryos beyond this period. Canadians pay high drug prices, but the pharmaceutical industry claims it is a 'key partner in economic resilience, recovery and growth.' (Shutterstock) Canadians pay very high drug costs, but Canada also does not receive the same economic benefits from pharmaceutical industry investments as other countries do. For many people, trying to lose excess fat is very difficult without help. Effective treatment is available when obesity affects health. (Shutterstock) Despite the prevalent view that people with large bodies should simply eat less and move more, it's nearly impossible to fight our genetic heritage or other factors that are not within our control. Research shows that sleep deprivation impairs communication between brain regions and brain blood flow, damages brain wiring and makes a young brain look like an aged brain. (Shutterstock) Ancient humans chose to sleep less, which had evolutionary benefits. For modern humans, sleeping less is futile and detrimental, but fitness may be a powerful ally in today's epidemic of sleep loss. Recruiting health workers from countries on the World Health Organization's safeguard list without robust and reciprocal benefits for the countries sending them does not meet ethical standards. (Shutterstock) Recruiting internationally educated health workers is a key part of Canada's proposed solution to the health worker crisis. But there are ethical questions about recruiting from foreign countries. Repetitive negative thinking can impact sleep quality, reduce efficiency and impair decision-making abilities. (Shutterstock) Mindfulness, through focused attention meditation, can help overcome repetitive negative thinking, thus improving mental and physical health. Smoke from wildfires hangs over Parliament Hill in Ottawa on June 6. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick Answers to some of the most common questions about wildfire smoke, health risks and the air quality situation affecting most of North America. Artwork created by public school students about the availability of healthy foods in schools. (Sara Kirk) An effective national school food program can help build the foundations for a healthy population. That's why Ottawa must limit the influence of the food industry on a national school food program. Extensive evidence shows COVID-19 vaccinations in pregnancy are safe, when given at any time during the pregnancy. (Shutterstock) COVID-19 vaccination has been shown to be safe in pregnancy, and protects both the mother and infant from severe disease. It's now also clear that infants' antibody protection continues after birth. Even though most people \u2014 including health-care professionals \u2014 are familiar with the term 'blue balls,' there is surprisingly little research on this phenomenon. (Shutterstock) The pain of 'blue balls' should never be used as a coercive tactic. But almost half of study participants \u2014 mostly women and some men \u2014 reported pressure to engage sexually. Antimicrobial resistance is now a leading cause of death worldwide due to drug-resistant infections, including drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis, pneumonia and Staph infections like the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus shown here. (NIAID, cropped from original) Drug-resistant microbes are a serious threat for future pandemics, but the new draft of the WHO's international pandemic agreement may not include provisions for antimicrobial resistance. Scientists and physicians raised concerns early in the pandemic that increased parental stress, COVID infections, reduced interactions with other babies and adults, and changes to health care may affect child development. (Shutterstock) Research findings are mostly reassuring for parents \u2014 despite the disruptions to nearly every aspect of life during the COVID-19 pandemic, most children continue to show healthy development.
