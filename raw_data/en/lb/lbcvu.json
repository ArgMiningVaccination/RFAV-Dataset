Whether or not an MRI is available to provide definitive knowledge of a structural issue, acupuncture can be an effective treatment for low back pain.| Digital Exclusive The Role of Meditation in Acupuncture The scope and breadth of traditional Eastern medicine corrects imbalances in bio-physiology and calms the complete nervous system. Acupuncture studies done around the world continue to confirm the link between meditation, a core element of traditional Eastern medicine (TEM), and balancing mind and body wellness through a devotion to practice. Calming Your Thoughts Meditation, like TEM is a comprehensive approach to modulate and calm erratic thoughts and actions in the central nervous system\u2014smoothing physical disharmony in the peripheral nervous system. Meditation, as one of the 8 limbs of traditional Eastern medicine, is known to modulate neurotransmitter synaptic messaging in the body and brain. Neurotransmitters convey messages of excitatory and inhibitory action potential through a complex messaging system called synapses. These synapses travel between the mind, body, and Shen / Spirit of each patient you provide treatment for. The balanced and complex range of neurotransmitters (NT), ligands or connectors of NT actions within the nervous system, regulate as well as stimulate mental thought processes in the complete emotional and physical motor response cascade. Mechanisms in the brain-mind and Heart-Shen connection, share a cornerstone toward greater clarity of thought and relaxation of the physical form. They also bridge Eastern practice and Western physiology opening up an exciting new area of clinical applications and understanding linking analogously: yin yang theory and neuronal and physiological processes of mind, body, and spirit. Deepening Your Balance & Harmony Utilize the 8 limbs of Oriental medicine to deepen balance and harmony within. By incorporating meditation alongside the complete 8 limb system of traditional Eastern medicine (TEM), the mind is quieted, allowing an opportunity for novel and more flexible thought. Adding these elements to your daily practice, provides a greater clinical competence through deeper self awareness and inner knowing. If you are unsure where to start, begin with a meditation focusing on the water element\u2014do as water does\u2014since water naturally flows, learn how to flow. The water element meditation reveals innately held wisdom. Capitalize on the understanding that your higher Self and Shen are aligned, guiding you. \"Knowing that you know\" begin to see this wisdom as a your consciousness. Your perception is clear. Your knowledge is vast. Discernment is yours to wield so you may take concise proactive action in all aspects of your life. Meditation reveals the water elements ability for soul knowing wisdom which assists the wood/decision and earth elements ability to make informed spiritually aligned choices. Practice Makes Perfect If you already have a practice of meditation, check in with yourself regarding the consistency of it. Is the amount of time devoted helping you dig deeper into the discovery of self? Is the act of meditation, qi gong, or sitting in prayer deepening your inclusion into the divine? Does your practice possess a spiritual component you could comfortably give away to your patients? If not, know your practice well enough to see that there is a relatable core or essence you could share. Lead by example, doing your own work inspires each patient you contribute wellness to. In my experience this is a positive step that greatly assists any personal healing journey. The long-term goal is to improve your personal connection to spirit since that will be the intuitive key that elevates your clinical practice. Bringing this conscious awareness into the treatment room enhances the services you provide. This brief introduction begins to outline the larger process of using neurophysiology and the 8 limbs of TEM to understand how well suited the body, mind, and spirit connection assists healing. Meditation roots us deeply in Heart-Shen allowing for a remodeling of negative, destructive, and undermining patterns. We become aware of routine and self-defeating thoughts which release us from mental and emotional entanglement, giving us clarity and less physical stress. Since we all continue to be on a healing journey, knowing that we possess inherent wisdom and power is crucial to our well being. "}
