For ex-ample, the West Nile Virus, which scientists believe has been in theUnited States since at least 1999, is thought to be closely related tostrains of a virus found in Africa, West Asia, and the Middle East. 1 Since the discovery of West Nile virus in New York City in early2000, 2 the virus is now recognized as an established seasonal epi- demic in the United States.3 In early 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( \"SARS \"), which originated in Asia, gained international attention when the illness spread over a few months to more thantwenty-four countries, including the United States. 4 Of the eight persons known to be infected with SARS in the United States, allhad contracted the highly contagious disease while traveling inother parts of the world. 5 Later that same year, the United States Department of Agriculture ( \"USDA \") confirmed that bovine spongi- form encephalopathy popularly known as \"mad cow \" dis- 1Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Overview of West Nile Virus, at http:// www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/qa/overview.htm (last visited Nov. 13, 2004). 2Id. 3Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, West Nile Virus: What You Need to Know, at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/wnv_factSheet.htm (last visited Nov. 13,2004) [hereinafter CDC, West Nile Virus]. 4Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Fact Sheet: Basic Information About SARS, at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/factsheet.htm (last visited Nov. 15, 2004) [hereinafterCDC, SARS Fact Sheet]. 5Id.\\\\server05\\productn\\H\\HHL\\5-1\\HHL104.txt unknown Seq: 2 4-MAY-05 12:30 146 H OUS.

Yet this is not the first time a foreign disease has raised fearsin the United States. More than twenty years ago, Acquired ImmuneDeficiency Syndrome ( \"AIDS \"), which is thought to have originated in Africa,8 created a similar media buzz. Today, AIDS, which is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus ( \"HIV\") has devel- oped into a global epidemic.9 Public health law and public health agencies have been charged with combating the threat of disease within the UnitedStates. 10 In order to effectively meet this challenge, legislation should be tailored to our knowledge of each disease. To effectivelyprevent or contain communicable disease, law and policy shouldtreat diseases differently according to various factors such as theirmethod and rate of transmission. For example, while travel restric-tions and quarantine may be appropriate measures for a diseasesuch as SARS, which is spread through close person-to-person con-tact, 11 it would be rash to adopt these measures in an attempt to contain West Nile Virus, which is transmitted primarily by an in-fected mosquito 's bite.12 But fear combined with improper concep- tions of diseases and the nature and manner of transmission maylead to laws ineffective in achieving public health goals. Such a law is found in the Immigration and Nationality Act, 13 which defines specific grounds upon which an immigrant or a non-immigrant visitor may be denied entry to the United States. 14 Under 6Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Questions and Answers Regarding Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), visited Nov. 13, 2004). 7Id. 8Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Where Did HIV Come From?, at http:// www.cdc.gov/hiv/pubs/faq/faq3.htm (last visited Nov. 13, 2004) [hereinafter CDC,Where Did HIV Come From]. 9UNAIDS & W ORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION , AIDS E PIDEMIC UPDATE 4 (2003) at http:// www.unaids.org/EN/Resources/Publications/Corporate+publications/AIDS+epidemic+update+ +December+2003.asp (last visited Mar. 23, 2005) [hereinafter UNAIDS, AIDS E PIDEMIC UPDATE ] (noting that HIV/AIDS \"killed more than three million people in 2003, and an estimated five million acquired the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\u2014bring-ing to forty million the number of people living with the virus \" worldwide). 10Id. 11CDC, SARS Fact Sheet, supra note 4. 12CDC, West Nile Virus, supra note 3. 13Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 (Law.

This provision contradicts everything weknow about the transmission of HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, the bangoes beyond being just ineffective: It may actually be harmful. Theban may exacerbate the spread of the illness by seriously undermin-ing proven efforts of prevention and control.

HIV: Emergence in the U.S. and Abroad and the Response of Public Health Officials and Agencies In an age of increasing globalization, the borders drawn by in- dividual nation-states are less and less effective in protecting thoseresiding within them from contagious disease. 20 The United States ' public health and prevention measures may be inadequate, in andof themselves, to combat an epidemic exacerbated by globaliza-tion. 21 In fact, many public health experts concur that national and international public health are indistinguishable as a result ofglobalization trends. 22 One of the causes of the spread of disease that can be attributed to globalization is the movement of peopleand goods across borders. 23 Thus, in analyzing the effects of any legislation that attempts to promote public health goals, it is impor-tant to consider both domestic and global public health efforts. In the case of AIDS, analyzing the history and pattern of trans- mission, along with the differing attempts to contain transmission,may be helpful in understanding how public health law and agen-cies can better contain the disease. AIDS is caused by HIV. 24 AIDS infection results in the weakening of the body 's immune system, causing the person infected with HIV to be highly susceptible to 20See Holly Rogers, Protecting Americans from Disease in a Global Society , 22 S UFFOLK TRANS- NAT'L L.

To examine how the HIV exclusion operates in practice, it is helpful to discuss individuals entering from abroad into the UnitedStates as falling into eight distinct categories: Immigrants enteringas LPRs; applicants for adjustment asylum seekers; unauthorized immigrants; returning LPRs;and returning United States citizens. 99 Some of the categories re- quire the individual to submit to a medical examination to proveadmissibility to the United States on medical grounds. 100 The medi- cal examination includes a blood test for all individuals fifteen yearsof age or older. 101 Additionally, individuals under age fifteen may be tested for HIV if the physician suspects that the patient may beinfected. 102 Immigrants seeking admission into the United States as lawful permanent residents apply through a consulate abroad and becomelawful permanent residents at the moment they gain admissionthrough a port of entry to the United States. 103 LPR status is gained through a variety of ways.104 A United States citizen 's family mem- ber or a United States employer may petition for the immigrant.105 Additionally, an individual may receive LPR status either by beingchosen in a lottery or through a special law for battered spouses andchildren of LPRs or United States citizens. 106 In 2002, some 384,427 new immigrants entered the United States.107 These immigrants were required to undergo a medical exam abroad which tested themfor HIV infection. 108 Likewise, an immigrant already within the United States may apply for LPR status through an adjustment of 98See id. at 213 (estimating that 7 million unauthorized immigrants were living in the U.S. as of January 2000). 99See U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services, supra note 90. 100See id .

These individuals may likewise subvert the medicalexamination required of authorized immigrants and visitors. Immi-grants and nonimmigrants who entered legally through immigrantor nonimmigrant visa procedures have either been tested or ques-tioned regarding their HIV status. 136 Immigration and Customs En- forcement may remove unauthorized immigrants for HIV-positivestatus if they entered the United States without permission. 137 How- ever, it is much easier for ICE to remove individuals on the groundsof an unauthorized entry into the United States than it is to removethem for being HIV-positive. 138 Accordingly, most individuals in this position are removed from the United States on immigrationgrounds as opposed to public health grounds. 139 LPRs returning from visits abroad generally may not be denied re-entry to the United States because of HIV-positive status.140 How- ever, if an LPR has been absent from the United States for 180 daysor more, or has committed certain crimes, he or she may be subjectto the grounds of inadmissibility, including the HIV and other pub-lic health exclusions. 141 United States citizens returning from abroad are not subjected to HIV testing or exclusion upon re-entry to theUnited States. 142 Thus, it is clear that there are large gaps in the process of ad- mitting HIV-positive individuals from abroad to the United States.For example, of those who enter the United States legally fromabroad, only a small percentage are actually required to be tested 134OFFICE OF IMMIGRATION STATS ., supra note 97, at 213. 135Id. 136See U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, supra note 90.

Furthermore, returning UnitedStates citizens and LPRs who have been abroad in areas of highprevalence of HIV/AIDS are not tested upon re-entry into theUnited States. 145 Finally, because the HIV tests work by detecting the presence of antibodies in an infected person, and these antibo-dies may not develop for up to six to twelve months, individualswho undergo the medical examination and have been recently in-fected may circumvent the ban. 146 D.

H EALTH L. & P OL'Y A final model, the ecological model, turns its focus to the envi- ronment in which the public health exists as a whole.171\"The ecolog- ical model conceives of illness not as an external threat such as apathogen or toxin, nor as a function of personal choices, but ratheras a product of society 's interaction with its environment. \"172 The ecological model encompasses social and physical structural aspectsof society which include distribution of wealth, attitudes towardssexual behavior, and relationships and economic conditions. 173 Changing negative environmental factors or encouraging publichealth under this model is effected through changes in virtuallyevery aspect of the society. 174 This model can be conceived of as a \"mirror, reflecting how a society produces and distributes wealth, creates conditions for human health (or its antithesis), constructs so-cial norms, and organizes its people[s] and communities. \"175 Addi- tionally, the public may even fight this type of analysis because, inorder to achieve the goal of systemic reform, it is inevitable that \"public health regulations targeting the causes of injury and disease will challenge behavior that people enjoy, that constitutes theirmoral vision, or that makes them money. \"176 These models can be helpful in the analysis of public health goals and effects of legislation outside of the traditional publichealth sphere. In considering the context in which the public healthground of exclusion arose in immigration law, it is important toconsider which of these views lawmakers and their constituentsbelieve. II. A NALYSIS Where does the immigration exclusion fit? The following is an analysis of the public health exclusion under the three models ofpublic health. A. Microbial Model The grounds for inadmissibility for HIV-infected immigrants or visitors seems to fall most easily under the conceptual framework 171See id. at 74. 172Gostin et al., supra note 147, at 74. 173Id. at 76. 176Id.\\\\server05\\productn\\H\\HHL\\5-1\\HHL104.txt 4-MAY-05 IMMIGRATION HIV E XCLUSION 165 of the microbial model.177 In attempting to deal with AIDS and HIV in the United States by restricting immigrants and visitors who areHIV-positive from entering our borders, legislators seem to applythe \"germ theory. \"178 The attempt to seal off the United States from the threat of HIV/AIDS in immigration law is dependent upon ef-fectively screening those who enter from abroad and bring withthem the HIV/AIDS virus. This approach fails to adequately ad-dress the HIV/AIDS epidemic in several ways. First, the immigration restriction does not effectively close off those within the United States from HIV or AIDS. This can be seenin the way the law is applied. In the United States, only a smallgroup of individuals entering from abroad are actually tested. 179 Nonimmigrant visitors, asylum seekers, returning LPRs, and re-turning United States citizens are not required to be tested for HIVto gain entry in to the United States. 180 The fact that nonimmigrants alone accounted for 27.9 million entries into the United States in2002 illustrates the relatively large portion of total entries into theUnited States that are not required to be tested for HIV. 181 Addition- ally, in the age of increasing global migration and increasingly po-rous borders, it is unrealistic to think that the HIV/AIDS virus canbe stopped effectively at the border. 182 Furthermore, due to the fact that antibodies may not be detectable in an infected individual forup to six months after infection, even the individuals who havebeen required to submit proof of HIV-negative status may be bring-ing the virus into the United States. 183 Use of the germ theory as the conceptual framework of the im- migration restriction on HIV-positive aliens ignores and under-mines what we know about the HIV/AIDS virus and its 177Gostin et al., supra note 147, at 70. 178See id.

HIV/AIDS is not transmitted through casual con- tact.184 HIV is not spread \"through the air, or from food, water or other objects. \"185 Likewise, \"nor will an infected person in a common public setting place another individual inadvertently or unwillinglyat risk. \"186 Thus, the mere presence of an HIV-infected person in so- ciety will not pose a rampant threat of infection to other individuals,unless the HIV-infected person engages in specific non-casual be-haviors that are known to result in transmission. 187 The rule of ex- clusion additionally ignores the fact that, prior to the ban onimmigrants, AIDS and the HIV virus were already present in theUnited States. 188 Inconsistently, the list of communicable diseases that serve as a ban for immigration purposes fails to list some seri-ous communicable diseases that are not widely present in theUnited States. 189 Finally, the exclusion of HIV-positive immigrants may actually serve to hinder the efforts of national public health systems to edu-cate the public and eradicate the disease. Within the United States,the government largely attempted to stay the spread of HIV/AIDSthrough education and voluntary testing. 190 The emphasis of educa- tional efforts was on the modification of behaviors which mightplace an individual at risk. 191 Laws were created to prevent discrimi- nation against HIV-positive people.192 These anti-discriminatory and educational approaches used within the United States differ markedly from the germ theory-driven policies designed to stop HIV-positive individuals at the 184See Barta, supra note 64, at 343 (noting that \"the CDC has categorically ruled out the possi- bility that HIV can be spread through casual contact . . . fears that other, thus far undiscov-ered methods of transmitting HIV may exist are not supported by scientific evidence \"). 185Id. 186Id. 187See id. at 343 (stating that HIV can be transmitted prenatally or through semen, blood, vaginal fluids, and breast milk). 188See CDC, Where Did HIV Come From, supra note 8 (indicating that the first known case of AIDS in the United States appeared in the late 1970s or early 1980s). 189See Rogers, supra note 20, at 210 (citing Ebola hemorrhagic fever as a serious communica- ble disease that is not listed as a disease that will bar an immigrant or visitor from enteringthe United States). 190Pendleton, U.S. Exclusion of HIV-Positive Aliens , supra note 25, at 279. 191See id. at 279-82 (noting that the media has flooded the public with information regarding transmission, prevention and treatment of HIV, and that the government has implementedmeasures to ensure that people engage in safe sexual practices and that intravenous drugusers use clean needles). 192See id. at 280 (listing laws against discrimination in housing, health care, education, and employment).\\\\server05\\productn\\H\\HHL\\5-1\\HHL104.txt unknown Seq: 23 4-MAY-05 12:30 THE IMMIGRATION HIV E XCLUSION 167 threshold. The ban creates the illusion that HIV necessarily comes from an outside source.193 This foreign threat concept of HIV is erro- neous.194 Recent studies confirm that most foreign-born individuals within the United States testing positive for HIV contracted the vi-rus while in the United States. 195 The misconception further results in various serious hin- drances to the HIV prevention efforts in this country; it falsely stig-matizes \"outsiders \" as carriers of disease, creating a false sense of security to United States citizens and residents.196 Stigmatization and fear of deportation drives HIV-positive immigrants under-ground, where they will be unable to access the public health ser-vices and information designed to prevent transmission. 197 The ban on HIV-positive individuals under the immigration laws of theUnited States undermines education- and behavior-oriented pre-ventative measures. The emphasis on banning individuals infectedwith HIV could better serve public health goals by emphasizingtesting, education, and behavior modification of immigrants seekingto enter the United States. B. Behavioral Model Perhaps a more realistic and effective way to target the HIV/ AIDS epidemic in the United States is to focus on a behavioral con-cept of disease control.

J. H EALTH L. & P OL'Y cies under the behavioral model would be more consistent with domestic policies. Some countries around the world have continued to test immi- grants and visitors for HIV, but have not used positive test results asgrounds for exclusion. 199 Information on HIV-positive individuals seeking to enter these countries is used proactively \"to alert health- care organizations and other caregivers of the necessity of providingcare for HIV-positive aliens. \"200 A similar policy in the United States would give agencies a chance to provide education and preventionservices to this vulnerable population. Although behavior-oriented immigration policies would seem to be most consistent with measures taken domestically to furtherprevent HIV infection, there are shortcomings to this approach aswell. First, a focus on controlling the individual behaviors thattransmit HIV can lead to measures that make disease control en-tirely a matter of personal responsibility, thus negating publiclyshared aspects that are vital to disease control. 201 Through this model, the social meaning of disease is altered, and HIV infectionmay come to be seen as a punishment for socially aberrant behav-iors. 202 When behavior is blamed for disease, the victim of the dis- ease is also blamed, resulting in stigmatization of HIV-positiveindividuals. 203 Second, the behavioral model 's narrow conception of disease prevention tends to ignore the underlying motivations andcauses of the behaviors it seeks to modify. 204 C. Ecological Model The ecological model of disease seems to be the most effective means of conceiving possible strategies for HIV prevention. By fo-cusing on the environmental and social conditions promoting HIV-spreading behavior, the ecological model may avoid the pitfalls ofthe microbial and behavioral models. 205 An ecological approach to disease control focuses on \"social institutions and activities, human inequality, and economic activities as the major health risks in a 199Qureshi, supra note 48, at 85. 200Id. 201Gostin et al., supra note 147, at 72. 202Id. 203Id.\"[T]he stigma of HIV . . . is based not just on the notion that the carrier is contaminated, but also, independently . . . that he is responsible for his own illness. \" Id. 204See id. at 74-75 (explaining that exposure to disease and behavior has social roots). 205Id. at 75.\\\\server05\\productn\\H\\HHL\\5-1\\HHL104.txt unknown Seq: 25 4-MAY-05 12:30 THE IMMIGRATION HIV E XCLUSION 169 population. \"206 In evaluating basic analytical elements under the ecological model, it is important to note the role that society 's laws and legal institutions play in the realm of public health.207 In fact, law can be seen as playing a direct role in infectious diseases.208 Consistent with the multi-factor approach of the ecological model, human rights are recognized as the key in creating a socialenvironment that maximizes the public health. 209 A human-rights analysis is particularly appropriate when examining a population 's vulnerability to HIV.210 International health organizations such as the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS ( \"UNAIDS \") promote the ecological model and conceptualize the global HIV/AIDS epi-demic in terms of broad human rights. 211 The UNAIDS plan notes that the \"[l]ack of respect for human rights continues to increase vulnerability to HIV infection of individuals and the whole soci-ety. \"212 Discrimination against HIV/AIDS-infected visitors violates the recognized human right of nondiscrimination.213 Degradation of this vital human right, through the immigration restriction on HIV/AIDS-infected aliens, hinders the efforts of global health organiza-tions to cope with the AIDS epidemic. 214 Although the WHO advo- cates for the elimination of discriminatory entry restrictions for 206Gostin et al., supra note 147, at 75. 207See Burris, Social Risk of Health Care , at 1770. \"[L]egal structures . . . have been identified as important and malleable factors in health. \" Id. 208Id. at 1770-71. \"[S]ome health risks (for example, poor access to sterile injection equip- ment) have been directly attributed to law, and law has been deployed to change un-healthy norms (smoking, for instance) or behaviors (such as driving while drunk). \" Id. 209Id. at 1775. 210See id.

To the extent that \"[l]aw operates to create and preserve social relations of status and power \" by order- ing \"social meaning, \" law can drive societal perceptions about what is \"right, appropriate, or natural to do. \"218 Therefore, the current law apparently informs society that it is permissible\u2014and even right\u2014 to discriminate against, stigmatize, and marginalize HIV/AIDS-in- fected individuals in particular, and immigrants by inference. III. C ONCLUSIONS AND PROPOSALS FOR A MODEL OF PREVENTION MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT HIV/AIDS E PIDEMIC The current immigration restriction on HIV/AIDS-infected travelers and immigrants makes no sense. The restriction is rootedin an ineffective concept of disease control. 219 The restriction fails to adequately exclude HIV/AIDS-infected individuals at our bor-ders. 220 Furthermore, the restriction is inconsistent with HIV/AIDS control and prevention measures used both domestically221 and 215See Qureshi, supra note 48, at 85 (noting that the WHO has a policy against AIDS-related discrimination). 216Immigration and Nationality Act, \u00a7 1182(a)(1) (Law.

To effectively do this, the United Statesmust acknowledge the reality of the threat that HIV/AIDS poses.For instance, to effectively confront the problem of disease at astructural level, we must acknowledge basic concepts in diseaseemergence: Emergence of infectious diseases is complex. Infectious diseases are dynamic.Most new infections are not caused by genuinely new pathogens.Agents involved in new and reemergent infections cross taxonomic lines. . . . The concept of microbe as the cause of disease is inadequate and incomplete. Human activities are the most potent factors driving disease emergence. Social, economic, political, climatic, technologic, and environmental factors shape disease patterns and influence emergence. Understanding and responding to disease emergence requires a global perspective, conceptually and geographically. The current global situation favors disease emergence. 225 The United States must recognize that a key to prevention do- mestically is prevention globally. Prevention includes acknowledg-ing the structural and ecological factors that drive the spread ofdisease. Namely, it is important to address the connection betweenpoverty in the developing world and disease in the developed 222See UNAIDS, AIDS E PIDEMIC UPDATE , supra note 9 (listing the violation of human rights as a contributing factor to the spread of HIV infection). 223See Barta, supra note 64, at 349. A report created by WHO criticized entry exclusions on immigrants and international travelers on the following grounds: no screening programcan prevent HIV infection and spread; in any specific country, the screening may onlytemporarily slow the rate of infection; and the screening diverts resources from more effec-tive disease control measures. Id. See also Sommerville & Wilson, supra note 196, at 800. 224See Barta, supra note 64, 329 (noting that \"the risk of . . . HIV comes not from the nation- ality of the infected person, but from the specific behaviors that are practiced . . . allowingHIV infected aliens into this country will not impose a significant additional risk of HIVinfection to the U.S. population, where prevalence of HIV is already widespread \"). 225Burris, Law as a Structural Factor , supra note 23, at 1760.\\\\server05\\productn\\H\\HHL\\5-1\\HHL104.txt unknown Seq: 28 4-MAY-05 12:30 172 H OUS. J. H EALTH L. & P OL'Y world,226 as well as the role that strengthening human rights can play in addressing the structural causes of disease.227 The United States should change its current policy of exclusion to a policy of compassion and education. Pre-entry testing of immi-grants and travelers should be used to reach out to HIV/AIDS-in-fected immigrants, incorporate them into our public health system,and provide education on behaviors that increase the possibility oftransmission. 228 The United States should make policies and decisions based on the totality of the ecological causes of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Inthe case of immigrants, the prevention efforts in the United Statesshould recognize that efforts aimed at the general public may notreach immigrants who are often marginalized. The prevention ef-forts should acknowledge factors specific to migrant populations,which might increase their vulnerability to infection. For example,migrating populations may be more susceptible to infection becauseof language barriers, differing cultural and health beliefs, and otherfactors, including \"financial instability, relationship disruption, and unequal sex ratios resulting from sex-segregated migration pat-terns. \"229 A more effective means of combating HIV/AIDS in the United States is to acknowledge the special public health considera-tions that should be afforded and implemented in addressing immi-grant public health. Protecting the health of immigrants in theUnited States protects the health of the global community. Thus, itbecomes important to develop an adequate public health systemthat ensures that individuals have access to suitable treatment andare informed consumers of healthcare. In conclusion, removal of the HIV restriction on immigrants and visitors to the United States is an important step in aligning lawwith public health goals and concepts. The current restriction isineffectively designed. It is based more on fear and discrimination 226Fidler, supra note 22, at 24 (stating that Third World poverty has been cited as negatively impacting the public health in the First World). 227UNAIDS, AIDS E PIDEMIC UPDATE , supra note 9, at 13. 228See Qureshi, supra note 48, at 85 (noting that some countries comply with international efforts by testing and then notifying service providers of the need for care). 229Harawa et al., supra note 195, at 1962.
