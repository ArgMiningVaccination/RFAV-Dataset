There are many therapeutic options available for the treatment of rosacea, but none arecurative. Since the pathogenesis of rosacea remains elusive, it is not surprising that no singletreatment is paramount and that many patients nd therapies unsatisfactory or even exacer-bating. Treatments are prescribed to work in concert with each other in order to ameliorate thecommon clinical topical therapies includemetronidazole, azelaic acid, and sodium sulfacetamide-sulfur. Many other topical inhibitors, benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, retinoids, topical corticosteroids,and permethrin have demonstrated varying degrees of success. Due to the inconsistent resultsof the aforementioned therapies patients are increasingly turning to alternative productscontaining natural ingredients or botanicals to ease inflammation and remit disease. Additionalresearch is needed to elucidate the benets of these ingredients in the management of rosacea,but some important considerations regarding the natural ingredients with clinical data will bediscussed here.Semin Cutan Med Surg 30:148-155 \u00a9 2011 Elsevier ingredients, Anti-inflammatories, Antioxidants, Anti-aging, Cosmeceuticals, Rosacea characterized by cuta- neous hypersensitivity and inflammation of the central facial skin. It is estimated rosacea affects 14 million people in the United States.1The typical presentation is that of a fair- skinned individual of European and Celtic origin with a va-riety of clinical features, including facial flushing anderythema, this diversity, in2002 the National Rosacea Society Expert Committee de- ned clinical subtypes to help classify rosacea on the basis ofits primary features, with further clarication in 2004 of thecommon secondary features. 3,4The classication of subtypes has helped dictate treatment protocols, as no treatments arecurative. Specic subtypes respond better to one treatmentthan the other, but in all cases therapy requires long-termmanagement with multiple concomitant interventions(Table 1). For the erythematotelangiectatic (Fig. 1) and papulo- pustular (Fig. 2) subtypes, primary interventions include topical agents, such as azelaic acid, metronidazole, or so-dium sulfacetamide-sulfur with or without minocycline, or tetracycline. 5-7 Nonablative lasers, vascular lasers, and intense pulse lighttherapy are the cornerstones of treatment for telangiecta-sias and persistent erythema but are often associated withsome short-term side effects, such as worsening redness orpurpura (Fig. 3). 8-10For phymatous disease, medical ther- apy includes isotretinoin; however, if advanced, only sur-gical interventions such as microdermabrasion, carbondioxide laser, electrocautery, or surgical shave are bene-cial, as this condition will not spontaneously resolve*Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Department of Dermatology, New York, NY.

Itis known that inflammation plays a role because most inter-ventions that modulate the inflammatory process are effec-tive. However, factors that regulate and maintain this inflam-matory dysfunction are poorly understood. Despite all theresearch on the development of rosacea and the underlyingneoangiogenesis, pilosebaceous abnormalities, dermal ma-trix degeneration, and dysfunction of antimicrobial peptides,most therapies only target the signs and symptoms of thecondition rather than the underlying cause. 15Because each patient is uniquely sensitive both to triggers that stimulatedisease and to standard therapies, an increasing number ofpatients are seeking alternative options. Natural Ingredient Alternatives Natural ingredients have been used worldwide for centuriesin skin care as wound healing and antiaging remedies. Manynew dermatologic products claim to contain \"natural\" ingre-dients\u2014 botanicals that are herbal in origin and found di-rectly in nature\u2014with benecial claims of activity on agingand inflammation (Fig. 5). They provide alternatives for pa-Table 1 Subtypes of Rosacea with Associated Characteristics and Suggested Therapies Subtype Characteristics Interventions Erythematotelangiectatic Flushing and persistent central facial erythema /H11550 telangiectasiaFlushing: trigger avoidance, ice chips /H11550pulse dye laser; cases: surgical interventions (electrosurgery, cold steel excision,carbon dioxide, scalpel or shave sculpting) Ocular Foreign body sensation in the eye, burning or stinging,dryness, itching,photosensitivity, blurredvision, telangiectasia of thesclera or other Rosso et al.88 Figure 1 Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea of the left cheek.

Because herbal andother alternative medical treatments are used by more thanhalf the population in the United States, it is important thatdermatologists have knowledge of common and popular bo-tanicals used medicinally or for flavoring and/or fra-grances. 16,17 Large, clinically validated, placebo-controlled trials are lacking, most likely because medicinal botanicals used incosmeceuticals are considered food additives or dietary sup-plements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)and can be marketed without maintaining any drug status orrestriction. A high level of scrutiny is needed because most\"natural\" treatments have no standards in potency, concen-tration, safety, or coffeeberryhave literature suggesting a therapeutic advantagein the treatment of rosacea (Table 2). These products will bethe primary focus of this paper, with a brief mention of otherbotanicals on the market. Hydrating Colloidal long-standing indermatologic conditions associated with itch and irritationbecause of ability to soothe and protect inflamed skin. Itcontains a variety of active components, including enzymes, flavonoids, vi-tamins, and avenanthramides FDA recognized the value of colloidal oatmeal as a safe andeffective skin protectant. preparations are the concentratedstarch-protein fraction of the oat grain mixed with emol-lient. 18Fine particles disperse on the skin and form a protec - tive, occlusive barrier that retards water loss and moisturizesto help improve the epidermal barrier. Further, oatmeal sa-ponins help to solubilize dirt, oil, and sebaceous secretionswhich may normalize the skin pH. 20Oats have important antioxidant, ultraviolet (UV) absorbent, and antiinflamma-tory properties attributed to the ferulic, caffeic, and coumaricacids, as well as flavonoids and components.21,22Recent research has identied avenanthra - mides (phenolic compounds) as a minor component of oatgrains, and in vitro work, researchers have demonstratedantiinflammatory and antipruritic properties by reported to inhibit prosta-glandin synthesis. 25As a result, many studies have substan - Figure 3 Erythema and purpura after pulsed-dye laser treatment of erythematotelangiectatic rosacea.

Waldorf, and the antiinflammatory, hydrating, and antipruritic properties of colloidal oatmeal and their use in the manage-ment of common inflammatory dermatoses, such as atopicdermatitis. Although additional research is needed to explainits use in other conditions, the data suggest that colloidaloatmeal may be a useful ingredient in cleansers or moistur-izers used for rosacea. Anti-inflammatories Niacinamide Niacinamide (also acid (vitamin B3 or niacin), which is a water-solublevitamin found in meat, sh, and wheat. It does not have thesame pharmacologic and toxic effects of niacin, which occursincidentally during biochemical conversion. Therefore, ni-acinamide does not cause flushing, itching, burning, or areduction in serum cholesterol but does an antioxidant but also possesses biologicalactivities, making it an important emerging cosmetic ingre-dient. 27Niacinamide has antiinflammatory action, skin- lightening properties, and can decrease the production ofsebum; thus, it may be of benet to patients with inflamma-tory skin conditions. 28 A recent open-label, multicenter, prospective cohort study was conducted to assess the clinical utility of oralpharmacologic doses of nicotinamide and zinc in 198 pa-tients with acne vulgaris and/or rosacea. 29The basis for this investigation was a variety of potential mechanisms ofaction of nicotinamide and zinc, including: (1) an sebum production. 30The study's primary efcacy measures were patient global eval-uation and patient evaluation of the percentage reduction in inflammatory lesions after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment;overall patient satisfaction also was recorded. The studyformulation consisted of nicotinamide, 750 mg; zinc, 25mg; copper, 1.5 mg;, and folic acid, 500 /H9262g. After 4 weeks, the number of patients enrolled who re- ported improvement was signicantly greater ( P/H110210.0001) than the number who reported either no change in or wors-ening of their condition. Seventy-nine percent of patientsreported improvement in appearance as moderately better ormuch better, as measured by patient global evaluation. Fifty- ve percent reported moderate (26%-50% reduction in le-sions) or substantial (/H1102250% reduction in lesions) improve-ment after four weeks of treatment (P /H110210.0001). The percentage of patients who responded to therapy continuedto increase through the 8 weeks of treatment. When patientswho received concomitant oral antibiotic therapy (51/198,26%) are compared with those who received vitamin tabletsas monotherapy (147/198, 74%), the percentage of patientswho responded to treatment was not signicantly differentbetween treatment groups (P /H110050.13). This nding was par- ticularly interesting given that most patients studied consid-ered their condition to be of at least moderate severity (143/198, 72%). The conclusion was that niacinamide and zincwere effective for the treatment of acne vulgaris and rosaceawhen used alone or with other therapies and should be con-sidered as useful alternatives or adjuncts. It has recently been shown that topical application of ni- acinamide has a stabilizing effect on epidermal barrier func-tion, seen as a reduction in transepidermal water loss and animprovement in the moisture content of the horny layer. 31 Niacinamide increases protein synthesis (eg, keratin), dinucleotide phosphate levels. Given ndings, it ishypothesized that topical application of niacinamide mayimprove surface structure, reduce rhytides, inhibit photocar-cinogenesis, and demonstrate antiinflammatory effects inacne and/or rosacea. 26,32,33Table 2 Natural Ingredients in the Treatment of Rosacea Product Source Active Component Colloidal oatmeal family and species-specic dried chrysanthemumleaves, is a medicinal herb used traditionally to reduce feverand treat headache, arthritis, and digestive problems. 34,35The perennial flowering plant has citrus-scented leaves and isreminiscent of daisies. It has potent antiinflammatory, anti-oxidant, and and inhibit sero-tonin release from platelets. 36Topical use of feverfew had been limited by the potent irritant effects of parthenolides.However, an industry patented process was developed allow-ing removal of parthenolides. As a result, feverfew PFE(Aveeno; Johnson and Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc,New Brunswick, NJ), a puried feverfew extract, was devel-oped to reduce facial redness and skin irritation by inhibitingthe release of inflammatory markers from activated lympho-cytes and reducing neutrophil chemotaxis. 37-39Feverfew PFE has been shown to possess antioxidative properties by (1) inhibiting proinflammatory mediatorsreleased from (nitric oxide, PGE 2, tumor human blood (tumor necro-sis chemotaxis; (3) NF-kB-dependent and (4) inhibiting IL-8 and adhesion molecules expressed from keratino-cytes. 40-42This puried extract has been studied and has demonstrated protective effects from UV exposure and irri-tation, improvements in facial redness, blotchiness, and tac-tile roughness, and reduction in irritation seen Extract Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra and Glycyrrhiza inflata) plants have been long used in alternative medicine for the treatmentof a variety of inflammatory conditions as the result of theirpresumptive healing powers. Glycyrrhiza glabra contains glabridin, and Glycyrrhiza inflata which anti-irritant anti-inflammatory prop-erties. 45,46Studies have - pears to exert immunomodulatory effects by regulating cyto-kines and interferon and thus, may have antiviral and anti-microbial activity. 48-50 Licorice extract is produced by boiling licorice root and subsequently evaporating the water. The main componentsof the extract include triterpene saponins, flavonoids, andisoflavonoids. 45Licorice superoxide anion produc-tion and cyclooxygenase activity. 46In a the antioxidant activity of Glycyrrhiza to antioxi- dants in commercial researchers 0.5% 1% concentrations.51 The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity of licorice suggests skin care benets in patients with sensitive skin. Inone study, topical preparations (1% and 2%) were evaluatedfor the treatment of atopic dermatitis in a double-blind clin-ical trial in comparison with a base gel. Two percent licoricetopical gel signicantly decreased scores of erythema, edema,and itching over 2 weeks. 52Another study of a skin care regimen containing licochalcone A (Eucerin Redness Relief;Beiersdorf, Inc, Hamburg, Germany), a retrochalcone de-rived from Glycyrrhiza inflata, demonstrated improvements in mean erythema and quality-of-life scores at 4 and 8 weeksin patients with mild-to-moderate facial redness and were comparable in efcacy with topical metronidazole and aze-liac acid. 53In another study, application of a licochalcone A-containing extract twice daily for 3 days was associatedwith signicant reduction in shaving-induced and UV-in-duced erythema compared with vehicle control in healthyvolunteers. 46 Antioxidants/Antiaging Teas White, green, oolong, and black teas are derived from theleaves and buds of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) and phenols, particularly epigallocatechin gallate and epicatechingallate, appear to be most diverse in initiating cellular/molec-ular responses in the epidermis. 57The multiple effects of green tea include inhibition of UV-induced tumorigenesispathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase andactivator protein-1, as well as the inltration of inflammatorycells. In addition, green tea possesses antioxidant propertiesby reactive species cyclooxygenase as well as by inhibitingthe inltration of inflammatory cells, such as macrophagesand of and subse-quent tumorigenesis. Besides the antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties, which make green tea useful in the treatment of rosacea, theprotection it affords from UV light makes it particularly use-ful as rosacea is often triggered by light exposure. Topicalapplications of green tea (epigallocatechin gallate and epicat-echin gallate) have been shown to decrease UV-induced ery-thema and to reduce DNA damage as demonstrated by mea-suring cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. 58-60These studies demonstrate the chemoprotective effect of green tea extractsand suggest a natural alternative for photoprotection andpossibly a treatment for UV-induced rosacea. Green tea mayalso directly improve the signs of rosacea by reducing the152 J. Emer, H. Waldorf, and D. Bersonnumber and appearance of telangiectasias and minimize the disruption of the skin barrier.55 Coffeeberry and Caffeine Extracts of the coffee plant (Coffea arabica) have been shownto exhibit antioxidant activity. It has recently been discoveredthat the fruit of the coffeeberry plant has effective antioxidantactivity. 61Coffeeberry contains potent polyphenol com - pounds, including chlorogenic acid, proanthocyanidins,quinic acid, and ferulic acid. 37These polyphenols help to prevent damage caused by free radical exposure and oxida-tive stress and have been shown to protect against UVA andUVB radiation. 62,63Testing by oxygen radical absorbance ca - pacity demonstrates 10-15 times the antioxidant capacity asgreen tea extract, pomegranate, vitamin C, and vitamin E. 64 Although no conclusive clinical studies assessing topicalpreparations containing Coffea arabica or coffeeberry extract have been performed, preliminary evidence suggests that thisextract produces improvement in hyperpigmentation, nelines, and overall skin appearance. 37,65The Coffea arabica plant is regarded as safe.66Current preparations represent a well-tolerated choice for rosacea patients who desire an an-tiaging regimen. Anecdotally, many of these patients experi-ence a reduction in facial erythema. Caffeine extracted from the leaves of the Coffea arabica plant has been used in some botanic formulations as an activeingredient. 67Caffeine is known to cause dehydration of fat cells by acting directly to promote lipolysis, inhibit phospho-diesterase, and thus augment cyclic adenosine monophos-phate. These characteristics plus its stimulatory effect on cu-taneous microcirculation have been used to support topicalcaffeine as a treatment for lower eyelid pufness and cellu-lite. 68,69Of note, although oral consumption of caffeine had previously been regarded as a risk factor for rosacea activ-ity, a recent study demonstrated only photosensitive skintypes, a positive family history of rosacea, or previoussmoking status as risk factors compared with healthy con-trol patients. 70Reports of dermatitis and/or allergic reac - tions to caffeine in the literature are more likely because ofvolatile oils found in the coffee grains or added preserva-tives and fragrances in the topical preparations rather thanfrom the caffeine itself. 71 Other Botanicals Aloe Vera Aloe vera is thought to have antiinflammatory, analgesic, an-tipruritic, and wound-healing properties. 72,73Its active com - ponents include acid been studied with success in the treat - ment of psoriasis and case reports have noted a reduction inburning, itching, and scarring associated with radiation der-matitis. 74-76One study on burn-wound signicant decreases and postcapillary vascu-lar permeability on the aloe vera-treated group, suggesting arole in inflammatory skin conditions, such as rosacea. 77 Chamomile Chamomile (Matricaria recutita and (apigenin, volatile oils that inhibit cyclooxygenase and li-poxygenase as well as regulate the T helper cell (Th2) activa-tion and histamine release. 78,79Topical applications have been be benecial in atopic dermatitis and skinirritation. 80One study documented the anti-inflammatory effect of topical application to be approximately 60% of thatproduced by hydrocortisone 0.25%. 81Chamomile can po - tentially induce allergic contact dermatitis because it is amember of the ragweed family; therefore, caution is war-ranted with use on sensitive skin even though it is thought tohave soothing effects. Tumeric Tumeric (Curcuma longa) has a long-standing history of usein Asian cuisine and is best known for its active componentcurcumin which is reported to have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, wound healing, and chemopreventive proper-ties. 44,82Odor and color limit its incorporation into many topical treatments. Mushroom Extracts from mushrooms, such as shiitake (Lentinula edodes) and interest for their potent anti-inflammatoryand antioxidant properties. 83,84Main mechanisms of action include peroxidation, superoxide dis-mutase, metalloproteinases, and proinflammatory cytokines(IL-8), well as the promotion of free radical scavenging. 85It is also thought that shiitake mushroom complexes inhibitelastase and activator protein-1, which breaks down colla-gen, forming the basis for its use in antiaging treatments. 86 Overconsumption of shiitake mushroom has been docu-mented to cause flagellate dermatitis. 87 Expert Opinion and Pearls As we have learned more about the pathogenic factors con-tributing to this complex condition, it is clear that inflamma-tion, inflammatory mediators, and subsequent oxidativedamage play a role. The use of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant ingredients, such as those found in botanic products,provide helpful adjuncts to traditional therapies. We oftenchoose products that contain soy, niacinamide, green tea, orfeverfew for improving erythema. These products seem tocalm the inflammation of rosacea by providing barrier pro-tection and exerting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory ef-fects. When initiating botanic therapy for rosacea, we recom- mend spot testing a small area (such as pre- or postauricular)Botanicals, antiinflammatories, and rosacea 153before full-face use. We then integrate the new topical into the treatment regimen slowly. Patients with rosacea havemore sensitive and reactive skin and even a delicate change intherapy can exacerbate the condition. Furthermore, it is ofthe utmost importance to recommend sunscreens to everypatient. Chemical blockers (i.e., octylcrylene, avobenzone,and oxybenzone) may be irritating and we prefer physicalblocking agents (i.e., titanium dioxide and zinc oxide). Pa-tients should avoid oil-based topical products, topical corti-costeroids, and minimize exposure to hot or spicy foods,alcohol, hot environs, and flush-inducing medications.Lastly, patients should be informed that no topical therapiesare effective for telangiectasias, and those with cosmetic con-cerns can be offered vascular laser or intense pulsed lighttherapy. Conclusions Rosacea patients are increasingly seeking natural alternativesto traditional prescription treatments. Although some naturalproducts show promise, research is limited and further in-vestigation is needed to validate the quality of these ingredi-ents. It is not known whether these products are useful ad-juvants or actual alternatives to commonly prescribedtreatments. It appears that the theoretic value comes fromtheir inherent anti-inflammatory, anti-irritant, and antioxi-dant nature. Dermatologists must be aware of what is avail-able and what their patients are using to better coordinate thelong-term management of chronic inflammatory conditionslike rosacea. References 1.
