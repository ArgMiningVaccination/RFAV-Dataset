So, here's the scoop: we're living in an era where being kind to our planet is all the rage. And guess what? Your friendly neighborhood airport - yep, that's us, Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (AUS) - is totally joining the cool kids' club. We're all about rocking the green scene with some seriously awesome solar panel action. You know airports, right? Non-stop hustle, crazy energy consumption - that's our jam. But hold onto your hats, because we've just dropped a solar bomb on our infrastructure. We've slapped some sleek solar panels on our roofs and parking lots, and let's just say, they're a game-changer. Picture this: sunlight hits those panels, and bam, we've got clean energy in the bag. It's like turning sunshine into power moves. We're talking lights, air conditioning, baggage systems - you name it, the sun's got it covered. And when we're feeling generous, we pump some of that excess energy back into the grid. Yep, we're like the coolest solar-powered party hosts ever! Let's talk numbers. We've got a solar panel playground up on our Blue Garage's top floor - 6,642 panels strutting their stuff, covering an area as big as two football fields. But these panels are more than just a pretty face; they're giving you shaded parking spots while soaking up rays. Talk about style with substance! But wait, there's a whole solar parade happening here. We're not stopping at panels, oh no. We've got electric vehicle charging stations popping up left and right, because green travel is the new black. And our Barbara Jordan Terminal? It's all about that 100% renewable energy vibe, thanks to our buddies at Austin Energy GreenChoice. Hold onto your seats, because we're not done yet. We're on a mission to be carbon-neutral rockstars. Recycling like champs, buying energy from the good guys, and just generally working towards our goal of carbon neutrality. So, next time you're cruising through AUS - whether you're taking off, landing, or just grabbing a coffee - know that you're part of the solar-powered revolution. We're not just an airport; we're your partners in making the world a greener, cooler place, one takeoff at a time. Share "}
