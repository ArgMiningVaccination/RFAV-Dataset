The philosophy of Ayurveda is based on the theory of Panchmahabhutas (five primordial elements), which postulate that all objects and living bodies are composed of five elements viz. Aakasha, Vayu, Agni, Jala and Prithvi. The combinations of these five elements are represented in the form of Tridoshas viz. Vata (Ether + Air), Pitta (Fire) and Kapha (Water + Earth). These three `Doshas' are physiological entities in living beings, whereas Satva, Rajas and Tamas are the mental attributes. The structural entities of the human body are the matrix of Rasa, Rakta, Mamsa, Meda, Asthi, Majja and Shukra. Ayurveda aims to keep these structural and functional entities in a state of equilibrium which signifies good health (Swasthya). Any imbalance due to internal or external factors causes disease, and the treatment consists of restoring the equilibrium through various interventions including therapeutic procedures, regimens, medicines and lifestyle management. 2.2.3. Ayurveda considers the human being as a microcosm (Yatha pinde tatha brahmande) which is a replica of the macrocosm (Universe). The treatment in Ayurveda is holistic and individualised. The preventive aspect of Ayurveda is called Svastha-Vritta and it includes personal hygiene, regular daily routine, appropriate social behaviour and use of Rasayana. The curative aspect consists of three major categories i.e. (i) Aushadhi (drugs) (ii) various therapeutic procedures including Panchakarma and Surgery and (iii) Satvavajaya (Methods for mind control). 2.2.4. The practise of Ayurveda as a system of medicine has been recognized under IMCC Act, 1970. The education of Ayurveda is regulated by a statutory body known as the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM). Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 regulates manufacturing and sale of Ayurvedic drugs. During the Samhita period (1000 BC), Ayurveda developed with eight branches or specialities due to which it is called as Ashtanga Ayurveda. Following are the specialities of clinical medicine in Ayurveda: - i. Kayachikitsa and Shalya Tantra (Toxicology) vii. Rasayana (Immuno-modulation and viii. Vajikarna (Science of fertility and healthy progeny) 2.2.5. The above eight branches have over the years and specifically during the last 50 years expanded into 22 specialities for post-graduate education as follows: i. Ayurveda Siddhanta (Fundamental Principles of Ayurveda) ii. Ayurveda Samhita iii. Rachna Kayachikitsa (Internal Medicine) xi. study for the award of Bachelor, Master and Doctorate degrees in Ayurveda are imparted through various Universities of India. 2.2.6. Three volumes of Ayurvedic Formulary of India (AFI) containing 980 compound formulations and eight volumes of Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API) Part-I containing 600 monographs on single drugs and three volumes of Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API) Part-II containing 152 monographs on compound formulations have been published. 2.3. Homoeopathy 2.3.1. The physicians from the time of Hippocrates (around 400 B.C.) have observed that certain substances could produce symptoms of a disease in healthy people similar to those of people suffering from the disease. Dr. Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician scientifically examined this phenomenon and codified the fundamental principles of Homoeopathy. Homoeopathy was brought into India around 1810 A.D. by European missionaries and received official recognition by a Resolution passed by the Constituent Assembly in 1948 and then by the Parliament. 2.3.2. The first principle of Homoeopathy 'Similia Similibus Curentur', says that a medicine which could induce a set of symptoms in healthy human beings would be capable of curing a similar set of symptoms in human beings actually suffering from the disease. The second principle of 'Single Medicine' says that one medicine should be administered at a time to a particular patient during the treatment. The third principle of 'Minimum Dose' states that the bare minimum dose of a drug which would induce a curative action without any adverse effect should be administered. Homoeopathy is based on the assumption that the causation of a disease mainly depends upon the susceptibility or proneness of an individual to the incidence of the particular disease in addition to the action of external agents like bacteria, viruses etc.20Annual Report 2020-2021 2.3.3. Homoeopathy is a method of treating diseases by administering drugs which have been experimentally proved to possess the power to produce similar symptoms on healthy human beings. Treatment in Homoeopathy, which is holistic in nature, focuses on an individual's response to a specific environment. Homoeopathic medicines are prepared mainly from natural substances, such as plant products, minerals and from animal sources, nosodes, sarcodes etc. Homoeopathic medicines do not have any toxic, poisonous or side effects. Homoeopathic treatment is economical as well and has a very broad public acceptance. 2.3.4. Homoeopathy has its own areas of strength in therapeutics and it is particularly useful in treatment for allergies, autoimmune disorders and viral infections. Many surgical, gynaecological and obstetrical and paediatric conditions and ailments affecting the eyes, nose, ear, teeth, skin, sexual organs, etc. are amenable to homoeopathic treatment. Behavioural disorder, neurological problems and metabolic diseases can also be successfully treated by Homoeopathy. Apart from the curative aspects, Homoeopathic medicines are also used in preventive and promotive healthcare. In recent times, there is an emergence of interest in the use of Homoeopathic medicines in veterinary care, agriculture, dentistry etc. Homoeopathic medical education has developed in seven specialities in Post-graduate teaching, which are Materia Medica, Organon of Medicine, Repertory, Practice of Medicine, Paediatrics, Pharmacy and Psychiatry. 2.4. Naturopathy 2.4.1. Naturopathy is a science of health and healing and a drugless therapy based on well-founded philosophy. It has its own concept of health and disease and principles of treatment. Naturopathy is a system of medicine that advocates harmonious living with constructive principles of Nature on physical, mental, moral and spiritual planes. It has great health promotive and restorative and disease preventive as well as curative potential. 2.4.2. According to Naturopathy the primary cause of disease, barring accidental or surgical injury, is violation of Nature's laws and the effects of violation of Nature's laws are: i. Lowered vitality; ii. Abnormal composition of blood and lymph; and 21 Annual Report 2020-2021 iii. Accumulation of morbid matter in the body. 2.4.3. The science of Naturopathy teaches us that the disease is Nature's effort to eliminate the morbid matter from the body to restore the health. Hence, we must not suppress the outward symptoms of disease like fever, cough, loose motions etc. but cooperate with Nature in the process of eliminating morbid matter from the body. 2.4.4. Some of the basic concepts of Naturopathy are outlined as under: (i) Naturopathy believes in the concept of unity of disease and unity of cure. According to it, the root cause of all diseases is one that is accumulation of morbid matter in the body and the remedy also is one i.e. elimination of those toxins from the body. (ii) Naturopathy considers bacteria and virus to be secondary cause of disease. The primary cause of disease is accumulation of morbid matter in the body. The microbes survive in the body only when a favourable atmosphere for their growth is established by the accumulation of morbid matter. Hence, the basic cause of disease is morbid matter and microbes are only the secondary cause. (iii) Acute diseases are self-healing efforts of the body. Hence, they are taken as our friends, not enemies. Chronic diseases are outcome of wrong treatment and suppression of the acute diseases. (iv) Human body has remarkable recuperative powers when left alone. Nature is the greatest healer. The human body is a self- healing machine. It is endowed with inherent healing power to prevent itself from disease and regain health when fallen ill. (v) In Naturopathy the patient is at the centre of intervention and treatment, cure of disease is effected automatically with the increase in vitality and detoxification of body. (vi) Naturopathy believes in holistic treatment. It not only treats the body as a whole, instead of specific organs, but also takes into account intervention at mental, moral and spiritual planes. (vii) Naturopathy does not use medicines. According to it, \"Food is Medicine\". 22Annual Report 2020-2021Naturopathy accepts prayers also as a modality of treatment. According to Gandhiji \"Rama Nama is the best Natural Treatment\" meaning thereby that prayer according to one's own faith is an important part of treatment. 2.4.5. Some of the important therapies/therapeutic modalities of Naturopathy which are employed not only for curative purposes but also for prevention of diseases and promotion of health are as under- (i) Upvas Chikitsa (Fasting Therapy) (ii) Aahar Chikitsa (Diet Therapy) (iii) Mitti Chikitsa (Mud Therapy) (iv) Jala Chikitsa (Hydrotherapy) Therapy) 2.5. Siddha System 2.5.1. The Siddha System of medicine is one of the ancient systems of medicine in India having its close association with Dravidian culture. The term Siddha means achievements and Siddhars are those who have achieved perfection in medicine. Eighteen Siddhars are said to have contributed towards the systematic development of this system and recorded their experiences in the Tamil language. 2.5.2. The Siddha system of Medicine emphasises on the patient, environment, age, sex, race, habits, mental framework, habitat, diet, appetite, physical condition, the physiological constitution of the diseases for treatment that is individualistic. Diagnosis of diseases is done through examination of pulse, urine, eyes, study of voice, the colour of body, tongue and status of the digestion of individual patients. 2.5.3. The system has a unique treasure for the conversion of metals and minerals as drugs and many infective diseases are treated with the medicines containing specially processed mercury, silver, arsenic, lead and sulphur without any side effects. The strength of the Siddha system lies in providing very effective therapy in the case of psoriasis, rheumatic disorders, chronic liver disorders, benign prostate 23 Annual Report 2020-2021 hypertrophy, bleeding piles, peptic ulcer including various kinds of dermatological disorders of non-psoriatic nature. 2.5.4. Education and Practice of Siddha as a system of medicine has been recognized under IMCC Act, 1970. The education of Siddha is regulated by the statutory body Central Council of Indian Medicine [CCIM]. 2.5.1.5. The manufacturing and sale of Siddha drugs are regulated by the Drug & Cosmetics Act, 1940. 2.5.6. Courses of study for the award of Bachelor, Master and Doctorate degrees in Siddha are imparted through various Universities of India. 2.6. Sowa-Rigpa 2.6.1. Sowa-Rigpa is among the oldest surviving health traditions of the world with a living history of more than 2500 years. Sowa-Rigpa is effective in managing chronic diseases like Asthma, Bronchitis, Arthritis. The basic theory of Sowa-Rigpa is explained in terms of (i) the body and the mind as the locus of treatment; (ii) antidote, i.e. the treatment; (iii) the method of treatment through antidote; (iv) medicines that cure the disease and lastly (v) Pharmacology. Sowa- Rigpa emphasizes the importance of the five cosmological physical elements in the formation of the human body, the nature of disorders and the remedial measures. 2.7. Unani Medicine 2.7.1. The Unani System of Medicine originated in Greece and passed through many countries before establishing itself in India during the medieval period. It is based on well-established knowledge and practices relating to the promotion of positive health and prevention of disease. The fusion of traditional knowledge of ancient civilisations like Egypt, Arabia, Iran, China, Syria and India was in the backdrop of the genesis of this system of medicine. Unani emphasises the use of naturally occurring substances, mostly herbal medicines and also uses some medicines of animal, marine and mineral origin. This system of medicine was documented in Al-Qanoon, medical classics, by Sheikh Bu-Ali Sina (Avicena) (980-1037 AD), in Al-Havi by Razi (850-923 AD) and in many other books written by the Unani physicians. 2.7.2. The Unani system is based on the humoral theory i.e. the presence of blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile in every person. The 24Annual Report 2020-2021 temperament of a person can accordingly be Sanguine, Phlegmatic, Choleric and Melancholic depending on the presence and combination of the Humors. According to Unani theory, the humors and the drugs themselves are assigned temperaments. Any change in quantity and quality of the humors brings about a change in the status of the health of the human body. A proper balance of humors is required in the maintenance of health. 2.7.3. The treatment consists of four components, namely, Preventive, Promotive, Curative and Rehabilitative. Unani System of medicine is efficacious in many conditions, particularly chronic and degenerative disorders e.g. Rheumatoid Arthritis, Hepatitis, Filariasis, Eczema, Sinusitis, Bronchial Asthma etc. 2.7.4. For the prevention of disease and promotion of health, the Unani system emphasises on six essential pre-requisites of life (Asbab-e-Sitta Zarooria) - (i) Pure air (ii) Food and Beverages (iii) Physical movement and Rest (iv) Psychic movement and Rest (v) Sleep and Wakefulness and (vi) Retention of useful materials and Evacuation of waste materials from the body. 2.7.5. There are four forms of treatment in Unani medicine - (i) Regimenal therapy [Ilaj [Ilaj bil Yad]. Regimenal therapy (Ilaj-bit-Tadbir) is a speciality under which various methods of treatment are used for treating specific and complicated diseases. 2.7.6. Education and Practice of Unani as a system of medicine has been recognized under IMCC Act, 1970. The education of Unani is regulated by a statutory body known as the Central Council of Indian Medicine [CCIM]. The manufacturing and sale of Unani drugs are regulated by Drug & Cosmetics Act, 1940. 2.7.7. During the last 50 years, 10 Post Graduate specialities have been developed in (i) Kulliyat (Fundamental of Unani System of Medicine), (ii) (viii) Jarahiyat (Surgery), (ix) Formulary of Unani Medicine (NFUM) containing 1228 compound formulations and six volumes of Unani Pharmacopoeia of India (UPI) containing 298 monographs on single drugs have been published.

The temperament of a person can accordingly be Sanguine, Phlegmatic, Choleric and Melancholic depending on the presence and combination of the Humors. According to Unani theory, the humors and the drugs themselves are assigned temperaments. Any change in quantity and quality of the humors brings about a change in the status of the health of the human body. A proper balance of humors is required in the maintenance of health. 9.4.7.3.The treatment consists of four components, namely, Preventive, Promotive, Curative and Rehabilitative.
