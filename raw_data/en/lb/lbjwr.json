These customizable programs are meant to deliver nourishment, movement, calm and a soothing escape for busy professionals. \"People need time away from devices, communication and the stress that comes with today's constant connections,\" says Patricia Galas, director of marketing and communications. \"We encourage digital detoxification to help individuals disconnect. We've positioned the spa as a peaceful haven; many guests need that kind of support.\" Signature Services The Spa is known for its customized Mandarin Oriental Signature Spa Therapies (120 min./$340 Mon.-Thu., $400 Fri.-Sun.), which were developed by master aromatherapists and experts in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Each TCM-certified therapist consults with the client to determine what chi blockages they may have, and recommends the appropriate meridien- based massage paired with aromatherapy oils to restore their body's balance. Afterward, guests are provided with nutritional and movement advice to implement at home. -by Sheryll Alexander "}
