Our physical medicine and rehabilitation professionals play a key role by helping children with a number of conditions, such as: - Autism spectrum disorders \u2014 A range of developmental disorders that can cause challenges with behavior, communication and social skills. [Brain tumor](/services/care-specialties-departments/cancer-blood-disorders/conditions-and-services/cancer-services/brain-and-spinal-cord-tumor-program/)\u2014 An abnormal growth on the brain, which can cause issues with motor control and speech. [Cancer](/services/care-specialties-departments/cancer-blood-disorders/conditions-and-services/cancer-services/)\u2014 A serious disease caused by abnormal cells that can spread to one or many parts of the body. [Chronic pain](/services/care-specialties-departments/pain-program/)\u2014 Pain that can last weeks, months or years. The cause can be an injury or illness, or the cause can be unknown.

[Concussion](/services/care-specialties-departments/concussion-program/)\u2014 An injury to the brain that disrupts normal brain function.

[Feeding and swallowing problems](/services/care-specialties-departments/feeding-clinic/)\u2014 When a child has difficulty swallowing, he or she may be unable to easily pass food and liquids into the throat, down the esophagus and into the stomach.

Working together, we can help your child make the most of his or her abilities. We start out with complete, up-to-date services Children's Minnesota is well recognized for its expertise in physical medicine and rehabilitation services for kids. Our [physiatrist](/services/care-specialties-departments/physical-rehabilitation/conditions-and-services/physiatry/), [physical therapists](/services/care-specialties-departments/physical-rehabilitation/physical-therapy/), [occupational therapists](/services/care-specialties-departments/physical-rehabilitation/occupational-therapy/), [audiologists](/services/care-specialties-departments/ear-nose-throat-ent-facial-plastic-surgery/conditions-and-services/audiology/) and [speech-language pathologists](/services/care-specialties-departments/physical-rehabilitation/conditions-and-services/speech-language-pathology/) work with children both in the hospital and in outpatient clinics. Here are just a few examples of how we make a difference: - Relaxing paws. Kids are crazy about our four-legged therapy assistants. Pets Assisting With Healing is a volunteer program in which dogs and their owners go through special training. The trained dogs may then take part in therapy sessions, giving kids a fun way to practice their skills. Who uses it: Occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech-language pathologists - Splish, splash! Kids love to hang out in the pool. Aquatic therapy, available in Minneapolis and St. Paul, uses a pool for rehab. The pool in St. Paul has advanced features, including adjustable floor depth and jets, a treadmill in the water and underwater cameras with a live video display. Who uses it: Physical and occupational therapists - Growing stronger. Don't let the name put you off: Constraint-induced movement therapy is actually a gentle treatment that helps kids who are weak on one side of the body due to a stroke, cerebral palsy or another condition. The stronger arm is put in a cast for a few weeks, while the child builds strength in the weaker arm. Research at Children's Minnesota has shown that it works. Who uses it: Physical and occupational therapists - Message received. Kids want to communicate well and learn easily at school, and we're here to help. For example, Fast ForWord is a cutting edge online language and reading program that targets the building blocks of phonics, spoken language, memory, attention and listening accuracy. Strengthening these basic skills results in a wide range of improved language and reading skills. And, most importantly, the gains kids achieve are lasting, the result of positive changes in their processing skills and learning capacity. Who uses it: Speech-language pathologists - Making strides. We help kids improve their walking, one step at a time. Serial casting uses a series of below-the-knee casts to gradually improve ankle flexibility. This promotes more normal walking in kids who walk on the balls of their feet rather than putting their whole feet down. It's also helpful for some children with cerebral palsy, lower leg injuries or nerve damage in their legs. Who uses it: Physical therapists - Ear push-ups. We help kids flex their hearing muscles. Therapeutic listening is a program that uses music and sounds to exercise the muscles and nerves of the ears. It also stimulates areas of the brain used for processing sounds. By helping the brain develop, it can improve not only listening, but also communication and movement. Who uses it: Occupational therapists - Down the hatch! We've got the inside story on swallowing disorders. [Videofluoroscopic swallow study](/services/care-specialties-departments/physical-rehabilitation/videofluoroscopic-swallow-studies/)is a video X-ray that's taken while a child is eating or drinking. It can detect aspiration \u2014 a swallowing problem in which food goes down the wrong pipe. Who uses it: Occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists - Easy-to-swallow treatment. [VitalStim Therapy](/services/care-specialties-departments/physical-rehabilitation/vitalstim-therapy/)is the only FDA-cleared device for treating swallowing problems. Electrodes are placed on a child's neck. Then the device emits a small amount of electrical current, which stimulates the muscles used for swallowing. Who uses it: Occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists Search over 1,100 members of Children's Minnesota clinical staff. Our directory includes physicians, dentists, oral surgeons, advanced practice registered nurses, psychologists, podiatrists, physician assistants, pharmacists, genetic counselors, and social workers.
