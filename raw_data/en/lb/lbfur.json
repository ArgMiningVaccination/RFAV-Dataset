According to the American Chiropractic Association, chiropractic \"focuses on disorders of the musculoskeletal system and the nervous system, and the effects of these disorders on general health.\" Chiropractic services are used to treat a variety of complaints including neck and back pain, muscle aches, headaches, and joint pain. A chiropractic adjustment is known by several names: chiropractic manipulation, manual manipulation or spinal manipulation. But regardless of the name, this therapy is treatment for pain that originates from misalignment in the spine. In chiropractic care, Dr. Z applies manipulation to the vertebrae that are not functioning normally or that have irregular movement patterns. The goal of this chiropractic treatment is to reduce subluxation and thereby increase range of motion, decrease nerve irritation and improve function. In addition to adjustments, Dr. Z and our team at AlignRight Chiropractic offer related types of services in order to help patients overcome pain and discomfort and maintain their best possible level of health. These services include massage therapy, rehabilitation, lifestyle advice, and more. Benefits of Chiropractic Treatment Almost everyone can benefit from chiropractic care. Our chiropractor in Richardson can be helpful to infants as well as people living into their 90s and beyond. Chiropractic care offers a number of ways to adjust the spine, so whether the patient is a child, adult, or senior, they can be adjusted in a manner that is safe and effective. In addition to relieving the symptoms named above, restoring and maintaining spinal alignment has other benefits, including: - Unimpeded communication between mind and body - Better flexibility, immunity, and strength - Quicker healing when damage occurs - Reduced risk of serious health issues like nerve damage Types of Chiropractic Care After your assessment, Dr. Z will create a treatment plan that has your specific needs and goals in mind. Although there are many problems chiropractic care can address, the most common ones consist of back pain, neck pain, headaches, and numbness and tingling, which are explained in greater detail below. Back Pain Whether you've had low back pain for years or you've suffered a recent injury from a long day of yardwork, low back pain can be debilitating. Whether you require a spinal adjustment, rehabilitation work, or massage therapy, Dr. Z can provide a customized treatment plan that alleviates your pain and restores function. Neck Pain With handheld technology and working long hours at a computer desk becoming more prevalent, we are seeing a serious increase in patients who suffer from chronic neck pain. Poor posture for prolonged periods of time can lead to misalignment and aggravation in the spine and therefore pain. Fortunately, Dr. Z can treat neck pain by guiding the spine back into proper alignment as well as teach healthy habits, stretches, and exercises to promotes better posture. Headaches A headache every now and then usually isn't too much of a problem, but did you know that as many as 9 out of 10 people experience headaches on a regular basis? Depending on their frequency and severity, headaches can interfere with your quality of life and even your ability to function. You don't have to solely rely on aspirin and resting in dark rooms for relief. Dr. Z can ease the muscular tension in the neck, which reduces pressure on the cervical spine. As a result, you may have headaches or migraines less often or at a more manageable level to carry on with your day. Numbness and Tingling These sensations may not necessarily be painful, but they aren't exactly pleasant or a good sign. If you experience numbness or tingling, you need to come see us for treatment. These symptoms often indicate that a nerve's messages to the brain are being blocked. As an expert in the nervous system, Dr. Z can identify where the blockage is and open communication back up, restoring feeling. "}
