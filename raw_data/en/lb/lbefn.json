Vaccination is one of the ways that we can help protect your pet family members. Some vaccines are considered \"core\" vaccines. Core vaccines are recommended for all of our patients (including indoor-only pets) because they protect against diseases that are prevalent in our area or are associated with very high risk should a patient become infected. For all vaccinations (including boosters) given at our hospital, our veterinarians will perform a wellness exam on your pet prior to administering any vaccinations. This examination allows us to make sure your pet is healthy enough to be vaccinated and to identify any additional medical concerns that may be present. Our veterinarians will also discuss deworming and other parasite preventatives depending on the season, they will make any appropriate nutritional or dental recommendations, and they will address any specific concerns you may have regarding your pet family member's health, in addition to also administering the vaccine. Core Vaccinations for Dogs: DA2PP and Rabies DA2PP is a combination vaccine that protects against canine Distemper virus, Adenovirus-2, Parainfluenza and Parvovirus. The number of vaccinations given for the initial series depends on the age of the patient and previous vaccine status. Our veterinarians will discuss the vaccination schedule for your pet based on their individual history. In general, puppies should be vaccinated at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age for DA2PP. Following the initial vaccine series, dogs will then have the DA2PP vaccine boostered one year later and then eventually will be transitioned onto a 3 year vaccine schedule. Rabies vaccination is administered as a single injection and is boostered one year after the initial vaccination. Following the one year booster (provided it was completed within the advised time frame), we then transition our patients onto a 3 year Rabies vaccination schedule. Puppies are generally vaccinated for Rabies between 12 and 16 weeks of age. Core Vaccinations for Cats: FRCP and Rabies FRCP is a combination vaccine that protects against Feline Rhinotracheitis, Calici virus and Panleukopenia. The number of vaccinations given for the initial series depends on the age of the patient and previous vaccine status. Our veterinarians will discuss the vaccination schedule for your pet based on their individual history. In general, kittens should be vaccinated at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age for FRCP. Following the initial vaccine series, cats will then have the FRCP vaccine boostered one year later and then eventually will be transitioned onto a 3 year vaccine schedule. Rabies vaccination is administered as a single injection and is boostered one year after the initial vaccination. Following the one year booster (provided it was completed within the advised time frame), we then transition our patients onto a 3 year Rabies vaccination schedule. Kittens are generally vaccinated for Rabies between 12 and 16 weeks of age. There are additional vaccines that our veterinarians may recommend depending on whether or not your pet does go outside frequently, if they have high levels of contact with multiple other animals, or if they are travelling outside of Saskatchewan. Additional Dog Vaccinations: Bordetella and Lyme Bordetella bronchiseptica (Kennel Cough): This vaccine protects against one type of upper respiratory infection and is recommended for all dogs that have contact with other dogs. This includes going to the dog park, doggy daycare, going to the groomer's, a boarding facility, sporting or agility events, or if they are highly social with other dogs out on walks! After the initial vaccination series this vaccine is given annually. Lyme Vaccine (Borrelia burgdorferi): This spirochete is what causes Lyme disease in humans and animals. It is transmitted by infected ticks, frequently of the Ixodes spp. (black-legged species). This vaccine is recommended for dogs traveling to endemic areas with high numbers of black-legged ticks such as B.C, Manitoba, several eastern provinces and the U.S. Although the risk is lower in Saskatchewan, we know that black-legged tick populations are starting to migrate into our province. This vaccine is also appropriate for dogs in Saskatchewan depending on the patient's individual risk or owner preference. All dogs being vaccinated for the first time need to have a blood test to confirm that they are currently seronegative (we can perform this blood test in our hospital). If negative, they are then given the first vaccination. A second booster vaccination is then needed 3 weeks after the initial one. Vaccination and testing are then performed annually. All dogs receiving the Lyme vaccine should also be on a tick preventative medication. Additional Cat Vaccinations: Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLeuk) FeLeuk vaccination is recommended for all cats that go outside routinely. This virus is transmitted through saliva and body excretions and causes immunosuppression which can then predispose them to other diseases and cancers. It is recommended that prior to the initial vaccination the patient be tested to make sure they do not already have the virus (this blood test is performed in our hospital). If negative, the initial vaccine is administered with a booster given 3-4 weeks later. Vaccination is then performed annually. "}
