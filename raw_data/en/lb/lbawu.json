When I went on it around two years ago, I thought it was just the right med for me. Now I've started to struggle. My short term memory has gotten so bad, it's cost me two jobs. I'm always so dizzy, I feel as if I've had four or five beers. I've gone from the local Tabasco Kid to a diet so bland it would bore a baby. Go ahead and add in absentmindedness and clumsiness. Top it off with some plain old profound disorientation and major depression. In four or so months I'm a mess where I was a model. My new neuro just wanted to throw some Dilantin back in the med mix. (I'll die before that happens!) Help me out here folks. Anyone had Lamictal go sour on them? Or was it last years' brain surgery taking me for a roller-coaster ride? It's been a long time gone for me. I hope my Family of Buddies are all doing well. I'm happy to be back. Peace- marko Comments I've been on Lamictal for 8 Submitted by omg.donna on Wed, 2018-03-14 - 13:56 I've been on Lamictal for 8 years (no seizure since) and have just recently changed to Keppra due to side effects. I suffered severe acne and my memory is getting low. I've used Lamictal for 13 Submitted by Rob Lamb on Fri, 2018-08-24 - 19:52 I've used Lamictal for 13 years - for 12 years I thought about suicide and taking my own life every hour of every day - I planned how I'd do it, made lists of the music I wanted played at my funeral, pondered different ways, gassing myself in the car (use a vacuum cleaner hose) crashing my motorcycle into a tree, over a cliff, into an oncoming car. many times I would sit there with 120 codeine tablets in my hand and just think who would I hurt, who would even care, what I could do with my cat and dog - and on and on - in 2013 a friend died so I attempted suicide in the local park where we used to feed the ducks. I ate 100 codeine tablets and filmed my self as I went over. People found me and called an ambulance. The ambulance people had already picked me up off the footpath after 2 seizures so assumed this was another seizure. Later I told them what I had done and I was sent to the local psychiatric hospital for 'evaluation - they said - youre exhausted (I had just started my own business) and take a holiday. 21/2 years later I closed the business and moved to my home town. I went to , avery cool, doctor who told me - this Lamotrigine is bad! it causes suicidal thoughts and I see from your records youve attempted suicide' we changed my drug to Levetricatm - sorry cant spell it, but its a new drug. I had a huge 'rebound' seizure, fell backwards and crushed my sacrum - tailbone. It still hurts now - lots of nerve damage and I'll never sit properly for the rest of my life. I just add it to all the other injuries my epileprosy has given me! . .amputated right leg from a seizure on my motorcycle in 1981, crushed fingers, cheekbones, missing teeth - on and on it goes.. anyway, I went back on the Lamictal and am still on it now. Ive found since I know its not ME having the suicaidal thoughts - its the drug - I've been OK. I'm 59 this saturday and have had epileprosy since I was 10 years old. Its totally ruined my life - relationships, jobs, friendships - and on it goes. My father was an abusive brute of a man who beat/humiliated/scorned me and so much more from the age of 3 years. Lovely man - - and I became epileptic. Thanks Dad. So - if you have epilepsy be careful of this drug, Lamotrigine. Its evil shit. The ONLY thing thats helped me for 49 years is cannabis. Without pot I'd be dead 100 times over. So Mother Nature has kept me alive.And I reccomend it whole heartedly to others with this evil affliction. So sorry to hear your sad Submitted by Siobhain2 on Fri, 2019-02-22 - 12:21 So sorry to hear your sad story Rob. I've been on Lamictal for 10 years now. I thought the depression was a totally separate issue. The suicidal thoughts creep up on me suddenly. I could be okay one day and then the next be planning a funeral that wouldn't cost my kids too much. Question: Does the cannabis not cause depression too? I've no objection to smoking it, but am sick of being so miserable. Think the anti-depressants are causing weight gain which does not help matters. Thanks for your comments. Doesn't do much for you, but has helped me just to write this to you. Like some of the people on here who suffer the side effects of Lamictal, I'm so afraid of sounding like a total idiot when I try to talk anyone.. (The way I lose my ability to remember words that I know perfectly well lends itself to isolating myself). ..... All of this adds up to SH*T life. It's been a while since you've written this, so prob won't even see this post. If you're anything like me you'll have forgotten which site was. If you do see it, my name is Gemma Broughton and I'm on fb...so if you're on that too I'd love to hear an update from you. I live in Ireland. I've been tested for memory Submitted by OTBfever on Fri, 2019-01-11 - 10:10 I've been tested for memory and cognitive mpairment and everything came back negative. My memory was so bad my boss pulled me into her office and talked of her concern regarding my forgetfulness which I secretly noticed. I made an appointment with my doctor because I was on lamictal for 15 years and wanted to ask if that could be the culprit. She said lamictal doesn't cause short term memory loss and did a cognitive test and failed with mild results. She then referred me to a nuroligist hence all the testing. My job is at risk and I'm on leave until I can get a diagnosis. I still believe the lamictal has something to do with my impairment and will go through the motions until everything is exhausted. Lots of love to all you Submitted by Pat campbell on Tue, 2019-02-05 - 23:56 Lots of love to all you sufferers out there. I have also had some ups and downs and self-doubt and relationship issues... I can't spell now and I was a high school English teacher... How is that for a joke. Sometimes I can add up but when I can't I know it's from a night time episode and then it comes right again. Nuro says stay away from any form of pot as it causes irreversible memory damage but at least it stops anxiety which triggers the Seizures anyway. I was very angry at myself and felt useless. Hang in there peeps and most of all, be kind to yourselves xxx I read somewhere that Submitted by Shirleyxxx on Mon, 2017-05-08 - 15:24 I read somewhere that Lamotrigine (lamictal) can actually cause brain damage. I have trouble with my balance, strange headaches, odd sensations and light headedness, dizziness and even seizures. I told my Neuro what was happening and he prescribed a HIGHER dose of lamotrigine, sent me for an EEG which picked up the seizures but apparently they were not epileptic. This I don't understand. I was only put on medication because the first EEG picked up temporal lobe epilepsy. They want to brush it off.. probaly because they know something I don't. Oh my gosh thank you so much Submitted by emonaco1113 on Fri, 2019-03-01 - 17:36 Oh my gosh thank you so much for posting this. I know it's old but I have developed insomnia, panic attacks, severe anxiety.. to the point where I am afraid to be alone and have to call into work because I'm so exhausted and anxious of seizures. I was paranoid i was going crazy, hopefully they switch me at my appointment monday. I've been on this for 7 years! When I first started Submitted by sjeinteriors@yahoo.com on Tue, 2018-12-04 - 23:14 When I first started lamotrigine I felt just as you do now, and I hope you stay that way. I've been on this stuff for about 4yrs now and I can't even explain how far I've fallen mentally. I excelled in math and in advanced A&P. I was actually waiting to get into veterinary school. Within a year my brain, eyesight, and coordination were and still are a joke. I want off this medication so badly. There are days that I literally can't divide by 2, my mind goes completely blank. I find it so difficult to have intelligent conversations I don't even try anymore. I feel like an idiot constantly. Some days are better than others, but for the most part I don't have a brain any longer. It weighs on me heavily... Same. Goodness gracious. How Submitted by Stacy Marie on Mon, 2018-03-26 - 17:27 Same. Goodness gracious. How is this stuff on the market? I went from getting into law school to barely being able to function. I'm 33 and feel 103! I'm so sorry. I totally understand. I thought I had MS because the symptoms were so similar. My doctors did not think my Submitted by lilibelle on Mon, 2017-01-30 - 17:27 My doctors did not think my symptoms were related to Lamictal and I was on 14 months of Lamictal hell. I've been off for seven months. My balance was so bad that I had to use a walker. My phone was 13 alarms so I remember to eat, bathe, take my meds and take my dog outside. I have to think hard to remember my granddaughter s name I frequently forget we're I'm going or easily get lost. I am addicted to solitaire. I am impulsive and shop too much. I say things to people that shouId never come out of my mouth. I think the Lamictal toxicity killed several brain cells and I will always be this way I've been on Lamictal (125 Submitted by Mallen on Sun, 2017-11-12 - 17:12 I've been on Lamictal (125 mg twice a day) for 5? years. While the side effects can't compare to what I experienced on Depakote they are still more than just annoying. But I have been on various seizure medications for 18 years and have lost track of what are side effects of the meds and what are seizure related. I have no words of wisdom. I don't have the Tonic/Clonic seizures anymore but continue to what I euphemistically call Left Temporal Lobe Issues. Memory, dizziness, lack of appetite, lack of concentration, depression....there are days when I wonder if taking the meds is worth it...when I ask the Neuro for a complete cure? He refers me to a therapist... I agree with everyone's Submitted by dspiller2001@yahoo.com on Thu, 2015-01-29 - 12:09 I agree with everyone's comments, I have loss of memory especially short term. Even typing this reply was difficult, I had to retype several word because I either typed the wrong word or totally misspelled. Another condition I am experiencing is hands and feet always freezing. I have also realized lose of coordination causing me stumble and fall down stairs and had to stop playing hockey because my decision making ability is so bad. I refuse to have it stop my from living as normal of a life as possible. One thing that has helped is smoking marijuana. Hi! I have been on Lamictal Submitted by ambercsmith on Wed, 2017-12-27 - 15:58 Hi! I have been on Lamictal since July - recently, since November, I have been having side effects that keep getting worse - once I decreased my dosage to 100mg 2x a day, they got a little better - but I insist on going off of the medication - my pharmacist and family doctor advised me how to slowly get off of it, but of course my neurologist won't allow it. I have been approaching a ketogenic diet, and am pursuing some herbal routes as well! I want this stuff out of my system too. My neurologist thinks I am crazy because I didn't initially have any skin reactions, and now I do, but also the entire time since July I have felt drunk, clumsier than usual ( I used to run 5 miles a day and now I just walk because I have no energy and fall) and I can't remember things. My husband and I own a business and it is really affecting my ability to do anything. How are the herbs and such working for you now? I would love to hear how you are doing! I totally understand what Submitted by Anonymous on Sun, 2015-02-01 - 14:26 I totally understand what your are saying about your spouse saying that your are insane. The only thing I hope you realize is how hard is it on him and others to help you deal with something they have no control over. I thank my wife often for having the patience to deal with me and probably the hardest thing she faces is worrying that i'm not laying on the ground having a seizure. I can't stop living and doing things without always having someone watch over me. I hope you can find a way to enjoy the family you have around you and keep looking for answers and not accepting that you have a life to enjoy.

I started taking Lamictal in July and I am starting to slowly get myself off of it as of today. I can not take it anymore! My skin has not fallen off and I have not had organ failure yet, but any other symptom I have already had. Right now my neck skin is burning and I feel drunk as I type this. This is not me. I have always been very healthy. My neurologist said I can not get off of it, apparently me calling the hospital late at night 2 times already doesn't seem to be a red flag to him.

I just found this site and Submitted by Trystanmad on Wed, 2017-10-11 - 20:40 I just found this site and read your post. This is exactly what has been happening to me lately. I thought it was me. When I started feeling little dizzy spells or anything my neuro upped my dose. I take 200mg twice a day. I have all of the weird symptoms you do with extreme ringing in my ears and pressure in my ears and head sometimes. Have you had any answers since posting this? I'm calling my doctor tomorrow to see what his thoughts are. Please check your packets for Submitted by NZchick on Fri, 2018-07-13 - 08:01 Please check your packets for dosage. If you have been given a different packet from normal, and the chemist says now you only need to take one pill twice a day, not 2 smaller pills twice a day, it could be WRONG. Check the dosage on the packet. If your old 25mg per pill packet means 50mgs twice a day, that means you are on 100mgs. The new packet said 100mgs when I checked it, per pill, and the chemist had it wrong. Thus, I took 200mgs today instead of 100. For a potentially extremely dangerous drug, this is pretty lax of the chemist, and will go and tell him he gave me the wrong information and I believed and trusted him. I felt very weird this morning, because I took 100mgs in one go, and my brain was foggy. Otherwise, I felt fine, but was pretty slow, mentally, compared to normal. always check your dosage on the packet. I now have to halve the big pills to have half a one a day.

Ohio recently became a medical marijuana state. I told all of my docs I was going to see a \"pot\" doctor. None objected, but all were afraid to say too much about their feelings. The doc I saw explained terpenes, and which terpenes to look for for my epilepsy, anxiety, and tremors. I have tried various strains and find that the strains with pinene eliminate my tremors and anxiety. The effect was nearly instantaneous. I use a vaporizer so there is no combustion and no odor. There are strains that contain very little THC (<1%) and still contain the terpenes. This is not for everyone. I just wanted to tell my experience.p.s. Street pot is bred for THC, not terpenes. Only certain strains contain the medicinal compounds. I've been taking 200mg of Submitted by Danielle222 on Tue, 2018-03-27 - 11:08 I've been taking 200mg of lamictal/lamotrigine for 9 years for bipolar and recently needed to increase to 250mg because depression slowly creeped up in me (likely due to hormonal changes because I'm 34 years old). For 2 years prior to lamictal I'd tried at least 12 other medications that did NOT help. I was always on the brink of suicide. I take 50mg at noon because it gives me energy and 200mg later in the day. I was scared if I took the entire 250mg at the same time then I'd be more susceptible to getting \"the rash\". After 10 years of experience with lamictal/lamotrigine, there's one odd thing that I know for certain... Not all generics are made the same and therefore, not all of them will FEEL the same. The ONLY one that gives me life, turns on the light in my brain, and allows me to function 100% as myself is lamotrigine manufactured by TARO. I told my doctor & pharmacist that I don't care what they say, it's definitely different. One generic made me so dizzy I couldn't concentrate. One generic practically put me to sleep. It was crazy! I think people have different experiences with this drug because it's difference depending on the manufacturer. I've checked the internet and found other people have had similar experiences. Good luck & you know your body better than anyone so always speak up. :) Where do you start, and how Submitted by Bosco on Fri, 2017-04-07 - 18:38 Where do you start, and how do you prove it was the drug that caused the symptoms Where and how could we start Submitted by Bosco on Fri, 2017-04-07 - 18:38 Where and how could we start a class action, if your given a list of side effects , what could we gain, I've come off mine. I can't even get my doctor to admit it could be the meds that caused me so much trouble, I'm still trying to find out if there is permanent damage. Gosh it's like I'm looking in Submitted by RobinIguess on Fri, 2017-09-08 - 10:36 Gosh it's like I'm looking in a mirror. I'm not a doctor but I can tell you it's not your fault. If you're not sure or don't believe me,after my suggested answer I have a bit of a long story/history/explanation of how I came to my conclusion. My husband and I are pretty sure we figured out the problem on our own about 3 weeks ago so I'm still having symptoms but they are starting to get milder.After about 4 or 5 years of some what decent seizure control I started having those same symptoms. Like you the Dr. kept upping my dose and it wasn't doing anything at all but maybe making things worse. For some reason the lamictal seems to do it's job for years and then things start back up again so the doc thinks you just need to up the meds. (from my experience and what I'm hearing everyone else saying.). And after a while things were going o.k. but then one day you feel kinda weird and just figure \"hay maybe I'm just tired or having a bad day.\" but very slowly seizures start happening once in a while but not as bad and the doc keeps upping it. As your are slowly getting weird feelings that you figure are just your fault. And the side effects get worse You're having a hard time keeping your eyes still or focusing on things you're looking at. You start twitching a bit and one day you suddenly realize you can't focus because the room is spinning. From then on all your muscles are tightened and you feel like you have no control over anything. (kinda like when you get out of the shower or the clenching feeling people get when they are cold.) Those are symptoms of overdose. You probably need to go back to the dose that you were on when things were best, and then that dose would have been the time to stop and add another med, or maybe just ask your Dr. It's time to try something new all together. I can tell you how I figured it out if you like. As I said it's kind of a long story It's only been about 2 weeks since my first weening down of the med so things are getting better slowly and right now my biceps are starting to hurt from concentrating on what I'm looking at and trying to type at the same time for this long. You can write me back if you want to. Or when I'm feeling better I'll come back and tell you my insane story of the battle of the last 5-6 years.

I seen 4 speciality doctors, nobody ever thought it could be lamictol , my sister suggested I ween off ,i feel so much better Over most of my life I've Submitted by Anonymous on Thu, 2015-01-08 - 23:30 Over most of my life I've dealt with several medical problems - SLE, glomerulonephritis & seizures (no causes found). I'm 54 and still having seizures. I've been taking lamictal over the last 2+ years, positive reactions either. My current neurologist, referring to my list of prescriptions asked, \"You've taken ALL of these?\" I've personally reduced the amount of my current prescription, Lamictal, from 500mg/day to 275mg/day against the guidance of my neurologists, without any difference to the seizure occurrence or my general health, except that I'm now dealing with memory loss. I often repeat myself (You already told me that!), ask questions regarding something I was told only minutes ago (I just said that!), say the wrong words (Make your bell. Bed?), go blank on the proper term to use (I made pasta for ...what do you call it? Dinner) & forget names (You've known Kayla for years!). I forget what I was supposed to do. Printed computer pages sit on my desk for weeks at a time. I often tell people that my brain doesn't work good, (Work right!) & get corrected. My 13 year old doesn't understand what it is I have to deal with. She just thinks I'm stupid (I feel stupid & often concur just to avoid an argument.) My husband thinks I'm insane & makes me see a psychiatrist. Watching Alzheimer's eat away my dad over the last 10+ years is depressing & terrifying. Is my lack of memory due to family connection or long-term medical effects/prescriptions? Many just tell me that it's my age. I've been on Lamictal for 9 Submitted by Marie Morgan on Sun, 2017-10-22 - 13:58 I've been on Lamictal for 9 years I just started noticing side effects I've been having here lately like Tremors upset stomach runny nose sore throat headaches dizziness double vision weakness I told my doctor what was going on and she said I was going to have a little bit of trimmers is okay but it's not okay it has gotten worse and I told her that and she seemed like she didn't want to change or change the medication so I decided to take myself off of it I have not had it in 2 weeks so right now I'm going through tremors some headache still and dizziness I'm a hairstylist I cannot work and I hate feeling this way about my life nauseation I've been having nauseation everyday for now on every medication I get for my doctor I will be looking it up and doing my own research if I see is long-term side effects that I know are going to harm me I would not take it right now I'm suffering short-term memory it's a lot of stuff I have been able to remember like my passwords to my account pin number to my accounts so I am getting ready to detox my body of every one of those drugs and start my life over that's how I feel I'm going to my herb stores and talk to them to find out things that I can help myself to for focus and memory it has to be a better way besides making doctors and the medication companies more Rich every day off of people like us. Lamictal in my case is for Submitted by Roadcan on Thu, 2018-03-29 - 18:31 Lamictal in my case is for depression , hellpra. No way :) I just had an RNS implanted. We willl see , I'm intractable with status. This started a few years ago and I'm no kid I have used Lamictal for a Submitted by annagebert on Wed, 2016-06-08 - 17:39 I have used Lamictal for a year and have developed problems with memory, concentration, disorientation and anxiety. Does anyone have experience if these symptoms get better after getting off the med or is the damage permanent? I feel like my brain is becoming less and less functional. yes I am having the same Submitted by Ryley's mom on Sat, 2019-10-12 - 09:45 yes I am having the same problems Do you feel taking the CBD Submitted by Lora!1968 on Mon, 2018-08-06 - 10:28 Do you feel taking the CBD oil has helped with memory issues. How was this with drawl a fax from the Lamictal yes I am having the same Submitted by Ryley's mom on Sat, 2019-10-12 - 09:52 yes I am having the same problems Ive been on it for like 3 Submitted by Doomrae on Thu, 2018-09-06 - 07:06 Ive been on it for like 3 months after switching from topomax for complex basilar migraines(they dont hurt. I go numb and then it looks like a seizure). It has kind of given me my life back. Im only on 100mg and I havent felt this clear or confident that i wont collapse during a night out with friends (again) in years. I really hope this doesnt happen:/ Im a nurse. I need my brain. Without meds my migraines take away my short term memory and make me exhausted all the time, with topomax i couldnt wake up to alarms or speak properly and my back felt like glass plus i was a total space cadet. I have a hx of eating disorder, hypotension, and tachycardia so i cant do the beta blockers and wont do the crazy weight gain ones(i know myself enough to know that would cause a relapse). I kind of need this to work.
