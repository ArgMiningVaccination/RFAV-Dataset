If excessive consumption (more than 4 ounces/day) occurs for longer than two days, remove the supplement for two days, then return to free choice. If overconsumption still occurs, follow directions for measured feeding. Follow label directions. Feeding added selenium at levels in excess of 0.3 ppm in the total diet is prohibited.

Mineral doesn't do any good laying in trough. My animals eat this mineral better than other brands I have tried. Reviewer Name tnsfm1801 I keep one of these in my hay hut year round for my horses out on pasture. They look great, and they love the block. I like that it provides them the mineral balance they need without feeding grain. Reviewer Name Sunnie I have been feeding this for years with great results. No other product is even close!!! Reviewer Name Tlmeek831 Horses love the taste and eat what they need. Its like giving them a treat that's good for them. Reviewer Name bespotted I have been using 12:12 for at least 30 years. My horses never chew if they have this readily available. What ever your forage is lacking this will make sure your horse gets adequate minerals. My horses have a strong immune system and there coats are always shiny.
