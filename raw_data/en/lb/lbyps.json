We evaluated the social-behavioral and cultural barriers and risk factors for refusal of polio, Routine Immunization (RI), or both in high-risk areas of poliovirus circulation. Methods: A matched case-control study was conducted from April to July 2017 in eight super high-risk Union Councils of five towns in Karachi, Pakistan. A total of 3 groups, each with 250 cases, including refusals for the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) in campaigns (national immunization days and supplementary immunization activities), RI, and both, were matched with 500 controls and identified using surveillance records. Sociodemographic characteristics, household information, and immunization history were assessed. Study outcomes included social-behavioral and cultural barriers and reasons for vaccine refusal. Data were analyzed in STATA using conditional logistic regression. Results: RI refusal was associated with illiteracy and fear of the vaccine's adverse effects, while OPV refusals were linked to the mother's decision authority and the assumption that the OPV caused infertility. Conversely, higher socioeconomic status (SES) and knowledge of and willingness to vaccinate with Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) were inversely associated with RI; and lower SES, walking to the vaccination point, knowledge of IPV, and an understanding of contracting polio were inversely associated with OPV refusals, with the latter two also inversely associated with complete vaccine refusal. Conclusion: Education, knowledge and understanding of vaccines, and socioeconomic determinants influenced OPV and RI refusals among children. Effective interventions are needed to address knowledge gaps and misconceptions among parents.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-05-05", "cleaned_text": "Factors Associated with Vaccine Refusal (Polio and Routine Immunization) in High-Risk Areas of Pakistan: A one of the most successful and cost-effective public health interventions, has the potential to save millions of lives annually, thereby preventing the majority of these deaths [ [1](#B1-vaccines-11-00947)]. Ever since the launch of the Global Polio Eradication Program (GPEI), with the resolution of the World Health Assembly in 1988, tremendous progress has been made toward the global incidence of poliomyelitis, which has been reduced by nearly 99% [ [2](#B2-vaccines-11-00947)]. Having overcome a situation where the wild-type poliovirus was endemic in 125 countries across five continents, transmission is now limited to two countries\u2014Pakistan and Afghanistan. [3](#B3-vaccines-11-00947)]. Routine immunization (RI) against poliovirus and five other diseases was also initiated in 1978 with the launch of the National Expanded Programme on Immunizations (EPI) in Pakistan [ [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00947)]. However, the introduction and implementation of Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) explicitly targeting polio have been a keystone of the GPEI to increase population immunity [ [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00947)]. In 2015, four WHO regions were classified as polio-free, leaving Pakistan and Afghanistan as the remaining endemic reservoirs of the wild poliovirus [ [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00947)]. [1](#B1-vaccines-11-00947)]. [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00947)]. Low vaccination rates were also highlighted in the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) 2018 and Third-Party Verification Immunization Coverage Survey (TPVICS) 2021. The PDHS indicated that only 66% of children aged 12 to 23 months had received essential vaccines (one dose of BCG and measles and three doses of DPT and polio vaccines), 51% had all age-appropriate vaccinations, and 4% did not receive any vaccine [ [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00947)]. According to the latter survey, 76.5% of children under two received complete vaccination, 18.1% partial vaccination, and 5.4% received no vaccines [ [1](#B1-vaccines-11-00947)]. Suboptimal immunization has also been reported by a number of studies from various areas of Pakistan [ [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00947), [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00947)]. [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00947), [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00947)]. [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00947), [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00947), [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00947)]. On the other insufficient belief in immunization, compromised caregiver experiences, vaccine misconceptions, fear of side effects, unavailability of the mother, and distance to the vaccination facility negatively influenced polio and routine immunization [ [1](#B1-vaccines-11-00947), [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00947), [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00947), [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00947)]. Furthermore, widespread skepticism about vaccine ingredients, as many people believe that vaccines are made of porcine materials\u2014which are strongly forbidden in Islam\u2014is also a significant barrier to vaccine administration and delivery [ [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00947)]. Similar factors have also been reported in Afghanistan [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00947), [20](#B20-vaccines-11-00947), [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00947), [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00947), [23](#B23-vaccines-11-00947)]. [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00947)]. Moreover, attacks on polio workers, and the spike in rumors and misinformation about polio vaccination and anti-vaccine conspiracy theories alleging invasion of foreign bodies through polio campaigns to destabilize the country have added to the slew of challenges, reducing people's intention to vaccinate their children [ [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00947), [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00947), [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00947), [27](#B27-vaccines-11-00947)].

Identification of Cases and Controls [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00947)], an active surveillance system was implemented, and logs and vaccination record books were maintained with the information of the true number of children in the catchment area and their vaccination status. This case-control study utilized those established sources to identify families who refused to vaccinate their children with the OPV and/or RI within the catchment area. The lists with the refusals were reviewed, and probability proportional to size (PPS) was used to select households. Controls were selected from the same catchment area, where the fourth house on the right and left of the cases' house was approached. If the household had more than one eligible child, then one child was randomly selected. In the case of an apartment building and the availability of a house number, the data collection team added and subtracted four to the apartment/house number to get the desired apartment/house to be visited. In case the team did not find any eligible child, they followed the same sequence until they enrolled two controls for each case. Recruitment of controls from the same population as of cases and matching on the defined characteristics minimized the selection bias. 2.5. Sample Size Estimation 2.6. Data Collection 2.6.1.

Ethical Consideration 3. Results 3.1. Population and Household Characteristics [Table 1](#vaccines-11-00947-t001). The household density ranged from 9.0-10.6, with a maximum M:F ratio of 1.1. The number of 0-59 months children per household ranged from 1.9 to 2.4, with a M:F sex ratio of 0.9 to 1.2 across the three groups. The most frequently spoken language was Pashto. One-fourth of the households shared a single room for sleeping, and a low proportion used one or more methods to make drinking water safer. On the other hand, a more significant proportion had improved water and toilet facility, used natural gas for cooking, had electricity, and lived in their own house. 3.2. Descriptive Analysis of Risk Factors and Barriers across the Three Refusal Groups [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00947-t002)shows the distribution of risk factors for refusals of RI, OPV, and all vaccinations among each group. For the educational level, illiteracy was prevalent in all three groups but more prevalent among the cases than in the controls (Group A 88.8% vs. 73.8%; Group B 70.8% vs. 66.4%; Group C 83.6% vs. 73.2%). Controls were more educated than cases in all other schooling categories, i.e., primary, middle, secondary, and higher. The knowledge of vaccination and polio disease was high among all the cases, with controls reporting 100% knowledge about immunization. However, IPV knowledge was considerably minimal among cases in Group A (9.2% vs. 77.6%) and C (6.8% vs. 74%) compared to the controls. [Table 3](#vaccines-11-00947-t003)describes the distribution of barriers related to knowledge, beliefs, and reasons for refusals across the three study groups. Groups A and C, which included the cases of RI and complete vaccine refusal, reported 0% of children receiving RI in Group A and only 2.9 percent in Group C. While Group B, which accepted RI, showed a 98.4% vaccination rate. The most common barriers to RI in these two refusal groups (Groups A and C) were a lack of belief in vaccines' ability to prevent disease, a lack of awareness and funding, and fear of vaccine-related adverse effects. Groups B and C reported 0% of children receiving the OPV, including refusals for the OPV and complete vaccines. On the other hand, Group A refused RI, but 100% vaccinated their children with the OPV. The common negative perceptions held against the OPV included the vaccine's capacity to cause infertility (Group B: 56% vs. 54.9%; Group C: 59.5% vs. vs. 25.2%; Group C: 27.8% vs. 26.0%). Additionally, the most often cited reasons for refusals were concern about the negative impact (Group B: 25.2 vs. 0%; Group C 14.5% vs. 7.4), lack of benefits of the OPV (Group B: 17.5% vs. 0%; Group C: 23.3% vs. 0%), and a dislike of polio workers visiting the household (Group B: 8.1% vs. 5.3%; Group C: 8.8% vs. 0%). On the other hand, the IPV was given to 100% of children in Group B and 21.7% in Group A, while no case child was vaccinated with the IPV in group C. The most common reasons for IPV refusals included the child receiving multiple OPV doses (Group A: 16.7% vs. 7%), family refusal (Group A 44.4% vs. 4%; Group C 17.7% vs. 0%), vaccine not halal (Group A 11.1% vs. 0%), unsafe (Group A 22.2% vs. 0%; Group C 29.4% vs. 0%), and can cause infertility (Group A 11.1% vs. 0%; Group C 17.7% vs. 0%). In addition, a mother needing permission to vaccinate their child was the common barrier reported across all three groups (Group A: 78.4% vs. 60.8%, Group B 74%% vs. 65%%; Group C 74% vs. 64%), with a majority of the mothers needing permission from the husband to vaccinate. 3.3. Inferential Analysis of Risk Factors and Barriers to RI, OPV, and Both 3.3.1. Group A: Refusal for but Acceptance Discussion [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00947), [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00947), [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00947)]. The role of education in impacting health literacy is well established, enabling mothers to make more informed health decisions. Individuals with a higher level of education are more likely to understand the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, the effectiveness of vaccines, the use of selective information sources, dependence on critical thinking, and the importance of making more proactive decisions [ [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00947)]. The finding that only 8.7% of cases in the RI refusal group were literate is concerning because it could play a significant role in the outbreak of vaccine-preventable diseases in Pakistan, which would be detrimental to the country and the world. [32](#B32-vaccines-11-00947)]. These reasons, coupled with false assumptions and doubts surrounding vaccines, can cause fear and worry among parents. Earlier research has also indicated the reluctance to vaccinate due to apprehension of side effects and concerns about the safety of vaccines as one of the primary reasons for refusals among parents [ [32](#B32-vaccines-11-00947), [33](#B33-vaccines-11-00947), [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00947)]. [35](#B35-vaccines-11-00947)]. However, we found contrasting evidence, where mothers with decision-making authority in our study reported more refusals for OPV. [36](#B36-vaccines-11-00947)]. A study in Malaysia reported that 76% of mothers who refused childhood vaccination perceived vaccine ingredients not to be halal, and 78% refused vaccines due to their religious beliefs [ [37](#B37-vaccines-11-00947)]. [38](#B38-vaccines-11-00947)]. Due to misinformation and illiteracy, these misconceptions will likely prevail and spread, resulting in mothers' reluctance to accept the OPV/IPV in campaigns. The mothers' knowledge is considered a significant component in influencing their decisions regarding the vaccination of children. (7) [ [39](#B39-vaccines-11-00947)]. It is also emphasized that instead of only the mother owning the decision authority, shared decision making among parents is associated with less chance of refusals [ [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00947)]. [40](#B40-vaccines-11-00947)]. Literacy is influenced by numerous socioeconomic factors, with poverty being the critical reason believed to have coexisted with illiteracy and low accomplishment. In developing countries, a definite association exists between poverty and illiteracy, as the former forces individuals to engage in child labor, leading to illiteracy, and these illiterate individuals take on low-income jobs, exacerbating poverty [ [41](#B41-vaccines-11-00947)]. Consequently, those who have higher SES are more likely to be literate and less likely to refuse RI than their counterparts. Literacy is also linked with knowledge and awareness, where mothers/families with a greater understanding of the purpose of polio vaccination were less likely to refuse RI and the OPV/IPV. In turn, these mothers were more willing to vaccinate their children with the IPV. [42](#B42-vaccines-11-00947)]. [43](#B43-vaccines-11-00947)]. Similar results were stated by another study that found children who lived further from the immunization facility were less likely to be vaccinated [ [44](#B44-vaccines-11-00947)]. [40](#B40-vaccines-11-00947)]. The time and physical effort required to reach vaccination sites for multiple campaigns and the burden of traveling on foot with one or more children could potentially deter people from seeking and returning for vaccination services. In our situation, walking to the immunization site reduced OPV refusal. One of the reasons reported by mothers is a dislike toward frequent visits of vaccinators to their houses. Another explanation points toward the fact that mothers willing to walk to the site took it as an opportunity to socialize with other mothers in their neighborhood, which otherwise is less likely due to the conservative social structures. [40](#B40-vaccines-11-00947)]. It is essential to understand that immunizing children may not be a priority for mothers or caregivers who are overburdened with household or work responsibilities. As a result, disadvantaged children may encounter several logistical challenges when trying to access vaccination services, including a lack of resources or transportation, mothers' inability to get to the vaccination site during the campaign days, a lack of vaccines at the site, or a conflict between the vaccination hours and parents' work schedules [ [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00947)]. 5.
