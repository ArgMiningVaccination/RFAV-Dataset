[Dr. Julia Aharonov](https://advancedrapiddetox.com/our-team/dr-julia-aharonov/) has perfected Opiate Reversal - The Advanced Rapid Opiate Detox Under Sedation protocol. Dr. Aharonov is a Board-Certified Anesthesiologist & Addiction Medicine Physician. Her proven procedure safely reverses all opiates/opioids from the receptors. Patients are placed under IV sedation allowing them to sleep through their withdrawals while the doctor uses medication to reverse the opiates from the receptors. As a result, they do not have the intense pain that is normally associated with most cold turkey withdrawals. Tell Me About Rapid Opiate Detox Under Sedation at Advanced Rapid Detox Your journey towards being free of opiate dependency begins at Advanced Rapid Detox medical opiate detox facility. We provide you with a caregiver, providing 24-hour medical monitoring while you're in our care. Our team of medical professionals are all expertly trained in the opiate detoxification process. Once your detox procedure has been completed, you'll be moved into your private room for the remainder of your stay. You'll also receive your first [Vivitrol\u00ae](/why-do-we-use-vivitrol/) injection, which is an opiate-blocker that eliminates cravings. After you leave our [detox facility](/our-facility/) and return home you should continue to get the shot each month for a year. It's important to note that Vivitrol\u00ae is not an opiate, it actually just eliminates cravings and is not addictive like Suboxone or Methadone. If you decide not to get the shot you can always get daily oral Naltrexone tablets. This is the best way to keep yourself free of cravings. Our Rapid Opiate Detox Under Sedation Procedure is as follows: - (Day 1) \u2014 Patient completes all intake paperwork, lab work, physical exam, social worker, and case planning meeting with the doctor. Next, the patient is taken to their private room which includes a private bathroom, flat screen TV, and WIFI. All meals are included. During this time the patient keeps their cell phone. Smoking and vaping are not allowed in or around the facility. We suggest patients wear a nicotine patch. We do not want the patient in withdrawals, so they are encouraged to continue their medication until midnight. - (Day 2) \u2014 Patient is taken to the ICU where they will remain for approximately 24 hours after the sedation detox procedure. During the sedation the doctor uses medication that reverse the opiates off the receptors. The patient remains under the care of Award Winning, Board-Certified Anesthesiologist, [Dr. Julia Aharonov](https://advancedrapiddetox.com/our-team/dr-julia-aharonov/), and receives IV Sedation in a private treatment room to sleep through their withdrawals while closely monitored. - After the opiate reversal, the patient receives an FDA Approved Vivitrol\u00ae injection. Vivitrol\u00ae is a brand name for Naltrexone, which blocks the effects of opioids and eliminates cravings. It should be noted that Vivitrol\u00ae eliminates the opiate cravings for 28 days, is not addictive and can be given immediately after this procedure\u2014avoiding the usual 7-14 day period if a patient were to detox themselves. - (Day 3) \u2014 Patient comes back to their private room (with 24-hour medical care), to rest and recuperate for the day. If they experience any post-acute withdrawals, they are given transitionary, non-addictive medications. The patient also receives those same medications to take home. If approved by the doctor (at an additional cost), patients can request to have an IV Ketamine infusion. - (Day 4) \u2014 After meeting with Dr. Aharonov, patients are free to go home and eligible for our detox-related aftercare program.

An opiate is a drug that's derived from opium - an alkaloid compound that is found naturally in the opium poppy plant. The most common opiates that are derived from opium are morphine, codeine and thebaine. More destructive and addictive opiates - such as heroin - can be derived from opium (heroin itself is derived from morphine). The main medical use of an opiate is for pain relief. Some opiates - such as codeine - are relatively weak and can be obtained without a prescription for minor ailments such as headaches and to reduce the debilitating effects of coughs and colds. Other opiates - such as morphine - are much stronger and are used to cope with the pain encountered following surgery. Opiates are usually prescribed to people who are unable to cope with painful situations such as constant back pain by using milder pain relief medicines like paracetamol or ibuprofen. Opiates can also cause some unwanted side effects, such as itching, nausea and vomiting, constipation, drowsiness and fatigue. Understanding Your Dependency Although opiates provide excellent pain relief, they are highly addictive. One of the most concentrated forms of opium - heroin - is possibly the most addictive narcotic there is. Opiates work within the body by binding themselves to natural proteins known as opioid receptors. These are found on nerve cells in many places within the human body, including the brain and spinal column. They do not stop the body from feeling pain - instead they change the way in which the brain perceives pain, which means the body is much more capable of withstanding pain and painful sensations. This lessening of pain is not the only thing that opiates do to the body. Opiates cause feelings of euphoria and pleasure. They also slow a person's heart rate and breathing rate, causing them to feel calm and relaxed. The brain understands that it is beneficial to our well-being that we repeatedly experience pleasurable sensations. It impels us to undergo such experiences again, leading to repeated use and - in many cases - overuse, dependency and even addiction. The body is capable of producing natural opiates, but not to the strength of opiates that are derived from opium. The more opium-based opiates that the body experiences, the more natural opiates the body produces. This lessens the effect of opium-based opiates, meaning that a person has to take more and more in order to experience the pleasurable experiences that lower doses created previously. As this cycle of dependency develops, the highs become less and less intense, and the lows become deeper and deeper. Eventually, someone with an opiate dependency may need a dose of opiates just to get back to where they were before they took opiates in the first place. People with an opiate dependency also suffer symptoms such as depression or anxiety. They start to rely upon opiates to quell these sensations too. Withdrawal from opiate dependency can be hard. Withdrawal symptoms include nausea and vomiting, aches, pains, body tremors, chills and dizziness. It is very hard for some to withdraw from opiate dependency without the necessary levels of help.
