Cannot mix products Key Priority Considerations 11 Federal recommendations Highest risk for COVID -19 disease and complications Preserve critical health care capacity Priority Groups 12 Vaccine prioritization may be subject to change. Safe and Phased Approach Phase 1 Vaccination of critical and high -risk populations (aligned with federal guidance) Limited vaccine availability CDC directly notifies the state of supply and distribution 13 LTCF Partnership CDC contracted with CVS and Walgreens to vaccinate residents and staff of LTCFs (SNFs, ALFs, Other) Part A - focus on SNFs started Dec 23, 2020 Part B - focus on ALFs and others just activated 14 Safe and Phased Approach Phase 2 Begins when Phase 1 targets have been met Vaccination of targeted groups, beginning with critical workers Vaccination efforts continue until every Marylander who wants a vaccine is able to get one 15 Allocation of Limited Vaccines Maryland will align as much as possible with federal recommendations for each vaccine. Each week Maryland receives a weekly allocation of vaccine (Pfizer and Moderna) from the federal government Each week allocations to facilities are determined, reviewed and approved by the Secretary's and Governor's offices 16 ImmuNet Maryland's Immunization Information System that stores an individual's vaccination records All COVID vaccinations are reported to ImmuNet Data from ImmuNet is used for the Maryland COVID vaccination dashboard 17 COVID Vaccination Dashboard 18 Vaccine Safety EUA granted by FDA indicating that the vaccines are safe and effective as reviewed by an independent vaccine group Vaccine safety continuously monitored using various systems run by the CDC and the FDA 19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Systems used to monitor vaccine safety Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) V-Safe smartphone -based, after -vaccination health checker for people who receive COVID -19 vaccines Vaccine Safety Datalink A network of nine integrated healthcare organizations across the United States that conducts active surveillance and research 20 VAERS The national system that collects reports from healthcare professionals, vaccine manufacturers, and the public of adverse events that happen after vaccination While VAERS does not determine whether the vaccine caused the event, it can determine if further investigation is needed. Used for COVID and routine vaccines 21 VAERS Reporting Healthcare providers are required to report to VAERS the following adverse events after COVID- 19 vaccination [under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)], and other adverse events if later revised by CDC: 22 VAERS Reporting Vaccine administration errors, whether or not associated with an adverse event (AE) Serious AEs regardless of causality (e.g. death, life threatening AE, persistent or significant incapacity) Cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Cases of COVID -19 that result in hospitalization or death 23 Updates on MD's COVID Vaccine Plan ... impact on the vaccination of Maryland educators. 24 Phase 1B - Education Education workers K-12 teachers and support staff Child Care Providers Higher education institutions 25 Phase 1B - Education (cont.) Educational facilities K-12: both public school systems and non- public schools Licensed Child Care facilities Higher educational institutions 26 MD's COVID Vaccine Plan - Educators LHDs should set aside at least 100 doses per week from their overall allocation for Phase 1B educators in their jurisdiction until they have vaccinated their educators. 27 MD's COVID Vaccine Plan -Educators (cont.) All COVID -19 vaccine providers shall take reasonable steps to determine if an individual qualifies for the priority groups. May require additional documentation Employee identification Organizations submit institutional plans with identified individuals 28 MD's COVID Vaccine Plan -Educators (cont.) Educational facilities shall: Identify a clinical provider (e.g. hospitals, FQHCs, others) that is registered with ImmuNet for COVID- 19 vaccine administration. If no provider is identified, then the LHD will be the default vaccinator of the facility through one of their general population clinics and the LHD's vaccine allocation. 29 MD's COVID Vaccine Plan -Educators (cont.) Each educational facility and their clinical provider are encouraged to coordinate with their LHD on their vaccine administration plan for vaccine allocations. 30 MD's COVID Vaccine Plan -Educators (cont.) An educational facility's clinical provider may submit a vaccine allocation request to the state and identify the number of staff that need to be vaccinated. NOTE: Due to the limited supply of vaccine, Maryland does not anticipate significantly fulfilling any specific educational vaccine requests until a majority of Marylanders over age 65 are vaccinated. 31 MD's COVID Vaccine Plan -Educators (cont.) NOTE : Higher educational institutions front line workers with potential contact with students living in residence halls (congregate living), facilities maintenance, dining hall, and campus police are included in 1C. 32 MD's COVID Vaccine Plan -Educators (cont.) Each educational facility shall prioritize their faculty, staff, and students by the following: (A) Faculty or staff that provide essential in- person learning (i.e. instruction that cannot be delivered remotely); (B) Individuals with essential functions related to facility/campus operations; 33 MD's COVID Vaccine Plan -Educators (cont.) Each educational facility shall prioritize their faculty, staff, and students by the following: (C) Individuals that require residential or on- campus housing; or (D) That meet an existing priority group in P hase 1A or 1B currently. 34 Common Questions Is the vaccine safe for children? Children, adolescents, teens (<16 or <18 - depending on the COVID vaccine) were not included in the vaccine trials so there is no safety data for children Vaccine are not approved for anyone outside of these age categories 35 Common Questions Will I need to get vaccinated every year? Since vaccines have only been in trials for less than a year, there is limited data on the duration of protection. As we move further out from vaccination, we will hopefully have more information on the need for booster doses 36 Common Questions Will I need to wear a mask after getting vaccinated? Yes. We also don't yet know whether getting a COVID- 19 vaccine will prevent you from spreading the virus that causes COVID -19 to other people, even if you don't get sick yourself. 37 Common Questions If I have had COVID infection, do I still need to be vaccinated? Yes. Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID- 19 and the fact that reinfection with COVID- 19 is possible, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID -19 infection. 38 Common Questions Can COVID- 19 vaccine recipients be given other vaccines at the same visit? CDC recommends that the vaccine series should routinely be administered alone, and not within 14 days before or after any other vaccination 39 Common Questions What should be done if a patient scheduled for vaccination is exposed to COVID -19 and quarantined or is isolated for suspected or confirmed SARS -CoV- 2 infection? Reschedule vaccination after their quarantine period has ended in order to avoid the risk of exposing vaccinators to the virus. 40 Common Questions How does the use of monoclonal antibodies to treat symptomatic COVID -19 affect the scheduling of mRNA COVID vaccination? Wait at least 90 days after receipt of passive antibody therapy for COVID -19 illness before initiating the COVID -19 vaccine series 41 Resources MDH CoronaVirus, https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/ Vaccine Administration and COVID Vaccine training, https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=m mmknOk4hlE&feature=youtu.be 42 Resources (cont.)

Interpretation of POC Test Results ** For footnotes and technical information please see the CDC \"Interim Guidance for Antigen Testing for SARS -CoV- 2\" Follow current MDH/MSDE guidance for: Communication Identification and notification of close contacts Isolation, exclusion, quarantine, and return to school Report all test results Current Requirements for Responding to a Positive Test Result All POC results (positive, negative, & inconclusive) must be reported to CRISP by the school Each local health department will identify 1 -2 public school liaisons as \"super users\" Each super user will be able to add and delete CRISP users who can enter POC results PCR tests will be reported by the processing lab Reporting Requirements for Schools Discussion and Questions "}
