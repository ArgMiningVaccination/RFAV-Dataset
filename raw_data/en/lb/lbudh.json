Rawlings, 612 F.2d 135, 140 (3d Cir. 1979) Bradshaw was passenger in vehicle driven by classmate, Rawlings. They attended sophomore class picnic (Delaware Valley College) where Rawlings became intoxicated. Rawlings' vehicle struck a parked vehicle after leaving picnic. Bradshaw suffered cervical fracture causing quadriplegia. Bradshaw sued Rawlings, Borough of Doylestown, beer distributor and Delaware Valley College. Faculty member planned picnic with class officers and co-signed check used to purchase beer for picnic. Third Circuit said that since Delaware Valley College regulation on alcohol use by students mirrored state law, there was no voluntary custodial relationship between college and its students. Rabel v. Illinois Wesleyan University, 514 N.E.2d 552 (Ill. App. Ct. 1987) Rabel called from her dorm room by a member of Phi Gamma Delta (Fiji) fraternity at IWU. Fiji member grabbed Rabel and threw her over his shoulder. As he ran toward gauntlet of fraternity brothers, he tripped and fell, dropping Rabel. Rabel suffered skull fracture and brain concussion among other injuries. Court found, \"We do not believe that the university, by its handbook, regulations, or policies voluntarily assumed or placed itself in a custodial relationship with its students, for purposes of imposing a duty to protect its students from the injury occasioned here . . . It would be unrealistic to impose upon a university the additional role of custodian over its adult students and to charge it with the responsibility for assuring their safety and the safety of others.\" Whitlock v. University of Denver, 712 P.2d 54, 55 (Colo. 1987) (en banc) Whitlock suffered quadriplegia after falling off trampoline in front yard of Beta Theta Pi fraternity house on university property. Whitlock intoxicated at time of incident. Whitlock filed suit against trampoline manufacturer, fraternity and its local chapter, and the university. Trial court determined that 72% of negligence attributable to university ($5,256,000) and 28% attributable to Whitlock. Trial court then granted university's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict finding that no reasonable jury could have found university more negligent than Whitlock. Whitlock appealed and university cross-appealed. Colorado Court of Appeals reject university's argument that it owed no duty to Whitlock and reinstated jury verdict. Colorado Supreme Court reversed judgment of Colorado Court of Appeals. Court declined to impose on university a duty to control its students' recreational choices. Exception to \"No Duty\" Rule Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 449 N.E.2d 331 (Mass. 1983) Student abducted from dorm room and raped on campus. Court recognized a duty arising from \"existing social values and customs\" and student -college relationship. Court determined (1) that colleges have general legal duty to provide campus security and (2) that a \"duty voluntarily assumed must be performed with due care.\" Relevant Hazing Case Law: 2011 2 Furek v. Delaware, 594 A.2d 506, 509 (Del. 1991) Furek, a Sig Ep pledge, seriously burned and permanently scarred when fraternity member poured oven cleaner over Furek's back and neck. Delaware Supreme Court found that university's policy on hazing and repeated warnings to students about the hazards of hazing \"constituted an assumed duty\" to protect students from injuries suffered as result of the hazing. Court rejected both Bradshaw court decision. Liberty or Property Interest Alton v. Texas A&M University, 168 F.3d 196 (5th Cir. 1999) Alton was a member of FISH Drill Team beaten on nightly basis during hell week. Not reported to University officials. He was beaten again 3 weeks later for \"botching drill movement.\" Alton did not tell University administrators, but told brother who told parents. Parents contact administrator in Corps of Cadets and request investigation. Team's faculty advisor questioned Alton about rumors and Alton denied incidents had occurred. Alton then suffered another beating and told to cut self with knife, which he did. Parents then met with Commandant of Corps of Cadets. Commandant suspended 9 cadets and ordered them of out of Corps facilities. Alton filed complaint in US District Court alleging that he was deprived of his constitutional rights. Named in complaint were commandant, former commandant, Vice President and faculty advisor. Court granted qualified immunity. Alton appealed. Fifth Circuit court ruled that \"supervisory officers, like the defendants, cannot be held liable for actions of subordinates like cadets, on theory of vicarious liability.\" In order for liability to attach, Alton had to show that the officials acted with deliberate indifference. Landlord-Tenant Relationship Nero v. Kansas State University, 861 P.2d 768 (Kan. 1993) Nero attending summer school at KSU and resident in Goodnow Hall. KSU housing administrators had transferred another student to Goodnow Hall after student was accused of raping a female student in his former residence hall. The transferred student sexually assaulted Nero in the lounge of Goodnow Hall. Kansas Supreme Court found that KSU owed a duty of reasonable care to its student-tenants. As landlord, \"a university has a duty of reasonable care to protect a student against certain dangers, including criminal actions against a student by another student . . . If the criminal act is reasonably foreseeable and within the university's control.\" Knoll v. Board of Regents of the State of Nebraska, 601 N.W.2d 757 (Neb. 1999) Knoll was forcibly taken from campus building to FIJI house at University of Nebraska. At FIJI house Knoll handcuffed to radiator and given 15 shots of brandy and whiskey and six cans of beer in 2 \u00bd hour period.

FIJI house owned by FIJI Corporation but UNL considered house as student housing unit. Nebraska Supreme Court determined that \"the University owes a landowner-invitee duty to students to take reasonable steps to protect against foreseeable acts of hazing . . . And the harm that naturally flows there from.\" Relevant Hazing Case Law: 2011 3 Alcohol and Hazing Ballou v. Sigma Nu General Fraternity, 352 S.E.2d 488 (S.C. 1986) As part of Hell Night activities, Ballou and other Sigma Nu pledges required to drink inordinate amounts of alcohol and other activities while encouraged and goaded by fraternity members. Ballou passed out and members were unable to wake him but left him lying face-down on couch overnight. Ballou found dead next morning. Ballou's father sued fraternity and its executive director. SC State Appellate Court found the fraternity owed a duty to care to initiates to prevent physical harm. Found fraternity responsible for damages related to Ballou's wrongful death from alcohol poisoning. Quinn v. Sigma Rho Chapter, 507 N.E.2d 1193 (Ill. App. Ct. 1987) Fraternity pledge required to participate in initiation ceremony in which he was directed to drink a 40-ounce pitcher of beer without letting the pitcher leave his lips or until he vomited. Later pledges taken to tavern where directed to drink 8-ounce bottle of whiskey and other drinks purchased by fraternity members. Quinn became extremely intoxicated and suffered neurological damage. Court determined that cause of action existed because case was distinguishable from social-host situation because pledge was required to drink and there was a state statue against hazing that prohibited embarrassing or endangering through thoughtless or meaningless activity. Haben v. Anderson, 597 N.E.2d 655 (Ill. App. Ct. 1993) Haben, freshman at Western Illinois University, was \"rookie\" on Lacrosse Club team. During initiation of new recruits (rookies), Haben and other rookies forced to consume large quantities of alcohol, engage in strenuous physical activities, submit to acts of ridicule and degradation including smearing their bodies, face and hair with food and other materials. Haben became intoxicated and lost consciousness. He was carried to a dorm room by a team member and laid on the floor. Haben found dead next morning. Died from acute alcohol poisoning (BAC .34) Trial Court dismissed the complaint against individual team members and the team because the facts did not fit narrow exception in Quinn. Appellate Court determined that case was similar to Quinn and defendants owed Haben a duty to act reasonably to protect him and that it was reasonably foreseeable and likely that the injury could result from consuming large amounts of alcohol as part of the initiation ceremony. Coghlan v. Beta Theta Pi Fraternity, 987 P.2d 300 (Idaho 1999) Coughlan pledge of Alpha Phi sorority at University of Idaho, attended two fraternity parties (SAE/PKA and Beta Theta Pi) celebrating end of pledge week.

She was led back to sorority house by sorority sister and put to bed. Coughlin later fell from 3rd floor fire escape on sorority house causing permanent injuries. Coughlan sued the fraternities which sponsored the parties and the university. Idaho Supreme Court concluded that \"University assumed a duty to exercise reasonable care to safeguard the underage plaintiff from the criminal acts of third persons, i.e. furnishing alcohol to underage students, of which University employees had knowledge.\" Relevant Hazing Case Law: 2011 4 Challenges to Hazing Statues State v. Anderson, 591 N.E.2d 461 (Ill. 1992) Criminal prosecution of Marc Anderson and 11 other members of Lacrosse Club in Nicholas Haben's death (Haben v. Anderson). Trial judge dismissed criminal charges, ruling hazing statue was unconstitutional. State appealed directly to Illinois Supreme Court. Defendants suggested that act of ridiculing a person could subject one to criminal penalties for hazing. Court pointed out that statue requires infliction of bodily harm in addition to ridicule. Ruled that \"the hazing statue does not promote arbitrary enforcement and is not unconstitutionally vague.\" State v. Allen, 905 S.W.2d 874 (Mo. 1995) (en banc) Allen charged with 4 counts of hazing for physical abuse of Kappa Alpha Psi pledges over several days. One of pledges died as result of beatings. Convicted on all 5 counts and sentenced to prison for 6 months on each count. Appealed on basis that hazing statue vague and overbroad. MO Supreme Court found that statue \"clearly delineates its reach in words of common understanding.\" Upheld conviction State of Texas v. Boyd & Chapa, Nos. 2043-99 and 2044-99 (Tx. Ct. of Crim. App. 2001) (en banc) Boyd & Chapa were members of Corps of Cadets at Texas A&M University. Both were charged with hazing by University for \"has firsthand knowledge of the planning of a specific hazing incident involving a student in an educational institution, or has firsthand knowledge that a specific hazing incident has occurred, and knowingly fails to report that knowledge in writing to the dean of students or other appropriate official of the institution\" (TX Educ. Code 37.152). Trial court granted motion to dismiss criminal charges finding that the hazing statue was unconstitutional. Compelled disclosure of such information creates risk of self-incrimination. Court of Appeals ruled that Trial Court decision appropriate. Court of Criminal Appeals reversed judgments of lower courts. Court indicated that appellants would have been immune from civil and criminal liability if had reported specific hazing incident. On the radar: Rider settles hazing lawsuit What was described as a \"significant\" monetary settlement would partially compensate the family of student Gary DeVercelly Jr. for his hazing death in 2007, Rider University said yesterday in announcing details of the compromise. The exact amount of the settlement was kept confidential, though the DeVercelly family had sought as much as $75 million. It was their lawyer who described the final amount as \"significant.\" DeVercelly died following a ritual drinking test in the fraternity Phi Kappa Tau. His family named the school as partly responsible for poor oversight in a subsequent lawsuit. \"The agreement reinforces the commitment the University made to the DeVercelly family and its own community to reduce the risks of a similar incident reoccurring at Rider,\" the school said in a statement yesterday, while not admitting liability. Changes in policy have accompanied the settlement to help ensure that fraternities are more closely regulated. \"Nothing will ever bring Gary back or ease the grief our family has suffered,\" said Julie DeVercelly, Gary's mother. \"The devastation is made even worse knowing that his death was caused by Relevant Hazing Case Law: 2011 5 hazing and should have been prevented. We sought to create meaningful changes that would honor Gary and protect others and we have done so in our settlement with Rider.\" The family's $75 million suit filed in Superior Court named the university, three employees, the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity and several fraternity members. While protecting the three campus employees, the settlement does not resolve the pending claims that the DeVercelly family is pursuing against the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity, the university said. As part of the settlement the school agreed to ban the use of alcohol at all Greek social events in residence halls and Greek houses on campus; increase sanctions for alcohol policy and hazing violations; notify parents of alcohol violations and promote a \"Good Samaritan\" policy to encourage students to seek help first for medically comprised classmates without fear of campus repercussions.... California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo The parents of a college freshman fraternity pledge who died of alcohol poisoning after fraternity hazing have reached a settlement with Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Carson Starkey, 18, of Austin, Texas, was found dead after the Dec. 1, 2008, fraternity hazing. Starkey was a freshman at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. The student's parents, Scott and Julia Starkey, filed a lawsuit against the fraternity's Illinois-based national headquarters saying they wanted changes in Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter operations, including hazing and alcohol use. The parents announced the settlement Monday without disclosing details. Sigma Alpha Epsilon says in a statement that it has a zero-tolerance policy against hazing. They dissolved the Cal Poly chapter after investigating the architecture-engineering student's death. Four men involved in Starkey's death were convicted of misdemeanors and got jail terms ranging from 30 days to six months. The night Carson Starkey died, fraternity members began to take him to the hospital. But they changed their minds and brought him back to the frat house, hoping he would sleep it off, according to the San Luis Obispo Tribune. He never woke up. Carson Starkey's blood-alcohol level was between 0.39 and 0.44, five times the legal driving limit in California. "}
