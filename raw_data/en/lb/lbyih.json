The best cure is prevention of infection (please, please get vaccinated and continue to mask in public spaces). The US death toll from the Coronavirus pandemic has topped 1.130 million people. This is an inconceivable number. I cannot fathom how much anguish and grief accompanies every one of these deaths. In Oregon, so far we have lost 8,831 people to Covid-19. For many folks who recover, Covid may cause long term damage to one or more vital organs: heart, lungs, brain, gut, or kidneys. Up to 30% of those who get Covid end up with some form of long Covid and inflammation of one or more body systems secondary to this virus. There are some naturopathic approaches to long Covid, but no known cures. Some folks recover slowly over time, others have not recovered thus far. If you get Covid and are unvaccinated, you are 10x more likely to die from it than if you have been vaccinated and boosted. If we have compassion for those staffing our hospitals, it behooves us to get vaccinated. Politics does not prevent or provide a cure for this infection. As many of my patients are aware, if I deny the existence of Lyme disease, Borrelia-caused illness still exists. Everything in health care is a risk benefit analysis. We know getting infected with COVID may cause long term or permanent sequelae, including death. Vaccines also pose risks that have been less well enumerated. The risk of Covid infection is greater than the risk posed by Covid vaccines. Flu-like symptoms for one to two days after the vaccine or booster for covid are common. Whether or not you get vaccinated for Covid, do continue physical distancing, mask wearing, and hand washing/sanitizing. It is noteworthy that there was a negligible influenza the winter of 2020-2021. This was due to precautions we took to prevent spread of COVID. I hope these behaviours continue. The Covid vaccine works differently from seasonal flu vaccines. Most Lyme doctors do not recommend patients with Lyme disease receive the annual flu vaccine, but most Lyme doctors are recommending the Covid vaccine for Lyme patients. The FDA has forbidden the use of ivermectin for Covid. Initial studies of ivermectin for Covid looked promising, but data was erroneous and subsequent studies have shown ivermectin doesn't benefit patients who have Covid. Dr Honeyman cannot prescribe ivermectin for treatment of Covid-19, and pharmacies cannot dispense it due to federal regulations. - Nutrients and herbs that may reduce the intensity or shorten the course of viral infections: - Vitamin D - dose for Oregonians 5 years of age and up is 5,000 iu per day. - Vitamin A - 25,000 iu per day for anyone who is not pregnant, including children. - Vitamin C - 3 to 5 grams taken up to 4 times per day in water. Change the form you are taking if this causes loose stools, ie you are not absorbing it. Vitamin C forms: ascorbic acid, buffered ascorbic acid, esterified ascorbic acid. - Zinc - 15 to 30 mg per day - antiviral herbs: elderberry, licorice root, Japanese knot weed (aka resveratrol), Berberine), green tea supplements, Baikal (Chinese skullcap) - selenium 100 mcg per day - vitamin E 100 to 400 iu per day "}
