As these inflammatory reactions are not related to allergy, most patients can receive subsequent vaccinations safely. A less common cause of an adverse skin reaction is an allergy to a vaccine or one of its components. Inflammatory skin reactions |Vaccination/constituent||Reaction||Cause| |Most vaccinations||Local injection site reactions such as swelling, redness and/or pain may occur with up to 80% of vaccine doses, depending on the type of vaccine. Local reactions generally occur within a few hours of the injection, are usually mild and do not require any specific treatment.||The normal inflammatory response to a foreign substance| |Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine||Transient rash in up to 5% of recipients.||As the vaccine contains live viruses, it is probably due to vaccine-induced modified |[Varicella](/topics/chickenpox)lesions may appear at the injection site in approximately 3% of recipients. In another 3%, the lesions may be more generalised. A [zoster](/topics/herpes-zoster)-type rash may rarely appear after varicella vaccination. [urticaria](/topics/urticaria-an-overview)(hives), [angioedema](/topics/angioedema), and unidentified rashes in around 5-13% of recipients. Allergic reactions Allergic contact dermatitis Localised [allergic contact dermatitis](/topics/allergic-contact-dermatitis) can be induced by vaccine components. Historically, dermatitis was due to [neomycin](/topics/allergy-to-neomycin) and [thiomersal](/topics/thiomersal-allergy). Thiomersal is no longer present in vaccines in New Zealand but may be used in some vaccines elsewhere. Contact allergy is confirmed by [patch tests](/topics/patch-tests) using potential allergens in the vaccine. Dermatitis following influenza vaccine The patient above had longstanding hand dermatitis and developed severe generalised dermatitis shortly after her first influenza vaccination. Anaphylaxis [Anaphylaxis](/topics/anaphylaxis) is a severe allergic reaction that occurs at a rate of approximately 1 per million vaccine doses. The allergic reaction may be caused by the vaccine antigen itself or some other component of the vaccine such as animal protein, [antibiotic](/topics/antibiotics), [preservative](/topics/contact-allergy-to-preservatives), or stabiliser; gelatin, egg, chicken and/or yeast are commonly implicated. Anaphylactic reactions usually occur within 4 hours of receiving a vaccination and involve multiple body systems, with generalised [urticaria](/topics/urticaria-an-overview) (hives), [angioedema](/topics/angioedema), difficulty breathing, and low blood pressure. Severe anaphylaxis can be life-threatening. If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, immediate resuscitation is required (see [ASCIA anaphylaxis action plan](http://www.allergy.org.au/)). Later, allergy [prick testing](/topics/skin-prick-testing) is recommended (under careful medical supervision) and further doses of the vaccine should not be given. A blood test called RAST or EAST testing can be used to exclude egg allergy. [Drug-induced urticaria](/topics/drug-induced-urticaria) without anaphylaxis can also result from vaccines. Erythema [Erythema multiforme](/topics/erythema-multiforme) is occasionally caused by vaccines. Erythema multiforme is characterised by target or bulls-eye lesions on hands, feet and lower legs. It has been reported after mumps/measles/rubella, diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus, toxic epidermal necrolysis](/topics/stevens-johnson-syndrome-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis) has also rarely been reported to follow [vaccination](/topics/adverse-cutaneous-reactions-to-vaccines). This is a potentially very serious condition in which skin and mucous membranes blister and erode. Viral infection Vaccines are intended to prevent viral disease. However, patients that are on [immunosuppressive therapy](/topics/immunisation-in-immunosuppressed-dermatology-patients) should avoid live vaccines in case the vaccine causes widespread viral disease. For example, [herpes zoster](/topics/herpes-zoster) vaccination is contraindicated in these patients due to the risk of disseminated herpes zoster infection, which can be fatal. "}
