With detailed knowledge they can find a homeopathic medicine (known as a 'remedy') that matches you and your symptoms as closely as possible. During the first consultation, your homeopath will ask lots of questions to build up a complete picture, taking into account a wide variety of factors such as medical history, personality traits, stress triggers, likes and dislikes, lifestyle and dreams. Your homeopath wants to understand what is unique about you, and how your body and mind express themselves. Because homeopathy looks at the whole picture, patients who have the same diagnosed illness - hay fever, for example - are each likely to need different homeopathic medicines.

The practitioner is building up a picture of your unique make up, a bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle. Follow-ups Homeopathic treatments involve a gradual process of change towards better health. The first follow-up is usually about four weeks after the first prescription, although in some cases it may be sooner. The second session tends to be shorter than the first - usually between half an hour and an hour. Your homeopath will ask about changes that have occurred, using their detailed notes as a reference point, before deciding on the next step in your treatment. The number of consultations that may be needed is difficult to predict - it depends on a number of factors such as the age of the patient, how long the symptoms have been going on and your response to your prescription. Fees Fees vary, with prices ranging from \u00a330 to \u00a3125 a session. The initial consultation usually costs more because it lasts longer. Fees often include extras, such as interim phone calls and acute prescriptions. You should check this with your practitioner. What about seeing my doctor? We always recommended that you maintain your relationship with your GP or specialist. Homeopathic and conventional approaches are often successfully used alongside one another in an integrated approach. Homeopathic remedies, which are non-toxic, will not interfere with the action of conventional drugs. Nevertheless, it's important to keep your homeopath informed of any changes in prescribed medication from your doctor, and to keep your doctor informed of any changes in symptoms for which you have been prescribed conventional medicines. Some people choose homeopathy because they are unhappy with side effects from their current conventional medication. However, you should not stop medication until you have discussed it with your prescribing doctor. It can be dangerous to suddenly stop taking prescribed conventional medicines.
