It is a form of psychotherapy that encourages individuals to be in the present and observe their thoughts from a non-judgmental perspective. This helps them become more aware of their emotions and more accepting of themselves. Mindfulness meditation therapy has been found to have significant benefits for mental health and well-being. Research suggests that it can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression while improving attention, focus, and overall mental clarity.
