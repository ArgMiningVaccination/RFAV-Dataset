One of the top priorities of this county is the health and wellbeing of its residents and visitors through an equitable lens. We recognize that one agency alone cannot do all the work and it takes an integrated state, county and community approach to fulfill our mission to protect, promote and improve the health of all people in Florida. As a result of these various approaches, the 2022 Community Health Assessment includes new indicators that the community felt should be included from our 2020 and 2021 Community Health Meetings. It is important to highlight throughout the 2022 Community Health Assessment for the Health Outcomes section, we have included breakdowns of the data by race, ethnicity, and gender. This will allow us to have a more comprehensive look at our community through this assessment to examine the county's health with a more inclusive lens. In 2016, we were a recipient of the 2016 Robert Wood Johnson Culture of Health Prize. We have embraced the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Culture of Health Action framework and brought together our partners who see health as a shared value. Our partners are made up of a cross-sector collaboration committed to improving wellbeing, working together to strengthen health services and systems, and creating healthier and equitable communities. A special thank you to the members of the Steering Committee for the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships. The committee consisted of the Alliance for Aging, United Way, University of Miami Mailman Center for Child Development, The Children's Trust, the Department of Children & Families and members of DOH-Miami-Dade County. A special note of acknowledgment to the City of Santa Monica for their guidance on our Wellbeing Survey and to the Will County Health Department for allowing us to use a portion of their questionnaire. We want to thank all those individuals who participated in our various assessments, surveys, and focus groups. Thank you to the Health Council of South Florida's leadership and staff for facilitating the multiple focus groups. We would also like to thank the Miami-Dade County Public Library System for providing access to their facilities throughout the county and to the West Kendall Baptist Hospital who used their community initiative, Healthy West Kendall to collect surveys. We would also like to recognize Mount Sinai Hospital who hosted several focus groups and Mayor Carlos Gimenez for his work and dedication to the Initiative on Aging.

To develop our plan, a Community Health Assessment needed to be completed. This is the third cycle using the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnership (MAPP) model. MAPP is a community-driven process used for improving community health. Through this process, communities can seek to achieve optimal health by identifying and using their resources wisely. The process consists of four community health assessments: Local Public Health System Assessment (LPHSA), Forces of Change Assessment (FCA), Community Themes and Strengths Assessment (CTSA), and the Community Health Status Assessment (CHA). The four assessments examine issues such as risk factors for disease, illness, mortality, socioeconomic factors, environmental conditions, inequities in health, and quality of life. Using these assessments can help the community identify and prioritize health problems, facilitate planning, and determine actions to address issues identified. The first assessment, the Local Public Health System Assessment, took place on August 24 & 25, 2017. During this time, over 111 individuals, representing 40 unduplicated organizations participated. For a complete listing of participants, see Appendix I. The LPHSA examines how well the 10 Essential Services of Public Health are implemented within the county. The 10 Essential Services of Public Health are explained in detail further in the document. The local public health system was scored based on perceived performance and, universal themes of discussion across all functions and standards were identified. An optimal level of performance is the level to which all local public health systems should aspire. Miami-Dade County's public health system ranked as Significant Activity in overall performance. The highest ranking available was Optimal Activity. The highest ranked service for performance was Essential Service 5 Develop Policies and Plans that Support Individual and Community Health Efforts . The three lowest ranked services for performance were Essential Service 7 Link People to Needed Personal Health Services and Assure the Provision of Healthcare when Otherwise Unavailable , Essential Service 9 Evaluate Effectiveness, Accessibility, and Quality of Personal and Population-Based Health Services , and Essential Service 10 Research for New Insights and Innovative Solutions to Health Problems . See Appendix l for the full LPHSA report. The second assessment conducted was the Forces of Change assessment, which took place on May 10, 2018. Organizations and sectors that play essential roles in promoting and improving the health in Miami-Dade County participated in the Forces of Change Assessment Community Meeting. The assessment process was well received among the participants. On the day of the event, there was a total of sixty-four participants representing 42 unduplicated organizations. See Appendix ll for the full report, including those in attendance. The purpose of this assessment was to identify the trends, factors, and events that are likely to influence community health and quality of life, as well as the work of the local public health system in Miami-Dade County. The Forces of Change Assessment brainstorming session focused on answering the following questions: What has occurred recently that may affect our local public health system or the health of our community? Are there trends occurring that will have an impact? What forces are occurring locally? Regionally? Nationally? Globally? What may occur in the foreseeable future that may affect our public health system or the health of our community? 11 Revised 4-26-2022 INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY During the community meeting, a varied group of community partners engaged in brainstorming sessions and discussed key factors that directly or indirectly affect health and the health of the community. Examples of the vital forces that were discussed included: Social/Mental Health Lack of Affordable Housing Opioid Epidemic Gun Violence Lack of Data Driven Decisions Lack of Coordination between Healthcare Providers Lack of Fully Integrated Data Sharing System Healthcare Immigration Policy Change The third assessment conducted was the Community Themes and Strengths Assessment. This assessment specifically targeted the residents of Miami-Dade County to gather their impressions and thoughts that can help pinpoint essential issues and highlight possible solutions. More importantly, by involving community residents and genuinely listening to their concerns, every participant feels like an integral part of the process. During this phase, two tiers of information-gathering occurred. Tier one consisted of focus groups. Focus groups were held throughout the county for several months in 2018. The DOH-Miami-Dade, along with the Health Council of South Florida, conducted 14 focus groups to obtain insight from Miami-Dade County residents. A total of 96 participants were involved in this component. Please see Appendix lII for the full results of the focus groups. Residents identified six areas within our county to address: 1.) Transportation and the built environment, 2.) Access to healthy food, 3.) Education, 4.) Neighborhood Safety, 5.) Health Service Utilization, 6.) Community Involvement. The second tier consisted of a Wellbeing Survey . The Wellbeing Survey is meant to identify the needs, opinions, and views of Miami-Dade County residents and looks to answer the following questions: What is important to the community? How is the quality of life perceived in the community? What assets does the community have that can be used to improve community health? Results from this assessment were made available in August 2019, and are located at www.healthymiamidade.org. Lastly, the Community Health Status Assessment consists of secondary data collected through the synthesis of existing data from national, state, and local sources which were analyzed to learn about health status, quality of life, and risk factors for poor health outcomes among residents of Miami-Dade County. This assessment is monitored and updated on an annual basis to ensure the data is being evaluated to track progress in our community. The four assessments give a complete view of health and quality of life in Miami-Dade County and help make up the Miami-Dade County Community Health Assessment. As a way to continue to involve the community in the assessment process, feedback and comments related to this document can be provided at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CHA-MDC.

These core functions completed through the ten essential services that public health provides (see Figure 1). Through the Mobilizing for Action Through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) process, we can implement a comprehensive assessment, develop a comprehensive Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP), and evaluate on an on going basis. Health is not only shaped by treating medical conditions but also by addressing the social determinants of health that influence one's health. These factors include social, education, economic, and environmental conditions. There needs to be a shared effort from all public health system partners to have a significant, positive impact in the community. No single agency on its own has the resources or the depth needed to address the health of all residents who live in Miami-Dade County. BUILDING ON COMMUNITY SUCCESS A leading figure in the development of the modern study of public health is Charles-Edward Armory Winslow. His definition of public health, developed almost a century ago, states that \"Public health is the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private communities, and individuals\" ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018 ). According to the American Public Health Association, public health promotes and protects the health of people and the communities where they live, learn, work, and play. In public health, the concern is not on individual health but instead on systems that prevent illness and injury and encourage and promote healthy lifestyles. DOH-Miami-Dade has completed its third round of implementing this comprehensive methodology to conduct the assessment. The process was first executed in 2008 and repeated in 2013. The third cycle started in 2017 with a large number of participants taking part in the various assessments. We are currently utilizing the CHIP developed as a result of the 2019 MAPP assessment. The Florida Department of Health in Miami-Dade works to support and strengthen policies, systems, and environments to improve population health. The department bears statutory responsibility for protecting the public's health, and its staff has worked to initiate the CHIP and convene partners to develop the plan. Department staff are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the CHIP performance indicators. Figure 1 13 Revised 4-26-2022 BUILDING ON COMMUNITY SUCCESS The CHIP is a five-year plan to improve community health and quality of life in Miami-Dade County. It is a long-term systematic effort to address the public health concerns of the community. The CHIP aligns with national and state public health practices using Healthy People 2020, Healthy People 2030, and the State Health Improvement Plan (SHIP) as a model. The plan identifies high-impact strategic issues and desired health and public health system outcomes to be achieved by the coordinated activities of the partners who provide input. Miami-Dade County's CHIP addresses six key health priorities: Health Equity, Access to Care, Chronic Disease, Maternal Child Health, Injury, Safey and Violence, and Communicable Disease/Emergent Threats. All CHIP goals, objectives, strategies, and performance indicators are accessible at www.HealthyMiamiDade.org/resources/community-health-improvement-plan/ . The CHIP serves as a framework for continuous health improvement in the local public health system by choosing strategic issue areas. It is not intended to be an exhaustive and static document. Evaluations on progress is ongoing through quarterly reports and discussion with community partners. The CHIP will continue to change and evolve as new information and insight emerge at the local, state and national levels. Miami-Dade County is at a critical juncture in public health as significant health challenges arise and persist such as the opioid crisis, Zika virus, HIV epidemic, limited access to care, health and socioeconomic disparities, mental health, as well as the prevalence of obesity, chronic disease, nicotine use, and many others. The local public health system must continue to join forces with community-based organizations to make a concerted effort to strengthen capacity, advance health equity, and make significant strides to improve, promote and protect health. Through partnerships, public health goals are more likely to beachieved and meaningful changes created that lead to healthier living standards for residents. The 2019-2024 CHIP is aligned with and includes Community Health Assessment data that has been recently collected through the MAPP process. 14 Revised 4-26-2022 DEMOGRAPHICS MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA AND FLORIDA DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE According to the 2016-2020 US Census American Community Survey 5-year estimates1, Miami-Dade County has 2,705,528 residents.

From this assessment, we did a further dive into the research using Miami Matters to learn more about our communities. Miami Matters is an online interactive platform that was launched in 2010 as an initiative of the Health Council of Soth Florida (HCSF). This online resource provides reputable easy to use data to understand the health and quality of life indicators for our South Florida community . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \"social determinants of health (SDOH) are the conditions in which we are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age.\" These factors have a profound impact on people's health, overall wellbeing, and quality of life. They contribute to wide health disparities and inequities. They influence the opportunities available to us to practice healthy behaviors and lifestyle choices. In this section we will highlight disparities and health inequities in specific Miami-Dade County Clusters (neighborhoods) and throughout Miami-Dade County as a whole. We wanted to highlight this section as a priority in which community partners and many community-based organizations in sectors like education, transportation, and housing can begin to take action to improve the conditions in people's environments in Miami-Dade. It is also important to highlight in 2021, the Florida Department of Health in Miami-Dade County was awarded by the CDC the \"National Initiative to Address COVID-19 Health Disparities Among Populations at High-Risk and Underserved, Including Racial and Ethnic Minority Populations and Rural Communities\" grant. The purpose of the grant is to address COVID-19 related health disparities and to advance health equity. This will be accomplished through the selection of interventions using two strategies. The first strategy focuses on to build, leverage, and expand infrastructure support for COVID-19 prevention and control among populations that are at higher risk and underserved. This will create infrastructure designed to lay a foundation for future response. The second strategy seeks to mobilize partners and collaborators to advance health equity in Miami-Dade and to address the social determinants of health to influence the opportunities available to expand access and resources to care to be able to practice healthy behaviors and lifestyle choices that increase overall quality of life. DISPARITIES BY MIAMI-DADE CLUSTERS The first indicator that will be highlighted in this section is the Percent of Population Living Below Federal Poverty Level (FPL). There are two clusters that should be noted when discussing this indicator. The first is Cluster 10, which has the highest rate of Families living below the FPL with an average of 30.1%. This rate is partly due to Opa-Locka's significant rate of 47.2% of their population living below the FPL. The second cluster, Cluster 5 has an average of 21.23%. Similar to Cluster 10, one region factors heavily into this rate which is Brownsville with 40.2% of families living below the poverty line. The second indicator that will be discussed in regard to our clusters is linguistic isolation\u2014 which translates to the concept where all household members over the age of 14 are not fluent in English. This becomes a major barrier when maneuvering through health and education systems as well as within the workforce. Cluster 9 and Cluster 13 have the highest rates of linguistic isolation with regions with linguistic isolation rates above 40%. The last indicator that we will examine is the percentage of adults and children with health insurance. Health insurance, or lack thereof, can contribute to one's health in a significant manner. With rising medical costs, health insurance can eliminate the financial barrier to care that many face. Fortunately, Miami-Dade Clusters have high rates of children being insured with the lowest percentage being 92% for Cluster 2. Unfortunately, adult health insurance rates are significantly 20 Revised 4-26-2022 lower among our clusters with the highest percentage being 87.2% (Clusters 2 and 4) and the lowest being 64.6% (Cluster 9). DISPARITIES BY MIAMI-DADE COUNTY Miami-Dade, is home to a diverse population with diverse needs. Unfortunately, many have limited access to care or services or have other barriers preventing them from achieving a healthy lifestyle. One of the biggest disparities that this region faces is in regard to Years of Potential Lives Lost (YPLL). YPLL estimates the number of life years lost due to premature death by subtracting the age at death from a life expectancy of 75 years. When examining 2020 premature mortality, Black residents lost 2,410 years of potential life years more than White residents. Black or African American population health outcomes have been significantly different than other populations within the region. Moreover, some of the most notable disparities fall within the Maternal and Child Health section. For instance, in 2020, the Black infant mortality rate [IMR] was over four times higher than the White IMR\u2014 11 and 2.6 infant deaths per 1,000 live births respectively. Over time the White IMR has been improving while the Black IMR has been worsening. Unfortunately, this trend of significantly higher rates in comparison to other groups is seen in pre-term births and low- birth-weight births as well. The 2020 Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) statistics also show this disparity with Black or African American residents in Miami-Dade with 60.1 maternal deaths per 100,000. This is more than four times higher than the White population in Miami-Dade (14.2 deaths per 100,000). Outside of the maternal and child health realm we find that African American/ Black population death rates are significantly higher than White populations in many of the indicators highlighted in this report. This includes death rates for HIV/AIDS, and certain cancers such as breast and prostate cancer. One that stands out is the Age-Adjusted Death Rate for Diabetes. Black populations in Miami-Dade had a rate of 61.4 deaths per 100,000 whereas White populations have a rate of 22.3 per 100,000. Notable disparities are also found within the socio-economic field. As reported in the homelessness section of this Community Health Assessment--while black persons represent 18% of Miami-Dade County's general population, they comprise 56% of the homeless population. In terms of high school graduation rates we find that American Indian or Alaska Native persons the lowest graduation rate. In 2020 the graduation rate for this group was 84.1% while their white counterparts was 91.7%. The last disparity we will discuss in this section is food insecurity; an important social determinant of health. According to Florida Health Charts, this indicator is the percentage of the population that does not have a consistent access to enough food for an active and healthy life. This rate also refers to a lack of available financial resources for food at the household level. In 2019, the food insecurity rate in Miami-Dade County was 16.1%. When looking at the child food insecurity rate in Miami-Dade, it was 22.9% in 2019. This rate refers to the percentage of children under the age of 18 years old who do not have a stable source and access to food. Tracking the food insecurity rate is extremely important because low-income families are affected by this at multiple levels with overlapping issues. Some of these other issues they may be experiencing include a lack of affordable housing, social isolation, chronic or acute health problems, high medical costs, and low wages. Those experiencing food insecurity usually consume a nutrient-poor diet. This may contribute to the development of obesity, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and other chronic diseases that may affect their overall health and lifestyle. CONCLUSION As a result of this data, our efforts have focused heavily on advancing health equity throughout Miami-Dade County. These efforts are especially focused in areas where inequities, health, and racial disparities exists. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation defines health equity as the \"means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible. 21 Revised 4-26-2022 This requires removing obstacles to health such as poverty, discrimination, and their consequences, including powerlessness and lack of access to good jobs with fair pay, quality education and housing, safe environments, and health care.\" From this research, we will continue to monitor and evaluate these trends closely to continue our efforts to make the greatest impact in our community. Social determinants of health have a major impact on health outcomes\u2014especially for the most vulnerable populations. Healthy People 2030 defines social determinants of health as \"conditions in the environments in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks.\" Healthy People 2030 has an overarching increased focus on how these conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age affect health. In Miami-Dade County we align our work with these efforts at the federal, state, and local level to achieve a healthier community. Overall it is important to keep in mind the environment as well as the social determinants in order to achieve health equity in Miami-Dade. 22 Revised 4-26-2022 LOCALLY AVAILABLE RESOURCES There is a breadth of locally-based health resources available to community members throughout Miami-Dade County, from behavioral health to parental support services. DOH Miami-Dade recently compiled a list of local providers into an interactive community resource map that is available online . The resources listed here are primarily located in the Homestead and South Miami region, since this area has been identified by the Community Themes and Strengths Assessment as an area of high need. However, many of these organizations have footprints that extend throughout the whole county. The organizations are categorized under nine labels: 1. Behavioral Health Resources 2.

These massive efforts are undertaken using a collaborative approach between the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin's Population Health Institute. According to the County Health Rankings website, \"the rankings are compiled using county-level measures from a variety of national and state data sources. These measures are standardized and combined using scientifically-informed weights.\" While the methodology of creating the County Health Rankings are detailed, the information gained from these rankings, the quality of the data, and the applicability to communities are invaluable. Below in Figure 1, you will find the framework for the Rankings. When visiting countyhealthrankings.org, each of the fields in the framework provides a more detailed explanation of how they are used to influence policies and programs, health factors, and health outcomes. The DOH-Miami-Dade has used the County Health Rankings for many years as a guiding principle for the implementation of health initiatives within the community. Figure 1: County Health Rankings Framework County Health Rankings Model \u00a9 2016 UWPHI 24 Revised 4-26-2022 COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS AND ROADMAPS Programs and initiatives have strongly contributed to the increase in healthy behaviors for both residents and visitors in Miami-Dade County. For example, through a collaboration between the DOH-Miami-Dade and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we applied and received the Partnerships to Improve Community Health Grant. DOH-Miami-Dade implemented projects towards increasing the awareness and importance of creating tobacco-free environments, access to healthier food options, physical activity and encouraging access to care. Targeted initiatives were implemented in areas with high chronic disease rates including Active Design elements, healthy hubs, healthy restaurants, and smoke free housing. Through the work of this collaboration, residents were introduced to healthy behaviors and were provided with education to help them lead healthier, happier lives. Of note, per the County Health Ranking's Website, the below rankings and metrics were unaffected by COVID-19 as the data used to calculate the rankings are from 2021 and earlier.

The first chart below highlights data shared from the 2021 County Health Rankings and indicates how Miami-Dade County compares with both Florida rates and national targets. When considering other factors that influence community health, Miami-Dade County continues to need some improvement in several areas. The County Health Rankings offer several sub-categories that examine overall rankings when compared to other Florida counties. It should be noted that with the Sub- Category chart, data from previous years are available on the County Health Rankings website but have not been included in this report. Exclusion is related to a methodology change from previous years, making yearly comparison less accurate. 2021 County Health Rankings Snapshot of Health Outcomes Health Outcomes Indicators Miami- Dade County, FL Florida National Target Direction Needed to Meet Target Mortality Indicator Premature Death \"Years of potential life lost before age 75 per 100,000 population\" 5,200 7,200 5,400 - Morbidity Indicator Poor or Fair Health (age adjusted) \"Percent of adults reporting fair or poor health\" 24% 20% 14% Poor physical health days (age adjusted) \"Average number of physically unhealthy days reported in past 30 days\" 4.2% 4% 3.4% Poor mental health days (age adjusted) \"Average number of mentally unhealthy days reported in past 30 days\" 4.1% 4.2% 3.8% Low County Health Rankings for Miami-Dade County, FL Health Outcomes and Health Factors Sub-Category 2021 Rankings Health Outcomes Length of Life 1 Quality of Life 17 Health Factors Health Behaviors 1 Clinical Care 60 Social and Economic Factors 24 Physical Environment 63 Source: County Health Rankings Report 2021 (www.countyhealthrankings.org) 26 Revised 4-26-2022 CONSORTIUM FOR A HEALTHIER MIAMI-DADE In the area of public health, one agency alone cannot do the enormous task of influencing the entire population; however, through collaboration, the Consortium's vision of a healthy environment, healthy lifestyles and a healthy community for all Miami-Dade County residents and visitors will be fulfilled. The Consortium for a Healthier Miami-Dade was established in 2003 by the Miami-Dade County Health Department to address the increasing rate of chronic disease in the community. The Consortium is comprised of seven committees and is guided by the goals and objectives established in Healthy People 2030. Over 400 organizations particpate, all united by the common belief that through collaboration and prevention- focused initiatives, Miami-Dade County residents can live longer, healthier and happier lives. Overall goals of the Consortium include: Integrate planning and assessment to maximize partnerships. Increase the percentage of adults and children who are at a healthy weight. Build and revitalize communities so people can live healthy lives. Increase access to resources that promote healthy behaviors. The seven committees of the Consortium for a Healthier Miami-Dade are the Children Issues/Oral Health, Elder Issues/Mayor's Initiative on Aging, Health and the Built Environment, Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, Marketing and Membership, Tobacco-Free Workgroup, and Worksite Wellness. Each of these committees share collective goals. Prevention through education and the support of policies, systems, and environmental changes that encourage healthy living Reducing and eliminating health disparities among high-risk populations Provision of educational forums, programs, and screenings Collaboration and leveraging of resources Implementation of evidence-based practices, community-focused programs, and services Increasing access to health services, healthy foods, and environments The DOH-Miami-Dade knows and understands that there must be many partners and collaborative relationships to address public health effectively. For us, public health is a network of partners working together. Other agencies, non- governmental organizations, institutions, informal associations, local communities, and individuals play critical roles in creating environments in which people can be healthy. Figure 2: How Essential Public Health Services Engage one Another Image Courtesy of NACCHO 27 Revised 4-26-2022 10 ESSENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES 2020 UPDATE The 10 Essential Public Health Services (EPHS) was recently revised on September 9, 2020. This framework was revised as a result of a collaborative effort by the Public Health National Center for Innovations (PHNCI) and the de Beaumont Foundation. These two organizations brought together a task force of public health experts, leaders, and practitioners. During this meeting they engaged the public health community in activities to inform these changes. The EPHS was first released in 1994 and now recently updated in 2020. The revised version of the 10 Essential Services is intended to bring the framework more in alignment with current and future public health practice. One of the main key elements to highlight from this update is health equity being included and encompassing throughout the whole 10 Essential Public Health Services process. The following include a list of the previous and updated 10 Essential Public Health Services framework for public health to protect and promote the health of all people in all communities . Previous Version 2020 Version 1. Monitor health status to identify and solve community health problems 2. Diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the community 3. Inform, educate, and empower people about health issues 4. Mobilize community partnerships and action to identify and solve health problems 5. Develop policies and plans that support individual and community health efforts 6. Enforce laws and regulations that protect health and ensure safety 7. Link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of health care when otherwise unavailable 8. Assure competent public and personal health care workforce 9. Evaluate effectiveness, accessibility, and quality of personal and population-based health services 10. Research for new insights and innovative solutions to health problems 1. Assess and monitor population health status, factors that influence health, and community needs and assets 2. Investigate, diagnose, and address health problems and hazards affecting the population 3.

Assure an effective system that enables equitable access to the individual services and care needed to be healthy 8. Build and support a diverse and skilled public health workforce 9. Improve and innovate public health functions through ongoing evaluation, research, and continuous quality improvement 10. Build and maintain a strong organizational infrastructure for public health 28 Revised 4-26-2022 10 ESSENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES 2020 UPDATE It's important to note that the surveys and data collection processed used in this Community Health Assessment reflect the previous version of the 10 Essential Public Health Services. Social Determinants of Health The Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) are the factors and conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality of life outcomes and risks. The social determinants of health can be grouped into 5 categories. These include: Economic Stability, Education Access and Quality, Health Care Access and Quality, Neighborhood and Built Environment, and Social and Community Context. It is important for community stakeholders to understand these factors influence the opportunities available to the community to practice healthy behaviors and lifestyle choices. The World Health Organization (WHO) states the social determinants of health are mostly responsible for health inequities. These are the unfair and avoidable differences in health status. These factors are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, and local levels. It is important to highlight that resources can enhance quality of life can have a significant influence on population health outcomes. 29 Revised 4-26-2022 MOBILIZING FOR ACTION THROUGH PLANNING AND PARTNERSHIPS MAPP PROCESS UPDATE The next upcoming MAPP Cycle will evolve from six phases to three phases. The table to the right includes the previous MAPP framework and the new revised framework. This cycle will build on the MAPP foundation principles especially related to community power and health equity. This process will be using a health equity lens and going beyond the social determinants of health while looking at the root causes and health inequities that exists in our community. DOH-Miami-Dade has taken the lead on implementing community-based assessments to identify the needs of the community, emerging trends and issues in public health. One of the best frameworks to use is the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP). The MAPP framework was developed by the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) as an evidenced based tool to help communities think strategically through the various levels of planning and assessment when it comes to health assessments. Though in the next MAPP process the new framework will be implemented. The process described below is the process that is currently used to inform this CHA. The MAPP process consists of six phases described below. It should be noted that DOH-Miami-Dade participated in each of the six phases as outlined in the MAPP process. Phase 1: Organize for Success/Partnership Development- Many partnerships formed through local efforts to help gain support and buy-in from the community for the MAPP process and the steps that proceed this phase. This phase is crucial because it will lay the foundation for creating firm commitments from organizations and stakeholders. Phase 2: Visioning- During the Visioning stage, DOH-Miami-Dade worked collaboratively with community and local organizations to ensure that key members were involved in the MAPP planning process. Phase 3: Four MAPP Assessments- Phase 3 of the MAPP process involves primary data is collection through the utilization of locally administered assessments- the Local Public Health System Assessment, Forces of Change Assessment, and the Community Themes and Strengths Assessment. The final of the four assessments is the Community Health Status Assessment which is utlizes secondary data collection. Each assessment is explained in detail in subsequent sections. Phase 4: Identify Strategic Issues- Results of the four assessments are analyzed to help identify the overarching needs of the community. Community partners help to prioritize the strategic areas and narrow the focus. Phase 5: Formulate Goals and Strategies- Phase 5 forms written goals and identifies participants who can work to effectively address each goal. Phase 6: Action Cycle- During this phase planning, implementation, and evaluation are brought together in a model for that is like a continuous quality improvement.

Before our community embraced the MAPP process, the DOH-Miami-Dade utilized the Planned Approach to Community Health (PATCH) methodology. PATCH was developed by the CDC to help state and local public health agencies in their partnerships with local communities to plan, conduct and evaluate health promotion and disease prevention programs. The PATCH process had five phases: mobilizing the community, collecting and organizing data, choosing health priorities, developing a comprehensive intervention plan and evaluation. The Consortium for a Healthier Miami-Dade utilized this methodology at its inception. The entire process took five years to implement and served as the foundation for the work of the multi-sectoral group. Because of this process, the group was able to develop its mission which is to be a significant catalyst for healthy living through the support and strengthening of policy, systems, and environments and has a shared vision of a healthy environment, healthy lifestyles, and healthy community. Additionally, during this five-year period, certain products were developed along with various initiatives. See Table 1 for details.

A second MAPP phase was completed in 2012. During the 2012 session, Consortium members and representatives from other organizations were invited to participate in several meetings where the group was asked the following questions: What does a healthy Miami-Dade County mean to you? How do you envision the Miami-Dade County community in 10-15 years? What are important characteristics of a healthy community for all who live, work, and play here? Participants envisioned that in 10-15 years Miami-Dade County would have adequate and affordable primary care for its residents. Additionally, they envisioned a community where emergency room (ER) visits for treatable conditions were reduced. Participants were able to articulate their desire for a healthy community, which included taking a holistic approach to health across the lifespan. The group envisioned a community where all families were able to thrive equitably and all communities within Miami-Dade would possess environmental assets that motivate residents to make healthy choices. The participants indicated that the approach to providing care needed to change from a treatment model to a wellness model, with access to healthy foods, opportunities to decrease stress, and increase socialization.

In conjunction with other assessments by DOH-Miami-Dade, the information gathered from the focus groups will assist in identifying areas of concern that residents face in their communities and allocate needed resources accordingly, which can help in improving the quality of life for all Miami-Dade County residents. This effort is part of the 2018 Miami-Dade County Community Themes and Strengths Assessment championed by the DOH-Miami-Dade. The use of focus groups in qualitative analysis is widely recommended by experts, as it allows participants to share their knowledge and experience of the community with facilitators, which could subsequently be utilized to support relevant programs or policy development to improve the lives of those involved. Focus group participants represented 13 clusters in Miami-Dade County (12 neighborhood clusters and one oversampled cluster), which comprised of zip codes linked according to perceived community identity and geographic contiguity. At times the clusters crossed boundaries based on socioeconomic status or population size and were identified in previous assessments of Miami-Dade County.2 The sample size of each focus group ranged from 3 to 16, with the smallest amount of participants from Cluster 12 (Aventura/Miami Beach) and the largest group from Cluster 11 (North Miami Beach). The focus groups were conducted in public library branches or other community-based locations throughout the county with a total of 92 residents participating in the focus group sessions. Gender was the only demographic variable collected with 65.2% of participants being female and 34.8% male. Additional demographic information was not collected from participants in this assessment. The focus group questions were designed by the DOH-Miami-Dade and the HCSF and consisted of the following seven topics: length of time living in Miami-Dade County, size of residents' home to accommodate their families; racial diversity in residents' neighborhoods/communities; availability and accessibility of healthy food options, safety, health service utilization; and residents' perceptions on how the community could be improved. Participants were recruited voluntarily until the target sample size (a minimum of 3 per focus group) was reached. Each focus group session was recorded for transcription, and any identifying information, such as participants' name, was not recorded. Before the commencement of the focus group sessions, participants were informed about the purpose of the assessment, and given instructions on the process involved in obtaining their feedback to the pre-selected questions. Participants were not compensated for their time. The analysis of all qualitative data gathered during the focus group sessions was carried out in NVIVO 12 Plus Pro software, a tool designed to identify social themes that emerge from key-informant or face-to-face interviews as well as from focus group sessions. The full Community Themes and Strength Assessments survey analysis will be available June 2019. Survey Demographics Due to the size and diversity of Miami-Dade County, one of the methodologies used was to stratify the county into 13 distinct areas or clusters. Each of these clusters is representative of the unique makeup of Miami-Dade County and allows for all communities to be represented in the survey. 59 Revised 4-26-2022 NEIGHBORHOOD CLUSTERS Gender For this survey, Miami-Dade County has been broken up into thirteen clusters (12 neighborhood clusters and one oversampled cluster) made up of ZIP codes linked according to perceived community identity and geographic contiguity, but at times also cross boundaries based upon socioeconomic status or population counts. The oversampled cluster is made up of zip codes representing the most economically and socially deprived neighborhoods, many of which also suffer from the highest rates of hospitalization for preventable conditions. Figure 1: Gender Across 13 Clusters in Miami-Dade County2 Gender distribution across most of the 13 clusters is similar, with a slightly larger percentage of female residents compared to male residents; however, there is a larger proportion of males in South Dade/Homestead, Miami Shores/Morningside, and Aventura/Miami Beach. 2 U.S. Bureau of the Census.

The cluster with the highest percentage of uninsured is Brownsville/Coral Gables/Coconut Grove (31.72%) followed by North Downtown/East Little Havana/Liberty City/Little Haiti/Overtown (29.10%). Of note is that every cluster in Miami-Dade County, with the exception of Coral Gables/Kendall, has a higher uninsured rate than the United States as a whole. From 2012-2016, the United States had an uninsured rate of 11.7% on average14. 12 The SocioNeeds Index summarizes multiple socio-economic indicators into one composite score for easier identification of high need areas by zip code or county. The SocioNeeds Index is calculated for a community from several social and economic factors, ranging from poverty to education, that may impact health or access to care. The index is correlated with potentially preventable hospitalization rates. 13 U.S. Bureau of the Census. American Community Survey [Internet]. Washington, D.C.: United States Government; 2012-2016.

Finally, 71.3% responded that they are employed full-time while 11.5% responded that they are employed part-time. A total of 13.0% responded that they are in school, 4.6% unemployed, and 6.8% retired. These employment numbers are not mutually exclusive, meaning that a person could respond that they are both employed full-time and part-time or that they are in school but also work part-time. 72 Revised 4-26-2022 Table 4: 2019 Miami-Dade Wellbeing Survey Economic Characteristics Count Percentage Household Income Less than $10,000 297 Situation Rent 1,039 32.2% Own 1,695 52.5% Live with someone but do not own or rent 357 11.1% Other 135 4.2% Employment Employed Full-time 2,299 71.3% Employed 372 11.5% School 420 Unemployed 147 4.6% Retired 219 6.8% Other 304 9.4% CONCLUSION The initial geographic, demographic and socioeconomic analysis of respondents to the 2019 Miami-Dade County Wellbeing Survey indicate a geographically distributed, racially and ethnically diverse cohort. Sample size by cluster were determined a priori with the goal of collecting 220 (7.4%) respondents in each cluster except for an oversampled cluster in Downtown/East Little Havana/Liberty City/Little Haiti/Overtown, which historically has been underrepresented, that would have 330 respondents (11.1%). Ultimately, the by cluster distribution does not perfectly follow the proposed distribution. To account for these discrepancies, post-stratification weighting will be utilized to ensure the sample is properly representative of Miami-Dade County as a whole in the larger analysis. This will allow for larger considerations regarding the health and wellbeing of Miami-Dade County residents as a result of the 2018 Miami-Dade County Wellbeing Survey. Limitations The 2018-2019 Miami-Dade Wellbeing Survey has several limitations. This survey was distributed through the Florida Department of Health in Miami-Dade County with several employees completing the survey. To minimize biases, these surveys are excluded from the analysis. Furthermore, a few of the questions were not made exclusive, allowing more than one answer where a single answer would typically seem appropriate. Therefore, total percentages for Race and Primary Language are greater than 100%. 73 Revised 4-26-2022 MAPP PHASE 3: SECONDARY DATA COLLECTION COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT (CHSA) The Community Health Status Assessment is an assessment that is used to provide a detailed summary of the health and wellbeing of our residents and community over some time. It involves examining data from a variety of reputable sources as noted below. While this is not an exhaustive list, each of the indicated data sources provides relevant information related to the morbidity and mortality rates for Miami-Dade County residents as well as specific information for a variety of environmental factors that influence the health of community residents. The use of such data allows the DOH-Miami- Dade to see county-level data and comparisons to peer counties, state and national rates.

Much of the data used for this assessment were accessed from FLCHARTS, which is a tool developed in 2005 to help communities obtain the needed data for strategic planning and community assessments. FLCHARTS includes data from more than 35 resources. Data pulled from FLCHARTS are utilized to calculate rates based on multiple years of data, ensuring validity of the indicators by using strategies including but not limited to 3-year rolling rates. All indicators included for Miami-Dade County, Florida were included to show the health status of the county and show a comparison, when available, to peer counties, state and national rates. Many of the targets that have been set with some of the indicators is in direct alignment with the Healthy People 2020 and 2030 goals for which Miami-Dade County strives to achieve or exceed. It should be further noted that while rates are provided for indicators, the statistical significance for each of the indicators was not calculated. More information can be found online related to rolling rates, statistical significance and how online data sources obtain their information. As a final part of analysis, a variety of resources are used to obtain the secondary data, none of the data sources used such as the County Health Rankings, U.S. Census, FLCHARTS, BRFSS etc. endorse the work included in this document. The views shared within this document are the work of DOH-Miami-Dade. 74 Revised 4-26-2022 HEALTH OUTCOMES LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH The most data regarding the leading causes of death for the United States was published in the annual report of the CDC Health, United States, 2019 from the National Vital Statistics ( www.cdc.gov/nchs ). Presented in the table below includes the Top 10 Leading Causes of Death in the United States and the rates for these causes in Miami-Dade and Florida. As presented in this report, the preliminary leading causes of death in the U.S 2019 included: heart disease, cancer, covid-19, unintentional injuries, chronic lower respiratory diseases, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis and influenza and pneumonia. Cancer and heart disease are the top 2 causes of death across the all three geographies in the table below.

This table shows the top Leading causes of death (mortality rate per 100,000 population) by age group in Miami-Dade County, FL in 2020. When segmented by age, unintentional injuries contributed to most deaths among those aged 15 - 44 in Miami-Dade County. Cancer was the leading cause of death among those aged 45 - 74 while heart disease was the leading cause among those aged 75+. Notably, COVID-19 became one of the top three leading causes for all age groups over 35 years old. 76 Revised 4-26-2022 HEALTH OUTCOMES YEARS OF POTENTIAL LIFE LOST Indicator: Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) before age 75 per 100,000 population. Why is this important? Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) is a measure of premature mortality defined as \"the number of years of life lost among persons who die before a given age\" meaning the number of years that an individual was expected to live beyond his or her death. The County Health Rankings and Roadmaps use YPLL to capture preventable deaths. It emphasizes the deaths of younger persons. The Florida Department of Health sets the age reference at 75 years based on life expectancy, so individuals who die before 75 years of age lost potential years of life. YPLL allows communities to target resources to high- risk areas and further investigate the causes of premature death. The YPLL rate in Miami-Dade County, FL has been generally decreasing. The recent 2019 YPLL rates for Miami-Dade County, FL do remain significantly lower compared to the peer counties average rate and Florida. The following charts break down YPLL rate by Race, Gender and Ethnicity. 2016 2017 2018 Life Lost <75 per 100,000 population <75 Note: Select peer counties include Broward, Hillsborough, Orange, and Palm Beach.

The average YPPL is more than two times greater for the black population as compared to the white population in Miami-Dade County. Additionally the disparity in the YPLL between the black and white population in Miami-Dade County is consistently much greater than the disparity overall across the state.

Why is this Important? Unintentional injury is an injury not intended as self-harm or as intentional harm to another person. Unintentional injuries refer to harm caused by accidents, falls, blows, burns, weapons and more (FLCHARTS). In the United States, millions of people injure themselves every year. Unintentional injury is the seventh leading cause of death in Miami-Dade County for 2020. Nationally, unintentional injury is the number one cause of death for people aged 1 to 44 years of age, regardless of sex, race or ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. More information on unintentional injuries can be accessed via: www.cdc.gov/injury . Note: Orange County was selected to compare to Miami -Dade County because it had the best performance of all peer counties.

Why is this important? Motor vehicle deaths are occupants killed in transport accidents. Motor vehicle fatalities and injuries vary according to the demographic characteristics of the victims, geographic region, and risk factors associated with crashes. Motor vehicle crash mortality information is used by local governments and organizations to identify areas in need and to designate available resources. According to the CDC, motor vehicle related deaths result in an estimated $55 billion in medical and work loss costs annually. The Healthy People 2020 national health target is to reduce the deaths caused by motor vehicle crashes to 12.4 deaths per 100,000 population and the Healthy People 2030 target is to reduce deaths to 10.1 deaths per 100,000 population. Miami-Dade County's 2020 rate of 11.4 deaths per 100,000 population meets the 2020 goal but not the 2030 goal.

Why is this Important? This indicator measures drowning while in or falling into a body of water (e.g. bathtub, swimming pools, natural water or tank/reservoir). This measure does not include water transport related to drowning. According to the CDC, every year there are an estimated 3,960 fatal unintentional drownings a year, averaging 11 drowning deaths per year. The CDC states that certain people are at higher risk of drowning. Children ages 1-4 have the highest drowning rate. Nearly 80% of people who die from drowning are male, and drowning rates for black people are 1.5 times higher than for white people. Additionally the following factors make drowning more likely; not being able to swim, missing or ineffective fences around water, lack of close supervision,not wearing life jackets and drinking alcohol or having taken certain drugs or prescription medications. Notably, more than half of fatal and nonfatal drowning occur in natural waters. Miami-Dade County has an oceanic coast and is a tourist location for being on the ocean. Miami-Dade County's unintentional drowning rate has decreased over the past 5 years. 2019 rates remain lower than Florida rates and select Peer Counties rates. The Healthy People 2020 national health target is to reduce the deaths caused by unintentional drowning to 1.1 deaths per 100,000 population. Miami-Dade County's 2020 rate of 1.4 deaths per 100,000 population did not meet the national health target. Healthy People 2030 does not have a goal for unintentional drowning. Note: Because several counties had rates of 0 in 2019, a quartile map was unable to be generated for 2019 alone, therefore 3 year data was used.

Why is this Important? Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States and the eighth leading cause of death among those in Miami-Dade County. The CDC defines suicide as \"death caused by self-directed injurious behavior\" with an intent to die as a result of the action. Many factors contribute to suicide among those with and without known mental health conditions. A combination of individual, relationship, community, and societal factors contribute to the risk of suicide. Risk factors are those characteristics associated with suicide\u2014they might not be direct causes. Between 1999 and 2016, suicide rates have increased in nearly every state. Miami-Dade County's suicide death rate has fluctuated over the past 5 years but has ultimately decreased since 2016 . The most recent rates remain lower than Florida rates and select Peer Counties Average rates. The Healthy People 2030 target for reducing the suicide rate is 12.8 suicides per 100,000 population.

Why is this important? The annual birth rate is the rate at which the population grows due to births within a one-year time period. The birth rate is an item of interest because it provides a standardized measure for monitoring the general increase or decrease in births. According to FLCHARTS, it defines live births as the number of births to women who live in Florida. The rate is the ratio between births and the specified population. When applied specifically to age groups, such as teens, or geographic areas, such as states, counties or countries, one can make comparisons between them. To plan for the current and future needs of generations, public health professionals track trends in birth rates.

Live births - tobacco use during pregnancy (maternal smoking) measures the number of mothers who smoked during pregnancy. It is expressed as a percentage of births. This is measured because smoking during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of low birth weight and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Eliminating smoking before pregnancy is one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk of low birth weight, SIDS and other infant health problems. For more information on maternal smoking, please visit the CDC's website: https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/health_effects/pregnancy/index.htm Overall , Miami-Dade County's maternal smoking rates have remained low, under 0.5 for the period of 2016-2020 with an increase in 2019.

Babies with a low birth weight (LBW) are born weighing less than 5 pounds, 5 ounces (<2500 grams). A LBW infant can be born too small, too early, or both. Birthweight is one of the strongest predictors of an infant's health and survival. LBW is unique as a health outcome because it represents multiple factors: infant current and future morbidity, as well as premature mortality risk, and maternal exposure to health risks. In terms of the infant's health outcomes, LBW serves as a predictor of premature mortality or morbidity over the life course. LBW children have greater developmental and growth problems, are at higher risk of heart disease later in life, have a greater rate of respiratory conditions, and have higher rates of cognitive problems such as cerebral palsy, visual, auditory, and intellectual impairments. Health inequities in LBW caused by inequities between groups of mothers having access to prenatal care, exposures to environmental risk factors, and risk behaviors. The proportion of babies born at a LBW is lower in Miami-Dade County than Florida. The Healthy People 2020 national health goal was to reduce the proportions of infants born with LBW to 7.8%. With a most recent rate of 8.2%, Miami-Dade County did not meet the national target. Healthy People 2030 does not have an objective regarding low birth weight.

Early and regular prenatal care helps identify conditions and behaviors that can result in low birth weight infants. Per CDC, expectant mothers can: 1.) Get preconception health care and early prenatal care throughout the pregnancy to identify and modify health behaviors (e.g. lack of weight gain, quit smoking, stop drinking alcohol and using drugs) 2.) Work with a health care provider to control chronic diseases and 3.) Take prenatal vitamins that contain 400 micrograms of folic acid before and throughout pregnancy. However, a disparity is observed when comparing the proportion of low birth weight babies by maternal age and race; more than twice the proportion of low birth weight babies are born to Black teen mothers than White teen mothers in Miami-Dade County.

Why is this important? Infant mortality is the death of an infant before his or her first birthday. The infant mortality rate (IMR) is the number of infant deaths for every 1,000 live births. IMR is an important marker of the overall health in society. In 2020, the leading causes of death among infants in the United States were: Congenital Malformations, Disorders related to short gestation and low birthweight, unintentional injury, SIDS and maternal complications of pregnancy. Preconception health and health care focus on things you can do before and between pregnancies to increase the chances of having a healthy baby. The key national strategy that has an impact on women's and infant's overall health is improving perinatal care. The CDC offers provision to perinatal quality collaboratives (PQCs), state networks, that work together to improve health outcomes for mothers and babies. Visit the CDC website for more information on infant mortality. https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/infantmortality-cdcdoing.htm The IMR for Miami-Dade County has remained fairly consistent since 2016 and the county rates have remained lower than both the State and Peer County rates. The Healthy People 2020 national health target is to reduce infant mortality rates to 6.0 deaths per 1,000 live births and Healthy People 2030 is to reduce it to 5.0 deaths per 1,000 live births. Miami-Dade County's most recent rate of 4.1 deaths per 1,000 births met both goals. However, this does not tell the whole story of infant mortality as evidenced in the following chart.

Preterm birth is when a baby is born too early, before 37 weeks of pregnancy have been completed. In 2019, preterm birth affected 1 of every 10 infants born in the United States. A developing baby goes through important growth throughout pregnancy including in the nal months and weeks. For example, the brain, lungs, and liver need the nal weeks of pregnancy to fully develop. Babies born too early (especially before 32 weeks) have higher rates of death and disability.

A pregnancy-related death is defined as the death of a woman during pregnancy or within one year of the end of pregnancy from a pregnancy complication, a chain of events initiated by pregnancy, or the aggravation of an unrelated condition by the physiologic effects of pregnancy. Many factors influence pregnancy-related health outcomes. It is important for all women of reproductive age to adopt healthy lifestyles (e.g., maintain a healthy diet and weight, be physically active, quit all substance use, prevent injuries) and address any health problems before getting pregnant. A healthy pregnancy begins before conception and continues with prenatal care, along with early recognition and management of complications if they arise. Health care providers can help women prepare for pregnancy and for any potential problems during pregnancy. Early initiation of prenatal care by pregnant women, and continuous monitoring of pregnancy by health providers, are key to helping to prevent and treat severe pregnancy-related complications.

Cesarean deliveries, or C-sections, can prevent injury and death in women who are at higher risk of complicated deliveries or have unexpected complications. C-sections can also prevent injury and death in their newborns. But C-sections are linked to increased risk of infections and blood clots, and many women who aren't at higher risk for delivery complications get unnecessary C-sections. Various evidence-based strategies aimed at hospitals and health care providers can help reduce C-sections in low-risk women. Healthy People 2030 specifies that the national baseline for low-risk females with no prior birth that had a cesarean birth is 25.9% and the goal is to reduce this to 23.6%. In 2020, both Florida and Miami Dade's percentage of women with low risk pregnancy giving birth for the first time who had a cesarean section was well above the national percentage at 30.3% and 38.5% respectively.

This indicator measures gonorrhea, chlamydia, and infectious syphilis. Why is this Important? Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), also known as sexually transmitted infections or STIs, refer to more than 25 infectious diseases that are transmitted primarily from one person to another through sexual activity including vaginal, oral, and anal sex. In Florida, three bacterial STDs are reportable to the Department of Health: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. According to the CDC's Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance 2019 report (published April 2021), there were nearly 1.8 million cases of chlamydia, 616,392 cases of gonorrhea, and 129, 813 cases of syphilis were diagnosed. Congenital syphilis increased 279% from 2015 to 2019, and caused 128 infant deaths in 2019. Most STDs affect both men and women, but in many cases the health problems they cause can be more severe for women Bacterial STDs can result in infertility, pain, and discharge. If a pregnant woman has an STD, it can cause serious health problems for the baby including miscarriage and stillbirth. Correct usage of condoms reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading STDs. For more information on prevention and treatment for all STDs, please visit the following CDC website: www.cdc.gov/std/ . The Miami-Dade County STD rates have increased over time similarly to the Florida rate. Recent STD rates for the County are higher than the Florida rate.

Why is this Important? HIV is a viral infection that gradually destroys the immune system. AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) is the final and most serious stage of HIV disease, which causes severe damage to the immune system. According to the CDC, HIV is spread mainly through anal or vaginal sex or by sharing drug-use equipment (e.g., needles) with an infected person, perinatal transmission, or breastmilk. Some populations in the United States are more likely to get HIV than others because of many factors including their risky behaviors, the status of their sex partners, and where they live. Per the CDC, there are an estimated 1.1 million people living with HIV in the United States, with nearly 40,000 new diagnoses in 2019. Nationally, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino people are disproportionately affected by HIV, accounting for 42% and 29% of new diagnoses for HIV in 2019. CDC has not released national data beyond 2019. HIV/AIDS mortality rate reflects the health and wellbeing of the population as well as the quality of the healthcare available. The CDC recommends that healthcare providers routinely test everyone 13 to 64 years of age and perform repeated testing for those who are considered high risk for HIV. More information is available through the CDC's website www.cdc.gov/hiv/ . As presented above, HIV/AIDS death rates are favorably decreasing in Miami-Dade County. Rates are higher than Florida rates and Peer Counties Average rates. The Healthy People 2020 national health target is to reduce HIV infection deaths to 3.3 deaths per 100,000 population. At a recent rate of 4 per 100,000, Miami-Dade County has yet to meet this national health goal. Healthy People 2030 objectives focus on reducing new HIV infections as opposed to reducing HIV deaths. Note: Peer Counties include Broward, Hillsborough, Orange, and Palm Beach.

Miami-Dade differs from the national trend in that Non-Hispanic people have a higher death rate than Hispanic people. Since 2016 HIV/AIDS deaths have been decreasing, both overall and across population subcategories, though the rates increased slightly between 2018 and 2019. According to the CDC, the following health behaviors contribute to the risk of HIV among men: Sexual contact: Most HIV infections in men are transmitted through sexual contact specifically anal sex. Sexually transmitted diseases: The presence of some STDs greatly increase the likelihood of acquiring or transmitting HIV. Injection drug and other substance abuse: The use of sharing needles and injection drug use may increase the risk of HIV infection through injection equipment being contaminated with HIV. 97 Revised 4-26-2022 HEALTH OUTCOMES - REPORTABLE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES HIV/AIDS HIV-related stigma refers to negative beliefs, feelings and attitudes towards people living with HIV, their families, people who work with them (HIV service providers), and members of groups that have been heavily impacted by HIV, such as gay and bisexual men, homeless people, street youth, and mentally ill people. The CDC reports stigma, fear, discrimination, and homophobia may place many African Americans at higher risk for HIV. Additionally, the socioeconomic issues associated with poverty\u2014including limited access to high- quality health care, housing, and HIV prevention education\u2014directly and indirectly increase the risk for HIV infection and affect the health of people living with and at risk for HIV. These factors may explain why African Americans have worse outcomes on the HIV continuum of care, including lower rates of linkage to care and viral suppression. 98 Revised 4-26-2022 HEALTH OUTCOMES - REPORTABLE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES HIV/AIDS According to FLCHARTS, in 2020, 27,214 residents in Miami-Dade County were living with HIV - a rate of 950 per 100,000 population. This rate is higher than the statewide rate (542.9 per 100,000 population). The Florida Department of Health has identified reducing transmission of HIV as one of its seven priority goals. To achieve this goal, Florida has adopted a comprehensive strategic approach to prevent HIV transmission and strengthen patient care activities which will greatly reduce the risk of further transmission of HIV from those diagnosed and living with HIV. The four key components are 1) Implement routine HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) screening in health care settings and priority testing in non-health care settings 2) Provide rapid access to treatment and ensure retention in care (Test and Treat) 3) Improve and promote access to antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) 4)Increase HIV awareness and community response through outreach, engagement, and messaging. In Miami- Dade County, there are 60 locations that provide Counseling, Testing, Referral, nPEP and PrEP services.

This indicator measures the following vaccine preventable diseases: acute hepatitis B, diphtheria, measles, mumps, pertussis, polio, rubella, and tetanus. Why is this Important ? Vaccines are one of the ten greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. Vaccination is the procedure in which a vaccine (a preparation that contains a killed or weakened pathogen) is introduced into the body to raise an immune response against a disease-causing microbe such as a virus or bacterium. Through reducing the risk of infection, vaccines have saved billions of lives, reduced the burden of disability, and contributed to a longer lifespan. It is important to note that it does not only protect those vaccinated, but also protects your community. When a large portion of a population is vaccinated against infectious diseases, there is less opportunity for those diseases to spread from person to person. High-risk individuals (such as newborns and expectant mothers) are then provided some protection from those diseases. This concept is known as herd immunity. The Florida Department of Health recognizes that maintenance of high immunization levels contributes positively to the state's economy by keeping lower disease incidence, lower healthcare costs, ensuring travelers that they may confidently visit Florida without contracting a vaccine-preventable disease, and improves school attendance. In the United States, sustained high vaccination rates have led to a 99% and higher favorable decline in deaths from diphtheria, mumps, pertussis, and tetanus.

Why is this Important? Influenza and pneumonia continue to rank among the leading causes of death in the United States and Miami-Dade County. In 2020, influenza and pneumonia killed 3,195 Floridians, 355 of which were Miami-Dade County residents. Influenza (also known as flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by flu viruses. Most people who get the flu will recover in a few days to less than two weeks, but some people will develop complications (such as pneumonia) as a result of the flu. Populations most at risk of dying from influenza include the elderly, the very young, and the immune- compromised. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs mainly caused by bacteria, viruses, and mycoplasmas that can cause mild to severe illness in people of all ages. Populations most at risk of dying from pneumonia include people with underlying conditions and those who smoke. You can help prevent pneumonia and other respiratory infections by following good hygiene practices. These practices include washing your hands regularly and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. Making healthy choices, like quitting smoking and managing ongoing medical conditions, can also help prevent pneumonia.

Why is this important? Enteric diseases are also known as foodborne illnesses. Enteric diseases are caused by enteric bacteria that typically enter the body through the mouth. They are acquired through contaminated food and water, by contact with animals or their environments, and through by contact with the feces of an infected person. Some commonly known enteric diseases are Cholera, Typhoid Fever, Salmonella, and Escherichia Coli or E. Coli. Every year, millions of cases of foodborne illness and thousands of associated deaths occur in the United States, and the illness burden is even higher in developing countries. Each year it is estimated that 1 in 6 Americans gets sick from eating contaminated food. Many cases and deaths can be prevented through food safety practices such as handwashing and storing foods at proper temperatures. The CDC tracks foodborne illnesses and collaborates with state and local health departments and other federal agencies to investigate foodborne outbreaks. The Florida Department of Health monitors enteric diseases through state, county, and ongoing local ongoing efforts. Florida law requires medical providers to report enteric disease cases. Overall, enteric disease rates have fluctuated over time. Since 2016 the enteric disease rates have unfavorably increased with a significant decrease in 2020. Miami-Dade County has had rates consistently higher than both Florida and the average of the peer counties.

Zoonotic diseases (also known as zoonoses) are caused by infections that spread between animals and people. It can also be caused by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi. They include Rabies, Malaria, and Lyme disease. In Miami-Dade reporting, prevention and treatment of zoonotic diseases are highly tracked. Sometimes people with zoonotic infections can be very sick, but some people have no symptoms and do not ever get sick. Other people may have symptoms such as diarrhea, muscle aches, and fever. Food may also be a source for some zoonotic infections when animals such as cows and pigs infected with parasites. Every year, tens of thousands of Americans will get sick from diseases spread between animals and people. These diseases can cause sickness or death in people which is always tracked and reported by the CDC. Regular handwashing is one of the best practices to remove germs, prevent the spread of germs to others, and avoid getting sick. For more information on prevention and treatment, please visit CDC's website: www.cdc.gov/zoonotic/gi/ . Simple Steps to Protect Yourself and Your Family from Zoonotic Diseases Make sure your pet is under a veterinarian's care to help protect your pet and your family from possible parasite infections. Practice the four Ps: Pick up Pet Poop Promptly (dispose of properly) Wash your hands frequently, especially after touching animals and if in contact with animal feces. Follow proper food-handling procedures to reduce the risk of transmission from contaminated food. For people with weakened immune systems, be especially careful of contact with animals that could transmit these infections.

Why is this important? According to the CDC, \"Rabies is a preventable viral disease of mammals most often transmitted through the bite of a rabid animal\". Most rabies cases reported each year occur in wild animals like raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes. Most cases in Florida occur in these same animals which can spread to unvaccinated pets, which then pose a high risk to pet owners and their families. The rabies virus can cause a nearly 100% fatal illness in humans and other mammals, meaning within days of the onset of symptoms, the human or animal bitten will likely die from rabies. Receiving medical attention quickly after exposure has the potential to save a life. Any person exposed to rabies (e.g., a person scratched or bitten by a wild or unvaccinated mammal) must seek immediate medical attention. A consultation with the state or local health department or a health care provider will decide if an individual requires a rabies vaccination, known as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). The decision will be based on the individual's exposure, the animal the individual was exposed to, and laboratory and surveillance information for the area in which the individual was exposed. If you see a wild animal acting strangely, call your local animal control officer.

Why is this important? Zika is a disease caused by the Zika virus, spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus ). The mosquitos that spread Zika are found in many countries around the world and can bite during the day and at night. The Zika virus can also be spread from person to person through sexual contact or from a pregnant woman to her baby during pregnancy or childbirth. Many people infected with the Zika virus will not have any symptoms or will only have mild symptoms and will recover without concern. The most common symptoms are fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, and muscle pain. Symptoms can last for several days to a week. It is very rare that the illness is so severe that an individual must be hospitalized for this disease. However, Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause severe fetal brain defects such as microcephaly, a condition where a baby's brain does not develop normally, and his or her head is smaller than expected. In 2020, there were no cases in Miami-Dade or the State of Florida of Zika virus transmission by any means. However, Zika is still a threat internationally. A person who believes that they may have Zika should consult his or her health care provider. If the health care provider thinks a Zika test is appropriate based on the guidelines from the CDC and the Florida Department of Health, the person should contact their local health department for further assistance. The Florida Department of Health reminds residents and visitors that it is vital to \"Drain and Cover.\" DOH-Miami-Dade encourages everyone to take simple precautions to protect themselves and their neighbors from mosquito-borne illnesses, which have received increased attention recently in Florida. Residents are encouraged to drain standing water, wear proper clothing, and use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulated insect repellant.

Why is this important? Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Miami-Dade County and also a leading cause of death in the United States and Florida. According to FLCHARTS, cancer is a class of diseases in which a cell or a group of cells display uncontrolled growth, invasion (intrusion on and destruction of adjacent tissues), and sometimes metastasis (spread to other locations in the body via lymph or blood system). There are more than 100 different types of cancers. Classification is according to their organ or tissue of origin. Reported by the CDC, United States Cancer statistics, the most common cancers among men include prostate, lung and bronchus, and colorectal (colon), while among women they include breast, uterus, and urinary bladder. One-half of new cases of cancer occur in people aged 65 years and over. Some risk factors for cancer may be reduced through healthy behavior and lifestyle changes such as keeping a healthy body weight, avoiding tobacco use, limiting alcohol use and using proper skin protection.

Why is this important? Breast cancer is a type of disease originating from breast tissue, most commonly from the inner lining of milk ducts or the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. The most common kinds of breast cancer include cancers originating from ducts, known as ductal carcinomas and those originating from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. The second leading cause of death among women in the United States is breast cancer. While it is not as common in men, they can also develop this disease. A health care provider should conduct a clinical breast exam, explain the benefits of regular self-breast exams, and identify the appropriate time to get a mammogram (breast x-ray). Breast cancer screening allows for early detection and treatment. The breast cancer death rate in Miami-Dade County, has been slightly decreasing since 2016. The most recent cancer death rate in Miami-Dade County is lower than the state and peer county averages. The Healthy People 2020 national health target was to reduce the breast cancer death rate to 20.7 deaths per 100,000 females. The Healthy People 2030 national health target is to reduce the breast cancer death rate to 15.3 At a recent rate of 8.9 deaths per 100,000 females, Miami-Dade County has met the national health target.Note: Peer Counties include Broward, Hillsborough, Or ange, and Palm Beach.

Why is this important? Lung cancer is a disease in which cells grow out of control in the tissues of the lung. Lung cancer begins in the lungs and may spread to lymph nodes or other organs in the body, such as the brain. Cancer from other organs may also spread to the lungs. The process of metastases is when cancer cells spread from one organ to another. Lung cancers are grouped into two main types: small cell and non-small cell. These types of lung cancer grow differently and have different treatments. Most primary lung cancers are carcinomas of the lung, resulting from epithelial cells. The most common cause of lung cancer is long-term exposure to tobacco smoke. The occurrence of lung cancer in nonsmokers, who account for as many as 15% of cases, is often attributed to a combination of genetic factors, radon gas, asbestos, and air pollution including secondhand smoke. The lung cancer death rate in Miami-Dade County has been favorably decreasing since 2016. The Miami-Dade County most recent cancer death rate 2020 is significantly lower compared to the Peer Counties Average rates and the State rate. The Healthy People 2020 national health target was to reduce the lung cancer death rate to 45.5 deaths per 100,000 population and the Healthy People 2030 national health target is 25.1 per 100,000. At a most recent rate 2020 of 20.7 deaths per 100,000 population, Miami-Dade County, has met both national health targets.

Why is this important? Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States. Prostate cancer is a form of cancer that develops in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. Noted by the National Cancer Institute, in the United States about one in five men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer. Although it is one of the most prevalent types of cancer in men, it usually is slow-growing, and many never show symptoms. Prostate cancer tends to develop in older men who are of 50 years of age and older, are African American, or who have had a family member like a father, brother, or son who has had prostate cancer. Since men with the condition are older, they often die of causes unrelated to the prostate cancer. About two-thirds of cases are slow growing; the other third of cases are more aggressive and fast developing. The goal of screening for prostate cancer is to find cancers that may be at high risk for spreading if not treated, and to find them early before they spread. Screening for prostate cancer begins with a blood test called a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test. Your doctor is the best person to interpret your PSA test results. More information is available via https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/prostate/index.htm . The prostate cancer death rate in Miami-Dade County, has decreased since 2017. The Peer Counties Average rates and State rate have remained steady. The Miami-Dade County most recent cancer death rate for 2020 is slightly higher than the Florida rates and the Peer Counties Average rates. The Healthy People 2020 national health target is to reduce the prostate cancer death rate to 21.8 deaths per 100,000 male population. The national health target for Healthy People 2030 is 16.9 deaths per 100,000 male population. At a recent rate of 17.6 deaths per 100,000 male population, Miami-Dade County, has met the Healthy People 2020 Target. Note: Peer Counties include Broward, Hillsborough, Orange, and Palm Beach.

Why is this important? Colorectal cancer is also called colon cancer or rectum cancer. These cancers are usually grouped because they have many characteristics in common. Colorectal cancer includes cancerous growths starting in the colon or rectum. In the United States, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in men and women. Colorectal cancers arise from abnormal growths called polyps in the colon or rectum. These mushroom-shaped growths are usually benign, but some develop into cancer over time. Screening tests can find polyps, so they can be removed before turning into cancer. The CDC states that, \"More than 90% of cases occur in people who are 50 years old or older.\" There are lifestyle factors that may contribute to an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Some of these lifestyle factors include a lack of regular physical activity, a poor diet low in fruit and vegetables, a low-fiber and high-fat diet (diet high in processed meats), unhealthy weight, alcohol consumption, and tobacco use. Overall, the most effective way to reduce your risk of colorectal cancer is to get screened for colorectal cancer annually beginning at the age of 50 years old. It is suggested that getting regular physical activity and keeping a healthy weight may help lower your risk. The most recent colorectal cancer death rate (2020) of Miami-Dade County has begun to gradually decrease and is lower than the Peer Counties Average and State rates. The Healthy People 2020 national health target is to reduce colorectal cancer death rate to 14.5 deaths per 100,000 population and the Healthy People 2030 national health target is 8.9 per 100,000. At a recent rate of 11.7 deaths per 100,000 population, Miami-Dade County has met the Healthy People 2020 Target while striving to met the Healthy People 2030 national health target.

Why is this important? Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. Cancer is always named for the part of the body where it starts, even if it spreads to other body parts later. When cancer starts in the cervix, it is called cervical cancer. The cervix connects the vagina (birth canal) to the upper part of the uterus. The uterus (or womb) is where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant. All women are at risk for cervical cancer. It occurs most often in women over age 30. Long-lasting infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer. HPV is a common virus that is passed from one person to another during sex. At least half of sexually active people will have HPV at some point in their lives, but few women will get cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is highly preventable in most Western countries because screening tests and a vaccine to prevent HPV infections are available. When cervical cancer is found early, it is highly treatable and associated with long survival and good quality of life. To reduce your risk of cervical cancer, there are several steps you can take. First, get either a pap test or an HPV test. The CDC also recommends getting the HPV vaccine. Finally, don't smoke, use condoms during sex, and limit your number of sexual partners.

Why is this important? Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States and is among the deadliest types of skin cancer. Melanoma is the third most common type of skin cancer. It causes about 75% of skin cancer-related deaths and accounts for the majority of skin cancer deaths. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that begins in the melanocytes cells normally found in the skin but also found in the bowel, and the eye. They are responsible for the production of the dark pigment melanin. This type of skin cancer is caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. Melanocytes are present in skin are responsible for the production of the dark pigment melanin. Anyone can get skin cancer, but people with specific characteristics are at a higher risk like those of lighter natural skin color, skin that burns or turns red easily, certain types of moles, and a family or personal history of skin cancer. The darker pigmented skin may lower your risk of developing melanoma. Other ways to reduce your risk and options to protect yourself from UV radiation as CDC include staying in the shade, wearing protective clothing, hats and using sunscreen. Comprehensive skin cancer prevention programs could prevent 20% of new cases between 2020 and 2030 according to the June 2015 CDC Vital Signs report. The report notes, \"that without additional community prevention efforts, melanoma will continue to increase over the next 15 years, with 112,000 new cases projected in 2030\". The annual cost of treating new melanoma cases is projected to closely triple from $457 million in 2011 to an estimated $1.6 billion in 2030.

Why is this important? In Miami-Dade County, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis are the leading causes of death with most preventable cases attributed to excessive alcohol, viral hepatitis, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The liver is the largest organ in the human body. It is essential for storing nutrients and the removal of waste products, filtering and processing chemicals in food, alcohol, and medications. The liver also produces bile to absorb fats. Cirrhosis is the result of a chronic liver disease that causes scarring of the liver. The scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue and prevents your liver from working regularly. Scar tissue also blocks the flow of blood through the liver resulting in liver dysfunction and failure. Other complications may be the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, bleeding disorders, increased pressure in the blood vessels of the liver, and confusion or a change in the level of consciousness. Common causes of chronic liver disease in the United States include Hepatitis C infection and long-term alcohol abuse. To lower your risk of liver disease it is recommended to get vaccinated against Hepatitis B, get tested and treated for Hepatitis C and limit alcohol consumption. Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis death rates have recently begun to decline since 2015 in Miami-Dade County. The current county rate has remained lower than the Peer Counties Average rate and the state rate. The Healthy People 2020 national health target is to reduce cirrhosis deaths to 8.2 deaths per 100,000 population and the Healthy People 2030 goal is 10.9 deaths per 100,000. At a recent rate of 8.9 deaths per 100,000 population, Miami- Dade County is meeting the Healthy People 2030 Target. Note: Peer Counties include Broward, Hillsborough, Orange, and Palm Beach.

Why is this important? Respiratory diseases are preventable and treatable but continues to be a leading cause of death in Miami-Dade County, and the United States. Chronic lower respiratory diseases (CLRDs) are chronic diseases of the airways and other structures of the lung. Some of the most common CRLDs are asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), occupational lung diseases and pulmonary hypertension. According to FL CHARTS, an estimated 15 to 20% of long-term smokers will develop CLRD. COPD is among the most lethal of these conditions. It refers to a group of diseases that cause airflow blockage and breathing-related problems. In the United States the leading cause of COPD is smoking. By comparison, in other countries air pollution, secondhand smoke and genetic factors are the leading causes of COPD. Smoking is a crucial factor in the development and progression of CLRDs in addition to exposure to air pollutants in the home and workplace, genetic factors, and respiratory infections. Smoking cessation is the most essential part of treatment for smokers diagnosed with chronic lower respiratory disease. Other risk factors mentioned by the CDC include persons aged 65 to 74 years of age, non-Hispanic Whites, women, individuals with lower educational attainment, lower income, those with a history of asthma and current or former smokers. The most recent chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD) death rates for Miami-Dade County, has begun to decrease and is considerably lower than the Peer Counties Average and State.

Why is this important? Alzheimer's is the fifth leading cause of death in Miami-Dade County, FL and among one of the leading causes of death in the United States. According to the CDC, as many as 5.8 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease. As noted by the CDC, this number is projected to nearly triple to nearly 14 million people by 2060. Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that begins with mild memory loss. This disease is the most common form of dementia. It slowly destroys one's memory and thought processes. It eventually leads to the loss of the ability to carry on a conversation, respond to the environment, and simply carry out daily living. The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease does increases with age. The CDC and the National Institute on Aging suggest that symptoms of the disease can first appear after 60 years old. The number of people living with Alzheimer's disease doubles every five years beyond age 65. It is also important to note that this disease can sometimes affect a person under 65 years old, this is called early or younger-onset Alzheimer's. The cause of Alzheimer's disease is not yet fully understood by scientists. There probably is not one single cause, but several factors that may contribute to Alzheimer's that affect each person differently.

Why is this important? In 2020, diabetes was in the top leading causes of death in Miami-Dade County, FL, and the United States. Diabetes is a disease marked by high levels of sugar in the blood. The most common form of diabetes is type 2 Diabetes when the body does not use insulin normally. This form of the disease is known as insulin-resistant diabetes. Your pancreas cannot keep up with making enough insulin from the rise of sugar in your blood. High blood sugar can cause other serious health problems such as heart disease, kidney disease, and vision loss. According to the CDC, approximately 90% to 95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. This is more than 30 million Americans and most often in people over the age of 45 years old. Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong condition most commonly diagnosed in children and young adults; about 5% of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes. With this, your body does not make insulin because the body's immune system destroys insulin-producing cells. Risk factors for developing Type 2 Diabetes include: if you have prediabetes, are overweight and obesity, family history of diabetes, high cholesterol or high blood pressure, and physical inactivity. Other important risk factors include age, ethnicity, and race. For more information, please visit the CDC's webpage: https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes .

Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States and the third leading cause of death in Miami-Dade County. Stroke continues to be a significant cause of disability and a significant contributor to increases in healthcare costs in the United States. The CDC estimates that 795,000 people in the U.S. have a stroke each year. The CDC also notes every 40 seconds someone in the U.S. has a stroke. FLCHARTS defines stroke as an interruption of the blood supply, cutting off the brain's supply of oxygen, or a burst in a blood vessel to any part of the brain. During a stroke when the blood flow is interrupted, brain cells start to die within minutes because they do not receive oxygen which can lead to long-term disability, lasting brain damage, and even death. Some risk factors for stroke that can be modified or treated include high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, obesity, physical inactivity, poor diet, and extreme alcohol and tobacco use. For more information, please visit the website https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/index.htm. Miami-Dade County, stroke death rates have steadily increased since 2016. The Miami-Dade County, stroke death rates have remained higher than the state rate. In 2020 the stroke death rates in Miami-Dade County is higher than the state rate and the peer county average. The Healthy People 2020 national health target is to reduce stroke death rates to 34.8 deaths per 100,000 population. At a recent rate of 44.9 deaths per 100,000 population, Miami-Dade County, FL has not met the Healthy People 2020 national target. The Healthy People 2030 target is to reduce the stroke death rate to 33.4 deaths per 100,000 population. Note: Peer Counties include Broward, Hillsborough, Orange, and Palm Beach.

The County Health Rankings provides detailed reports related to income and poverty and have suggested that \"employment provides income that shapes choices about housing, education, child care, food, medical care and more\" (Countyhealthrankings.org ). This group of factors can also be characterized as the social determinants of health and includes socioeconomic status or SES. To learn more information about the SES and the direct impact on communities as well as strategies to improve health, see Appendix V to view the publication: What Works? Social and Economic Opportunities to Improve Health for All . SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS Below is a summary of socioeconomic factors from the U.S. Census for Miami-Dade County.

Income inequality is a word used to describe how income is unevenly dispersed among the population. Income inequality has been increasing in the United States. There has been adversity in trying to address this growing issue, but providing educational tools such as community partner workshops that provide education on financial literacy to community members can aid in developing solutions to reduce income inequities. POVERTY The poverty level in a community reflects their ability to meet basic needs to maintain their health and wellbeing. High poverty rates are the cause and the consequence of poor economic conditions and can affect a person's health. On the surface, poverty is defined as a lack of income and assets needed to live on a day-to-day basis. Poverty converts into a network of disadvantages that exhaust opportunities for improvement. People who lack access to the most basic opportunities such as education, shelter, proper sanitation, and adequate nutrition can be adversely affected. The United States Census Bureau is the government entity responsible for measuring poverty. The Census Bureau uses monetary thresholds and family size to make poverty determinations. \"If a family's total income is less than the family's threshold, then that family and every individual in it is considered in poverty. The official poverty thresholds do not vary geographically, but they are updated for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). The official poverty definition applies money income before taxes and does not include capital gains or noncash benefits.\" POVERTY BY RACE AND ETHNICITY Poverty levels in Miami-Dade County are highest in Black or African Americans at approximately 23.6% and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander at 22.5% and as compared to other racial and ethnic populations. Compared to Florida and the United States, White alone, Black or African American Alone, Asian Alone, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander poverty rates are all higher than to the same racial and ethnic population in Florida and the United States.

Children and teens who are in poverty are more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as smoking and drinking in comparison to their peers. In Miami-Dade County, the highest population living in poverty are those who are under the age of 18 . Miami- Dade County's (21.1%) proportion is slightly higher than the state of Florida (18.7%) and the nation (17.5%).

MDCPS is comprised of 396 schools for the 2019 - 2020 school year. Of those 396 schools, there are more elementary schools than any other school type. The table does not portray the number of private schools or higher education facilities that are in Miami- Dade County. STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES According to MDCPS there are 84,128 students who are identified as having an ESE Primary Exceptionality. ESE Primary Exceptionality categories include students with autism spectrum disorder, deaf/hard of hearing, developmentally delayed, sensory impaired, emotional/behavioral disability, gifted, hospital or homebound, language impaired, orthopedically impaired, speech impaired, traumatic brain injury impaired, visually impaired and other health or learning disabilities. The MDCPS acknowledges that finding a starting point to aid the students who have disabilities may be arduous, so resources have been gathered from community members to help find the best services to meet the students' needs. One program within the MDCPS is the Exceptional Student Education (ESE) program. The ESE program and services help address the unique needs of kindergarten through 12th grade students who are gifted and those who have mild, moderate or severe disabilities. They serve students from the age of three until they graduate with their high school diploma, or until their 21st birthday. 156 Revised 4-26-2022 Information and resources for students are available through the following organizations: Miami-Dade County Public Schools http://www.dadeschools.net/ The Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind https://www.fsdbk12.org/ 157 Revised 4-26-2022 Public high school adjusted cohort graduation rate (ACGR).

Social support enhances quality of life and provides a buffer against adverse life events. To improve community health, there is a need to identify and address the social support inequities within Miami- Dade County. SOCIAL SUPPORT AND HEALTH According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is a an association between increased levels of social support and reduced risk for physical disease, mental illness, and mortality. Social support can promote health by providing persons with positive experiences, socially rewarding roles, or improved ability to cope with stressful events. The rates of chronic disease are reaching record levels and the support of families, friends and communities can help to combat the problem. There are times when social support can have an impact on the likelihood of an individual who is considering suicide. A lack of social support, isolation, limited access to resources, and substance abuse are just a few of the many risk factors that make it more likely for a person to consider ending their own life. SOCIAL SUPPORT AND HEALTH INEQUITIES Social support can be affected by many different factors including the social determinants of health. The social determinants of health include the availability of resources such as education, healthcare services, safe housing, socioeconomic conditions, discrimination and racism. The County Health Rankings have shown that neighborhoods with lower social support may be more prone to violence than those with more social support and often have limited community resources and role models. Socially isolated individuals are more likely to be concentrated in communities with limited social support. These individuals with low support are more likely to have a fair or poor health status and are more likely to suffer depression and anxiety. 160 Revised 4-26-2022 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS-FAMILY AND SOCIAL SUPPORT YOUTH AND SOCIAL NORMS Social norms give us an expected idea of how to behave in a social group or culture and often vary among age groups, ethnicities, and races. Norms provide a key to understanding social influence in general and conformity, in particular. Social norms may have an impact on youth interactions with their peers. Youth may have misconceptions about alcohol and drug use, healthy eating, and bullying behaviors. ELDERLY AND SOCIAL ISOLATION The process of aging can be different for each individual depending on heredity attributes, lifestyle, and attitudes. Social disconnectedness and perceived isolation have distinct associations with physical and mental health among older adults (Cornwell & Waite, 2009 ). Social disconnectedness and perceived isolation are independently associated with lower levels of self-rated physical health Individuals who lack social connections or report frequent feelings of loneliness tend to suffer from higher rates of morbidity and mortality, infection, depression, and cognitive decline ( Cornwell & Waite, 2009 ). FAITH COMMUNITIES Faith organizations have an impact on individual's values, behaviors, spiritual well-being and their overall health. Faith organizations are assets due to the role that they play in the community. Community members who are a part of the congregation often receive health information through attending faith-based events and service.

Living in unsafe neighborhoods can impact health and quality of life and exposure to violence can affect us physically and psychologically. Studies have shown that high exposure to violence and crime can increase your stress levels, affect your overall wellbeing and increase the chances to suffer from certain illnesses like hypertension, stress-related disorders, upper respiratory illness, asthma, and obesity. Policies and programs such as firearms restrictions for domestic violence offenders, automated speed enforcement cameras, traffic calming, universal motorcycle helmet laws, hot spot policing, community policing, car seat distribution and educational programs can help decrease accidents and fatal injuries. Crime contributes to higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression among commubity members which can also be linked to higher rates of premature births and low birth weight babies. CRIME High crime rates can have a negative impact on social and economic outcomes in a community. For instance, neighborhoods across the United States that have a low annual income have been frequently linked with higher crime rates when compared to neighborhoods that have a higher annual income ( Brown et al., 2014 ). Crime may result in companies being less willing to invest in neighborhoods that have high crime rates, which may impact community resources. Surveilling criminal activity is key to ensuring safe, livable, communities and to improving community health. Crime rates in Miami-Dade County are lower than the state's rate in the following areas: burglary, and rape. In other areas such as aggravated assault, robbery, motor vehicle theft, and murder, the rates are higher than Florida's overall rate. The County Health Rankings provide additional information on community safety for each county in Florida including Miami- Dade County.

Anyone can be a victim of domestic violence. Domestic Violence does not discriminate based on race, age, sexual orientations, religions, genders, socioeconomic backgrounds, or education levels . Miami-Dade County offers free services and programs to increase the safety of domestic violence victims and to reduce violence. In the table presented below, Miami-Dade County has lower rates of domestic violence when compared to the state's rates. The rates of domestic violence in 2020 for Miami-Dade County is 260.8 which is the lowest rate out when compared to peer counties and state's rate. It is important to note that many victims of domestic violence are not included in these rates because not all victims seek help in the health care setting or report domestic violence. 0100200300400500600 2016 2017 2018 Offenses per 100,000 Single Year Rates MIAMI-DADE COUNTY RESOURCES Emergency 911 Florida Domestic Violence 24-Hour Crisis Hotline 1-800-500-1119 Miami-Dade County Coordinated Victims Assistance Center 305-285-5900 Rape Hotline 305-585-7273 Miami-Dade Advocates for Victims Hotline an incident by emailing svbinfo@mdpd.com Source: https://www.miamidade.gov/global/initiatives/domesticviolence/home.page Source: Florida Health Community Health Assessment Resource Tool Set (FLCHARTS) http://www.flhealthcharts.com 163 Revised 4-26-2022 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS-COMMUNITY SAFETY HUMAN TRAFFICKING According to the Department of Homeland Security \"human trafficking involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act\"16. Since 2007, there have been over 4,000 cases of human trafficking in Florida involving over 11,000 victims (these are cases reported through the National Human Trafficking Hotline [NHTH]). In terms of most contacts through NHTH, Florida comes in 3rd behind California and Texas. To combat this issue, the Department of Homeland Security suggests using some of following indicators to help identify and report human trafficking17: Does the person appear disconnected from family, friends, community organizations, or houses of worship? Has a child stopped attending school? Has the person had a sudden or dramatic change in behavior? Is a juvenile engaged in commercial sex acts? Is the person disoriented or confused, or showing signs of mental or physical abuse? Does the person have bruises in various stages of healing? Is the person fearful, timid, or submissive? Does the person show signs of having been denied food, water, sleep, or medical care? Is the person often in the company of someone to whom he or she defers? Or someone who seems to be in control of the situation, e.g., where they go or who they talk to? Does the person appear to be coached on what to say? Is the person living in unsuitable conditions? Does the person lack personal possessions and appear not to have a stable living situation? Does the person have freedom of movement? Can the person freely leave where they live? Are there unreasonable security measures?

According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), this class of drugs includes heroin, synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, and pain relievers available legally when such (OxyContin), hydrocodone (Vicodin), codeine, and morphine. Between people died from an overdose involving opioids including prescription drugs and illicit opioids. that The CDC notes that the rise in opioid overdose deaths can be explained in three distinct waves: 1.) In the late 1990s, the first wave began with increased prescribing of opioids with overdose deaths related to prescription opioids. 2.) The second wave started in 2010, with a quick rise in overdose deaths involving heroin. 3.) The third wave started in 2013, with significant increases in overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids specifically those involving illicitly-manufactured fentanyl (IMF). The IMF market continues to change, and IMF can be found in combination with heroin, counterfeit pills, and cocaine. Florida's Statewide Drug Policy Advisory Council (DPAC) 2016 Annual Report states that, \"Since 2000, the rate of deaths from drug overdoses has increased 137 percent, including a 200 percent increase in the rate of overdose deaths involving opioids (opioid pain relievers and heroin). The number of deaths associated with fentanyl and heroin-related drug use has substantially increased.\" In the Spring of 2017, Florida's Governor Rick Scott signed an executive order declaring a statewide public health emergency for the opioid epidemic. In a response to the illegal and prescription opioid addiction and overdose epidemic in Miami-Dade County, Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez in partnership with the State Attorney Katherine Fernandez-Rundle, the Department of Children and Families, the DOH-Miami-Dade and Miami-Dade County's Board of County Commissioners Chairman Bovo, founded the Opioid Addiction Taskforce. The Taskforce was charged with developing an effective action plan to address the opiod crisis. From a review of best evidence-based and informed practices, the Taskforce was delegated to provide recommendations to reduce opioid overdoses, prevent opioid misuse and addiction (as well as heroin addiction), increase the number of persons seeking treatment, and support persons recovering from addiction in our communities. Additionally, healthcare solutions were examined to raise awareness and improve knowledge of misuse and the role of the justice system in opioid prevention. Per the Florida Department of Health in 2019, the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control awarded the state of Florida a new Overdose Data to Action grant. The grant expanded the scope of previous drug overdose surveillance system to include more non-opioid related overdoses and strengthened funding of prevention efforts.The FL-DOSE program will be improving the drug overdose surveillance system. To combat the opioid addiction and overdose epidemic, programs have been created to combat this issue. The Helping Emergency Responders Obtain Support (HEROS) is a program sourced at the DOH-Miami-Dade that provides emergency responders with emergency opioid antagonist medications like Naloxone. This medication works by reversing the narcotic effects on the brain. The 2009 Florida legislature created the Florida Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. This initiative was created to encourage safer prescribing of controlled substances and to reduce drug abuses and diversion within the state of Florida. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline is available for individuals and family members facing substance use disorders at 1-800-662-HELP (4357) or 1-800-487-4889. This service provides referrals to local treatment facilities, support groups, and community-based organizations. 165 Revised 4-26-2022 HEALTH BEHAVIORS-DRUG USE NEONATAL ABSTINENCE SYNDROME Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is defined by the CDC, \"as a withdrawal syndrome that can occur in newborns exposed during pregnancy to certain substances including opioids\". There is a dramatic increase in maternal opioid use and neonatal abstinence syndrome. The use of opioids during pregnancy can have detrimental effects on newborns such as withdrawal syndrome. Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a result of the sudden discontinuation of fetal exposure to substances that were used or abused by the mother during pregnancy. These babies are more likely to have low birthweight and suffer from respiratory complications, seizures, and feeding difficulties. This information is relevant to addressing NAS as this syndrome is directly linked to substance abuse during pregnancy. According to CDC guidelines, prevention for NAS involves controling opioid prescription and being cautious especially with pregnant women and nonpregnant women of reproductive age, and when possible using nonopioid pharmacological therapy. It is also important to have proper access to prenatal care and family planning services. Women who are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant should be honest with their health care provider about the consumption of opioids before, during and after pregnancy to prevent and decrease the rate of NAS. In Florida, the number of babies born with NAS has decreased between 2017-2019. Data for 2020 and beyond has not been released. The Florida Birth Defects Registry (FBDR) has tracked the number of infants that manifest a diagnosis of NAS since 2014 in Florida. While the Florida Department of Health works to track NAS trends, the following should be noted: Data sources: To identify NAS cases, DOH currently uses a passive case ascertainment methodology that relies on linked administrative datasets and diagnostic codes indicative of NAS. ICD codes used for diagnosis are 779.5 and P96.1. Once an infant's birth certificate record has been linked to his/her birth hospitalization, the discharge portion of the linked electronic record is scanned for the presence of any of the above-mentioned diagnosis codes. What are limitations of the data? Currently, there appears to be substantial variation in the diagnosis and reporting of NAS across medical institutions, providers, and surveillance systems. These inconsistencies result in questionable accuracy and reliability of NAS data. However, they are also indicative of the need and opportunity for the DOH/FBDR to encourage establishment of a standardized set of recommendations and guidelines for clinical diagnosis, data collection, surveillance, and reporting efforts. There are specific data perimeters that should be considered when examining this data.

Young adults ages 18 to 34 and those with a household income of $75,000 or more are more likely to participate in binge drinking behaviors. It is worth noting that those with a household income of less than $25,000 consumed a higher amount of drinks, between eight to nine when binge drinking. Binge drinking is a significant issue in the U.S. due to the following: inexpensive to purchase, accessibility, and mass marketing and promotion by the alcohol industry. One out of ten adult deaths are related to binge drinking. According to the County Health Rankings, 2019 data indicates that the percentage of adults reporting binge or heavy drinking in Miami- Dade County and state is 18%. The chart below comes from the Florida Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Take caution comparing data before and after 2013 as the survey method changed in that year. BINGE DRINKING AND MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH When a women drinks during pregnancy, there can be adverse effects on the unborn child. According to the CDC, the effects of alcohol on unborn children are characterized as a set of behavioral or intellectual disorders known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. There can be significant medical problems for the unborn child including hearing, vision, and sleep problems. When a woman is pregnant, there is no safe level of alcohol that should be consumed. To learn more about Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders and the specific types of disorders, please visit the CDC- https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/facts.html . BINGE DRINKING AND YOUTH Per the CDC, excessive drinking is responsible for more than 3,500 deaths among people under age 21 each year. Alcohol is the most commonly used substance among young people in the U.S. Youth who engage in binge drinking are more likely to engage in binge drinking as adults. According to the BRFSS, the rates of binge drinking among middle and high school students has been declining over the past decade. 2002 2007 2010 2013 2016 2019 Miami-Dade 16.1 15 10.9 18.2 18.3 18 Florida 16.4 16.2 15 17.6 17.5 18101214161820Percent of Adults Who Engage in Heavy or Binge Drinking, 2002-2019 Source: Florida Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System telephone survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Florida Department of Health Division of Community Health Promotion. 167 Revised 4-26-2022 HEALTH BEHAVIORS-ALCOHOL USE ALCOHOL CONFIRMED MOTOR VEHICLE TRAFFIC CRASHES Indicator: Age-adjusted death rate per 100,000 population due to alcohol-suspected motor vehicle traffic crashes .

More than 16 million Americans have a disease linked to smoking. Smoking increases the risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, diabetes, and (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. It increases risk of tuberculosis, certain eye diseases, and problems of the immune system, including rheumatoid arthritis, and erectile dysfunction. Smoking remains the number one cause of preventable diseases in the United States. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services states that cigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the United States, including more than 41,000 deaths resulting from secondhand smoke exposure (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). The money that is collected from tobacco taxes and settlements in court, less than 2.4% is spent on programs that can help stop young people from becoming smokers and help current smokers quit (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). In Miami-Dade 12% of the adult population are current smokers. 2002 2007 2010 2013 2016 2019 Miami-Dade 18.8 15.4 10.6 14 12.3 12 Florida 22.2 19.3 17.1 16.8 15.5 14.80510152025 Percent of Adults Who Are Current Smokers Source: Florida Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System telephone survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Florida Department of Health Division of Community Health Promotion. 169 Revised 4-26-2022 HEALTH BEHAVIORS-TOBACCO USE SMOKING AND YOUTH The U.S. National Library of Medicine in the National Institute of Health attributed about a third of teenage experimentation with smoking to tobacco advertising and promotional activities in retail environments. The 2016 and 2018 Florida Youth Tobacco Survey (FYTS) shows a slight decrease in some areas for youth ages 11 years old to 17 years old who have tried some form of tobacco. It is essential to note the evolving trend of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) such as vapes or JUUL. Since 2016, electronic vaping is the most prevalent type of tobacco that students have tried and has generally been increasing since 2014. 2020 Florida Youth Tobacco Survey for Miami-Dade County Percentage of Youth Ages 11- 17 Who Have : 2014 2016 2018 2020 Ever tried cigarettes 16.50% 13.10% 12.7% 12.8% Revised 4-26-2022 HEALTH BEHAVIORS-DIET AND EXERCISE DIET AND OBESITY Obesity is the state of being significantly overweight based on a height-to-weight ratio, or body mass index. Factors that influence the likelihood of becoming obese include genetics, diet, exercise, and socioeconomic status. Additionally, medical costs for people whose weight is categorized as obese is higher than medical costs for people who are not obese. According to FLCHARTS in 2019, 37.6% of adults in Florida were obese. In Miami-Dade County 34.7% of adults were classified as overweight. This rate is lower than Florida's rate. As represented below, the proportion of Miami-Dade County adults that are overweight is decreasing. FOOD DESERTS A person's food environment is made up of several factors: the physical presence of food that affects a person's diet, a person's proximity to food store locations, the distribution of food stores, food service, and any physical entity by which food is obtained, or overall a connected system that allows access to foods. The CDC defines food deserts as \"areas that lack access to affordable fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat milk, and other foods that make up a healthy nutritious diet\". Populations that live within food deserts rely on federal supplemental assistance which includes the National School Lunch Program (NSLP),SNAP, and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) programs. The WIC program in Miami-Dade County has partnered with University of Florida Institute of Food and Agriculture Sciences on promoting a program called \" Health in The Hood .\" The program brings a mobile unit to WIC locations and offers a variety of fruits and vegetables for members in the community to come and participate in picking nutritious groceries. This program is an example of bridging the gap in these food desert areas. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) map illustrates that food desert areas exists in Homestead, Cutler Bay and Florida CIty. 2002 2007 2010 2013 2016 2019 Miami-Dade 37.6 38.9 38.1 39.8 38.7 34.7 Florida 35.1 38 37.8 36.4 35.8 37.632333435363738394041 Percent of Adults Who are Overweight Source: Florida Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System telephone survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Florida Department of Health Division of Community Health Promotion. 171 Revised 4-26-2022 HEALTH BEHAVIORS-DIET AND EXERCISE FOOD INSECURITY Food insecurity for the County Health Rankings is the percentage of the population who lacks adequate access to food. It is important to discuss food insecurities when discussing health because it can be related to negative health outcomes such as weight-gain and premature mortality. The measure also addresses the ability of individuals and families to provide balanced meals, further addressing barriers to healthy eating and adequate access to a constant food supply. The prevalence of food insecurity in the United States is related to changes in unemployment, inflation, and the cost of food. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) describes food environments as food secure and food insecure. A food secure household always has access to adequate food for all members of the household, whereas, a food insecure households does not always have adequate or enough food for all household members throughout year. According to the USDA's annual study of household food security for 2019, the prevalence of food insecurity was at 10.5%. In 2019 4.1% of US households had very low food security. The County Healthy Rankings Report uses \"Food Environment Index\" as one of the Diet and Exercise measures. The two factors that determine this index are food insecurity estimates and limited access to healthy foods estimates. The 2019 County Healthy Rankings Report highly ranks Miami-Dade County for the Food Environment Index measures as 3rd out of 67 counties in Florida. FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) is a federally assisted meal program which provides nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free lunches to children each school day in public, nonprofit private schools and residential child care institutions. An indicator of poverty is the number of students receiving free or reduced priced lunch. The proportions of Miami-Dade's students eligible to receive free or reduced lunch when compared to the the state of Florida is similar but still greater than the Florida percentage.

Evidence-based architectural and urban design strategies can encourage regular physical activity and healthy eating. Improving the built environment to make the surroundings conducive to healthy lifestyles will benefit all members of the community. This objective will potentially reduce health disparities such as access to health care and increasing physical activity by encouraging better walkable streets and complete streets planning principles that are incorporated in underserved and unsafe areas. Additionally, incorporating Active Design Guidelines and Complete Streets Guidelines provides architects and urban designers with a manual of strategies for creating healthier buildings, streets, and urban spaces, based on the latest academic research and best practices in the field. Local governments play a key role in shaping community infrastructure to support walking by promoting transit, community planning zoning provisions, and by retrofitting existing areas to better serve pedestrians. A frequently cited barriers to physical activity is lack of safe areas. According to the Recommended Community Strategies and Measurements to Prevent Obesity in the United States, street- scale urban design and land-use policies and practices may increase environmental supports, such as safety, walkability, improved sense of community, decreased isolation, and reduction in crime and stress. In Miami-Dade the Active Design guidelines have been adopted to achieve environmental supports. Active Design is an evidence-based approach to shaping communities which leverage urban design and architecture solutions to improve public health. Another approach adopted by Miami-Dade is the Complete Streets Design Guidelines which was developed to provide policy and guidance to all stakeholders involved in street design projects. These projects are designed and operated to enable safe access for all users including, pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and public transportation users of all ages and abilities. By implementing a Complete Streets policy, communities direct their transportation planners & engineers to routinely design and operate the entire right of way to enable safe access for all users, regardless of age, ability, or mode of transportation. This means that every transportation project will make the street network better and safer for drivers, transit users, pedestrians, & bicyclists - making areas in the county a better place to live. Our Active Design Miami guidelines policy includes the following: A vision for how and why the community wants to complete its streets Specifies that 'all users' includes pedestrians, bicyclists and transit passengers of all ages and abilities, as well as trucks, buses and automobiles. Applies to both new and retrofit projects, including design, planning, maintenance, and operations, for the entire right of way. Makes any exceptions specific and sets a clear procedure that requires high-level approval of exceptions. Encourages street connectivity and aims to create a comprehensive, integrated, connected network for all modes. Is implementable by all agencies to cover all roads. Directs the use of the latest and best design criteria and guidelines while recognizing the need for flexibility in balancing user needs. Directs that Complete Streets solutions will complement the context of the community. Establishes performance standards with measurable outcomes. Includes specific next steps for implementation. To date, there are ten municipalities within Miami-Dade and Unincorporated Miami-Dade that have adopted Active Design Guidelines. By adopting these guidelines, Miami-Dade County has been able to effectively impact over 600,000 Miami-Dade County Residents. 173 Revised 4-26-2022 HEALTH BEHAVIORS-DIET AND EXERCISE BUILT ENVIRONMENT, EXERCISE, AND OBESITY DOH-Miami-Dade has over five years of experience with Active Design development and has thoughtfully created partnerships within the community through the Consortium for a Healthier Miami- Dade. We have partnered with the Miami Chapter of American Institute of Architects (AIA) to organize an annual Fit City Miami conference based on the NY Active Design Guidelines developed by NYC Department of Health and NYC AIA. Incorporating the Active Design Guidelines into the Urban Design Manual. The Urban Design Manual Is a set of principles that designers use that improve the quality of physical development in unincorporated Miami-Dade. This merge will provide an important opportunity to educate local architects, engineers, planners, city managers, school boards, hospitals, universities, business owners, and elected officials about the physical and economic benefits of NY Active Design Guidelines, through special training sessions and participation in yearly Fit City events. The NY Active Design Guidelines have been retrofitted to fit the climate and cultural aspects unique to Miami-Dade. The Miami Active Design Guidelines will strengthen policy guidelines that illustrate the basic design principles for the placement and design of public open space and civic structures and significantly improve wellness in Miami-Dade County. The urban design principles in this manual identify acceptable and preferred design examples of ways to implement the urban form guidelines and other policies pertaining to community land use, housing patterns, and design in the Miami- Dade County Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP), in addition to the incorporation of the Active Design Guidelines as part of increasing physical activity. Miami Dade Parks, Recreation, and Open Spaces ( MDPROS) has 270 parks, covering 13,599 acres of land and there are 130 miles of bike/walking trails that can be accessed by Miami-Dade County's 2. 7M residents, as well as any visitors/tourists to the area.

Why is this important? Vaccination is one of the best ways parents can protect infants, children, and teens from about 16 harmful diseases. These diseases can result in long school absences, hospitalizations, and death. This may even have a significant impact on the family's financial stability consequentially from costly medical bills and even loss of work to take care of dependents. The State of Florida has improved immunization coverage through mandatory immunization requirements for school-aged children in an effort to reduce the threat of vaccine-preventable disease. Required vaccines for children in the state of Florida include: diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis (DTaP), polio series vaccine, measles/mumps/rubella (MMR), Hepatitis B B) series, Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB), and varicella (chicken pox). In addition, childcare facilities and schools must report their annual vaccination records at the beginning of each school year or period of assessment to the Florida Department of Health.

There are two screening tests that can help prevent cervical cancer or detect it in its early stage: the Pap smear (or Pap test) and the human papillomavirus (HPV) test. The Pap smear screens for precancerous cells, on the cervix that could potentially become cervical cancer. According to the CDC HPV factsheet , HPV is the most common form and main cause of cervical cancer which is also the most commonly sexually transmitted infection in the United States. All women are at risk for cervical cancer; however,most often it occurs in women over the age of 30 years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) recommends that women should start getting Pap tests at the age of 21 and to continue to get tested annually until the age of 65. Screening requirements may vary, so it is best to discuss your risk and options with your healthcare provider. Data is not available past 2016. The Healthy People 2020 national health target is to increase the number of women who receive a cervical cancer screening based on the most recent guidelines in 2008 (age-adjusted to the year 2000 standard population) to 93.0%. The percent of women 18 years and older who received a Pap smear in 2016 in Miami-Dade County was 52.7%; Miami-Dade has yet to meet this national target. 2007 2010 2013 2016 Miami-Dade 63.6 56.9 53.8 52.7 Florida 64.8 57.1 51.4 48.445.050.055.060.065.070.0PercentPercent of Women 18 Years of Age and Older Who Have Received a Pap Smear in the Last Year - Miami-Dade County and Florida, 2007-2016 (Single-Year) Source: Florida Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System telephone survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Florida Department of Health Division of Community Health Promotion. 178 Revised 4-26-2022 HEALTH BEHAVIORS-SEXUAL ACTIVITY TEEN BIRTHS Indicator: Rate of births per 1,000 females 15 years of age to 19 years of age. Why is this important? The 2020 National Vital Statistics reports from the CDC stated that a total of 157,548 babies were born to women aged 15-19 years, for a birth rate of 15.3 per 1,000 women in this age group. This is a record low for U.S. teens. Some of the reasons for teen births declining are due to more teens abstaining from sexual activity and using birth control and contraceptives than in prior years. The importance of prevention is key in teen pregnancies and childbearing because it brings such a substantial social and economic costs through immediate and long-term impacts on teen parents and their children. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports that babies born to teen moms are more likely to be born pre-term and possibly with a low birth weight. Healthy People 2030 also notes children of teen parents are more likely to have lower cognitive attainment, more behavior problems, more likely to have poorer educational and health outcomes throughout their lives compared to children born from older parents. Since 2016 teen birth rates in Miami-Dade County have decreased and remained lower than Florida and Peer Counties Average rates. In 2020 the birth rate was 5 birthsper 1,000 women 15-19 years of age in Miami-Dade County. Overall teen birth rates are on the decline in Miami-Dade County. Teen pregnancies are linked to Social Determinants of Health including unplanned pregnancies, poverty, and lack of education and access to adequate family planning resources. Note: Peer Counties include Broward, Hillsborough, Orange, and Palm Beach.

The recent birth rate for the Hispanic population in Miami-Dade is below the Florida rates. The rates for the non- Hispanic population in Miami-Dade are lower than the Hispanic population in Miami-Dade. The rates for the Hispanic population in Miami-Dade are lower compared to the state rate also the non-Hispanic population in Miami-Dade are lower compared to the state rate. When broken down by race, the Teen Birth rate for the Black population is greater than the Teen Birth rate for the white population, at both the county and state level. The county rates are lower than the state rates for both the white and black population respectively. Additionally the disparity in the birth rates is greater at the state level than at the county level and the disparity in Miami-Dade has been decreasing over the past 5 years. 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Miami-Dade White 6.6 6 5.4 5.2 4.4 Miami-Dade Black 11 10.9 8.8 7.5 7.4 Florida White 8.6 8.1 7.5 7.1 6.6 Florida Black 13.1 12.7 11.2 11.2 10.402468101214Birth Rate for Mothers 15-19 years of Age by Race, Single Year Rate per 1,0002016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Miami-Dade Hispanic 7.1 6.4 5.6 5.7 4.7 Miami-Dade Non-Hispanic 7.5 7.7 5.9 5 5.3 Florida Hispanic 10.6 10.1 9.1 9.1 8.6 Florida Non-Hispanic 9 8.5 7.7 7.3 6.7024681012 Birth Rate for Mothers 15-19 years of Age by Ethnicity, Single Year Rate per 1,000180 Revised 4-26-2022 HEALTH BEHAVIORS-MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH EARLY ENTRY INTO PRENATAL CARE Indicator: Percentage of births to mothers who began prenatal care in the first trimester (12 weeks) of their pregnancy. Why is this important? Prenatal care is a top maternal and child health priority. Preconception health is getting healthy before pregnancy. Women who see a health care provider regularly during pregnancy have healthier babies and are less likely to have pregnancy complications. Prenatal care visits are used to monitor the progress of a pregnancy. It is recommended that women begin prenatal care visits in the first trimester or as soon as pregnancy is suspected or confirmed to achieve the greatest benefits and better health outcomes for both the mother and the baby. Early visits allow health care providers to identify potential problems, so they can be prevented or treated before they become serious. The percent of mothers entering early into prenatal care in Miami-Dade County has unfavorably decreased since 2016; however, when compared to the State rates Miami-Dade County remains higher at 7.8.

However, there are several barriers to healthcare services such as high cost of care, inadequate or no insurance coverage, lack of availability to services and lack of culturally competent care. Healthy People 2020 and Healthy People 2030 notes that access to care often varies based on race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, sex, disability status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and residential location. Lack of healthcare access leads to unmet health needs, delays in receiving appropriate care, inability to get preventive services, financial burdens, and preventable hospitalizations. To achieve the best health outcomes, three distinct steps are required. 1) Gaining entry into the healthcare system (usually through insurance coverage). 2) Accessing a location where needed health care services are provided (geographic availability). 3) Finding a health care provider whom the patient trusts and can communicate with (personal relationship). QUALITY OF CARE Quality of care also plays an important role on health outcomes. In order to have better and higher quality of healthcare for all Americans, it is necessary to have adequate coverage, excellent care services, and quick healthcare. It is important to focus on the six priorities as identified by the Institute of Medicine to guide efforts to improve health and health care quality. They are: 1. Making care safer by reducing harm caused in the delivery of care. 2. Ensuring that each person and family is engaged as partners in their care. 3. Promoting effective communication and coordination of care. 4. Promoting the most effective prevention and treatment practices for the leading causes of mortality, starting with heart disease. 5. Working with communities to promote wide use of best practices to enable healthy living. 6. Making quality care more affordable for individuals, families, employers, and governments by developing and spreading new health care delivery models. 183 Revised 4-26-2022 CLINICAL CARE-ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE Health insurance coverage impacts a person's ability to receive the care they need. As shown in the table, 83.8% of Miami-Dade County residents reported having health insurance coverage, surveyed by the United States Census Bureau. This proportion is lower than both the state of Florida and the United States (87.3% and 91.3%, respectively). In Miami Dade Count 53.4% of people have private insurance and 33.8% are insured through a public health insurance provider. The age groups with the highest percentage that have health insurance are those under 6 years old, 6-18 years old, 65- 74 years old and over 75 years old.

A physician can specialize in different areas of medicine. In Miami- Dade County, the rate of licensed practicing physicians has increased since FY 14-15 through FY 18-19. PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS Health care access and quality is directly affected by the proportion of liscenced health care professionals to the community. Primary care is the entry point into the healthcare system for non-emergent services. Primary care providers offer a usual source of care, early detection and treatment of disease, chronic disease management, and preventive care. Patients with a usual source of care are more likely to receive recommended preventive services. Primary care providers are made up of general and family medicine physicians, internists, pediatricians, obstetricians and gynecologists, nurse midwives, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. School health nurses provide primary care services to selected populations.

According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), public drinking water systems consist of community and non-community systems. It is a public water system that supplies water to the same population year- round. It is important to know where drinking water also known as potable water comes from, how and if it has been treated, and if it is safe to drink or use for food preparation. A community water supply system provides water to the public for human consumption through pipes or other constructed transports. The Florida's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) states a community water system serves at least 15 service connections used by year-round residents. Public drinking water regulations aim to reduce the harmful effects of contamination on people who use water from public water systems. Some of these benefits of these regulations include: improved taste, reduced pipe corrosion, and a reduction in buying bottled water, boil-water advisories, and purchasing filters. Since 2015, the proportion of Miami-Dade County, FL residents receiving potable water from a regulated community water system has increased and has remained above the state level. Per FLCHARTS, purchasing among community water systems and public utilization of drinking water from a variety of places and systems occurs; therefore the estimated number of people served may exceed the estimated population in that area and the percent served may exceed 100%. 2019 is the most recent data available.

Why is this important? According to the CDC, water fluoridation is the controlled addition of fluoride to a public water supply to prevent and reduce tooth decay (dental caries). Through this process, fluoride a natural mineral, helps to re-mineralize tooth surfaces. The community water system must adjust their water with fluoride, have fluoride naturally occurring in their water, or purchase water from another system which is adjusted or naturally fluoridated to be considered an optimally fluoridated system. Moderate water fluoridation is now reaching about two-thirds of the US population on public water systems; however, cavities are still one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood, which greatly affects their quality of life, particularly those of low socioeconomic status. One of the most cost-effective ways to deliver fluoride to people of all ages, education levels, and income levels who live in a community is through community water fluoridation. Through this method it has been shown to reduce tooth decay by 25% in children and adults. Other techniques that are also effective in preventing tooth decay include fluoride toothpaste and dental sealants. The percent of Miami-Dade County residents receiving optimally fluoridated water has remained constant over time, with Miami-Dade County is being almost 21% higher than the state. Miami-Dade County's most recent and higher than both the Peer Counties Average. and the State proportions. The Healthy People 2020 objective on community water fluoridation target is to increase the percent of the U.S. population served by community water systems with optimally fluoridated water to 79.6%. The Healthy People 2030 target is 77.1%. Miami-Dade County meets both targets with a most recent proportion of 98.1% of the population receiving optimally fluoridated water. 2019 is the most recent available data year. 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Miami-Dade County 98.2 98 98.1 98.1 of Population Recieving Fluoridated Water Source: Florida Health Community Health Assessment Resource Tool Set (FLCHARTS) http://www.flhealthcharts.com Information and supportive resources for community water fluoridation are available through the following organizations: CDC's Community Water Fluoridation https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/faqs/index.htm Florida https://www.floridafluoridation.org/ 194 Revised 4-26-2022 PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT-WATER QUALITY HEALTHY BEACHES Indicator : Number of beach advisories issued for monitored beaches that are open to the public for swimming. Why is this important? The saltwater from the ocean can cause disease if contaminated with certain bacteria like enterococci. Contaminants to ocean water include but are not limited to: storm water runoff, animal and seabird waste, failing septic systems after a natural disaster, sewage treatment plant spills, or boating waste. Enterococci bacteria are in high concentrations in recreational waters like beaches and are ingested while swimming or enter the skin through a cut or sore. They may cause human disease, infections or rashes. All coastal beaches are tested regularly for enterococci bacteria. This bacterium is present in intestinal tracts of warm-blooded animals and humans. A health advisory is issued when bacteria levels exceed normal healthy water levels. For more information on the Florida Department of Health's Healthy Beaches Program, please visit: http://www.floridahealth.gov/environmental-health/beach-water-quality/index.html The Healthy People 2020 national health target was to increase the percent of days that beaches are open and safe for swimming at a target of 96%. Healthy People 2030 did not retain this objective.

Why is this important? Lead poisoning is caused by swallowing or breathing lead particles and can affect nearly every system in the body, particularly the brain and the nervous system. It can cause learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and at very high levels it could cause seizures, coma, and even death. Between 1970-1990, dramatic reductions in blood lead levels (BLLs) of children in the United States were attributed to population-based primary prevention policies (such as the banning of lead in gasoline) in combination with improved lead screening and identification of children with elevated BLLs. Childhood lead exposure and signs of elevated blood lead levels remain a major public health problem among young children in the United States. Miami-Dade County lead rates have increased since 2016 and are higher than the state rate. The Florida Department of Health lowered the threshold for blood lead level from 10 \u00b5g/dL to 5 \u00b5g/dL to align with the national surveillance case definition in 2017. As a result of that change, you may see significantly increased lead poisoning cases after 2017. Miami-Dade County lead rates in 2019 is 5 per 100,000 population. The CDC Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program is committed to the Healthy People 2020 goals of eliminating blood lead levels 10 \u00b5g/dL and differences in average risk based on race and social class as public health concerns. The exposure often occurs with no obvious symptoms and thus frequently goes unrecognized.

Particle pollution is pollution by particulate matter that is made up of several components including: acids like nitrates and sulfates, organic chemicals, metals, soil or dust particles, and allergens like pieces of pollen or mold spores. Small particles found in smoke and haze are defined as \"fine particles\" which are 2.5 micrometers in diameter or less; and \"coarse particles\" can be found in wind-blown dust which have diameters between 2.5 and 10 micrometers. Particles less than 10 micrometers in size cause the greatest problems, because they can penetrate lungs, and get into bloodstreams. Larger particles are of less concern and can irritate eyes, nose, and throat and can often cause limited visibility on hazy days. INDOOR AIR QUALITY-RADON Indicator: Number of housing units tested for radon in 2019. Why is this important? The American Cancer Society identifies radon as the second leading cause of lung cancer. Radon is naturally occurring outdoors and can be found in different amounts in rocks, soil and groundwater. It cannot be detected by the human senses because it is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. Florida has many places where natural radioactivity in the soil releases radon gas into the home through the foundation. Homes are not normally built to be radon resistant. The possibility for radon exposures varies by geographic area with Miami-Dade County is in a mid-level radon potential area, meaning that testing for radon should be conducted for indoor air safety.

A way to address housing inequities is to ensure that the community has affordable housing. Since 1940, the U.S. Census Bureau has collected information on housing characteristics. Results from the United States Census helps communities determine where to build schools, supermarkets, homes and hospitals. As shown below, homeownership rates in Miami-Dade County (51.6%) is lower than the states rate (66.2%) and the nation's (64.4%). Additionally, more than half (54.1%) of renters spend 35% of their income on rent, which is a greater proportion than renters at the state (46.8%) and national (40%) level.

In 2005 had the highest rate of building permits issued of any year. By 2007 there has been a dramatic decrease with 2009 showing the least number of permits issued. After 2009, there has been a slow increase in the number of residential permits, but saw a small decline again in 2014. Data past 2014 was not available.

There are several contributing factors that can lead an individual or family to lose secure housing. In Miami-Dade County, there are many resources and agencies dedicated to reducing the number of people who are without housing. The Miami-Dade County Homeless Trust is one of the many organizations who is taking the lead on this mission with the goal of implementing policy changes and working with contracted providers to ensure services are delivered to those who need them most. The Homeless Trust is also responsible for overseeing the utilization of food and beverage taxes that are specifically dedicated to fund programs. The Trust also serves for both federal and state funding announcements. The Trust also completed a 2018 Assessment of Racial Disparities for Miami-Dade County. This assessment evaluates service delivery for four programs including emergency shelters, transitional housing, rapid rehousing and permanent supportive housing. Key Findings are: Persons of color are extraordinarily overrepresented as a proportion of the homeless population when compared to the general population. While black persons represent 18% of Miami-Dade County's general population, they comprise 56% of the homeless population. While young adults aged 25 years or younger make up a small percentage of all persons served by the (Continuum of Care) CoC, racial disparity among such young adults is striking, particularly when compared to single adults over the age of 25 years. Sixty-nine percent (69%) of young adults are black compared to 53% of single adults. White participants have a longer length of stay in permanent supportive housing. While a small percentage of PSH participants exit to homelessness, a greater percentage of those who do are black. While the CoC programs (emergency shelter, transitional housing, rapid re-housing and permanent supportive housing) do a good job in preventing returns to homeless compared to overall exits, a significantly greater number of black persons exit into homelessness than white persons. On the other hand, the rate of exits to permanent housing is much greater for black persons when compared to white persons. There is racial disparity in the collection of exit destination data with a greater percentage of black persons leaving without exit destination. According to the Florida Housing Coalition Home Matters Report 2019 , Florida continues to have problems with affordable housing. Below are facts for 2019. There are 921,928 \"very low-income\" Florida households-which include hardworking families, seniors, and people with disabilities-pay more than 50% of their income in housing. Florida has the third highest homeless population of any state in the nation, with 31,030 people living in homeless shelters and on the streets. This includes 2,543 veterans and 9,587 people in families with at least one child. Low wage jobs are prevalent in Florida's economy. In many occupations, workers do not earn enough to rent a modest apartment or buy their first home. Information and supportive resources for homelessness are available through the following organizations: Miami-Dade County Homeless Trust http://homelesstrust.org National Health Care for the Homeless Council www.nhchc.org/ 201 Revised 4-26-2022 PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT-HOUSING CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE The Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) reports that every day in Florida children are removed from their homes. A child could be removed from their home because of bad parenting skills, substance abuse, mental illness, and/ or domestic violence. Removing a child from his or her home and caregiver generates trauma, confusion, and fear. In Miami-Dade County in addition to DCF, Our Kids of Miami-Dade/Monroe Inc., provides a direct coordinated system of care in order to deliver excellence to abused, abandoned, and neglected children and families. FLCHARTS reported that in 2020 Miami-Dade County, FL had a rate of 229.7 per 100,000 population of children under the age of 18 years old in foster care. By contrast the rate in 2020 for the state of Florida was 549.2 per 100,000 population of children under the age of 18 was in foster care. There was a total of 1,335 children in Miami-Dade County under the age of 18 years old compared to a total of 23,517 children in the whole state of Florida. The Miami-Dade County rate is statistically significantly lower compared to the state rate. Nevertheless, it is important to continue to monitor the rate of foster children for a few reasons including, children who have been in the foster care system are at a higher risk of developing mental and physical health problems. 202 Revised 4-26-2022 PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT-TRANSPORTATION TRANSPORTATION Lack of adequate transportation can limit a person's employment options and their chances of being hired for a position. Without transportation, a person may also lack the ability to access nutritious foods or recreational spaces where physical activity takes place. Transportation barriers also inhibit access to health care services, in some cases causing people to cancel or miss medical appointments. As shown below, 10.1% of households in Miami-Dade County do not have a vehicle, a proportion higher than both the state of Florida (6.1%) and the United States (8.5%). Percent of Households by Number of Available Vehicles 2020 Occupied housing units No vehicles available 1 vehicle available 2 vehicles available 3 or more vehicles available Miami-Dade presented below, of the approximate 1,302,098 workers (ages of 16 and over) in Miami-Dade County, 75.7% drove alone. This rate is lower than Florida's rate of 77.1% but is slightly higher than the nation's rate of 74.9%. Of the 1,302,098 workers, only 4.2% used public transportation, which is a higher than Florida (1.6%) and lower than the nation's (4.6%). Support for public transportation is essential for community members because it is affordable and widely accessible. For those who are unable to afford a vehicle, transport systems are a vital source for improving population health. Public transportation has been found to reduce financial stress for those who are lower income. It also decreases fuel emissions and the number of car crashes per year.

Safe transportation is not only important for those on the road, but for those who commute by foot. Florida ranks number 1 out of all states in the nation for highest Pedestrian Danger Index (PDI) and the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach Metro Statistical Area ranks 13 out of all metro statistical areas. The Pedestrian Danger Index, developed by Smart Growth America, measures how fatal it is for people to walk based on the number of people struck and killed by drivers while walking. The PDI controls for the number of people that live in that state or metro area and the number of people who walk to work. Multiple collisions have happened on Interstate 95 and other major highways like US-1 due to those who have been hit while on a motorcycle, walking or biking on these major highways. The chart below shows the number of motorcyclist, pedestrian, and bicyclist fatalities that occurred between the years of 2016 and 2020. Pedestrian fatalaties are the most common, followed by motorcycle and bicyclist. Bicyclist Fatalaties had an outlier in 2018 with 744 deaths.

2022 Community Health Assessment (CHA). It is evident from the data analysis that there have been improvements in various areas. The CHA has identified opportunities for improvement. We are confident that with the help of our community leaders, partners, and residents' that these priorities will be identified, goals formulated, objectives developed and evidenced based strategies implemented. The following are themes that have been identified through the various assessments. Access to Care Health insurance coverage continues to be a problem within Miami-Dade, where 20.7% of the population has no insurance. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, areas within Miami-Dade, specifically the Northwest, Northeast and Southwest areas of the county, have shortages in primary care professionals, dental health professionals and mental health professionals. This coincides with the sections of the county where most of the residents with low income live. Health Equity According to the CDC, health equity is achieved when every person can obtain their full health potential and that no one is disadvantaged from achieving their full health potential because of social position or other socially determined circumstances. The CHA serves as an opportunity in Miami-Dade to help achieve health equity through a multisectoral and multidisciplinary manner to ensure that all residents within Miami-Dade County have access to resources that will provide them with the tools needed to obtain more positive health outcomes. Chronic Disease Cancer rates overall have decreased within the county. However, there remains a disparity with cancer rates among African Americans being higher when compared to other ethnicities. Alzheimer's disease death rates are steadily increasing, as is diabetes. We are seeing a decrease in heart disease death rate however the rates of mortality from stroke is on the rise. Infectious Diseases The rates of sexually transmitted diseases, specifically gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis, have been on the rise. Although HIV/AIDS death have been decreasing in Miami-Dade County, our rates are higher than the State and our peer counties. Maternal Child Health The rate of infants born in Miami-Dade County has been decreasing. The past few years has shown a rise in the infant mortality rate. Mental Health From the various focus groups that were held mental health, behavioral health, and the opioid epidemic has been named as areas in need of attention by our community. Social Determinants of Health Healthy People 2030 defines the social determinants of health as the factors and conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality of life outcomes and risks. The social determinants of health can be grouped into 5 domains. These include Economic Stability, Education Access and Quality, Health Care Access and Quality, Neighborhood and Built Environment, and Social and Community Context. It is important for community stakeholders to understand these factors influence the opportunities available to the community to practice healthy behaviors and lifestyle choices. 216 Revised 4-26-2022 Although Miami-Dade County has resources within the community, there is a lack of coordination between healthcare providers. Additionally, although many entities collect data, the lack of a fully integrated system for data sharing is lacking within the community. The purpose of the CHA is to provide the Miami-Dade County community with quantitative and qualitative data that will allow for informed community decision making. There are many evidenced based strategies and programs being implemented throughout Miami-Dade County that address the areas above. We are confident that by taking a coordinated and integrated approach the Miami-Dade community will be able to develop a comprehensive Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). 217 Revised 4-26-2022 NEXT STEPS The CHA continues to serve as guidance to help monitor the status of the 2019-2024 Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). The CHIP is a long term-systematic plan that addresses public health concerns that arise from the community health assessment. The idea behind this plan is to set priorities and coordinate and target resources to address health outcomes. This plan is developed in a collaborative manner and will be used to address areas within the CHA that need improvement. There will be a continued series of meetings where community residents, partners and stakeholders will be invited to identify strategic issues, formulate goals and strategies and develop an action plan. For health equity to be achieved we will need to work in a multisectoral, multidisciplinary manner to ensure that all residents within Miami-Dade County have access to resources that will provide them with the tools needed to obtain more positive health outcomes.

The public health community plays a critical role in handling major threats t o the public's healt h. All of the entities within a local public health system ( LPHS ) contribute to the health and well -being of the community in some way. Taking a systems perspective with this assessment ensures that the contributions of all entities are recognized in assessing the local delivery of the 10 Essential Public Health Services. The public health system plays a critical role in handling major threats to the public's health. 2017 -2018 Local Public Health System Assessment Miami -Dade County 5 Acknowledgements A diverse composition of public health system partners was represented at the Local Public Health System Assessment Community Meeting. T he assessment was well received among participants.

The two -day event brought together public, private and volun tary entities that contribute to the delivery of essential public health services. During the event, representatives of organizations that play an important role in improving the health in Miami -Dade County evaluate d LPHS activities and identified areas o f the LPHS that need improvement . Attendees assessed how well the organizations in the system are communicating, connecting, and coordinating services. In addition, Florida Senator Rene Garcia (R), District 36, shared remarks on the importance of health or ganizations working together as an integrated health care system to improve the overall well -being of the community. The LPHSA focuses on all entities that contribute to the delivery of public health services within a local area. The assessment is one of the four assessments as part of the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) process for community health improvement. The LPHSA is completed using the National Public Health Performance Standards Local Instru ment, a guideline that describes the model LPHS. The Ten Essential Public Health Services provided the framework for the assessment. The assessment process influenced knowledge of the Ten Essential Services. Over one h undred attendees representi ng forty organizations participated in the community meeting. A diverse composition of public health partners was represented, and the assessment was well received among participants. The local public health system was scored in perceive d performance and common themes of discussion across all services and standards were identified. An optimal level of performance is the level to which all local public health systems should aspire. The Miami -Dade County public health system ranked as Significan t Activity in overal l performance. The highest ranked service for performance was Essential Service 5 Develop Policies and Plans that Support Individual and Community Health Efforts. The three lowest ranked services for performance were Essential Service 7 Link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of healthcare when otherwise unavailable , Essential Service 9 Evaluate Effectiveness, Accessibility, and Quality of Personal and Population -Based Health Services , and Essential Service 1 0 Research for New Insights and Innovative Solutions to Health Problems . 2017 -2018 Local Public Health System Assessment Miami -Dade County 7 Background Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) Process The Florida Department of Health in Miami -Dade County embarked on a new cyc le of Community Health Planning. The LPHSA Community Meeting was the first meeting of the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) process. MAPP is a community -driven process for improving community health. Using MAPP, communities seek to achieve op timal health by identifying and using their resources wisely, taking into account their unique circumstances and needs, and forming effective partnerships for strategic action. The first phase of MAPP involves two critical and interrelated activities: or ganizing the planning process and developing the planning partnership. Visioning, the second phase of MAPP, guides the community through a collaborative, creative process that leads to a shared community vision and common values. The next phase involves t he four assessments. Each assessment yield s important information for improving community health, but the value of the four MAPP Assessments is multiplied by considering the findings as a whole. In the Identification phase of the MAPP process participants develop an ordered list of the most important issues facing the community. During the Formu late Goals and Strategies phase, participants take the strategic issues identified in the previous phase and formulate goal statements related to those issues. The last phase, Action Cycle , links three activities - Planning, Implementation, and Evaluation. The process consists of four community health assessments: Local Public Health System Assessment, Community Themes and Strengths Assessment, Forces of Change Assessment, and the Community Health Status Assessment. The four assessments examine issues such as risk factors for disease, illness and mortality, socioeconomic and environmental conditions, inequities in health, and quality of life. These assess ments can help identify and prioritize health problems, facilitate planning , and determine actions to address identified problems. The 2017 -2018 assessments are vital in the development of the new 2019 -2024 Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP), the com munity's 5 -year plan for improving community health and quality of life. The CHIP is a community -wide strategic plan that incorporates the activities of many organizations and departments and addresses the health issues identified through the four MAPP ass essments. It is a plan that the entire public health system in Miami -Dade County will be able to follow and incorporate to have a long -term, systematic effort to add ress public health problems in the community. 2017 -2018 Local Public Health System Assessment Miami -Dade County 8 Meeting Objectives The Local Public Health System Assessment (LPHSA) answers the questions, \"What are the components, activities, competencies, and capacities of our local public health system?\" and \"How are the Essential Services being provided to our community?\" The Local Public Health System Ass essment is a broad assessment, involving all of the organizations and entities that contribute to public health in the community. The objectives of the LPHSA Community M eeting were to understand the role of the local public health system assessment and ga in understanding on how well the Miami -Dade County public health system is performing against optimal standards for delivery of the essential health services. Assessment Tool The N ational Public Health Performance Standards (NPHPS) Local Public Health System Performance Assessment Instrument (Local Instrument) was used during the LPHSA Community Meeting. The assessment tool was developed and updated under the leadership of the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and focuses on the local public health system or all entities that contribute to the delivery of public health services within a local area. The 10 Essential Public Health Services (Essential Serv ices) provide the framework for the Local Instrument by describing the public health activities that should be undertaken in all local communities. The Performance Standards related to each Essential Service describe an optimal level of performance and cap acity to which all LPHSs should aspire. Therefore, the Local Instrument provides every LPHS, regardless of the level of sophistication, with benchmarks by which the system can be assessed to help identify s trengths, weaknesses, and short and long - term impr ovement opportunities. The Local Instrument is a valuable tool for identifying areas for system improvement, strengthening local partnerships, and assuring that a strong system is in place for effective delivery of day -to-day public health services and res ponse to public health emergencies. 2017 -2018 Local Public Health System Assessment Miami -Dade County 9 10 Essential Services of Public Health The 10 Essential Services (Essential Services) provide the framework for the Local Assessment Tool/Instrument by describing the public health activities that should be undert aken in all local communities. The three core functions of public health and the 10 Essential Public Health Services provide a working definition of public health and a guiding framework for the responsibilities of local public health systems. The function s of Assessment, Policy Development, and Assurance help to balance and focus three core public health responsibilities while striving to provide essential population based services to constituents. All public or community health responsibilities whether co nducted by the local public health department or another organization within the community can be categorized into one of the services. The Essential Services that constitute Assessment are: 1. Monitor health status to identify community health problems. 2. Diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the community. The Essential Services that constitute Policy Development include: 3. Inform , educate, and empower people about health issues. 4. Mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems. 5. Develop policies and plans that support individual and community health efforts. The Essential Services that constitute Assurance are: 6. Enforce laws and regulations that protect health and ensu re safety. 7. Link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of health care when otherwise unavailable. 8. Assure a competent public health and personal health care workforce. 9. Evaluate effectiveness, accessibility, and quality of persona l and population -based health services. Essential Service 10 Research for new insights and innovative solutions to health problems can involve all of the other Essential Services. 2017 -2018 Local Public Health System Assessment Miami -Dade County 10 Framework The Ten Essential Services provide the framework for the assessment. Each essential service contains two to four Model Standards, and each model standard contains two to six Benchmark Activities. A description of the essential services, model standards , and benchmark activities are found within the local instrument. Performance Measures Benchmark activities are phrased as questions about the local public health system and act as the performance measures of the assessment. The activities associated with each model standard were phrased in the fo rm of a question, starting with \"At what level does the local public health system...\" and then scored by participants by level of activity. Participants used the following scoring chart to rate each performance measure. Optimal Activity (76-100%) Greater than 75% of the activity described within the question is met. Significant Activity (51-75%) Greater than 50% but no more than 75% of the activity described within the question is met. Moderate Activity (26-50%) Greater than 25% but no more than 50% of the activity described within the question is met. Minimal Activity (1-25%) Greater than zero but no more than 25% of the activity described within the question is met. No Activity (0%) 0% or absolutely no activity. Model Standards Benchmark ActivitiesEssential Service 2017 -2018 Local Public Health System Assessment Miami -Dade County 11 Methodology The LPHSA Community Meeting was held at the United Way Center for Excellence Building in Miami, Florida on August 24, 2017 and August 25, 2017. The two -day event consisted of concurrent breakout sessions each focused on one Essential Public Health Service. On day 1 of the event, Essential Services 1 -6 were covered during the facilitated sessions. On day 2 of the event, Essential Services 7 -10 were covered . The meeting agenda ca n be found in Appendix 1. Participants were asked to register to attend the event in advance. D uring the registration process , participants identi fied the Essential Services where their organization was active . To ensure fruitful dialogue in the sessions, participants were assigned to breakout sessions based on the Essential Services identified during the registration process. In each breakout session, skilled facilitators guided participants through the assessment tool and conducted audience polling. In each session, trained scribes were responsible for completing the assessment tool as participants provided feedback. Each breakout session presentation was linked with Participoll for audience polling with real -time results. Participants were asked to vote by accessing a website. When participants accessed the website, six answer options appeared on participant's screens as lettered, colorful buttons. Only five answer options (A -E) were used in the polls. If technical difficulties were encountered during the polling, participants used the five colored index cards found in their welcome packet to vote. \"Great way to participate, well organized - loved the online poll system.\" -Participant feedback form, 2017 LPHSA 2017 -2018 Local Assessment Miami -Dade County 12 11% 22% 40%27%Pre-Assessment Results Never heard of them Not very familiar Somewhat familiar Very familiar6% 10% 38%44%Post -Assessment Results Never heard of them Not very familiar Somewhat familiar Very familiar 4% 8% 88%Post -Assessment Results Not at all Somewhat DefinitelyResults Participant Pre and Post -Assessment Participants were given a pre and post assessment on two major conceptual components of the Local Public Health System Assessment: Familiarity with the 10 Essential Services and identification with the Public Health System . The assessment process influenced knowledge of the 10 Essential Public Health Servic es. Sixty - seven (67) percent of respondents reported being \"somewhat\" or \"very\" familiar with the essential services prior to the assessment. After the assessment, eighty -two (82) percent felt that they were somewhat or very familiar with the services, ind icating that learning occurred. An increase in familiarity is important because the Essential Services serve as a community framework for the core functions of public health, and a foundation for collective public health activity. How familiar are you with the Ten (10) Essential Services? Seventy -seven (77) percent of respondents reported being \"definitely\" part of the public health system prior to the assessment. After the assessment, eighty -eight (88) percent felt that they were \"definitely\" part of the public health system. During the post -assessment, four (4) percent of respondents noted that they did not consider themselves as part of the public health system. I consider myself or my organization part of the Miami -Dade County Public Health System. 22% 77%Pre-Assessment Results Somewhat Definitely2017 -2018 Local Public Health System Assessment Miami -Dade County 13 Performance Scores The local public health system assessment is a community review and assessment of public health system performance based on a set of national standards for each of the ten essential services. Essential S ervices describe what public health seeks to accomplish and how it will carry out its basic responsibilities. In an ideal public health system, all activities would be performing at an optimal level of performance, defined as the system meeting greater than 75% of activity for all benchmarks within each model standard. An optimal level of performance is the level to which all local public health systems should aspire. Essential Services: Summary Overview The Miami -Dade County local public health system's ove rall performance ranking score wa s 67%, which represents Significant Activity .

The prioritization ranking measures which activities are perceived as having the greatest priority relative to each other. On Monday, January 29, 2018, the suppl emental Priority of Model Standards Questionnaire was completed during a community webinar. The webinar slides can be found in Appendix 2 . The Local Assessment Instrument scoring was amended to allow participants to vote using Participoll, an audience pol ling add -in for PowerPoint that uses audience members' electronic devices for anonymous voting and displays results live in the slides. The original scale of 1 to 10 (with 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest) was modified to reflect five response o ptions: Very High Priority; High Priority; Moderate Priority; Low Priority; and Very Low Priority. Participoll Voting Option Priority Ranking Scale Equivalent A Very High Priority 10 B High Priority 8 C Moderate Priority 6 D Low Priority 4 E Very Low Priority 2 2017 -2018 Local Public Health System Assessment Miami -Dade County 19 All model standards are considered important to the function of the local public health system. For the purpose of this comparison, the top half scores were ranked as \"Higher\" and the bottom half scores were ranked as \"Lower.\" The Priority matrix compares perceived performance versus perceived priority. Quadrants are used as a way for planners to weigh potential actions versus their perceived significance in the local public health system to maximize impact within the community. Performance Ranking Priority Ranking Quadrant Significance to the local health department Lower Performance Higher Priority A These activities may need increased attention. Higher Performance Higher Priority B These activities are being done well, and it is important to maintain efforts. Higher Performance Lower Priority C These activities are being done well, consideration may be given to reducing effort in these areas. Lower Performance Lower Priority D These activities could be improved, but are of low contribution. They may need little or no attention at this time. On a scale from Very High Priority to Very Low Priority , there were no model s tandards that ranked below Moderate Activity . Nineteen mode l standards ranked as Very High Priority (10 on the rating scale), ten model standards ranked as High Priority (8 on the rating scale), and one model standard ranked as Moderate Priority (6 on the rating scale). Two model standards for Essential Services 1, 6, 7 and 9 ranked as High Priority and Low Performance. The activities of the following eleven (11) model standards may need increased attention due to their quadrant ranking.

The primary function o f the PMC is to advise and guide the creation, deployment and continuous evaluation of the department's performance management system and its components. The PMC is comprised of the Health Officer, executive management, accreditation liaisons, and staff re sponsible for QI projects, QI Plan, CHIP, and Strategic Plan implementation. Completing the questionnaire is useful for understanding the local health department's role specifically and can serve as an important input into the local health department's ow n strategic planning efforts. The results may serve to catalyze or strengthen performance improvement activities resulting from the assessment process, and will inform the upcoming strategic planning process that the agency will undertake in 2018. Particip ants came to a consensus on the percentage of the work for each Model Standard that is contributed directly by the local health department by using a similar scale used to assess the Model Standards in the core Local Instrument.

The 2012 and 2017 assessments used the National Public Health Performance Standards (NPHPS) local public health system assessment instrument. The NPHPS provide a framework to assess capacity and performance of the local health system, which can help identify a reas for system improvement, strengthen partnerships, and ensure that a strong system is in place for addressing public health issues. A change in assessment methodology and survey administration is noted between the 2012 and 2017 assessments. Both assessm ents scored the system in the Significant Activity category overall.

How well are the 10 Essential Public Health Services being provided in our public health system? DESCRIPTION The local public health system assessment is a community review and assessment of public health system performance based on a set of national standards for each of the ten Essential Services. Essential Services describe what public health seeks to accomplish and how it will carry out its basic responsibilities. In an ideal public health system, all activities would be performing at an optimal level of performance, defined as the system meeting greater than 75% of activity for all benchmarks within each model standard. An optimal level of performance is the level to which all local public health systems should aspire.ASSURANCE ASSESSMENT POLICY DEVELOPMENT EvaluateMonitor Health Diagnose & Investigate Inform, Educate, Empower Mobilize Community Health System Assessment Infographic 462017 Local Public Health System Assessment Miami-Dade County, Florida > 75% 2012 67% 2017PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT The last local public health system assessment was performed in 2012*. Both assessments scored the system in the Significant Activity category overall. The 2017 overall performance decreased in performance by 11% as compared to the 2012 local public health system assessment. *The 2012 and 2017 assessments used the National Public Health Performance Standards (NPHPS) local public health system assessment instrument. The NPHPS provide a framework to assess capacity and performance of the local health system, which can help identify areas for system improvement, strengthen partnerships, and ensure that a strong system is in place for addressing public health issues. A change in assessment methodology and survey administration is noted between the 2012 and 2017 assessments.Two Essential Services scored Optimal, seven scored Significant, and one as Moderate Activity.

The NPHPS assessment instruments guide state and local jurisdictions in evaluating their current performance against a set of optimal standards. Through these assessments, responding sites can consider the activities of all public health system partners, thus addressing the activities of all public, private and voluntary entities that contribute to public health within the community. The NPHPS assessments are intended to help users answer questions such as \"What are the components, activities, competencies, and capacities of our public health system?\" and \"How well are the ten Essential Public Health Services being provided in our system?\" The dialogue that occurs in the process of answering the questions in the assessment instrument can help to identify strengths and weaknesses, determine opportunities for immediate improvements, and establish priorities for long term investments for improving the public health system. Three assessment instruments have been designed to assist state and local partners in assessing and improving their public health systems or boards of health. These instruments are the: State Public Health System Performance Assessment Instrument, Local Public Health System Performance Assessment Instrument, and Public Health Governing Entity Performance Assessment Instrument. The information obtained from assessments may then be used to improve and better coordinate public health activities at state and local levels. In addition, the results gathered provide an understanding of how state and local public health systems and governing entities are performing. This information helps local, state and national partners make better and more effective policy and resource decisions to improve the nation's public health as a whole. Acknowledgements The National Public Health Performance Standards (NPHPS) was developed collaboratively by the program's national partner organizations. The NPHPS partner organizations include: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); American Public Health Association (APHA); Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO); National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO); National Association of Local Boards of Health (NALBOH); National Network of Public Health Institutes (NNPHI); and then Public Health Foundation (PHF). We thank the staff of these organizations for their time and expertise in the support of the NPHPS. Appendix 4: 2017-2018 NPHPS Report 72Introduction The NPHPS Local Public Health System Assessment Report is designed to help health departments and public health system partners create a snapshot of where they are relative to the National Public Health Performance Standards and to progressively move toward refining and improving outcomes for performance across the public health system. The NPHPS state, local, and governance instruments also offer opportunity and robust data to link to health departments, public health system partners and/or community-wide strategic planning processes, as well as to Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) standards. For example, assessment of the environment external to the public health organization is a key component of all strategic planning, and the NPHPS assessment readily provides a structured process and an evidence-base upon which key organizational decisions may be made and priorities established. The assessment may also be used as a component of community health improvement planning processes, such as Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) or other community-wide strategic planning efforts, including state health improvement planning and community health improvement planning. The NPHPS process also drives assessment and improvement activities that may be used to support a Health Department in meeting PHAB standards. Regardless of whether using MAPP or another health improvement process, partners should use the NPHPS results to support quality improvement. The self-assessment is structured around the Model Standards for each of the ten Essential Public Health Services, (EPHS), hereafter referred to as the Essential Services, which were developed through a comprehensive, collaborative process involving input from national, state and local experts in public health. Altogether, for the local assessment, 30 Model Standards serve as quality indicators that are organized into the ten essential public health service areas in the instrument and address the three core functions of public health. Figure 1 below shows how the ten Essential Services align with the three Core Functions of Public Health. Figure 1. The ten Essential Public Health Services and how they relate to the three Core Functions of Public Health. Appendix 4: 2017-2018 NPHPS Report 730% or absolutely no activity. Greater than zero, but no more than 25% of the activity described within the question is met.Significant Activity (51-75%) Moderate Activity (26-50%)Purpose The primary purpose of the NPHPS Local Public Health System Assessment Report is to promote continuous improvement that will result in positive outcomes for system performance. Local health departments and their public health system partners can use the Assessment Report as a working tool to: Better understand current system functioning and performance; Identify and prioritize areas of strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement; Articulate the value that quality improvement initiatives will bring to the public health system; Develop an initial work plan with specific quality improvement strategies to achieve goals; Begin taking action for achieving performance and quality improvement in one or more targeted areas; and Re-assess the progress of improvement efforts at regular intervals. This report is designed to facilitate communication and sharing among and within programs, partners, and organizations, based on a common understanding of how a high performing and effective public health system can operate. This shared frame of reference will help build commitment and focus for setting priorities and improving public health system performance. Outcomes for performance include delivery of all ten essential public health services at optimal levels. Greater than 75% of the activity described within the question is met.About the Report Calculating the Scores The NPHPS assessment instruments are constructed using the ten Essential Services as a framework. Within the Local Instrument, each Essential Service includes between 2-4 Model Standards that describe the key aspects of an optimally performing public health system. Each Model Standard is followed by assessment questions that serve as measures of performance. Responses to these questions indicate how well the Model Standard - which portrays the highest level of performance or \"gold standard\" - is being met. Table 1 below characterizes levels of activity for Essential Services and Model Standards. Using the responses to all of the assessment questions, a scoring process generates score for each Model Standard, Essential Service, and one overall assessment score. Optimal Activity (76-100%)Table 1. Summary of Assessment Response Options Greater than 50%, but no more than 75% of the activity described within the question is met. Minimal Activity (1-25%) No Activity (0%)Greater than 25%, but no more than 50% of the activity described within the question is met. Appendix 4: 2017-2018 NPHPS Report 74Understanding Data Limitations There are a number of limitations to the NPHPS assessment data due to self-report, wide variations in the breadth and knowledge of participants, the variety of assessment methods used, and differences in interpretation of assessment questions. Data and resultant information should not be interpreted to reflect the capacity or performance of any single agency or organization within the public health system or used for comparisons between jurisdictions or organizations. Use of NPHPS generated data and associated recommendations are limited to guiding an overall public health infrastructure and performance improvement process for the public health system as determined by organizations involved in the assessment. All performance scores are an average; Model Standard scores are an average of the question scores within that Model Standard, Essential Service scores are an average of the Model Standard scores within that Essential Service and the overall assessment score is the average of the Essential Service scores. The responses to the questions within the assessment are based upon processes that utilize input from diverse system participants with different experiences and perspectives. The gathering of these inputs and the development of a response for each question incorporates an element of subjectivity, which may be minimized through the use of particular assessment methods. Additionally, while certain assessment methods are recommended, processes differ among sites. The assessment methods are not fully standardized and these differences in administration of the self-assessment may introduce an element of measurement error. In addition, there are differences in knowledge about the public health system among assessment participants. This may lead to some interpretation differences and issues for some questions, potentially introducing a degree of random non-sampling error. Presentation of results The NPHPS has attempted to present results - through a variety of figures and tables - in a user-friendly and clear manner. For ease of use, many figures and tables use short titles to refer to Essential Services, Model Standards, and questions. If you are in doubt of these definitions, please refer to the full text in the assessment instruments. Sites may have chosen to complete two additional questionnaires, the Priority of Model Standards Questionnaire assesses how performance of each Model Standard compares with the priority rating and the Agency Contribution Questionnaire assesses the local health department's contribution to achieving the Model Standard. Sites that submitted responses for these questionnaires will see the results included as additional components of their report. Results Now that your assessment is completed, one of the most exciting, yet challenging opportunities is to begin to review and analyze the findings. As you recall from your assessment, the data you created now establishes the foundation upon which you may set priorities for performance improvement and identify specific quality improvement (QI) projects to support your priorities. Based upon the responses you provided during your assessment, an average was calculated for each of the ten Essential Services. Each Essential Service score can be interpreted as the overall degree to which your public health system meets the performance standards (quality indicators) for each Essential Service. Scores can range from a minimum value of 0% (no activity is performed pursuant to the standards) to a maximum value of 100% (all activities associated with the standards are performed at optimal levels). Figure 2 displays the average score for each Essential Service, along with an overall average assessment score across all ten Essential Services. Take a look at the overall performance scores for each Essential Service. Examination of these scores can immediately give a sense of the local public health system's greatest strengths and weaknesses. Note the black bars that identify the range of reported performance score responses within each Essential Service.

A primary goal of the NPHPS is that data is used proactively to monitor, assess, and improve the quality of essential public health services. This report is an initial step to identifying immediate actions and activities to improve local initiatives. The results in this report may also be used to identify longer-term priorities for improvement, as well as possible improvement projects. As noted in the Introduction of this report, NPHPS data may be used to inform a variety of organization and/or systems planning and improvement processes. Plan to use both quantitative data (Appendix A) and qualitative data (Appendix B) from the assessment to identify improvement opportunities. While there may be many potential quality improvement projects, do not be overwhelmed - the point is not that you have to address them all now. Rather, consider this step as a way to identify possible opportunities to enhance your system performance and plan to use the guidance provided in this section, along with the resources offered in Appendix C, to develop specific goals for improvement within your public health system and move from assessment and analysis toward action. Note: Communities implementing Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) may refer to the MAPP guidance for considering NPHPS data along with other assessment data in the Identifying Strategic Issues phase of MAPP. Analysis and Discussion Questions Having a standard way in which to analyze the data in this report is important. This process does not have to be difficult; however, drawing some initial conclusions from your data will prove invaluable as you move forward with your improvement efforts. It is crucial that participants fully discuss the performance assessment results. The bar graphs, charts, and summary information in the Results section of this report should be helpful in identifying high and low performing areas. Please refer to Appendix H of the Local Assessment Implementation Guide. This referenced set of discussion questions will to help guide you as you analyze the data found in the previous sections of this report. Using the results in this report will help you to generate priorities for improvement, as well as possible improvement projects. Your data analysis should be an interactive process, enabling everyone to participate. Do not be overwhelmed by the potential of many possibilities for QI projects - the point is not that you have to address them all now. Consider this step as identifying possible opportunities to enhance your system performance. Keep in mind both your quantitative data (Appendix A) and the qualitative data that you collected during the assessment (Appendix B). Appendix 4: 2017-2018 NPHPS Report 86Action Planning In any systems improvement and planning process, it is important to involve all public health system partners in determining ways to improve the quality of essential public health services provided by the system. Participation in the improvement and planning activities included in your action plan is the responsibility of all partners within the public health system. Consider the following points as you build an Action Plan to address the priorities you have identified Each public health partner should be considered when approaching quality improvement for your system The success of your improvement activities are dependent upon the active participation and contribution of each and every member of the system An integral part of performance improvement is working consistently to have long-term effects A multi-disciplinary approach that employs measurement and analysis is key to accomplishing and sustaining improvements You may find that using the simple acronym, 'FOCUS' is a way to help you to move from assessment and analysis to action. F Find an opportunity for improvement using your results. O Organize a team of public health system partners to work on the improvement. Someone in the group should be identified as the team leader. Team members should represent the appropriate organizations that can make an impact. C Consider the current process, where simple improvements can be made and who should make the improvements. U Understand the problem further if necessary, how and why it is occurring, and the factors that contribute to it. Once you have identified priorities, finding solutions entails delving into possible reasons, or \"root causes,\" of the weakness or problem. Only when participants determine why performance problems (or successes!) have occurred will they be able to identify workable solutions that improve future performance. Most performance issues may be traced to well-defined system causes, such as policies, leadership, funding, incentives, information, personnel or coordination. Many QI tools are applicable. You may consider using a variety of basic QI tools such as brainstorming, 5-whys, prioritization, or cause and effect diagrams to better understand the problem (refer to Appendix C for resources). S Select the improvement strategies to be made. Consider using a table or chart to summarize your Action Plan. Many resources are available to assist you in putting your plan on paper, but in general you'll want to include the priority selected, the goal, the improvement activities to be conducted, who will carry them out, and the timeline for completing the improvement activities. When complete, your Action Plan should contain documentation on the indicators to be used, baseline performance levels and targets to be achieved, responsibilities for carrying out improvement activities and the collection and analysis of data to monitor progress. (Additional resources may be found in Appendix C.) Appendix 4: 2017-2018 NPHPS Report 87Monitoring and Evaluation: Keys to Success Monitoring your action plan is a highly proactive and continuous process that is far more than simply taking an occasional \"snap-shot\" that produces additional data. Evaluation, in contrast to monitoring, provides ongoing structured information that focuses on why results are or are not being met, what unintended consequences may be, or on issues of efficiency, effectiveness, and/or sustainability. After your Action Plan is implemented, monitoring and evaluation continues to determine whether quality improvement occurred and whether the activities were effective. If the Essential Service performance does not improve within the expected time, additional evaluation must be conducted (an additional QI cycle) to determine why and how you can update your Action Plan to be more effective. The Action Plan can be adjusted as you continue to monitor and evaluate your efforts.

Link websites. Use universities as an avenue for information.Community is invested in assessments. Various databases such as FLHealthCHARTS and Miami Matters help to identify and monitor health problems. The community can access a wealth of data.There is not a common definition for CHA & CHIP. Community does not know how to access the data or does not know it exists. The community is working in silos. Data overload. There is a lack of monitoring results. Lack of effective deployment. The community is not aware of the Community Health Improvement Plan and how to access it. Community members do not have the expertise to synthesize the data. Databases are limited in ability. Appendix 4: 2017-2018 NPHPS Report 971.2 GIS mapping used in service delivery. Increased GIS capability by universities, FDOH.Community needs better access to chronic disease data.

Difficulty in assessing the information. There is a lack of funding to adequately monitor health status. Lack an inventory /comprehensive list of available registries. Availability to pull down available data. Limited resources to maintain registries. FDOH does not have a TB registry. Birth & Death registry is strictly regulated. Appendix 4: 2017-2018 NPHPS Report 99Increase community involvement. Work with all zip codes to help under- served and those showing a need for help. Increase outreach (especially preschools and childcare centers). Identify location and resources available.Identify ways to improve resources for community surveillance (financial resources, all kinds of resources). Increase transportation and transit planning. Community organizations recognizing that they are part of the health system.Model Standard: Identification and Surveillance of Health Threats Vast network to identify threats. There is strong local, state and national alignment. Surveillance information is readily available. Sharing of information. Availability of information. Diversity. Multiple surveillance systems exist (syndromic surveillance; crash data). Public health schools help train epidemiologists and monitor diseases. Jessie Trice Community Centers conduct outreach and educate others. DOH - monitor health safety (Healthcare Preparedness Coalition). Homeless population and shelters (report diseases - HIV, TB testing). Domestic violence (HIV testing). Infectious diseases are reported quickly (within 24 hours for some diseases).Community needs stronger networks. Surveillance needs to be completed in a timely fashion. Redundancy present. Systems not user friendly. Not enough evidence based information for diverse groups. Long reporting process. There is a disconnect between national and state communication with data.

Timing of regulations. Certain communities lack coverage. Residents do not have access to care to get to labs. Residents lack health insurance so they are not tested. Cumbersome pre-approval process to send to a laboratory. Confirmatory process (pregnant women do not get their results in time and babies are already born). Lab support needs to be more timely and efficient.Share all of the information discussed in community meetings. Reinforce changes. Improve influx capacity to better prepare to rapidly expand if there is an influx of cases. Expand ability to handle the rush of labs needed depending on the situation and/or disease (Ex. Ebola, Zika).

Most organizations have a Public Health Information Officer to get messages out to the public. Majority of partners have a health communication plan (i.e. Jackson Health Systems has a social media team; DOH has statewide media office, Tallahassee sends down information to counties to disseminate to communities). Stakeholders use community organizations to spread message to the community (i.e. Consortium for a Healthier Miami-Dade).There are funding restrictions. Local health organizations train smaller organizations on how to promote health messages to the public. Increase cultural competency. Train organizations on diversity or health literacy/cultural background of the community. Public health servants spread awareness and also stay current about public health issues. Ensure that health messages are appropriate. Research and analyze community needs.Increase co-branding opportunities. Appendix 4: 2017-2018 NPHPS Report 104Many partners are not aware of the emergency communication plan. Emergency communication plan has a line of authority, but it is not clear. Some resources are not available to the public. Most partners not aware of the emergency communication plan and partners do not receive messages.Share with partners a checklist on what needs to be done during an emergency. Trainings on disaster prep for Public Information Officers. Increase involvement from media and faithbased organizations.3.3 Model Standard: Risk Communication Partners receive emergency messages.

Strong coalitions: Alliance for Aging, Shine, Health Council. Sharing of funds through partnerships. There are geographically based alliances (example: Liberty City; West Kendall). Better understanding of issues regarding public health, mental health, and community health. Partners working together. Public health has gained more momentum. Specific pockets of the population are now more aware.Some coalitions are similar enough to work together (merge). Fighting for funding. Local politics. Too many personal interests. Jurisdiction problems that create issues moving forward - cities dropping off homeless people in other cities to be dealt with by other city. Geographical size/diversity. Isolation of cities within the same county. Health organizations not trusting each other. There is a lack of shared databases. Unable to determine how resources are being communicated on a larger scale. Lack of common terminology. Cultural perspective of what is considered healthy. Lack of resources.Develop a community wide database. Ability of people to understand the information they are receiving (referring to the appropriate language). Keep organizations engaged when there is no crisis. Link people to the appropriate place. Send patients to the right place. Focus on prevention. Become smoke free or create similar policies. Expand employee wellness to reduce illness, and reduce sick days.Rather than being prescriptive, identify what the community needs at a grassroots level. Keep in front of crisis since Miami is rapidly changing. Learn to disseminate information in the community. Address climate change. Sustain partnerships and link them together using a Consortium-like method to build and expand on our improvement plan. Conduct studies on targeted populations (ex: infant mortality in Haitian population). Help the community trust the health system. Improve perception of the public. Improve county disparities.

The purpo se of this assessment is to identify the trends, factors, and events that are likely to influence community health and quality of life, or impact the work of the local public health system in Miami -Dade County. The Forces of Change Assessment brainstorming session focused on answering the following questions: What has occurred recently that may affect our local public health system or the health of our community? Are there trends occurring that will have an impact? What forces are occurring locally? Region ally? Nationally? Globally? What may occur in the foreseeable future that may affect our public health system or the health of our community? 2018 Forces of Change Assessment Miami -Dade County 5Acknowledgements Organizations and sectors that play important roles in promoting and impr oving the health in Miami -Dade County were adequately represented at the Forces of Change Assessment Community Meeting. T he assessment process was well received among participants. During the registration process, eighty (80) individuals from fifty-five (55) different community organizations registered to attend the event. On the day of the event, t here was a total of sixty-four (64 ) sign-ins representing forty-two (42) unduplicated organizations . Approximately 20% of those who registered did not attend the event. The following organizations participated in the event: Miami -Dade Police Miami -Dade Solid Waste/M osquito Control Nicklaus Children's Health System Nova Southeastern University South Florida Behavioral Health Network St. Thomas University State Attorney Office The Children's Trust The City of Coral Gables Theresa Gilmore, LAc Town of Cutler Bay UF/IFA S Extension Family Nutrition Program UF/Miami -Dade County Extension UHealth United Way of Miami -Dade University of Miami VITAS Healthcare West Kendall Baptist Hospital/Healthy West Kendall Barry University City of Aventura Community Health of South Flori da, Inc.

The Forces of Change Assessment folds into the Mobilizing for Action through Plann ing and Partnerships (MAPP) model of community health improvement as one of the four types of assessments that informs the new Community Health Improvement Plan. Taken together, the four assessments of the MAPP process create a comprehensive view of health and quality of life in Miami -Dade County, and constitute the Miami - Dade County Community Health Assessment. During the community meeting, a varied group of community partners engaged in brainstorming sessions and discussed key factors that directly or in directly affect health and the health of the community. Examples of some of the key forces discussed included: Social/Mental H ealth Lack of Affordable H ousing Opioid E pidemic Gun Violence Lack of Data Driven Decisions Lack of Coordination between Healt hcare P roviders Lack of F ully Integr ated Data Sharing S ystem Healthcare Immigration P olicy Change The forces identified through this process - together with the results of the other three MAPP Assessments - will serve as the foundation for the identificat ion of s trategic issues. By understanding and preparing for these forces of change, the Miami -Dade County community can act to ward off or reduce threats and take advantage of opportunities to protect and improve community health and the public health syst em. 2018 Forces of Change Assessment Miami -Dade County 7 Background Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) Process The Florida Department of Health in Miami -Dade County embarked on a new cyc le of Community Health Planning. The Forces of Change Assessment Community Meeting was the second meeting of the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) process. MAPP is a community -driven process for improving community health. Using MAPP, communities seek to achieve optimal health by identifying and using their r esources wisely, taking into account their unique circumstances and needs, and forming effective partnerships for strategic action. The first phase of MAPP involves two critical and interrelated activities: organizing the planning process and developing the planning partnership. Visioning, the second phase of MAPP, guides the community through a collaborative, creative process that leads to a shared community vision and common values. The next phase involves the four assessments. Each assessment yield s important information for improving community health, but the value of the four MAPP Assessments is multiplied by considering the f indings as a whole. In the Identification phase of the MAPP process participants develop an ordered list of the most importan t issues facing the community. During the Formu late Goals and Strategies phase, participants take the strategic issues identified in the previous phase and formulate goal statements related to those issues. The last phase, Action Cycle , links three activit ies - Planning, Implementation, and Evaluation. The process consists of four community health assessments: Local Public Health System Assessment, Community Themes and Strengths Assessment, Forces of Change Assessment, and the Community Health Status Assess ment. The four assessments examine issues such as risk factors for disease, illness and mortality, socioeconomic and environmental conditions, inequities in health, and quality of life. These assessments can help identify and prioritize health problems, fa cilitate planning , and determine actions to address identified problems. The 2017 -2018 assessments are vital in the development of the new 2019 -2024 Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP), the community's 5 -year plan for improving community health and qu ality of life. The CHIP is a community -wide strategic plan that incorporates the activities of many organizations and departments and addresses the health issues identified through the four MAPP assessments. It is a plan that the entire public health syste m in Miami -Dade County will be able to follow and incorporate to have a long-term, systematic effort to add ress public health problems in the community. 2018 Forces of Change Assessment Miami -Dade County 8 Meeting Objectives The Forces of Change Assessment wa s designed to help participants answer the following questions: \"What is occurring or might occur that affects the health of our community or the local public health system?\" and \"What specific threats or opportunities are generated by these occurrences?\" The objectives of the Community M eeting wer e to identify trends, factors, and events that are or will be influencing the health and quality of life of the community and the local public health system; identify threats or opportunities generated by key forces; and bring partners together on common ground to collaboratively address changes . Forces of Change While it may not seem obvious at first, the broader contextual environment is constantly affecting communities and local public health systems. State and federal legislation, rapid technological advances, changes in the organization of health care services, shifts in economic and employment forces, and changing family structures and gender roles are all examples of Forces of Change. They are important because they affect \u2014 either directly or indir ectly \u2014 the health and quality of life in the community and the effectiveness of the local public health system. The purpose of the Forces of Change Assessment was to identify the external factors that affect the environment in which the Miami -Dade County public health system operates and the related challenges and opportunities these factors pose. Forces of change include factors both generated inside the public health system and imposed from the outside. Forces are a broad all -encompassing category that includes trends, events, and factors. Trends are patterns over time, such as migration in and out of a community or a growing disillusionment with government. Factors are discrete elements, such as a community's large ethnic population, an urban setting, or the jurisdiction's proximity to a major waterway. Events are one -time occurrences, such as a hospital closure, a natural disaster, or the passage of new legislation. 2018 Forces of Change Assessment Miami -Dade County 9 Methodology Session Structure The half -day Force s of Change Assessment Community Meeting consisted of 4 meeting agenda can be found in Appendix 1. Each meeting participant had the opportunity to par ticipate in 2 of the 4 breakout sessions. Each session lasted 1 -hour and was led by a facilitator. Two scribes were in each session capturing the key findings. Pre-Meeting Homework Participants were asked to register to attend the event in advance. Before the meeting, participants received a pre -meeting worksheet to list all brainstormed forces and were encouraged to bring the completed worksheet to the brainstorming session. During the sessions, participants discussed within their teams the forces they listed on the pre -meeting worksheet that were relevant to the session category. The pre -meeting worksheet can be found in Appendix 2. Room Setup In each breakout session, there were 8 -9 tables with 4 chairs and approximately 25 -30 participants in each session. If all the seats in a particular session were filled, the additional attendees were directed to join the other session. Table Discussions/Brainstorming Activity Skilled facilitators guided participants in identifying forces, challenges, and oppo rtunities by asking the following questions: What has occurred recently that may affect our local public health system or community? What may occur in the future? Are there any trends occurring that will have an impact? What forces are occurring locally? Regionally? Nationally? Globally? What characteristics of our jurisdiction or state may pose an opportunity or threat? What may occur or has occurred that may pose a barrier to achieving the shared vision? 2018 Forces of Change Assessment Miami -Dade County 10Teams Identified Key Force Each team ident ified one force outside of their control that affects the local public health system or community, and the challenges (barriers/threats) and opportunities (prospects/responses) associated with each. Teams wrote the forces, challenges, and opportunities on the color - coded half sheets found on their tables. Forces were written on blue sheets, Challenges were written on yellow sheets, and Opportunities were written on green sheets. A sticky wall was used as a facilitation aid in each session. This visual tool is simply a fabric wall that can be mounted on a vertical surface and used to display ideas and concepts generated through the process so that teams can easily see them. The fabric is coated on one side with a special adhesive that allows sheets of paper to be placed, held, and repositioned on the fabric. The sticky wall was tremendously useful in helping the g roups maximize creativity and effectiveness. Teams Reported Out Each team recorded their key force on the half sheets and placed them on the stick y wall under the respective title headings: Forces, Challenges Posed, and Opportunities Created. A lead from each team reported out. The facilitator then opened the floor to questions and comments after each report, guided the group in grouping similar for ces/categories, and placed emphasis on the impact forces will have on the local public health system. Teams Identified Top Forces Once the challenges and opportunities were identified for each force, teams voted for the top 2 forces that will require fo cused attention by the public health system. The facilitator emphasized that teams will identify the forces that have the greatest impact/most significant effect on the community/system (not just one agency) and should take priority in community planning e fforts. The facilitator asked the following questions in preparation for team voting: What are the most significant forces that affect the health of our residents? What are the most significant forces that affect the effectiveness of the public health syst em, either currently or in the foreseeable future? What forces require our immediate or increased attention? What forces require tactical efforts now? What forces should be addressed in our new Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP)? Each team received 2 star-shaped voting stickers to place under the force(s) they believed to have the greatest impact . Scribes capture d the key informati on, include the voting totals on the a ssessment tool, and complete d session summary sheets. F acilitators provided session summaries and an event recap at the end of the meeting. \"The sticky walls were a great way to display the informat ion.\" -Participant feedback form, 201 8 FCA 2018 Forces of Change Assessment Miami -Dade County 11 Results Assessment Findings Key stakeholders in Miami -Dade County identified a wide array of trends, factors, and/or events at the local, state and national levels that influence the health or qual ity of life in the County and its local public health system. Forces of Change information can serve as a vital resource for effective health improvement planning within the community. A total of 19 forces of change were identified spanning the 4 session categories: Social/Economic Forces; Legal/Ethical Forces; Political/Technological Forces; and Environmental/Scientific Forces.

In conjunction with other assessments by the FDOH -MD, the information gathered from the focus groups will assist in identifying areas of concern that resident s face in their communities and allocate needed resources accordingly , which can assist in improving the quality of life for all Miami -Dade County residents. This effort is part of the 2018 Miami -Dade County Community Themes and Strengths Assessment champi oned by the FDOH -MD. The use of focus groups as a Community -Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach in qualitative analysis is widely recommended by experts in the field, as it allows participants to share their knowledge and experience of the communi ty with facilitators , which could subsequently be utilized to support relevant programs or policy development to improve the lives of those involved.1 Focus group p articipants represented 13 clusters in Miami -Dade County (12 neighborhood clusters and one oversampl ed cluster), which are comprised of zip codes linked according to perceived community identity and geographic contiguity . At times the clusters cross boundaries based on socioeconomic status or population size and were identified in previous as sessments of Miami -Dade County .2 The number of residents who participated in the focus groups ranged from 3 to 16, with the smallest number of participants deriving from Cluster 12 (Aventura/Miami Beach) and the largest number from Cluster 11 (North Miami Beach). The focus groups were conducted in public library branches or other community -based locations throughout the county with a total of 92 residents participat ing in the focus group sessions. Gender was the only demographic variable collected with 65.2% of participants being female and 34.8% male. Additional demographic information was not collected from participants in this assessment.

Participants were recruited voluntarily until the target sample size (a minimum of 3 per focus group) was reached. Each focus group session was recor ded for transcription purposes , and any i dentifying information, such as participants' name , was not recorded. Prior to the commencement of the focus group sessions, participants were informed about the purpose of the assessment and they were given instructions on the process involved in obtaining their feedback to the pre -selected questions. Participants were not compensated for their time. The analysis of a ll qualitative data gathered during the focus group sessions was carried out in NVIVO 12 Plus Pro software, a tool designed to ide ntify social themes that emerge from key -informant or face -to- face interviews as well as from focus group sessions. Qualitative researchers have warned about the utilization of numbers or percentages when analyzing qualitative data, as this approach may overestimate participants' responses (same person responding tw o or three times) .8 As such, in instances in which part icipants' responses could not be placed in a binary category (i.e. \"Yes\" or \"No\" response), percentages have not been calculated. However, i n instances in which responses could be placed in a binary category, two different approaches were employed: first, percentages have been calculated based on number of responses out of the total number of participants per cluster and , secondly, percentages based on the number of responses out of total participants who provided a response. It is important to note that i n a few instances, participants responses were unintelligible in the transcription of the recordings, which are the result of participants speaking over one an other or speaking in a very low voice. ICEBREAKER ACTIVITY The focus gro up sessions started wit h an ice breaker activity in which participants were asked to draw their ideal community and to identify in their drawings five community fe atures along with an explanation of why they chose the top five features. The facilitator explained that features could include hospitals, parks, schools, among other features which participants felt were important to them and their families to design their ideal community. Due to the vast amount of content provided by participants, the information has been summarized by highlighting the top five themes or features selected by participants during this discussion. It is noteworthy that a common theme that arose across all clusters was that all features drawn or identif ied by participants were located within walking distance from their homes . As such, proximity and accessibility to these features were drivers for the design of participants' ideal community. Additionally, even though some participants selected hospitals a nd/or health centers as well as churches as community features, they did not surface as a theme. The subsequent discussion expands on the top five features 8 Krueger, RA. Focus group, a practical guide for applied research. SAGE Publications, CA; 2009 6 | P a g e 2 0 1 8 C o m m u n i t y T h e m e s a n d S t r e n g t h s A s s e s s m e n t selected by participants from all clusters which included: grocery stores, shopping centers, schools , police stations/departments, parks or accessibility to parks, and community centers (out of the total number of features selected, three ranked as top four, as such six features were included in the analysis and discussion). The following table summariz es the top features identified by participants: Table 2 - Top Features Identified during the Icebreaker Activity Top Features Identified Quotes from Participants Participant's Cluster (Community) Grocery Stores \"The most important things for me in a community would be grocery stores and restaurants that focus on healthy eating because I'm terrible at it\" Cluster 7 (Doral/Miami Springs/Sunset) Shopping Centers/Malls \"...sooner or later I was going to draw a shopping center for entertainment.\" Cluster 3 (Westchester/West Dade) Schools \"... I put like slash a magnet school because I feel like, umm, like when you put like focus on the like, like certain interests and make school a lot better and it can create a lot of different types of things that I guess kids really want to cultivate but can't\". Cluster 7 (Doral/Miami Springs/Sunset) Police Stations/Departments \"...a police station for safety and then a tight community as well that's surrounded by homes\". Cluster 8 (Miami Shores/Morningshore) Parks \"... then add trails, lakes and rivers, peaceful parks\". Cluster 10 (Opa -Locka/Miami Gardens/Westview) Community Centers \"...also over here you could have like the basketball court or volleyball and a community center where everybody can come together to talk about, uh, what's going on...\" Cluster 13 (Downtown/E. Little Havana/Liberty City/Little Haiti/Overtown) Across all clusters, participants were aware of the importance of eating healthy and the connection between a poor diet and the prevalence of chronic conditions. Based on participants' design of their ideal community, accessibility to grocery stores in the ir neighborhoods was the top feature selected . Participants gave examples, which included accessibility to Publix, Whole Foods, and Presidente supermarkets. The second feature identified by participants were shopping centers or malls . For instance, one pa rticipant from Cluster 1 (South Dade/Homestead) indicated that shopping centers were place s for people to \"get away and shop a little sometimes\" or for entertainment purposes. The inclusion of schools in participants' drawings was the third top feature identified , and participants shared different reasons as to why this feature was included. Some participants expressed that the inclusion of a Magnet school, which provides specialized programs or curricula, would allow children to have the opportunity to suc ceed as these resources become accessible . Other participants discussed the importance to maintain safe schools in the community for teachers and students and gave examples of the recent school shootings in South Florida. As mentioned previously, three fea tures tied for the 4th ranked feature identified by participants and included: police stations or police departments, accessibility to parks, and community centers (i.e. the three features received the same number of references by participants) . According to participants, the availability and \"presence\" of a police station or a police department adds a sense of safety that, in many instances, is lacking in the neighborhood. With respect to the accessibility to parks, several adjectives 7 | P a g e 2 0 1 8 C o m m u n i t y T h e m e s a n d S t r e n g t h s A s s e s s m e n twere utilized by part icipants to describe their ideal parks such as clean, peaceful, large, numerous, and walkable. Additionally, one participant shared that his or her ideal park would be a place where kids could go, and in which different activities would be available to the m during the summer. Lastly, participants cited that community centers would be an important component of the ideal community in that it would be a place that provides diverse physical activities for kids and adults , a place \"where everybody can come together\" to discuss the issues that the community faces , and a place to access resources. Other features that did not rank among the top five but are important to mention included paved roads, affordable housing for la rge families, \"green communities\" that focus on sustainability, recycling, diverse communities, walkable trails, rehabilitation centers for seniors and veterans , and medical centers. Please refer to the Word Cloud representation below which mirrors the fe atures identified during the analysis of the icebreaker activity. Word Cloud Figure - Participants' Ideal Community (Icebreaker Activity) FOCUS GROUP QUESTIONS Question 1: How many years have you lived in this community/neighborhood? The amount of time that participants lived in their communities var ied across all clusters , based on selected categories provided during the focus group sessions (one year or less, between 2 and 10 years, 11 and 20 years, 21 years or more, \"All M y Life \"). Overall, more parti cipants lived in their communities or neighborhoods for 21 years or more than any other category provid ed, which represents close to 32.0% of total participants (all clusters) . This was followed by participants who reported that they have lived in their co mmunities between 2 and 10 years (25.0 %). Please refer to the Chart 1 . It is noteworthy that 13 out of the total number of participants ( 92) or 14.1% did not share their responses to this question. 8 | P a g e 2 0 1 8 C o m m u n i t y T h e m e s a n d S t r e n g t h s A s s e s s m e n t Chart 1 - Overall Responses (All Clusters) to Question 1: How many years have you lived in the community/neighborhood? More specifically, out of the total number of participants who shared their responses to this question, residents of Cluster 11 (North Miami Beach) accounted for the greatest pr oportion of participants who have lived in the communities for 21 years or more with 38.0 % of the total responses and constitute 68.8% of the number of residents from this cluster who participated in the f ocus group session (please refer to Table 3). This finding could signify more residential stability among participants of Cluster 11 (North Miami Beach), compared to other cluster groups that participated in the focus group sessions. When the second largest category was analyzed further (residents who have lived in their communities or neighborhoods between 2 and 10 years), it is noteworthy that all participants residing in Cluster 1 (South Dade/Homestead) have lived in their communities between 2 and 10 years and constitute the largest proportion of respon dents (21.7%) from all clusters who indicated that they have lived in the communities or neighborhoods during this time frame.

When responses from all clusters were analyzed, a sizable percentage of participants shared that their homes were large enough to accommodate their families, however, they could use additional space or \"extra room\" such as a family room, backyard, parking space, and more storage room. Although it did not surface as a theme, participants from Cluster 11 (North Miami Beach) felt that their homes were too big; however, they did not move or sell their homes because the ir children, who are now married and have children of their own, always come back to visit them. This could indicate that participants from Cluster 11 (North Miami Beach) are older than participants from other clusters, in which the confounding factor, age, may have determined how participants responded to this question (i.e. A young family would prefer a bigger home to accommodate the children ). Chart 2 details the analysis of participants' responses to Question 2. I t was observed that 52.2% of all participants (48 out of 92) believe that their homes are large enough for their families, while 25.0% did not feel this way . A substantial percentage of participants ( 20 out of 92 participants or 22.0%) did not shared th eir responses to this question or their responses were not recorded (please refer to Chart 2). Chart 2 - Size of the Home to Accommodate Participants' Families (All Clusters) As mentioned above, c lose to 22.0% of participants from all clusters did not share their responses when asked about the size of their homes to accommodate their families, and as this figure is disaggregated by cluster the greatest proportion of \"No Response\" derives from North Miami ( Cluster 11 , Part 2) and North Miami Beach (Cluster 11), with 40.0% and 35.0%, respectively. Furthermore, participants residing in Cluster 4 (Coral Gables/Kendall) who provided a response to this question accounted for the greatest proportion of respondents from all clusters who felt that their homes are not large enough for their families (17.4% ) and comprise 66.4% of the total number of Cluster 4 participants (i.e. 4 out 6 participants). Table 4 provides additional details by cluster and response rate .

When asked about whether participants believe their community or neighborhood to be racially diverse, responses varied across all clusters from as low as 20.0% of participants (e.g., 1 out of 5 in Cluster 1) who answered \"Yes\" to as high as 100.0% of participants (e.g., all participants in Cl uster 3) who also responded affirmativel y to the question (please refer to the Table 5). It is important to highlight that most of the participants from Cluster 7 (5 out of 6 participants or 83.3% ) did not believe their neighborhood to be racially diverse followed by Cluster 1 and Cluster 10 (4 out 5 participants or 80% each) as the second highest percentage of participants among all c lusters who answere d negatively to this question.

Overall, 65.2 % of participants (60 out of 92 participants) believed their neighborhood to be racially divers e, compared to 29.3% who felt that their neighborhood was not racially diverse (27 out of 92 total participants) . Approximately, 2.0% of participants did not provide any feedback to the q uestion, while 3.0% provided a response other than \"Yes\" and \"No\" . Pleas e refer to the C hart 3. 12 | P a g e 2 0 1 8 C o m m u n i t y T h e m e s a n d S t r e n g t h s A s s e s s m e n tChart 3 - Racial Diversity in Participants' Neighborhoods (All Clusters) As the discussion of racial diversity expanded, some participants shared that in order to answer whether racial diversity exists in their respective neighborhoods , diversity would need to be defined , as people's perspective of diversity is subjective . Participants posed the question: how many ethnic groups would need to be present in a neighborhood to be considered a racially diverse community? One par ticipant stated that diversity is like beauty, \"it is in the eye of the beholder.\" It is noteworthy that there were different points of view across and within clusters regarding the acceptance of residents of a different race and ethnic background. For ins tance, some participants of Aventura/Miami Beach (Cluster 12) and Coral Gables/Kendall (Cluster 4) indicated that residents are reluctant to have a \"harmonious relationship\" with neighbors of a different race and ethnicity as well as with those of the same background. In this instance, the word \"hate\" was employed to describe some of the tension experienced in these neighborhoods regardless of ethnic or racial identity . Furthermore, participants of North Miami Beach (Cluster 11), expressed that acceptance o f people of different racial and ethnic background s was not the issue, but the unwillingness of foreign residents to learn the English language , which could \"alleviate\" communication problems on basic issues such as those associated with health (e.g., comm unication with physician or nurse). By contrast, participants from Doral/Miami Springs/Sunset (Cluster 7) and Aventura/Miami Beach (Cluster 12), shared that they not only embrace people of other cultures but also appreciate a racially diverse society , which teaches children to play with one another regardless of racial or ethnic identification. One participant stated that racial and ethnic diversity brings new ideas to the community and creates \"bondage\" in society.

Most of the participants expressed their high level of satisfaction with their neighborhoods and provided insightful information regarding the features they feel make their neighborhoods or communities great places to live. However, it is also important to note that other participants shared their discontent with their neighborhoods and the discussion at times deviated from the question originally posed . This, concurrently, creates an opportunity to revisit their concerns on future assessments of the commun ity. Table 6 summarizes participants' responses which have been organized into theme categories. Table 6 - Features , Concepts, Programs and Neighborhood Descriptions Identified by Participants Theme Categories Features Accessibility & Proximity to the Built Environment & Nature Available transportation (e.g., mini bus) Bus stop Church Fire Department Flea markets Grocery stores Gym Hospitals Major highways Metro stations Nature Parks Police Departments Restaurants Wide sidewalks Shopping centers Water 14 | P a g e 2 0 1 8 C o m m u n i t y T h e m e s a n d S t r e n g t h s A s s e s s m e n tTable 6 (Continued) Theme Cat egories Essential Concepts A sense of Community \"Church community\" \"Contained\" or close community Activities for Children Available Programs Community centers Library activities Special programs Neighborhood Description of Communities Clean Friendly Peaceful Quiet Safe When all features or \"things\" that participants value in their neighborhoods were analyzed, the top theme that emerged across all clusters was accessibility and proximity to the features present in the built environment or in nature (please refer to Table 6). In other words, whether participants mentioned grocery stores, bus stations, and/or parks as their top features, they placed value on the proximity and accessibility of these features to their homes. This was the consensus for participants from all clu sters. According to participants residing in North Miami (Cluster 11 Part 2 ), North Miami Beach (Cluster 11), and Hialeah/Miami Lakes (Cluster 9) being close to the bus stop as well as to a hospital were essential components that made their neighborhoods g reat places to live. For instance, one participant from Cluster 11 Part 2 (North Miami) shared the following: \"I live in Skylight on Miami Gardens Drive and for me I can walk out the door and take four or five different buses, shopping is right across the street\". The subsequent three categories included on Table 6 illustrate concepts (e.g., \"church community\"), available programs (e.g., summer school activities for children), and a description of participants' neighborhoods (e.g., quiet) for which partici pants place value on. Several participants shared that being part of a community generates a sense of peacefulness, harmony, and trust among community neighbors, in which everyone looks after one another. One participant described the community as a \"churc h community\", while others described it as a \"contained or closed community\" characterized by friendly neighbors and a quiet and safe neighborhood (please refer to Table 7 for notable mentions by participants). These are qualities that participants value i n their communities. Additionally, participants placed value on school and reading programs tailored for children, which are accessible in the library and community centers, especially when summer programs are no longer available (please refer to Table 7 for participants notable mentions). Participants from Cluster 3 (Westchester/West Dade) and Cluster 4 (Coral Gables/Kendall) felt strongly that the presence of these programs were important features in their neighborhoods. Lastly, participants utilized t he several adjectives to describe their neighborhoods such as friendly, peaceful, quiet and safe. One participant from Cluster 11 Part 2 (North Miami) explained that being surrounded by friendly neighbors make him or her feel safe when walking at night. 15 | P a g e 2 0 1 8 C o m m u n i t y T h e m e s a n d S t r e n g t h s A s s e s s m e n tTable 7 - Participants' Notable Mentions According to the Theme Categories Identified Theme categories Quotes from Participants Participant's Cluster (Community) Accessibility & Proximity to the Built Environment & Nature Fire Department \"Everything is accessible, we have the church, to a restaurant, a fast food and police station, fire station\".

Based on information shared by participants, accessibility of healthy food options in all clusters vary to a certain degree ; however , all clusters shared common themes or topics that emerged during the focus group sessions. The definition of \"healthy\" was regarded as subjective by several respondents, and it was reinforced by participants' individual responses to this question. One respondent, for instance, stated that \"what's healthy for one person is not healthy for somebody else\". In addition, i n several instances throughout the analysis, the phrase \"healthy food options\" and the word \"variety\" were employed interchangeably , which implied that participants felt that access to different types of ethnic food options would equa te to access to healthy food options. Approximately 37.0% of participants stated that they have access to healthy food options in their communities/neighborhoods compared to 33.3% who do not access to healthy food options (please refer to Chart 4) . As it has been observed throughout the analysis of the focus group question s, a great percentage of participants (24.1% or 21 parti cipants ) did not shared their responses to this question. This substantial statistic could be attributed to a recording error of the focus group session as noted earlier in this report caused by participants speaking in a low tone or by participants speaking over one another. Additionally, nearly 6.0% of respondents provided additional context to this close -ended question . 17 | P a g e 2 0 1 8 C o m m u n i t y T h e m e s a n d S t r e n g t h s A s s e s s m e n tChart 4 - Accessibility of Healthy Food Options (All Clusters) Overall Responses (All Clusters) Participants from Cluster 11 (North Miami Beach) , accounted for the greatest proportion of respondents who do not have access to healthy food options (34.5%) and constitute 62.5% (10 out of 16 ) of the total number of participants from this cluster (please refer to the Table 8 ). By contrast, participants from North Miami (Cluster 11, Part 2) accounted for the greatest proportion of respondents (7 out of 32) who indicated that their neighborhood has healthy food options (21.9 %) and represent half of the participants from this cluster (7 out of 14).

Two of the themes that emerged are linked to the residents' socioeconomic status: affordability and transpo rtation. The high cost of healthy food options was perceived as an obstacle for participants to receive a healthy nutrition as well as lack of transportation to get to the establishments that provide healthy foods (e.g., Publix, Whole Foods) that in most c ases, were distant from participants' neighborhoods. The availability of corner stores , fast food restaurants, and \"dollar menus\", which do not generally offer healthy food options, was a concern voiced by participants that impede participants ability to maintain a healthy diet. Several participants provided suggestions that would allow residents in their neighborhoods access to healthy food options, such as community gardens and farmers markets. The following figure or Word Cloud illustrates the most com monly used words by participants when asked about availability and accessibility of healthy food options. These words correlate with themes identified above. Word Cloud Figure - Availability of Healthy Food Options in Participants' Neighborhoods (Question 5) Question 6: Do you feel safe walking in your neighborhood no matter what time it is (streets well dept, lighting, mobility, grass cut, no litter, no needles, etc.)? Across all clusters , participants were very vocal during the focus group sessions regarding the safety of their neighborhoods and provided valuable context to this close -ended question. Please note that the inclusion of a frequency table of participants' responses to this question (i.e. \"Yes\" or \"N o\" answer), would not be an ac curate representation of their views regarding th e safety of their neighborhoods as their answers could not be placed in a \"yes\" or \"no\" binary category. A s such, a frequency table, in this instance, has not been included. 19 | P a g e 2 0 1 8 C o m m u n i t y T h e m e s a n d S t r e n g t h s A s s e s s m e n tOverall, m ost of the participants from each cluster felt that they were safe walking in their neighborhoods regardless of the time ; however, a number of participants also felt that they were not sa fe. It is important to highlight that a small number of participants felt that they were safe in the daytime but not at night and refrained from walking during this time. There were several themes that emerged as question 6 was posed to participants from all clusters during the focus g roup sessions , mainly among participants who did not feel safe walking in their neighborhoods regardless of the time of the day , but especial ly at night. Participants from C luster 2 (Kendall) , Cluster 4 (Coral Gables/Kendall) , and Cluster 10 (Opa -Locka/Mia mi Gardens/Westview) voiced their concern about drug and alcohol abuse as well as the presence of drug dealers in their neighborhoods , which, according to participants, occurs at night. As a result, participants feel hesitant to walk at night. In addition, participants maintained opposing views regarding the presence of the police that would help them develop a sense of safety in their neighbo rhoods . Participants from Cluster 11 (North Miami Beach) and one participant from Cluster 12 (Aventura/Miami Beach) presented the following poin ts of views to account for the lack of police pa trolling in their neighborhoods: firstly, budget cuts observed in recent years in which several police officers lost their jobs; and secondly, police officers seen as \"greedy\" whic h has resulted in a low retention rate . One participant stated, \"they want to get paid like doctors\". By contrast, participants in C luster 8 (Miami Shores/Morningshore) , Cluster 9 (Hialeah) , and Cluster 12 (Aventura/Miami Beach) felt content with the police presence in their neighborhoods, as one participant shared: \"...there was al ways a constant police and public safety presence... They are on the streets any time of day doesn't matter \". Participants also felt that the built environment, such as the absence of sidewalks and adequate lighting on the streets , as well as drivers who do not respect the rules of traffic (e.g., not yielding to pedestrians), are factors that hinders residents f rom walking in their neighborhoods especially at night. It is im portant to mention that one participant , who identifies as an advocate to increase police patrolling in residents' neighborhoods, provided the following recommendations: promote the recruiting and retention of police officers by providing bonuses as well a s \"putting money back to the police department\". To conclude, a small number of participants from Cluster 3 (Westchester/Kendall) associated poor sanitation to a safety issue and described their neighborhood as full of debris caused by Hurricane Irma; in which debris has not been cleaned by the city for months. Participants added that this could result in an epidemic and they cited asthma as one of the chronic conditions that residents could develop by being exposed to poor sanitary conditions. The following Word Cloud below summarizes the most commonly used words by participants and complements the themes that were identified in this section of the analysis. 20 | P a g e 2 0 1 8 C o m m u n i t y T h e m e s a n d S t r e n g t h s A s s e s s m e n tWord Cloud Figure - Safety in Participants' Neighborhoods (Question 6) Question 7: Do you utilize services provided by Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), the Department of Health, and/or private clinics found in your neighborhood? Throughout this report, participants' views on the issues discussed duri ng the focus group sessions varied among all clusters , but there were common themes that emerged during these discussions. When asked about whether participants utilize services provided by Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), the Department of Heal th (DOH) , and/or private clinics in their neighborhoods, responses ranged from simply \"Yes\" or \" No\" to context that added value to the discussion of the issues, obstacles, and strengths perceived by participants pertinent to their neighborhoods. Due to the great variation of participants' responses observed in all clusters , a frequency table has not been included as the aggregation of all responses could not be placed in a binary category. However, among participants in which a binary category could be dete rmined (62 out of 92 participants ), the majority do not utilize health services provided by FQHCs, DOH, and/or private clinics located in their neighborhoods. Among the themes that emerged, the discontent or dissatisfaction with their local free health cl inics was voiced by participants . Participants cited personal experiences, which included a long wait to b e seen by a nurse or physician , not being given a guarantee that they would be seen or treated on the day they visited the clinic , limited access to f ree servic es, and the impersonal communication and treatment by the staff. As such, utilization of local health clinics, whether categorize as FQHCs or as a part of the DOH, is low or infrequent among residents who participated in the focus group sessions . In several instances during the discussion of this topic, participants shared that they would prefer to pay for services they would otherwise receive for free than to utilize their local free clinics. Most of the participants utilize the following health systems or programs accessible in Miami -Dade County: Jackson Memorial Hospital, Mercy Hospital clinics, urgent care clinics, private clinics, and/or primary care physician clinics. One of the obstacles that was shared by a young parent from Cluster 2 (Kendall) was that even though his or her children receive federal assistance coverage, he or she does not qualify and cannot afford to pay the sliding scale fee to be treated for services in her local clinic. Other participants share d the same 21 | P a g e 2 0 1 8 C o m m u n i t y T h e m e s a n d S t r e n g t h s A s s e s s m e n t concern in that they do not qualify for federal assistance and cannot afford to pay for medication or treatment of their chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes) otherwise covered by a health insurance plan; thus, health services are being sought at their local hospital. Cluster 11 (North Miami and North Miami Beach) provided additional context that , while it does not answer the question directly about utilization of their local clinics , it adds value to the topic of services provided by specific hea lth programs. Based on responses provided, participants from Cluster 11 were retired senior citizens who feel that their Medicare coverage provides the services they need, as well as it \"takes cares of the bills\" that accrue once services are rendered. Mor e specifically , participants residing in North Miami Beach feel that available transportation to their health clinics is an essential component that would assist in meeting their health needs , and it is , mo re often than not, met by their health plans. As observed in the Word Cloud representation below, the word \"people\" was the most commonly used word during the discussion of utilization of local health clinics, and it correlates with the first theme identified as it discusses the interaction of residents or \"people\" with their local health centers. Word Cloud Figure - Health Service Utilization (Question 7) Question 8: What improvements can be made in your community (safety, aesthetics, etc.)? This open -ended question allowed participants to express their thoughts on how their community could be improved, and most participants shared their concerns, ideas, and/ or experiences which were discussed in the focus group sessions . The information provided by participants pertai ning to this question summarize s what was discussed previously throughout the focus group sessions and complements the overall report. Due to the large amount of information shared by participants, themes have been aggregated into the following categories: Built Environment, Education, Transportation, Community Involvement, Police Responsiveness and Involvement, and Emergency P reparedness. 22 | P a g e 2 0 1 8 C o m m u n i t y T h e m e s a n d S t r e n g t h s A s s e s s m e n tBuilt Environment Participants shared that Miami -Dade County residents need to develop or \"build\" their own economy, and not to rely solely on tour ism. By generating or \"building\" the County's economy, participants feel that the built environment could be improved. This could be accomplished by researchin g the best econom ic models and by searching for investors. Participants shared that once sufficie nt revenue has been generated, one way to improve the built environment would to expand the Metrorail and Metromover and to build more highways \"above ground\", which would, consequently, alleviate traffic congestion. Another theme that emerged under the ca tegory of Built Environment was the issue s that residents are experiencing with flooding during a rainstorm , and this concern was voiced by participants residing in Doral/Miami Springs/Sunset (Cluster 7) , in particular . One participant from this cluster stated that homes in this neighborhood have been built \" a little bit lower than in other places \" and, as a result , the streets flood constantly when heavy rains start. Several themes surfaced regarding homes in Miami -Dade County, however most were categori zed under the P olice Responsiveness and Involvement category since it involved safety/security of neighborhoods. These will be discussed subsequently. In relation to the Built Environment category, however, participants felt that larger and affordable home s were necessary to accommodate large families that cannot afford larger homes , and, by contrast, other participants shared that smaller homes and larger backyards are important component s that their neighborhoods are lacking. Other themes that emerged under the Built E nvironment that would improve the safety of residents included: the need to clearly mark pedestrian crossing lanes -especially near elementary schools , and the repair of old buildings that could potentially contaminate tenants with asbestos and/or fungal spores. More specifically, participants of Cluster 2 (Kendall) , some who also reside in Homestead, felt that the absence of paved roads in certain areas are an important component that hinders the safety of residents. Education Participants across all clusters were concerned with the educational system in Miami -Dade County, not just the public -school district serving grades K-12, but also the educational level of adult residents . More specifically, p articipants of C luster 2 (Kendall) and Cluster 10 (Opa -Locka/Miami Gardens/Westview) stated that there is a substantial disparity between private and public school education that serve school - aged children in Miami -Dade County , and they feel that as children grow into young a dults they don't realize that they have received a low education because, as one participant stated, \"this is all they know\". One participant of Cluster 10 (Opa-Locka/Miami Gardens/Westview) cited Carol City as providing a lower education level than other cities, such as Aventura. In this participant's experience, residents are willing to invest in private education for their children rather than to enroll them in any of the public schools located in Carol City. Within the Education category, participants offered suggestions as to how the educational system, for children and adults, could be improved. For instance, participants of Cluster 3 (Westchester/West Dade) agreed that implementing specialized educational programs or vocationa l programs in public schools that are tailored for students' interests will improve the educational level of residents. Other participants felt that it is important to shift from the mentality of a four -year college education to a technical school educatio n which could , subsequently , relieve the pressure that parents place on their children to pursue a col lege career. As one participant expressed, \"... not everybod y has to be a doctor or a lawyer \". Finally, participants also expressed that offering practical c ourses for adult residents in Miami -Dade County would be beneficial for the community as a whole. Examples provided by participants included 23 | P a g e 2 0 1 8 C o m m u n i t y T h e m e s a n d S t r e n g t h s A s s e s s m e n tdriving classes, first aid courses, and educating residents on the laws or rules. One participant stressed the impo rtance of informing or educating the community about infectious diseases , especially in areas with a high rate of drug abuse where needles are commonly found on the ground . As this participant stated: \"if you see a needl e on the floor, don't grab it\". Transportation As mentioned previously, few of the themes that were placed in one category overlap with another category , and this has been the case when respondents expressed their discontent with the public transportation system in Miami -Dade County. For instance, one theme that emerge d during the discussion of the Built E nvironment was the expansion of the Metrorail and M etromover that could be possible as the economy in the County improves , and, concurrently , would improve the public transportation system for residents that rely on this system as their means of transportation. Most of the participants from all clusters e xpressed that the public transportation syst em could be improved, as one participant residing in Coral Gables/Coconut Grove/Key Biscayne (Cluster 6 ) shared: \"...transportation con ditions here is a complete mess \". Additionally, participants also shared that t raffic congestion in Miami -Dade County is the result of a poor transportation system and the constant construction projects being developed on the highways . Other participants stated that as certain cities in Miami -Dade County have \"become more popular\", s uch as Homestead, residents need to travel long distances and , coupled with a poor transportation system, commute time increases substantially. Specific examples were also cited by participants demonstrating their discontent with the public transportation system, such as the way the bus system is managed which causes the user to wait for a long time at the bus station. Participants feel that they shouldn't have to file a formal complaint for buses to \"run on time\", as residents pay for the trainings provid ed to the drivers. Community Involvement During this discussion, participants residing in Cluster 3 (Westchester), Cluster 8 (Miami Shores/Morningshore), Cluster 12 (Aventura/Miami Beach) , and Cluster 13 (Downtown/E. Little Havana/Liberty City/Little Hait i/Overtown), expressed the importance of being involved with issues that affect the community; which could start by simply getting acquainted with their neighbors. Participants indicated that, as a community, residents could advocate to address those same issues at community meetings so that their voice could be heard which will in turn start the process of reform . Other participants suggested calling the Commissioner's office to inquire when community meetings are held or to call 311, a non -emergency call system. One participant stated that one of the benefits of attending community meetings is that the local poli ce are also present, as such local issues or barriers could be discussed. As observed during this discussion , participants felt that by being involved a sense of empowerment would develop that would allow residents to \"have a voice\" on the issues they exp erience in their communities and, consequently, allow them to make choices for the betterment of their own communities. Police Responsiveness and Involvement This category expands on the discussion of safety posed in Question 6, in that participants expre ssed the need to have more \"police presence\" in their neighborhoods. Some participants suggested the presence of more police stations or \"sub -police stations\" that would help address issues encountered as well as increase responsiveness to incidents that o ccur in the community. Overall, participants from Cluster 1 (South Dade/Homestead), Cluster 2 (Kendall), and Cluster 5 (Brownsville/Coral Gables/Coconut Grove ) 24 | P a g e 2 0 1 8 C o m m u n i t y T h e m e s a n d S t r e n g t h s A s s e s s m e n tshared that increasing police patrolling in their neighborhoods would provide a sense of safety or security to residents. More specifically, one participant from Cluster 5 stated that it is important to increase the enforcement of \"zero tolerance\" for areas considered \"drug zones\". Emergency Preparedness It is important to highlight that even thoug h Emergency Preparedness has been placed as an additional category, it is actually a theme specific to Cluster 11 , which comprised of residents from North Miami and North Miami Beach. Based on the anecdotes shared by participants of North Miami Beach, thi s population comprises retired senior citizens , some with limited mobility, which voiced their concern based on their previous experience with Hurricane Irma that affected residents in South Florida. Participants emphasized the importance of being prepared for such storms, which are common in South Florida, before and after it affects the community especially among the elderly population and the handicapped. Other participants suggested access to a governmental hotline, whether at the city - or state - level, in which residents could communicate their needs after a natural event, such as a hurricane, affects the community. Additionally, participants stated the need to get more churches or centers involved so that they could be utilized a s shelters for those mo st in need. Please refer to the Word Cloud figure below which highlights the most commonly utilized words during this discussion. Word Cloud Figure - Question 8: What improvements can be made in your community (safety, aesthetics, etc.)? (Question 8) 25 | P a g e 2 0 1 8 C o m m u n i t y T h e m e s a n d S t r e n g t h s A s s e s s m e n tCONCLUSION Many of the clusters identified cross boundaries based on socioeconomic status or population size , and this fact was also reflected in the way participants defined or perceive their \"community\". For instance, one participant indicated that \"north of Flagler\" is not part of his or her community even though this reference point may lie within the identif ied cluster boundaries from which he or she came from. This definition has important implications on how participants responded to the questions posed during the focus group sessions. For instance, when participants were asked about topics associated with accessibility to healthy food options, safety, health services provided by FDOH -MD, and racial diversity, their responses depended on how they defined their community and not on the physical boundaries encompassed by their respective clusters. One particip ant shared that his or her community is defined by where one person is willing to drive to. Most of the questions shared with participants were close -ended questions, however, with a few exceptions, participants provided valuable content in addition to a \"Yes\" and \"No\" response that described their experiences associated the topics discussed. It is noteworthy to highlight that participants' responses to a specific question overlapped with other questions. For instance, when participants were asked if thei r community or neighborhood has healthy food options they also shared how accessibility of healthy food options could be improved or increased in their community (e.g., community garden) , which also coincided with their responses to Question 8, that inquir ed about improvements that could be made in their community overall. Additionally, the icebreaker activity which asked participants to draw their ideal community summarizes their responses to the eight questions posed. For instance, if schools, hospitals, or churches were features of the built environment that participants value in their neighborhoods they were illustrated in their drawings. It is also important to note that participants shared information that, although it was not related to the question s posed, could add value for future assessments of Miami -Dade County. Some of this information was briefly discussed in the focus group sessions but could be expanded on different efforts. For instance, when asked about \"some things\" participants like ab out their neighborhood they also indicated things they did not like. These included: traffic congestion, inadequate transportation system, failure of the government to address community needs, health threats (e.g., Zika virus), lack of activities for child ren, lack of information that delineates resources (e.g., rehabilitation centers for senior citizens, free services), increase violence, and crime. Finally, one theme that surfaced in Questions 4 through 7 was accessibility and proximity to the different components discussed in the focus group sessions . In other words, accessibility and proximity were essential components to participants when asked about availability of healthy food options (e.g., Whole Foods Supermarket), safety (police stations nearby), and health service utilization (e.g., free clinics).

We know that many factors influence the health of our residents such as the ability of one to enjoy a balanced diet, physical activity, a ccess to preventative care, clean water , and air. In addition to these factors other influences impact the health of the County including many socioeconomic considerations -schools, economy, and income. In an effort to help the community become healthier and to achieve the mission of becoming the \"hea lthiest state in the nation\", collaborative approaches are taken to reach that goal. The Florida community is working together to address the complex needs of this diverse community from all avenues including social, economic and en vironmental. The many pa rtners contributed to the vision, and as a result a strong and comprehensive Community Health Improvement Plan has been devel oped to better address the needs of the community. This is the annual review report for the 2013 -2018 Miami -Dade County CHIP. The Florida Department of Health in Miami -Dade County opted to extend the 2013 -2018 CHIP as the agency was in the process of working with the community to undertake a new Mobilizing for Planning and Partnership (MAPP) cycle. This annual report will serve as a closeout of the 2013 -2018 CHIP as the agency works to bring to the community the 2019 -2024 CHIP. The Florida Department of Health in Miami -Dade County has provided administrative support, data collection and tracking as well as worked to prepare the annua l report. This annual report will review the 2013 -2018 strategic priority areas as well as share the status of the CHIP indicators. This report will also introduce the new strategic priority areas and goals for the 2019 -2024 Community Health Improvement P lan. It should be noted that while this will serve as the final report for the 2013 -2018 CHIP, some of the indicators that are tracked will continue to be addressed in the new 2019 -2024 CHIP. Overview of CHIP and Annual Review Meeting The Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) is a five -year plan to improve community health and quality of life in Miami -Dade County. It is a long-term systematic effort to address the public health concerns of the community. The CHIP is based on the results of the health assessment activities and part of the community health improvement process. The CHIP shows alignment with all level of assessments inclu ding Healthy People 2020 and the State Health Improvement Plan. In the 2013 -2018 CHIP, there were five strategic priority areas: Health Protection, Access to Care, Chronic Disease Prevention , Community Redevelopment and Partnerships , and Health Finance and Infrastructure. All CHIP goals, objectives, strategies, and performance indicators can be accessed at www.HealthyMiamiDade.org/resources/community -health -improvement -plan/ . As a result of the most current community meeting held on July 18, 2019, new strategic priority areas were identified and used to create the 2019 -2024 Community Health Improvement Plan which can be accessed here. Strategic Priority areas for the 2019 -2024 CHIP include : 1. Health Equity, 2. Access to Care, 3. Chronic Disease, 4. Maternal Child Health, 5. Injury, Safety, and Violence, and 6. Communicable Diseases and Em ergent Threats. 4 On Thursday, July 18th, 2019, the Florida Department of Health in Miami -Dade County hosted the Community Health Assessment and Improvement Plan Community Meeting. The meeting's purpose was to deliver high -level information on the MAPP proc ess and the results from the community assessments conducted. Attendee s from different organizations and backgrounds were able to discuss the strategic health priorities that affect Miami - Dade residents and their health. A diverse group of partners were r epresented at the Community Health Assessment and Improvement Plan Community Meeting. On Thursday, July 18th, 2019, there was a total of seventy -seven (77) signatures representing thirty -one (31) organizations. Approximately 12% of those who registered did not attend the event. During this event, participants played an essential role in improving the health and quality of life for Miami -Dade. The full day event had two main focuses. The morning sessions were used to share the r esults from community assess ments with the attendees and they were asked to prioritize the health indicators that emerged from all four community assessments. Results from the Forces of Change, Community Health Assessment and the Local Public Health System Assessments were shared. Ten themes emerged from the assessments that were conducted. 1) Health Equity 2) Maternal/Child Health 3) Chronic Disease 4) Healthy Weight/Physical Activity/Nutrition 5) Community Concerns 6) STD/Communica ble Diseases/Emerging Threats 7) Behavioral Health 8 ) Injury/Safety/Violence 9) Immunizations 10) Access to Care. Attendees were asked to rank these themes, or strategic health priorities from one to ten, one being the highest priority and 10 being the lowest. In the afternoon, t hose who attended the event participated in dynamic, high -level breakout sessions where they were able to discuss these health indicators in detail, offering insight as to how to address issues specifically in Miami -Dade and. The ranking of these priority areas and discussing how to address them in Miami -Dade County will aid the Department of Health in Miami -Dade County with creating their 2019 -2024 Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). A Strategic Priority Area Reporting Tool was utilized by breakout group facilitators and scrib es who were assigned to each of the ten breakout sessions for each strategic priority area. The tool was used to organize and track the participants' resp onses. During the breakout sessions, community members addressed the strategic priority areas by answe ring guided questions and providing feedback with objectives, potential strategies/barriers, target population, responsible parties, key partners to work with, and what indicators should be created to evaluate the goals of the strategic priority area. 5 2019-2024 CHIP Strategic Priorities and Goals Strategic Priorities Goals Health Equity Improve service linkage to encourage equity.

CR2.1.6: By December 31, 2018 a strategy will be written in partnership with the alliance for aging that will support older adults being able to age in place with the best quality of life. Completion of the Elder Issues work plan in alignment with meeting the needs of older adults. Educating the community on the importance of an Aging in Place Initiative; mobilizing community organizations to work together to take action; and improving livability for all ages. Why This Accomplishment is Important for Our Community According to the U.S. Census Bureau's estimates that were released in 2014, the nation as a whole is getting older as the youngest of the Baby Boomers generation (born between 1946 - 1964) entered their 50s and the olde st baby boomers became seniors . It is important that this group has improved quality of life and access to be healthy and active . The Elder Issues Committee works with the Alliance for Aging, Miami -Dade County Age Friendly Initiative, AARP and other partners to support older adults and health y aging. Representatives from various organizations regularly attend committee meetings and provide partner updates and/or presentations on their current services, programs and plans. In turn, members of the committee attend community events, workshops and meetings organized by these community partners. The Consortium for a Healthier Miami -Dade Elder Issues committee serves as a conduit to allow for collaborative efforts, strategies, and ideas to be shared among all partners who wish to advance healthy ag ing in Miami -Dade County. The committee meets with representatives of the above groups at monthly Elder Issues Committee meeting and support measures that enable elders to age in place and be healthy, active and productive. The committee supports partners in creating opportunities for older adults to be more active in Miami -Dade County. meets with community representatives at least monthly and supports measures that enable elders to age in place and be healthy, active and productive. 53 Goal Objective Accomplishment Reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. By December 31, 2018, increase the percentage of women who are exclusively breastfeeding their infant at 6 months of age from 9.3% (2007) to 12%. FLDOH is on track to meet thi s objective in the future. This indicator progressively shows an increase in the percentage of women who are exclusively breastfeeding their infant at 6 months of age. For the last quarter in 2019 data indicates that 10% was the percentage for this objecti ve. Why This Accomplishment is Important for Our Community The DOH -Miami -Dade WIC (Women, Infant, and Children) Program has actively been working to increase the percentage of women who are exclusively breastfeeding their infants at 6 months of age while also examing the breastfeeding rates for non -Hispanic Black women in Miami -Dade County . The gap in breastfeeding rates among non -Hispanic Black infants and other racial/ethnic groups is substantial. In July 2017, non -Hispanic Black women had the low est initiation rates in the county (75.3 % vs 85.7% for Hispanics and 82.2% Whites). The burning question for was why do these disparities persist? An interdisciplinary team of WIC professionals, the Miami -Dade County Health Department, and community partn ers convened to address these disparities. A series of surveys were conducted i n the community -at-large and with WIC mothers to address breastfeeding attitudes and beliefs in 2019. The survey confirmed significant differences in breastfeeding attitudes and beliefs depending on where residents lived. Non -Hispanic Black mothers had significantly lower attitude scores than White or Hispanic mothers in the same neighborhood. Pr egnant women who saw a WIC Peer Counselor (PC) were 20% more likely to intend to breastfeed. Interaction with a WIC PC or lactation consultant was also associated with more positive breastfeeding attitudes and practices. Encouragement and support from wome n with breastfeeding experience as well as family support were cited as the most important contributing factors to make breastfeedin g successful in this community. In addition, DOH -Miami -Dade WIC (Women, Infant, and Children) Program is a very active partner of the Healthy Baby Takskforce and works with many other sectors in DOH and partners in the community to increase breastfeeding education and support in Miami -Dade County. Next steps will be to use the d ata from these assessments to develop community -specific action plans with important collaborators and community stakeholders who can impact breastfeeding rates in non-Hispanic Black communities in Miami -Dade. 54 Goal Objective Accomplishment Prevent and Control infectious disease By December 31, 2018, reduce reported new HIV infections per 100,000 in Miami -Dade from 53.9 (2014) to 45 with particular focus on the elimination of racial and ethnic disparities and new HIV infections. FLDOH is on track to meet this objective in the fut ure. Through the work of the HIV team and the getting to zero task force, outreach and education has incre ased. It is worth noting that 0 babies were infected with HIV in Miami -Dade C ounty in 2019. Why This Accomplishment is Important for Our Community The DOH -Miami -Dade HIV/AIDS section developed a Four Key Component Plan to eliminate HIV transmission and reduce HIV related deaths. Locally, the Miami -Dade County \"Getting to Zero\" HIV/AIDS initiative established a set of recommendations focusing on pre vention, treatment, and systems change. The process enhanced services, built partnerships, and established collaborations. DOH Miami -Dade also piloted the Test and Treat VIP program in 2016 with the goal of helping newly diagnosed and out of care clients gain rapid access to treatment . In 2019 the DOH -Miami -Dade STD/HIV program was working on local efforts around a new initiative called Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America. Miami -Dade County was one of seven jurisdictions that received funding to conduct a rapid community engagement response in order to create a jurisdictional Ending the HIV Epidemic : A Plan for Miami -Dade County . The program in 2019 was working on collecting community feedbac k through a survey to create this plan. Currently, the Florida Department of Health in Miami -Dade county is finalizing the Ending the HIV Epidemic Plan. The input from the community is key and needed to create a successful plan that is inclusive of the nee ds of everyo ne living in Miami -Dade County. The various initiatives have been working together to increase collaborations with community partners. These collaborations are a way for partners to educate the community on the resources available to them. Thi s effective system change in place is to better leverage the use of community resources that are needed by those who live in Miami -Dade . 55 Conclusion The CHIP serves as a roadmap for a continuous health improvement process for the local public health system by providing a framework for the chosen strategic issue areas. It is not intended to be an exhaustive and static document. We will evaluate progress on an ongoing basis through quarterly CHIP implementation reports and quarterly discussion by community partners. We will conduct annual reviews and revisions based on input from partners and create CHIP annual reports by February of each year. The CHIP will continue to change and evolve over time as new information and insight emerge at the local , state and national levels. By working together, we can have a significant impact on the community's health by improving where we live, work and play. These efforts will allow us to realize the vision of a healthier Miami - Dade County.

COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS MODEL How much stronger could our communities be if all of our children attended high quality schools, if everyone earned enough money to afford essentials, and if we all felt connected to our communities, regardless of where we live, the circumstances we are born into, or the color of our skin? When we work together to improve education, employment, income, and family and social supports\u2014the social and economic factors that influence our communities\u2014we can improve the health of all who live, learn, work, and play there. Creating healthier communities where everyone can thrive and have a voice in the process for creating solutions requires bringing people together to: llLook at the many factors that influence health, llSelect strategies that can improve everyone's health, and llMake changes that will have a lasting positive impact. There is no single strategy that can ensure everyone in a community can be healthier. The County Health Rankings model helps us understand the many factors that influence health, and should be considered in an approach to improving health in a community. Social and economic factors like education and income are not commonly considered when it comes to health, yet strategies to improve these factors can have an even greater impact on health over time than those traditionally associated with health improvement, such as strategies to change behaviors. This report outlines key steps toward building healthier and more equitable communities and features specific policies and programs that can improve social and economic opportunities and health for all. Policies and programs that are likely to reduce unfair differences in health outcomes are emphasiz ed. Creating Healthy and Equitable Communities 3 What Works? Social and Economic Opportunities to Improve Health for AllHealth is about more than what happens at the doctor's office\u2014it is influenced by a range of factors. The places where we live, learn, work, and play, the opportunities we have, and the choices we make all matter to our physical, mental, and social well-being. Social and economic opportunities, such as good schools, stable jobs, and strong social networks are foundational to achieving long and healthy lives. These opportunities affect our ability to make healthy choices, afford medical care and housing, and manage stress. Not everyone has the means and opportunity to be their healthiest. Across the nation, there are meaningful differences in social and economic opportunities for residents in communities that have been cut off from investments or have experienced discrimination. These gaps in opportunities disproportionately affect people of color\u2014especially children and youth. Policies and practices put in place have marginalized population groups and communities, such as people of color, keeping them from the resources and supports necessary to thrive. Limited access to opportunities creates disparities in health, impacting how well and how long we live. These differences in opportunity can be narrowed, if not eliminated, if we take ongoing, meaningful steps to create more equitable communities. Here's a closer look at how each of the social and economic factors influence health. Individuals with more education live longer, healthier lives than those with less education, and their children are more likely to thrive. This is true even when factors like income are taken into account. People with greater social support, less isolation, and greater interpersonal trust live longer and healthier lives than those who are socially isolated. Neighborhoods richer in social connections provide residents with greater access to support and resources than those that are less tightly knit.As income increases or decreases, so does health. Employment provides income that shapes choices about housing, education, child care, food, medical care, and more. Employment also often includes benefits that can support healthy lifestyle choices, such as health insurance. Unemployment and under employment limit these choices and the ability to accumulate savings and assets that can help cushion in times of economic distress.How Can Jobs, Education, and Social Supports Improve Health and Equity? EDUCATION EMPLOYMENT & INCOME FAMILY & SOCIAL SUPPORT 4 What Works? Finding Strategies that Work This report can help you get started on the path to creating healthier, more equitable communities by selecting strategies to improve social and economic factors and remove barriers to opportunity. A good first step is to explore strategies that have worked in other communities or are recommended by experts. With evidence ratings, literature summaries, and implementation resources for more than 400 strategies, What Works for Health (WWFH) is a great place to start. WWFH offers in-depth information for a variety of policies and programs that can improve the many factors that influence health, including social and economic opportunities, health behaviors, clinical care, and the physical environment. For each policy and program, you will find: llBeneficial outcomes (i.e., the benefits the strategy has been shown to achieve as well as other outcomes it may affect) llKey points from relevant literature (e.g., populations affected, key components of successful implementation, cost-related information) llImplementation examples and resources, toolkits, and other information to help you get started llAn indication of the strategy's likely impact on the gaps or disparities in outcomes among groups of people (e.g., differences among racial, ethnic, or socio-economic groups) This report outlines some of the policies and programs you will find in WWFH to support local initiatives to: llImprove educational outcomes llIncrease income and employment llBuild family and social support These examples emphasize policies and programs that are likely to reduce disparities in health outcomes, and those with strong evidence of effectiveness. To see the full list of strategies in WWFH, go to countyhealthrankings.org/whatworks.EVIDENCE RATING WWFH includes six evidence of effectiveness ratings. Each strategy is rated based on the quantity, quality, and findings of relevant research. Ratings include: llScientifically Supported (SS): Strategies with this rating ar e most likely to make a difference. These strategies have been tested in multiple robust studies with consistently positive results. llSome Evidence (SE): Strategies with this rating are likely to work, but further research is needed to confirm effects. These strategies have been tested more than once and results trend positive overall. llExpert Opinion (EO): Strategies with this rating are recommended by credible, impartial experts but have limited research documenting effects; further research, often with stronger designs, is needed to confirm effects. llInsufficient Evidence (IE): Strategies with this rating ha ve limited research documenting effects. These strategies need further research, often with stronger designs, to confirm effects. llMixed Evidence (Mixed): Stra tegies with this rating have been tested more than once and results are inconsistent; further research is needed to confirm effects. llEvidence of Ineffectiveness (EI): Strategies with this rating ar e not good investments. These strategies have been tested in multiple studies with consistently negative or harmful results. To learn more about WWFH methods and the criteria used to select strategies for inclusion in this report, see page 19. 5 What Works? Social and Economic Opportunities to Improve Health for AllA Look at Education Individuals with more education live longer, healthier lives than those with less education, and their children are more likely to thrive. This is true even when factors like income are taken into account. Across the U.S., there are large gaps in educational attainment between people who live in the least healthy counties and those in the healthiest counties. Often, for American Indian/Alaskan Native, Black, and Hispanic people, barriers to educational attainment create gaps within communities that are similar, if not greater. Educational institutions, governments, funders and community members can work together to set all children and young adults on a path towards academic and financial success.

WHAT'S WORKING TO IMPROVE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES? Examples of approaches and strategies with strong evidence of effectiveness that communities can implement to improve educational outcomes include: Increase early childhood education, for e xample: llPreschool education programs provide center- based support and learning for young children llUniversal pre-kindergarten provides early education for all 4-year-olds Improve quality of K-12 education, for e xample: llAttendance interventions for chronically absent students include resources and support to address individual, familial, and school-related factors that contribute to poor attendance llFull-day kindergarten offers early education for 4- to 6-year-olds, every weekday for at least five hour s llSummer learning programs provide continuous learning throughout the year Increase high school graduation rates, for e xample: llAlternative high schools for at-risk students provide an alternative setting for education llDropout prevention programs provide supports or undertake environmental changes to help students graduate Create environments that support learning, for example: llSchool breakfast programs offer students a nutritious breakfast at school llSchool-based health centers provide attending students health care services on school premises llSchool-based social and emotional instruction efforts help kids recognize and manage emotions, set and reach goals, appreciate others' perspectives, and maintain relationships llSchool-based violence and bullying prevention programs address students' disruptive and antisocial behavior through skill building llTrauma-informed schools use a multi-tiered approach to address the needs of trauma- exposed youth Increase education beyond high school, for e xample: llCollege access programs help underrepresented students prepare academically, complete applications, and enroll llHealth career recruitment for minority students helps train and prepare for careers in health fields Learn more about these and other strategies on pages 13 and 14. SPOKANE COUNTY, WA, 2014 In Spokane, Washington, a 2014 RWJF Culture of Health Prize winner, a multi- pronged effort was launched to raise the science, technology, engineering, and mathematic abilities of students through mentoring, internships, and project-based learning. 7 What Works? Social and Economic Opportunities to Improve Health for AllA Look at Income and Employment Employment provides income and, often, benefits\u2014such as paid sick leave\u2014that can support healthy lifestyle choices. Unemployment limits these choices and negatively affects both quality of life and health overall. Across the U.S., there are large gaps in employment and income between people who live in the least healthy counties and those in the healthiest counties. Often, for American Indian/Alaskan Native, Black, and Hispanic people, barriers to opportunities for employment or higher income create gaps within communities that are similar, if not greater. Employers, educational institutions, and community members can work together to increase job skills for residents and enhance local employment opportunities.

What Works? Social and Economic Opportunities to Improve Health for All 9A Look at Family and Social Support Social support stems from relationships with family members, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances. Social capital refers to those aspects of society that help us to create beneficial relationships and networks in a community, such as interpersonal trust and civic associations. People with greater social support, less isolation, and greater interpersonal trust live longer and healthier lives than those who are socially isolated. Communities richer in social connections provide residents with greater access to support and resources than those that are less tightly knit. Non-profit organizations, governments, health care, public health and community members can build and sustain partnerships that reflect the diversity of the community and work together to implement strategies that increase social connections and supports. WAASWAAGANING ANISHINAABEG (LAC DU FLAMBEAU) TRIBE, WI, 2015 In Waaswaaganing Anishinaabeg, a 2015 RWJF Culture of Health Prize community, family support and fostering cross-generational connections are priority through the program Cooking with Grandmas where community elders teach youth the \"Ojibwe way.\" 10 What Works? WHAT'S WORKING TO BUILD FAMILY AND SOCIAL SUPPORT? Examples of approaches and strategies with strong evidence of effectiveness that communities can implement to improve social support and connectedness include: Ensure access to counseling and support, for e xample: llEmployee Assistance Programs provide confidential worksite-based counseling and referrals to employees to address personal and workplace challenges llMental Health First Aid provides an 8- or 12- hour training to educate laypeople about how to assist individuals with, or at risk for, mental health pr oblems llSocial service integration efforts coordinate access to services across multiple delivery systems Increase social connectedness, for example: llExtracurricular activities for social engagement offer social, art, or physical activities for school- aged youth outside of the school day llIntergenerational mentoring establishes relationships between older adults and children or adolescents llYouth peer mentoring establishes ongoing relationships between an older youth or young adult and a younger child or adolescentBuild social capital within communities, for e xample: llCommunity centers facilitate local residents' efforts to socialize, participate in recreational or educational activities, gain information, and seek support services llTrauma-informed approaches to community building support and strengthen traumatized and distressed residents and address effects of trauma Build social capital within families, for e xample: llEarly childhood home visiting programs provide expectant parents and families with young children with information, support, and training llFather involvement programs support fathers' active involvement in child rearing via various father- or family- focused interventions Learn more about these and other strategies on page 16. Perhaps no other innovation embodies what is taking place in Waaswaaganing Anishinaabeg (Lac du Flambeau), a 2015 RWJF Culture of Health Prize community, better than Envision. Though still in its infancy, this youth-driven learning program bridges generations while conveying life skills that do not fit neatly into any academic category. Envision immerses middle school students in the Ojibwe culture. Using traditional tribal methodologies, youth considered at risk are redirected, often with the gentle guidance of community leaders and elders. 11 What Works? Social and Economic Opportunities to Improve Health for AllChoosing the Right Strategy for Your Community This report provides examples of strategies that have been shown to make a difference in improving social and economic factors, especially for those who face barriers to opportunity. Visit What Works for Health to learn more about the specific outcomes and health factors each strategy has been shown to affect, and the decision makers who can help move it forward. This will help you develop your own short list of potential strategies. As you explore strategies that may be a good fit for your community, be sure to: 1. Consider the context: Strategies, even those that are rated Scientifically Supported, may not be right for every community. To evaluate whether a strategy might work where you are, ask yourself: llIs the strategy a good fit for our community and our partners? llHave we included those most affected by poor health or poor social and economic conditions in choosing the strategy? llIs our community ready and able to support our chosen strategy? Do we have what we need to implement and evaluate the strategy? llDoes our community's political environment support our strategy? 2. Consider the community: Communities are not always ready for change. It's important to consider your community's unique makeup, characteristics, and culture. Involving community residents along the way can help build support for change. 3. Consider your stakeholders: Stakeholders are people who care about your issue. O ften when we think of the political environment, we think of key decision makers. They're important, but it is equally important to consider all stakeholder groups, including: llThe public. All those with vested interests. This might include community residents (particularly those who face barriers to opportunity and good health), advocacy groups, non-profit agencies, and businesses.llSpecific political stakeholders. Those who have the power to give you what you want, including elected and appointed officials or lobbying groups. llImplementers. Those tasked with making the strategy work, such as administrators. This is an important group - a strategy only works when it's implemented or enforced. 4. Select the best str ategy: As you make your selection, consider a balance of strategies. Start with short-term strategies that give you early wins. At the same time, lay the groundwork for strategies that have a longer-term impact. llGenerate a list of your top choices. (This is a good time to look back at WWFH) llCheck your inclusiveness \u2014 have you engaged those most impacted by the issue? llChoose a strategy \u2014 pull together what you know about your top choices, their impact, and your community to make a decision. 5. Consider whether to adapt the strategy: Policies and programs may not be a fit for your community straight \"out of the box.\" You may need to adjust the strategy to fit your community's needs. If you do, be ready to conduct more rigorous evaluation to make sure it is working as intended. Now what? Once you have decided what you want to do, the next step is to make it happen. CHR&R's guide to Act on What's Important can help your community build on strengths, leverage available resources, and respond to unique needs. 12 What Works?

Technical Notes and Glossary of Terms What is health equity? What are health disparities? And how do they relate? Health equity means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible. This requires removing obstacles to health, such as poverty and discrimination, and their consequences, including powerlessness and lack of access to good jobs with fair pay, quality education and housing, safe environments, and health care. Health disparities are differences in health or in the key determinants of health\u2014such as education, safe housing, and discrimination\u2014which adversely affect marginalized or excluded groups. Health equity and health disparities are closely related to each other. Health equity is the ethical and human rights principle or value that motivates us to eliminate health disparities. Reducing and ultimately eliminating disparities in health and determinants of health is how we measure progress toward achieving health equity. Braveman P, Arkin E, Orleans T, Proctor D, and Plough A. What is Health Equity? And What Difference Does a Definition Make? Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. May 2017 How did we select strategies to include in this r eport? We selected strategies from the Social and Economic Factors section of What Works for Health based on those assigned the highest evidence of effectiveness ratings: Scientifically Supported, Some Evidence, and Expert Opinion (see page 5 for definitions). The availability of evidence about the effectiveness of strategies varies by topic. For example, there is much stronger evidence about the effectiveness of educational interventions than for employment and income- related interventions.Among this set of strategies, preference was given to those where there is scientific support (with consistently favorable results in robust studies) and favorable disparity ratings (see below). Preference was also given to broader strategies versus specific named programs, programs that can be implemented locally, and those that can be described and understood easily. The report also sought a balance in representation across the different approaches to improving social and economic opportunity, such as increasing early childhood education and increasing high school graduation. This report reflects content as of August 14, 2018. WWFH Disparity Ratings As WWFH evidence analysts review the available evidence on individual strategies, they assess each strategy's likely effect on racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities based on the best available evidence related to disparities in health outcomes and the strategy's characteristics (e.g., target population, mode of delivery, cultural considerations). Strategies are r ated: llLikely to decrease disparities llNo impact on disparities likely llLikely to increase disparities Strategies that are likely to reduce differences in health outcomes (i.e., close a gap) are rated 'Likely to decrease disparities,' while strategies likely to increase differences are rated 'Likely to increase disparities.' Strategies that generally benefit entire populations are rated 'No impact on disparities likely.'

INTRODUCTION Miami -Dade County is the largest major metropolitan area in the State of Florida representing 13.4% of the State's population, with an estimated population of 2,702,602. It is also one of the few counties in the United State that is a \"minority -majority\", meaning that a minori ty group comprises the majority of the population, with 67.5% of the population in Miami -Dade County identifying as either Latino or Hispanic compared to 24.7% of the State of Florida population. Furthermore, 52.9% of residents in Miami -Dade County are for eign -born, with 73.8% speaking a language other than English at home, often Spanish or Haitian -Creole. Compared to Florida as a whole, Miami -Dade County is also a relatively young population with 84.7% of residents under the age of 65 and 20.5% under the a ge of 18. Miami -Dade County has significant socioeconomic and health disparities to address, particularly among Black/African -American and Hispanic/Latino residents. Black/African -American and Hispanic/Latino residents consistently have a significantly lo wer Median Household Income ($35,082 and $43,802, respectively) compared to the county -wide ($46,338) and White, non -Hispanic residents ($75,083). Additionally, 27.6% of Black/African -American residents live below the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) compared t o the county -side average (19.0%). There is also a significant disparity in educational attainment with 16.2% of Black/African -American residents age 25+ earning a bachelor's degree compared to 49.9%o of White, non -Hispanic residents and 27.8% of Miami -Dade County residents. Hispanic residents are much less likely to have a usual source of healthcare (57.6%) compared to non - Hispanic Black (72.2%) or non -Hispanic White (77.4%), and Black/African -American adults are less likely to have health insurance (69.0% ) compared to Hispanic/Latino (74.6%) or White, non -Hispanic adults (86.4%).

PROJECT OVERVIEW Project Goals This Wellbeing Survey serves as a follow -up to similar studies completed in 2006 and 2013. I t is a systematic, data -drive n approach to understanding the quality of life, environment, health risks, and access to healthcare of residents in Miami -Dade County. Therefore, the results of this analysis may be used to inform decisions and drive efforts to improve community health. The Wellbeing Survey provides survey results that represent the issues of greatest concern to the community and can be utilized to determine resource allocation in order to make the greatest possible impact on community health. This analysis will serve as a tool toward reaching three basic goals: 1. Improve residents' health status, increase life expectancy, and elevate overall quality of life. 2. Reduce health disparities among residents of Miami -Dade County 3. Increase access to preventative healthcare services The Wellbeing survey was developed an d administered by the Florida Department of Health (FDOH), Office of Community Health and Planning with guidance from the Health Council of South Florida (HCSF) . Analysis was completed on behalf of FDOH by the HCSF. The H CSF is the state -mandated health planning council for Miami -Dade and Monroe counties with extensive experience conducting community health assessments and evaluations. III. METHODOLOGY Clustering Methodology The clusters for the 2018 Miami -Dade County Wellbei ng Survey are made up of ZIP codes linked according to their perceived community identity and geographic contiguity. However, at times these clusters also cross boundaries based upon socioeconomic status or population counts. There are thirteen (13) total clusters for sampling, twelve (12) standard clusters and one (1) oversampled cluster. The oversampled cluster consists of contiguous ZIP codes representing the most economically and socially deprived neighborhoods, many of which also suffer from the highes t rates of hospitalization for preventable conditions. The following map ( Figure 1 ) shows the location of each of the defined clusters. 5 6 Details of the ZIP codes corresponding to each cluster are provided in Table 1. Table 1: Clusters by Name and ZIP Co de Cluster Name ZIP Codes Included Cluster 1 Survey Instrument The survey instrument used for this study was created by combining specific, validated survey questions from national surveys, such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), into one succinct survey by the FDOH, Office of Community Health and Planning . Additional resources used in the creation of this survey instrument were the Will County Illinois Health Department and the Santa Monica Well being Survey, and it was also largely based on previous county -wide surveys that address gaps in health promotion and disease prevention in communities. The final survey instrument was approved in consultation with the HCSF. 7 Sample Approach and Design From June 12, 2018 to March 10, 2019 , the F LDOH administered the 2018 Miami -Dade County Wellbeing Survey. To ensure proper representation of the population surveyed, an online, tablet or computer -based survey methodology was utilized. Participants were self -selected in public spaces, such as libraries, parks, and other community -based even ts. Email blasts were also used through the Consortium for a Healthier - Miami Dade and inclusion in newsletters such as those provided by t he Miami -Dade County Library and the Consortium Connection. The sample design employed sought a stratified sample of 2 ,970 individuals age 18 and older in Miami - Dade County based upon a population of 2,115,418. There were 220 expected surveys in Clusters 1 - 12 and 330 in the oversampled Cl uster 13. In comparison to previous county -wide surveys discussing the health and well -being of Miami -Dade County residents, this survey has a higher overall sample size. A 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment had targeted sample size of 2,700 Miami -Dade County residents. This sample size was based upon a population age 18 and older of 1,989,485. The increase in population over age 18 in Miami -Dade County results in the increased sample size, while keeping sample error and confidence level consistent at 1 .8% and 95% confidence, respectively. Post -stratification Survey Weighting To accurately represent the population of Miami -Dade County, post -stratification weights were applied to the raw data collected from the 2018 Miami -Dade County Wellbeing Survey. Th ough the survey design strove to minimize bias, it is common to apply weights after data is collected to improve representativeness. This is accomplished by adjusting the results of the random sample to match the sociodemographic and geographic characteris tics of the general population. The HCSF examined the respondents' sociodemographic characteristics including gender, age, ethnicity, household income, and education, and utilized statistical raking to determine and apply weights to the survey responses. Thus, while the integrity of each individual's responses is maintained, one respondent's response may contribute a larger proportion to the whole compared to another. Figure 2 outlines select demographic characteristics of Miami -Dade County as estimated b y the U.S. Census Bureau compared to the weighted survey results. The sample design and quality control procedures used in data collection and analysis, as mentioned earlier in the Methodology section, ensure that the sample is representative when weights are applied. Therefore, the findings in Weighted Results section of this report (Section V) may be generalized to the total Miami -Dade population with confidence. Limitations This survey and analysis contain some limitations that are important to note. First, while design weights were applied prior to survey collection, due to the survey collection methodology employed the design weights were not followed accurately. Online survey collection is more difficult to control when seeking specific sample sizes from various locations for a single survey. In this case, some clusters, such as Cluster 2, had many more survey respondents than sought, while others, such as Cluster 6, were severely underrepresented (see Table 2). To remedy this, we included the propos ed design weights as a variable 8 in the post -stratification weighing methodology utilized after -the-fact. Furthermore, there were several questions that allowed more than one answer creating difficulties in analyzing them to gain representative samples. For example, the question \"Where do you or your family go when sick or in need of healthcare, mental healthcare, or dental services?\", allows multiple answers, which made it difficult to draw representative conclusions for the county and clusters. For these q uestions, rather than draw conclusions that may not be representative of the true cluster or county -wide makeup, we included them in the Respondent Summary section rather than in the Weighted Results section. 9 Figure 2 \u2014Population Characteristics, Miami -Dade County vs. IV. SURVEY RESPONDENT SUMMARY The following results are based solely upon the respondents themselves. These results were not weighted utilizing the methodology described in Section III, and, thus, should not be considered representative of the individual clusters or the county. However, they represent the individuals who completed the Miami - Dade County Wellbeing Survey. Geography The 2018 Miami -Dade County Wellbeing Survey was collected from June 12, 2018 to March 10, 2019 with a total of 3,573 complete respondents. The largest percentage of respondents were from Cluster 2 (18.8%), Cluster 1 (11.3%), and Cluster 3 (11.0%).

Chart 3 \u2014Where do you get information about RESULTS The following section are results from the weighted analysis. These results, based upon the methodology explained earlier in Section III, can be considered representative of the areas and county described. Quality of Life The first set of question s of the Miami -Dade Well -Being Survey under the Quality of Life section asked participants about their attitude to ward life as they are confronted with inevitable issues or problems. These questions aimed to inquire about the presence of individual and soc ial support; the value of their own life; a sense of community identification with health -related issues; attitude to life in general; and the presence of beliefs, whether religious or spiritual, that influence how participants lead their lives. To begin, the survey asked the degree to which the respondent agrees with a series of questions related to their view on life. For example, 79.7% of respondents either strongly agree or agree that they have people with whom they can share problems or get help when needed (Chart 4). However, this is not universal across all clusters. Cluster 13 has 58.5% that either strongly agree or agree with an additional 41.5% responding that they disagree or strongly disagree. Chart 4- To what extent do you agree or disagree with each of the following statements about yourself : I have people with whom I can share problems or get help when needed. Additionally, when asked whether they have a positive view on the future, over 80% of respondents strongly agree or agree that th ey do have a positive view. This is pretty standard across clusters, with the largest percentage seen in Cluster 2, where 91.9% strongly agree or agree and the lowest percentage seen in Cluster 5 with 72.4% Agree Strongly Agree17 Chart 5- To what extent do you agree o r disagree with each of the following statements about yourself : I have a positive view on the future. When asked whether they have a sense of responsibility to help improve the health of their community, 84.2% of respondents stated that they either strongly agree or agree. This, too, was similarly represented across clusters, with most responding with 70% strongly agreeing or agreeing. The largest percentage was seen in Cluster 2 (93.3%) with the smallest percentage seen in Cluster 8 with 74.3% of those strongly agreeing/agreeing and Strongly Agree18 Chart 6- To wh at extent do you agree or disagree with each of the following statements about yourself : I have a sense of responsibility to help improve the health of my community. The majority of respondents (64.2%) stated that they strongly disagree/disagree that it takes them a long time to get back to normal when things have gone wrong in their life. The largest percentages of those who strongly disagree/disagree were found in Cluster 2 (76.4%), Cluster 4 (76.7%), and Cluster 6 (77.4%), while the smallest percentag e was seen in Cluster 5 (46.6%) and Cluster 9 (48.8%). Please refer Agree Strongly Agree19 Chart 7- To what extent do you agree or disagree with each of the following statements about yourself : When things go wrong in my life, it takes me a long time to get back to normal. The residents of Miami -Dade County also feel that their lives, in general, are worthwhile with 86.7% of respondents indicating that they strongly agree/agree when prompted. This sentiment is fairly common across all clusters. The high est percentage that strongly agree/agree are found in Cluster 2 (92.9%) and the lowest percentage in Cluster 8 (72.2%). Chart 8- To what extent do you agree or disagree with each of the following statements about yourself : I generally feel that what I do in my life is Agree Strongly Agree20 Overall, the majority of residents indicate that their religious or spiritual beliefs influence the way that they live (70.6% strongly agree/agree; 29.4% strongly disagree/disagree) with varying degrees over the clusters. Cluste r 4 had the largest percentage of residents who strongly agree/agree (79.9%) while Cluster 6 had the lowest percentage (50.8%). Please refer to Chart 9. Chart 9- To what extent do you agree or disagree with each of the following statements about yourself : My religious or spiritual beliefs influence the way that I live. Residents were also asked about how worried they are about financial concerns in their life, such as credit card payments, rent, and job security. Overall, residents are not too worried or not worried at all (56.9%) about making minimum payments on their credit cards with 34.0% indicate that they are moderately worried or very worried and 9.0% not applicable. Clusters 13 and Cluster 7 indicated the least amount of worry about making minimum credit card payments ( 49.7% and 50.4%, respectively ). Cluster 7, however, indicated the largest percentage who are very worried and moderately worried (45.2%) followed by Cluster 6 (40.1%). Please refer Agree Strongly Agree21 Chart 10- How worried are you right now about not being able to make the minimum payments on your credit cards? A larger percentage of residents are worried about not being able to pay their rent, mortgage, or other housing costs. Overall, 38.4% indicate they ar e very worried or moderately worried about housing costs. Cluster 1 and Cluster 7 have over 50% of their residents very worried or moderately worried about housing costs (52.2% and 51.6%, respectively), while Clusters 2, 3, and 10 all have much lower perce ntages indicating worry (33.1%, 30.7%, and 30.2%, Moderately worried Not too worried Not worried at all Not Applicable22 Chart 11- How worried are you right now about not being able to pay your rent, mortgage, or other housing costs? Finally, overall, less than one -quarter (24.5%) of residents are worried that they might lose their job in the next six months. While all clusters remain below 50.0%, not all clusters feel as secure in their jobs. Clusters 5, 6, and 7 have greater percentages of those very worried or moderately worried about their job security with 34.9%, 36.6%, and 34.3%, respectively. Please refer to Chart 12. Chart 12- How worried are you right now that you might lose your job in the next six months? The subsequent set of questions aimed to capture resident s' stress level, decreased interest in activities they would normally enjoy, depression level, energy, and appetite. As observed in previous categories Moderately worried Not too worried Not worried at all Not Moderately worried Not too worried Not worried at all Not Applicable23 questions, certain patterns and variations were captured on this component of the Quality of Life sect ion. Overall, when residents were asked whether they feel stressed, 31.2% indicated that they felt stressed 3 or more days in a week and 43.1% indicated they feel stressed less than 2 days in a week. Cluster 6 residents, however, report that 50.2% of resid ents feel stressed 3 or more days in a week, while only 6.9% indicate that they never feel stressed on average. Whereas, 38.2% of Cluster 10 indicate that they never feel stressed. Please refer to Chart 13. Chart 13 -Over the last week, how man y days have you felt stressed? The majority of residents (52.5%) responded \"none\" to indicate the number of days in a week in which they had little interest or pleasure in doing things that they normally enjoy compared to 32.7% who said they had less than 2 days in a week and 14.9% who had 3 or more days in a week (Chart 14). Residents of Cluster 6, however, had 29.9 % who responded that they had 3 or more days in a week in which they had little interest or pleasure in doing things that they normally enjoy doing with 47.1% responding \"none\". Cluster 8 had the lowest percentage of residents who responded that they had no days in which they felt apathetic toward their normal interests (34.9%) with an additional 44.6% with less than 2 days in a week and 21.1% who respond ed 3 or more days in than 2 days in a week 3 or more days in a week24 Chart 14 - Over the last week, how man y days have yo u had little interest or please in doing things you normally enjoy doing? When asked how many days they felt down, depressed, lonely, or hopeless, the majority responded \"none\" (54.4%), with only 13.5% responding 3 or more days in a week. Cluster 6 had the largest percentage of residents who responded that they felt depressed, lonely, or hopeless 3 or more days in a week (34.0%), while Cluster 2 had the smallest (9.2%). F urthermore Cluster 6 also had the smallest percentage of residents who responded \"none\" (42.4%) while Cluster 2 had the largest percentage who responded \"none\" (68.0%). Please refer to Chart 15. Chart 15 - Over the last week, how man y days have yo u felt do wn, depressed, than 2 days in a week 3 or more days in a than 2 days in a week 3 or more days in a week25 The following question intended to capture participants' energy level over the last week. Countywide, the majority of residents (41.6%) indicated that they have felt tired or had little energy less than two days in a week; followed by those who indicated \"none\" with 33.7%; and close to 25.0% who shared that they have felt tired or had little energy three or more days in a week (please refer to Chart 16). When participants' responses were stratified by cluster, most clus ters showed similar results as the County overall. However, most respondents in Cluster 4, 9, and 10 (41.2%, 42.9%, and 38.4%, respectively) pointed out that they have not felt tired or had little energy over the last week, while the majority of responden ts in Cluster 6 (44.5%) indicated that they have felt tired or had little energy three or more days in a week and represents the largest percentage of respondents compared to other clusters and the County as a whole. Chart 16 - Over the last week, how man y days have yo u felt tired, or had little energy? The following question inquired about participants' nutritional habits, more specifically it asked participants whether they had a poor appetite or had eaten too much over the last week. At the county - level, most residents (52.7%) indicated \"none\" as their answer, followed by those who shared \"less than 2 days in a week\" (30.0%), and close to 18.0% who pointed out three or more days in a week (please refer to Chart 17). It is important to note that with t he exception of Cluster 6, the response distribution across all clusters mirrored the countywide response results with a few fluctuations observed among clusters. In Cluster 6, the second most frequent response derived from residents who had a poor appeti te or had eaten too much three or more days in a week with 33.0%, and it represents the highest percentage of residents compared to other clusters and the County as a than 2 days in a week 3 or more days in a week26 Chart 17 - Over the last week, how man y days have yo u had a poor appetite or eaten too much? The next of group questions or topics covered in the survey inquired about the social interaction of participants, whether with friends, colleagues, or in the community; as well as the amount of time spent outdoors away from home. At the county -level, t he majority of residents (27.6%) meet socially with their friends, family members or co-workers between one and three times a month; followed by 22.6% of respondents who indicated between one and two times a week, and 18.4% who meet sociall y every day or almost every day (please refer to Chart 18). Slightly over 14.0% of residents \"never or almost never\" meet socially with friends, relatives or work colleagues. Responses varied across all clusters. The most frequent response derived from Clu ster 8 residents, in which close to 42.0% indicated that they meet with friends, family members, and co -workers between one or two times a week. By contrast, the least frequent response derived from Cluster 9, in which 7.2% of residents engage in social ac tivity than 2 days in a week 3 or more days in a week27 Chart 18 - Thinking about your life at the moment, how often do you meet socially with friends, relatives, or work colleagues? The following question asked participants about the frequency of involvement associated with voluntary work or when working with charitable organizations . Overall, 40.0% of res idents are \"never or almost never\" involved in this type of work , followed by 24.8% who do so \"less than monthly,\" and those who indicated between one and three times per m onth (16.4%). Please refer to Chart 19. Half of residents (50.0%) from Cluster 7 \"never or almost never\" engage in work for voluntary or charitable organizations, which is the highest percentage across all clusters. Cluster 6 exhibited the lowest percenta ge of residents that are involved in this type of work with 4.5%, and the highest percentage that does Less than monthly 1-3 times a month 1-2 times a week Every day or almost everyday28 Chart 19 - Thinking about your life at the moment, how often do you get involved in work for voluntary or charitable organizations? Countywide, 25.1% of residents spend their leisure time outdoors or away from home between one and two times a week; and the same percentage of residents do so between one and three times a month (please refer to Chart 20). The least frequent response at the county -level derived from residents who \"never or almost never\" spend their leisure time outdoors or away from home with 14.7%, which is substantially higher than the percentage of respondents residing in Cluster 6 (4.8%). Compared to the County as a whole, the percentage of respondents residing in Cluster 10 who spend their leisure time outdoors or away from home \"every day or almost every day\" was twice as high (15.5% compared to 31.0%). Additionally, only 9.1% of responde nts residing in Cluster 8 spend their leisure time outdoors or away from home \"every day or almost every day\" which is 3.4 times lower than the percentage of respondents who reside in Cluster Less than monthly 1-3 times a month 1-2 times a week Every day or almost everyday29 Chart 20 - Thinking about your life at the moment , how often do you spend your leisure time out of doors and away from home? The following question concludes the set questions, under the Quality of Life, that aimed to learn about participants' social interaction and it examines the degree of frequency that participants spend time in community or public spaces. Approximately, 25.0% of respondents spend time in community or public spaces \"less than monthly\", followed by those who indicated between one and two times a week (23.6%), and 19.6% who responded \"never or almost never.\" Certain patterns were observed with the response distribution across all clusters. For instance, Cluster 10 exhibited the highest percentage of respondents that spend time in community or public spaces (e.g., libraries, parks) \"eve ry day or almost every day\" with 24.3% (as mentioned in the previous section, Cluster 10 also exhibited the highest percentage of respondents who spend their leisure time outdoors or away from home). Additionally, Cluster 6 residents constituted the lowest percentage of respondents who \"never or almost never\" spend time in community or public spaces with 10.3%. Please refer to Less than monthly 1-3 times a month 1-2 times a week Every day or almost everyday30 Chart 21 - Thinking about your life at the moment, how often do you spend time in community or public spaces such as libraries or parks? The last topic covered under the Quality of Life section of the survey asked participants whether, in the last five years, they have experienced discrimination, been prevented for doing something, been hassled, or made to feel inferi or during the following scenarios or situations based on race, ethnicity, or color: at school, during job hiring process or at work, while meeting housing accommodations, receiving medical care, receiving service at a store or restaurant; obtaining credit, bank loans, or a mortgage; public setting, and from the police or in the courts. At the county -level, most respondents indicated that in the last five years they have never experienced this prejudicial treatment in any of the situations o r places mentioned, and a decreasing pattern is observed as the frequency of these possible scenarios increases (i.e. once, two or three times, and four or more times). However, when responses from all clusters are considered, a certain degree of variation is observed in the percentage of respondents who felt they have undergone this treatment; although the majority of respondents still maintained that that they have never been discriminated, been excluded or prevented, been hassled, or made feel inferior ba sed on their race, ethnicity, or color. School Countywide, close to 74.0% of respondents shared that in the last five years they have never been subjected to prejudicial treatment at school based on their race, ethnicity, or color; followed by those who indicated \"once\" (13.1%); two or three times (9.0 %); and four or more times (4.3%). Please refer to Chart 22. Cluster 7 exhibited the highest percentage of respondents who have been never experienced this treatment at school with 86.3%, while Cluster 6 exhibited the lowest percentage (61.1%). By comparis on, the highest percentage of respondents who felt they have been subjected to this treatment four or more times based on their race, ethnicity, or color derived from Cluster 1 Less than monthly 1-3 times a month 1-2 times a week Every day or almost everyday31 Chart 22 - In the last five years, have you ever experienced discri mination, been prevented from doing something, or been hassled or made to feel inferior in any of the following situations because of your race, ethnicity, or color? : At school Hiring Process Chart 23 illustrates the response distribution of participant s, by cluster, when they were asked if in the last five years they have been treated with prejudice while getting hired or getting a job based on their race, ethnicity, or color. Approximately 81.0% of residents from Cluster 7 never experienced this type o f treatment while getting hired or getting a job, which represents the highest percentage compared to all clusters and the County as a whole. Cluster 8 displayed the highest percentage of residents who felt they have been discriminated, been excluded or pr evented, been hassled, or made feel inferior four or more times during the aforementioned scenario with 8.1%; compared to Cluster 9 which exhibited the lowest or three times Four or more times32 Chart 23 - In the last five years, have you ever experienced discrimi nation, been prevented from doing something, or been hassled or made to feel inferior in any of the following situations because of your race, ethnicity, or color? : Getting hired or getting a job Work Compared to the County and all other clusters, Cluster 7 represented the highest percentage of respondents who indicated they have never been experience prejudicial treatment at work based on their race, ethnicity, or color with close to 81.0%; while Clust er 6 exhibited the highest percentage of respondents who have experienced this treatment two or three times in the last five years (30.3%). Please refer to Chart 24. Additionally, close to 14.0% of respondents from Cluster 1 indicated that they have been discriminated, been excluded or prevented from doing , been hassled, or make feel inferior at work four or more times, which is the highest percentage compared to other clusters and the overall response or three times Four or more times33 Chart 24 - In the last five years , have you ever experienced discrimination, been prevented from doing something, or been hassled or made to feel inferior in any of the following situations because of your race, ethnicity, or color? : At work Housing As observed previously, response distribution varied across all clusters and the County overall when respondents were asked if they have been discriminated, been excluded or prevented, been hassled, or made feel inferior while pursuing housing accommodatio ns based on race, ethnicity, or color. For instance, approximately 93.0% of residents from Cluster 4 stated that they have never been subjected to this treatment while \"getting housing\" and represents the highest percentage among all clusters and the Count y's overall response distribution (please refer to Chart 25). Additionally, less than one percent of respondents residing in Cluster 2 have undergone this experience four or more times while pursuing housing accommodations; compared to 9.0% of respondents from Cluster 1, which represents the highest percentage of respondents who encountered the experience this frequently based on race, ethnicity, or color. It is also important to note that 20.3% of respondents from Cluster 6 have experienced prejudice, 9.2 times higher than the percentage of respondents from Cluster or three times Four or more times34 Chart 25 - In the last five years, have you ever experienced discrimination, been prevented from doing something, or been hassled or made to feel inferior in any of the following situatio ns because of your race, ethnicity, or color? : Getting housing Medical Care When receiving medical care is concerned, 6.2% of respondents from Cluster 11 stated that they have experienced an unjust encounter four or more times and represents the highest percentage of respondents compared to all other clusters and the County (please refer to Chart 26).

The first set of questions under the Environment section asked participants to rate their neighborhood, from poor to excellent, based on the following themes or topics: overall quality of life, as a place to raise children, as a place to grow old, overall quality of the environment, and a as safe community. When asked to rate the overall quality of life in their neighborhood, 36.9% of residents rated their neighborhood as Poor or Fair, while 32.9% rated their neighborhood as Very Good or Excellent. However, 17.2% of residents in Cluster 5 and 15.8% in Cluster 13 rated the quality of life in their neighborhood as Poor with an additional 35.8% in Cluster 5 and 42.1% in Cluster 13 as Fair, both of which are significantly higher t han the county -wide percentage. These clusters additionally had the lowest percentages to respond that the quality of life in their neighborhood is Excellent with 3.1% and 3.2% respectively.

CONCLUSION The 2018 Wellbeing Survey sought to understand the health status, needs, and expectations of the residents of Miami -Dade County. Overall, the residents of Miami -Dade C ounty are optimistic about their health, their access to healthcare, and their overall quality of life. However, this is not universal across all indicators and clusters. The following section highlights the major findings of the 2018 Wellbeing Survey: Respondent Summary The respondents to the 2018 Wellbeing Survey were largely female, between the ages of 24 -54, and White or African -American. Furthermore, many of them are long -term residents of Miami -Dade County and have a minimum education of a Bachelor's Degree. While these characteristics are not representative of Miami - Dade County as a whole, through advanced statistical processing, the results of the survey on specific health and quality of life indicators are representative (for more information see S ection III L ife As a whole, Miami -Dade County residents indicate that they, largely, agree that they have a high quality of life. The majority responded that they have good support systems when they need help, have positive view s of the future, a sense of civic duty, and have a positive view on life. However, there are key neighborhoods/clusters within Miami -Dade that do not share this positive view. For instance, r esidents from Cluster 13 are less likely to strongly agree or agree that they have people with whom they can share problems or get help when needed compared to the County and other clusters . Additionally, residents from Cluster 6 are more likely to worry about losing their jobs i n the next six month s and are more likely to feel tired, stressed, down, depressed, lonely, or hopeless three or more days in a week compared to the County and other clusters . Meanwhile, Cluster 1 residents (South Dade/Homestead) exhibited the highest perc entage of residents who have experienced prejudicial treatment four or more times in the past five years in the following settings: at school, at work, getting housing, receiving medical care, and on the streets or public setting . Furthermore, housing and the health care system in Miami -Dade County continues to be a large concern for residents with 38.4% indicating they are moderately or very worried about their ability to pay for housing ; while over 40% believe the quality of their health system is poor o r fair. These results indicate that, while residents ' opinion s of the overall quality of life in Miami -Dade County are good, there are specific areas that do not equally feel this positivity and larger, more wide -spread issues that must be addressed to co ntinue to see improved quality of life . Environment As a place to live, the residents of Miami -Dade County found that, overall, the county is a good place to live and raise a family. However, unlike Quality of Life, there was not a clear tendency in the po sitive. When asked to rate their neighborhood as a place to grow old, to raise children, and as a safe community, responses were closely split between Fair, Good, and Very Good. Furthermore, these sentiments are not felt universally. Residents of Clusters 1, 5, and 13 have higher percentages of those who responded Poor or Fair when asked to rate their neighborhood, while Clusters 4 and 6 tended to have higher percentages that rated their neighborhoods as Very Good or Excellent. Specific aspects of the community environment did not reveal any large consensus either. While larger percentages at a County Level indicated that they believe their neighborhood is family friendly and provides access to good schools, key themes persist \u2014issues wit h housing affordability and transportation \u2014with most individual clusters indicating that they can either only sometimes, rarely, or never find affordable housing or a variety of transportation options. Only Clusters 4 and 9 consistently indicated a larger percentages of residents who answered they Always had access to these characteristics. Modifiable Health Risks Residents indicated that they are, generally, Always or Most of the Time have access to healthy and affordable food, and Strongly Agree on the i mportance of breastfeeding for infant health. These trends are common across clusters with only Cluster 13, and to a lesser extent Cluster 5, indicating lower access to healthy and affordable food and decreased understanding of the importance of breastfeed ing. For instance, Cluster 13 is characterized with the highest percentage of residents who are more likely to strongly disagree or disagree with the following components associated with breastfeeding: it benefits 71 the health of the mother and babies; it is the best food for babies; it is healthier for babies than formula feeding; mothers have the right to breastfeed in public places; that they are comfortable when mothers breastfeed their babies in a public place , and that employers should provide a private room for breastfeeding mothers to pump their milk at work. This indicates that for Cluster 13, additional health education opportunities are needed coupled with expanded availability of health and affordable food options for residents. Additionally, when asked about specific modifiable health risks, such as illegal drug use and mental health, there were significant portions of the county that felt that these risks are at least somewhat of a problem. These sentiments are particularly strong in Clusters 13, 4, and 1, which consistently exhibited higher percentages that indicated modifiable health risks are a large problem. For example, Cluster 1 is characterized with the highest percentage of residents who feel that substance abuse (illegal drug use, prescri ption drug use, alcohol abuse) and mental health are large problems is their communities . These results indicate a need for targeted responses to modifiable health risk concerns at a neighborhood level in Miami -Dade County, with particular focus on those a reas that indicate a moderate to high level of concern with answers of \"It's somewhat a problem\" or \"It's a large problem\". Access to Healthcare Services While a large proportion of residents believe they are always able to get the health services needed , many did not indicate the quality of health services to be \"Very Good\" or \"Excellent\" or that they are able to pay for needed healthcare. This is especially true of Cluster 13 residents, who are more likely than the County and other clusters to respond that their community is \"Never\" able to pay for healthcare services and also represent the largest percentage of residents who feel that residents with disabilities \"Never\" have access to services. I n contrast, residents of Cluster 6 largely feel they \"Alw ays\" or \"Most of the time\" can get the health services needed, are able to pay for healthcare, and believe residents with disabilities have access to needed services. Mental Health Medicine or Treatment The vast majority of residents of Miami -Dade Count y are not taking medication or receiving treatment for any type of mental health condition or emotional problem. While there are varying rates across neighborhoods and clusters (e.g. 90.4% in Cluster 4 responded \"no\" while 55.8% of Cluster 13 responded \"no\"), every cluster continued to have the majority of residents respond that they do not take medications or receive treatment for mental health or emotional conditions. Lessons Learned There were several lessons gleaned from the 2018 Wellbeing Survey. First, for ease of analysis and interpretation, the inclusion of design weights is crucial. The current survey was implemented in an online only format and often distributed via email blast s to a nd through community partners and via the use of tablets at local community events . This does not allow for robust control over area specific sample size. In future surveys, mixed method approaches or a focus on phone -based interviews could allow for closer regulation over sample size, particularly at the cluster level. Additionally, the 2018 Wellbeing Survey was a new iteration of previous county -wide surveys and included numerous new questions that were not able to be compared to previous years. Wh ile there are benefits 72 to focusing on new subject matter or tweaking individual questions to be more specific to the population sought, this does not allow for time trend data. In future years, it would be beneficial to repeat large portions of the current survey or return to previous surveys so that ti me trend data is available, and interpretations can include improvements over a five -year to ten -year period. Finally, any survey that is meant to represent a large metropolitan area must be expected to nee d post - stratification weighting. While, the 2018 Wellbeing Survey did utilize post -stratification weights, future surveys should develop the survey and design weights to minimize post -stratification weighing , particularly when it comes to the demographic p rofile of respondents. Overall, the 2018 Wellbeing Survey is a scientifically rigorous, representative sample of Miami -Dade County. The weighted results presented in this report can be used to inform and plan for population health initiatives to improve u pon the current response of residents. Furthermore, the results of this survey can be used to inform local administrators, government officials, community -based organizations, and academic communities as they also seek to implement programs to improve comm unity health and the overall quality of life of residents.
