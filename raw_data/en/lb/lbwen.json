The absence of reported absolute risk reduction in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials can lead to outcome reporting bias that affects the interpretation of vaccine efficacy. The present article uses clinical epidemiologic tools to critically appraise reports of efficacy in Pfzier/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccine clinical trials. Based on data reported by the manufacturer for Pfzier/BioNTech vaccine BNT162b2, this critical appraisal shows: relative risk reduction, 95.1%; 95% CI, 90.0% to 97.6%; p = 0.016; absolute risk reduction, 0.7%; 95% CI, 0.59% to 0.83%; p < 0.000. For the Moderna vaccine mRNA-1273, the appraisal shows: relative risk reduction, 94.1%; 95% CI, 89.1% to 96.8%; p = 0.004; absolute risk reduction, 1.1%; 95% CI, 0.97% to 1.32%; p < 0.000. Unreported absolute risk reduction measures of 0.7% and 1.1% for the Pfzier/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively, are very much lower than the reported relative risk reduction measures. Reporting absolute risk reduction measures is essential to prevent outcome reporting bias in evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-02-26", "cleaned_text": "Outcome Reporting Bias in COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Clinical Trials [https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57030199](https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57030199) [Pandemic Outbreak of Coronavirus]( /journal/medicina/special_issues/Pandemic_Outbreak_Coronavirus Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-medicina-57-00199)]. Normally, genetic code in mRNA is transcribed from DNA in the cell nucleus, and the coded message is delivered by mRNA to cell ribosomes for translation during protein biosynthesis [ [2](#B2-medicina-57-00199)]. COVID-19 mRNA vaccines directly inject cells with a synthetic genetic code to replicate the spike S protein found on the surface of the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 [ [3](#B3-medicina-57-00199)]. Once replicated, the spike protein is proposed to trigger an immune response that creates antibodies against the virus [ [4](#B4-medicina-57-00199)]. [5](#B5-medicina-57-00199)]. To mitigate enzymatic degradation, mRNA in the vaccines is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles [ [6](#B6-medicina-57-00199)], but it is unclear how this encapsulation affects genetic code translation in the cell ribosomes. Nevertheless, clinical results of phase III trials reported for COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech (New York City, NY, USA/Mainz, Germany) [ [7](#B7-medicina-57-00199)] and Moderna (Cambridge, MA, USA) [ [8](#B8-medicina-57-00199)] have far surpassed predicted performance, with vaccine efficacy rates of approximately 95%. Curiously, \"why these vaccines seem so effective while previous attempts against other pathogens haven't appeared as promising remains an open question\" [ [1](#B1-medicina-57-00199)]. [9](#B9-medicina-57-00199)], \"There may be much more complexity to the '95% effective' announcement than meets the eye\u2014or perhaps not. Only full transparency and rigorous scrutiny of the data will allow for informed decision making. The data must be made public.\" [9](#B9-medicina-57-00199)]. Absolute risk reduction (ARR) and relative risk reduction (RRR) are measures of treatment efficacy reported in randomized clinical trials. Because the ARR and RRR can be dramatically different in the same trial, it is necessary to include both measures when reporting efficacy outcomes to avoid outcome reporting bias. In the present article, a critical appraisal of publicly available clinical trial data verifies that absolute risk reduction percentages for Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine BNT162b2 [ [7](#B7-medicina-57-00199)] and Moderna CI, 0.97% to 1.32%; p = 0.000. The same publicly available data, without absolute risk reduction measures, were reviewed and approved by the roster of members serving on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) for emergency use authorization (EUA) of the mRNA vaccines [ [10](#B10-medicina-57-00199)]. Ironically, the omission of absolute risk reduction measures in data reviewed by the VRBPAC overlooks FDA guidelines for communicating evidence-based risks and benefits to the public [ [11](#B11-medicina-57-00199)]. The FDA's advice for information providers includes: \"Provide absolute risks, not just relative risks. Patients are unduly influenced when risk information is presented using a relative risk approach; this can result in suboptimal decisions. Thus, an absolute risk format should be used.\" [12](#B12-medicina-57-00199)] and the mRNA-1273 vaccine [ [13](#B13-medicina-57-00199)], but with no mention of absolute risk reduction measures. 2. Critical Appraisal of Vaccine Efficacy [14](#B14-medicina-57-00199)]. Clinical epidemiologic tools can be applied in evidence-based medicine (EBM) to critically appraise research evidence for validity, size of effect, and usefulness in clinical practice [ [15](#B15-medicina-57-00199)]. Clinical treatment effects in groups of participants are measured by comparing probabilities of an event, known as event rates [ [16](#B16-medicina-57-00199)]. [Figure 1](#medicina-57-00199-f001)shows an example of a vaccine clinical trial for an infectious disease. The vaccine and placebo groups in [Figure 1](#medicina-57-00199-f001)each have 100 randomly assigned individuals with no history of infection, and an event is defined as the incidence of infection among all individuals during the course of the trial. The percentage of events in the vaccine group is the experimental event rate (EER) or the risk of infection in the vaccine group (1/100 = 1%), and the percentage of events in the placebo group is the control event rate (CER) or the risk of infection in the placebo group (2/100 = 2%). Absolute risk reduction (ARR) is the disease risk difference between the placebo and vaccine groups, i.e., the CER minus the EER (2% 1% = 1%). The ARR is also known as the vaccine disease preventable incidence (VDPI) [ [17](#B17-medicina-57-00199)]. Relative risk reduction (RRR) or vaccine efficacy (VE) is the reduced risk from vaccination, the ARR or VDPI, relative to or divided by the risk in unvaccinated individuals, the CER (1%/2% = 50%) [ [18](#B18-medicina-57-00199)]. 3. 2 \u00d7 2 Contingency Tables and Epidemiologic Equations [12](#B12-medicina-57-00199)] and the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine [ [13](#B13-medicina-57-00199)]. The table rows, shown in [Table 1](#medicina-57-00199-t001), list the vaccine and placebo groups and the table columns list the participants' outcomes of either SARS-CoV-2 infection or no infection. [Table 2](#medicina-57-00199-t002)and [Table 3](#medicina-57-00199-t003)list the clinical trial data for the Pfzier/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively. As shown in [Table 1](#medicina-57-00199-t001), the total number of participants in a group, known as n, is represented by a + b for the vaccine group and c + d for the placebo group. [Table 1](#medicina-57-00199-t001), [Table 2](#medicina-57-00199-t002)and [Table 3](#medicina-57-00199-t003)) to calculate relative and absolute measures of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine efficacy. [19](#B19-medicina-57-00199)]. Dividing the EER by the CER equals 1 if the rates do not differ, in which case the RR has the null value 1. RRs below 1 indicate a protective effect and a decreased risk (EER < CER), and RRs above 1 indicate an increased risk (EER > CER). [20](#B20-medicina-57-00199), [21](#B21-medicina-57-00199)], and the natural logarithm (Ln) is used, along with the antilog expressed as an exponent of the base e, to normally distribute the data when calculating the 95% probability. [19](#B19-medicina-57-00199)]. The difference equals zero if the rates do not differ, in which case the ARR has the null value zero. The difference is negative if the EER is higher than the CER. [22](#B22-medicina-57-00199)]. If the ARR CI includes the null value zero, the ARR is not statistically significant. [17](#B17-medicina-57-00199)]. Note that the numerator is multiplied by 100 when the ARR is expressed with a percentage sign. The NNV is also usually rounded up to the next individual. [22](#B22-medicina-57-00199)], again multiplying by 100 in the numerator when the ARR is expressed with a percentage sign. [17](#B17-medicina-57-00199)]. The RRR is calculated by subtracting the RR from the null value 1, or by dividing the ARR by the CER [ [22](#B22-medicina-57-00199)]. [23](#B23-medicina-57-00199)]. Online calculators are also available that compare group proportions [ [24](#B24-medicina-57-00199)] and calculate epidemiological equations [ [25](#B25-medicina-57-00199)], which are useful for measuring vaccine efficacy. [Figure 2](#medicina-57-00199-f002)shows a chart of the present critical appraisal of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine efficacy. Note that the vertical axis of the chart is a logarithmic scale, base 10. [26](#B26-medicina-57-00199)] and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen Biotech Ad26.COV2.S vaccine [ [27](#B27-medicina-57-00199)]. (As this article goes to press, the FDA VRBPAC is scheduled to review the Janssen Biotech vaccine for EUA.) As well, reported efficacy for randomized clinical trials involving any treatment, intervention, disease, disorder, or illness can be critically appraised using clinical epidemiologic tools. In a similar manner, observational studies that report vaccine and other treatment effectiveness in reducing disease incidence within a population can also be critically appraised using clinical epidemiologic tools. 4. Discussion [28](#B28-medicina-57-00199)]. Currently, differences between relative effect measures and absolute effect measures in studies are \"poorly understood by health professionals, and even more poorly understood by patients.\" [ [29](#B29-medicina-57-00199)] In addition, \"...critical appraisal knowledge and skills are limited among physicians,\" and \"use of relative effect measures was associated with greater perceptions of medication effectiveness and intent to prescribe, compared with the use of absolute effect measures.\"[ [29]] [22](#B22-medicina-57-00199)]. Omitting absolute risk reduction findings in public health and clinical reports of vaccine efficacy is an example of outcome reporting bias, which ignores unfavorable outcomes and misleads the public's impression and scientific understanding of a treatment's efficacy and benefits [ [30](#B30-medicina-57-00199)]. Furthermore, the ethical and legal obligation of informed consent requires that patients are educated about the risks and benefits of a healthcare procedure or intervention [ [31](#B31-medicina-57-00199)]. [32](#B32-medicina-57-00199)]. This vaccine efficacy is consistent with a 40% to 60% reduction in influenza reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [ [33](#B33-medicina-57-00199)]. However, critically appraising data from the 2018 review shows an overall ARR of only 1.4%, which reveals vital clinical information that is missing in the CDC report. A 1.4% ARR works out to a NNV of approximately 72 people, meaning that 72 individuals need to be vaccinated to reduce one case of influenza. By comparison, [Figure 2](#medicina-57-00199-f002)of the present article shows that the NNV for the Pfzier-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are 142 (95% CI 122 to 170) and 88 (95% CI 76 to 104), respectively.
