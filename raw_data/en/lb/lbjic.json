Crystal healing can be traced back to ancient Samaria, Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Crystals are mentioned in many religious texts including the Bible, Koran, and others. In 1609, the court physician to Rudolf II of Germany, Anselmus de Boot, theorized that crystals gained their properties through the presence of good or bad angels. Mysticism or scientific theory? Today, there is still a sense of mysticism attached to crystals for some people, but for others, there is a firm scientific theory behind their belief that crystals offer true healing therapy. This is the vibrations theory, and it's based on a fundamental principle of physics, that all matter vibrates on a unique frequency. The belief is that certain crystals vibrate on frequencies that can interact with the frequencies of the human body and heal. Crystal therapy and migraine There are several crystals associated with relieving migraine. To some extent, as with other therapies, different experts will make different recommendations. I go with the most commonly recommended crystals and are recommended by the most established people in the field. Amethyst - Healing for the brain - Strengthens the central nervous system and circulatory system - Relieves fatigue and exhaustion - Relieves headache - Aids in relaxation and relieving stress Rose quartz - Relieves anxiety - Strengthens the central nervous system - Helps relieve pain and headache - Relieves fatigue - Relieves vertigo Lapis lazuli - Vomiting - Vertigo - Pain Rhodochrosite Rhodochrosite used to be recommended for migraine because it's thought to dilate blood vessels, and people mistakenly thought that would be good for people with migraine. Now we know that although vasodilation isn't the first step in the migrainous process, it does usually occur, and it's not something we would want to cause deliberately. Therefore, the use of rhodochrosite is no longer recommended. A complementary and alternative therapy Healing with crystals is gentle and noninvasive. It's not going to cure migraine disease. In my experience, it's not going to be the magic [preventive](/migraine-treatment/prevention-medications) or even [stop a migraine in progress](/migraine-treatment/migraine-medication-relief). Crystal therapy or crystal healing is often called an alternative therapy. I prefer to call it a complementary therapy. I use it in combination with my other treatments; it complements them. Is there science to back it up? Can I show evidence that I have fewer migraines because of these crystals? No. I studied crystal therapy and started using crystals at the same time that I started treatment with my first migraine specialist, and I'm not willing to stop my medications and see if crystals would \"pick up the slack.\" Anecdotally, I can tell you that when I compare times that I've traveled, times when I've forgotten to take my crystals with me, I've had more migraines than times when I've remembered them. Those periods of travel haven't been long enough for the difference in the number of migraines to be what scientists would consider \"statistically significant.\" Still, the evidence is good enough for me. What has my experience been? I can also tell you that my migraine [pain levels](/living-migraine/subjectivity-relativity-pain) do decrease when I use crystals. The pain doesn't stop, but it does decrease. During a migraine, the use of crystals also helps me feel less stressed and relaxed while waiting for my medications to work and/or for the migraine to end. They help me with the fatigue I often experience during the [postdrome](/living-migraine/postdrome-stages) phase. How do I use them? Some ways I use amethyst and rose quartz crystals: - Some of my favorite jewelry is made with amethyst and rose quartz. - There are amethyst and rose quartz on my bed's headboard and on my desk, where I spend most of my day. - There are small amethyst and rose quartz crystals in a soft leather pouch in my purse. - When I have a migraine or headache, I hold an amethyst crystal. What are crystals and are they expensive? In crystal therapy, we mean a naturally occurring stone that's used to heal instead of the form or structure of the stone. Some crystals can be expensive because they're rarer than others. It's not necessary to spend a great deal of money on crystals. In some cases, it's not necessary to spend any money at all. One of my favorite rose quartz pieces is one I picked up myself on a mountain in Colorado. Amethyst, rose quartz, and lapis lazuli are all fairly common stones, so they needn't be expensive. It is recommended that the crystals you choose be \"pure,\" which means that they are good specimens of that one stone, not some that you find that have been cut where two are close together or have veins of other minerals running through them. How do I know which ones are right for me? You can use tumbled, rough cut, naturally formed crystals or cut stones set in jewelry, but it is recommended that stones touch the skin, so keep that in mind if you decide on jewelry. Some people feel that some of us are \"sensitive\" enough to crystals' vibrations that it's best to select crystals in person. When you touch the crystals, you should be able to feel which ones are right for you. There may well be some merit to this, and I have some crystals that I find feel very comfortable in my hand and that I'm quite drawn to. Still, many of us, myself included, don't live in areas where it's easy to find or buy crystals. There are some very reputable online sellers, including some on eBay. I've purchased many of mine on eBay. If you choose to do so, check out the seller's feedback and buy only from established, reputable sellers. Summary Crystal therapy or crystal healing can be an excellent [complementary migraine treatment](/complimentary-and-alternative-therapies) for some of us. Amethyst and rose quartz are the two most commonly used crystals for migraine. Lapis lazuli can also be helpful, especially for vomiting and vertigo associated with migraine. As with any non-traditional treatment, crystal therapy has its detractors, its doubters. Some believe that any positive effects it may have are merely placebo effects. To me, it makes perfect sense that the vibrations of the crystals can interact with our bodies in gentle, healing ways. For those of us who are experiencing the pain, nausea, and other migraine symptoms that crystal therapy can help, does it really matter how it works as long as it works without harming us? I think not. The purpose of the Treatment Series is to share personal experiences with migraine management techniques. Do not start, stop or change any treatment program without the advice of a qualified healthcare professional.
