The practice, based in Sheboygan, is 100 percent virtual. They offer care for both acute and chronic symptoms. \"In every way that you may be stressed and suffering, there is a homeopathic remedy that is available to stimulate your inner healer,\" says Bundy. Homeopathic medicine works by leveraging the body's natural vitality through utilizing remedies which are micro-doses of substances found in nature that stimulate the body's own healing response. \"Healing response is achieved through careful matching of the totality of your symptoms\u2014physical, emotional, mental and spiritual\u2014with a corresponding homeopathic remedy. In contrast to conventional medicine, with homeopathic care your vitality is strengthened and your overall resilience is increased,\" Keul explains. The word homeopathy comes from Greek words meaning \"similar suffering\". Keul affirms that any substance that can produce symptoms of illness in a healthy person can initiate a healing response in an ill person whose symptoms are similar. Bundy cites an onion as an example of the \"like cures like\" homeopathic philosophy: \"Have you ever cried while slicing an onion? The homeopathic remedy made from onion, allium cepa, is used to treat symptoms of hay fever with burning and watering eyes, sneezing and a runny nose. Like treats like. They are the brilliant adaptive mechanisms by which your system is working to right itself.\" The acute conditions treated by Fieldwork Homeopathy include those such as influenza, food poisoning, ear infections and sprains. Acute care sessions are 30 minutes, either virtual or via telephone, and include four days of follow-up care to ensure clients and their loved ones are on track to a healthy resolution. Remedies for acute care are available at local food cooperatives or natural health food stores. Keul and Bundy can also ship remedies directly to clients. They offer a free 15-minute discovery call to those interested in learning more about homeopathy. Keul and Bundy also use homeopathic medicine to address chronic, longer-term conditions with symptoms related to recurrent migraines, hormonal disturbances, arthritis, autoimmune disorders, anxiety, depression, insomnia, behavioral disorders and hyperactivity. Care for chronic or longer-lasting issues includes an initial two-hour virtual session in order to do a deep dive into a client's current symptoms, as well as to learn the client's health and family history. The World Health Organization (WHO) cites homeopathy as a leading complementary medicine effectively used across the globe. It is an integral part of the medical systems in England, France, Germany, Switzerland, India, Russia, and much of Central and South America. \"Homeopathy works with you to access your own inner healer in any type of challenge, from acute pain to chronic illness to emotional struggle,\" Keul concludes. \"You are reminded of what you already know, and the innate power you already embody. Homeopathy can help you wherever you are on your journey.\" Fieldwork Homeopathy is based in Sheboygan. For more information, call 507-321-1148 (Beth Bundy) or 507-301-5904 (Ashley Keul); email "}
