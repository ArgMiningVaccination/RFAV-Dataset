The India n Health Service (IHS) GPRA report includes measures for clinical prevention and treatment, quality of care, infrastructure, and administrative efficiency functions. The IHS Clinical Reporting System (CRS) is a Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) software application designed for national reporting as well as Area Office and local monitoring of clinical GPRA and developmental measures. CRS was first released for Fiscal Year (FY) 2002 performance measures (as GPRA+) and is based on a design by the Aberdeen Area (GPRA2000). This manual contains the FY 2014 clinical performance measure definitions and logic for the CRS 2014 Version 14.1 software. CRS is the reporting tool used by the IHS Office of Planning and Evaluation to collect and report clinical performance results annually to the Department of Health and Human Services and to Congress. Each year, an updated version of CRS software is released to reflect changes in the logic descriptions of the different denominators and numerators. Additional performance measures may also be added. Local facilities can run reports as often as they want to and can also use CRS to transmit data to their Area. The Area Office can use CRS to produce an aggregated Area report for either annual GPRA or Area Director Performance reports. CRS produces reports on demand from local RPMS databases for both GPRA and developmental clinical measures that are based on RPMS data, thus eliminating the need for manual chart audits for evaluating and reporting clinical measures. To produce reports with comparable data across every facility, the GPRA measures definitions was \"translated\" into programming code with the assistance of clinical subject matter experts. CRS uses predefined taxonomies to find data items in the RPMS Patient C are Component (PCC) to determine if a patient meets the performance measure criteria. Taxonomies contain groups of codes (e.g., diagnoses or procedures) or site -specific terms. Each performance measure has one or more defined denominators and numerators. Administrative and clinical users can produce reports for selected measures at any time to: Identify potential data issues in their RPMS, i.e., missing or incorrect data .

For information on system setup, available reports and steps for running the reports, and performing Area Office functions, refer to the CRS Version 14.1 User Manual. Clinical Reporting System (BGP) Version 14.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2014 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic May 2014 2 2.0 Performance Measure Logic This section provide s the following information for each performance measure topic: For Government Performance and Results Act ( GPRA ) measures, the measure description is provided as stated in the Indian Health Service ( IHS) Annual Performance Report to Congress Definitions o f all denominators and numerators for each performance measure topic Detailed description of the logic for the denominator and numerator, including specific codes, fields, taxonomies , and/or values searched Key changes to logic from the previous year, if any Description of which patients and information are contained on the patient list Performance measure source and past IHS performance, if any, and IHS or Healthy People (HP) 2020 targets for the performance measure Report examples Patient list example s Note: All report examples and patient list examples used in this section were produced from \"scrubbed\" demonstration databases and do not represent individual patient data. 2.1 2BPerformance Measure Logic Basics 2.1.1 12BCRS Denominator Definitions Each performance m easure topic has one or more defin e denominators and numerators. The denominator is the total population that is being reviewed for a specific measure. For the National GPRA /GPRAMA Report, only one denominator for each topi c is reported. These denominators are pre -defined, based on the Active Clinical Population definition. For the Selected Measures reports for local use (CRS Version 14.1 User Manual, S ection 5.11), multiple denominators may be reported to provide a complete pi cture of clinical performance. There are also additional options available to further refine denominator definitions. Clinical Reporting System (BGP) Version 14.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2014 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic May 2014 3 2.1.1.1 85BDenominator Definitions for National GPRA Reporting The Active Clinical population is the denominator definition used as the basis for most GPRA measures. This denom inator was developed in FY 2003 specifically for clinical performance measures because it is more representative of the active clinical population. Prior to FY 2003, the GPRA User Population denominator definition was used for national reporting, similar to the agency's IHS User Population definition. The Active Clinical population for the National GPRA /GPRAMA Report is defined by the following criteria: Patients with the name of \"DEMO , PATIENT \" or who are included in the Resource and Patient Management Sys tem (RPMS) Demo/Test Patient Search Template (DPST option located in the PCC Management Reports, Other section) will be automatically excluded from the denominator. Patient must have two visits to medical clinics in the past 3 years.

Clinical Reporting System (BGP) Versi on 14.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2014 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic May 2014 11 2.1.2 13BPerformance Measure Logic Example Cancer Screening: Mammogram Rates : During FY 2014, achieve the target rate of 54.7% for the proportion of female patients ages 52 through 64 who have had mammography screening within the las t 2 years . For CRS, the GPRA measure definition is defined as: Denominator (total number of patients evaluated): Active Clinical female patients ages 52 through 64, excluding those with documented history of bilateral mastectomy. (The clinical owner of the measure has determined based on current medical guidelines that \"eligible\" women are defined as ages 52 through 64.) Numerator (those from the denominator who meet the criteria for the measure): patients with documented mammogram in past 2 years . For the programmer, the Mammogram measure is described in terms of the following logic : 1. Begin with the Active Clinical population definition . Exclude any patients with the name of \"DEMO , PATIENT .\" Exclude any patient records that are included in the RPMS Demo/Test Patient Search Template. Exclude any patients with a date of death in the Patient Registration file. Exclude any patients who do not have value 01 (AI/AN) in the Beneficiary field in Patient Registration file. Exclude any patients whose Community of Residence is not included in the site's defined GPRA Community Taxonomy for this report. For the remaining patients, search Visit files for the 3 years prior to the selected report end date; exclude any patient records whose visits do not meet the \"two medical clinics\" definition . 2. From these patients, identify the subset that are female and at least age 52 on the first day of the current report period and less than age 65 on the last day of the report period. Clinical Reporting System (BGP) Version 14.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2014 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic May 2014 12 3. Exclude patients with documented bilateral mastectomy by searching the V Procedure file for Procedure Codes ICD-9: 19200, 19220, 19240, w/modifier of 50 or 09950 any time before the end of the report period; or who have two separate occurrences for either CPT Codes 19300- 19307, or old two different dates of service or on the same date of service if the codes include both a right side modifier (RT) and left side modifier (LT) . 4. For these patients (the denominator), check for a mammogram in the past 2 years in the following order: a. Check V Radiology or V CPT for the CPT Codes: 77059, code), G0204, G0202 b. Check the Pu rpose of Visi t file (V POV) for a diagnosis of ICD-9: V76.11 Screening M ammogram for High R O 793.89 Other Abnormal Fi ndings O n Radiological E of B reast or ICD-10: R92.0, R92.1, R92.8, Z12.31. c. ICD -9: BH02ZZZ . d. Check t he Women's Health Tracking package for documentation of a procedure called Mammogram Screening, Mammogram Dx Bilat, or Mammogram Dx Unilat and where the result does not have \"ERROR/DISREGARD\" . If a visit with any of the specified codes is found, the patient is considered to have met the measure, and the program check s the next patient. 2.1.3 14BAge Ranges Unless otherwise noted, for the purposes of CRS reports, the age of a patient is calculated at the beginning of the report period. For example, for a report period of July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014, Jane Doe is defined as age 74 if her birth date is June 10, 1939, even though she becomes age 75 during the report period. Clinical Reporting System (BGP) Version 14.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2014 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic May 2014 13 2.1.4 15BStandard Health Care Codes 2.1.4.1 87BCurrent Procedural Terminology Codes One of several code sets used by the healthcare industry to standardize data, and allow for comparison and analysis. Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) was developed and is updated annually by the American Medical Association, and is widely used in producing bills for services rendered to patients. CPTs include codes for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and specify information that differentiates the codes based on cost. CPT codes are the most widely accepted nomenclature in the United States for reporting physician procedures and services for federal and private insurance third- party reimbursement. CRS searches for CPT and other codes as specified in the logic definition to determine if a patient meets a denominator or numerator definition. 2.1.4.2 88BInternational Classification of Disease Codes One of several code sets used by the heal thcare industry to standardize data. The International Classification of Disease (ICD) is an international diagnostic coding scheme. In addition to diseases, ICD also includes several families of terms for medical -specialty diagnoses, health status, disabl ements, procedure, and reasons for contact with healthcare providers. IHS currently uses ICD, Ninth Revision (ICD -9) for coding , but will be switching to ICD -10 in 2014. CRS searches for ICD and other codes as specified in the logic definition, to determine if a patient meets a denominator or numerator definition. 2.1.4.3 89BLogical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC\u00ae). A standard coding system originally initiated for laboratory values, the system is bein g extended to include non- laboratory observations (electrocardiograms, vital signs, etc.). Standard code sets are used to define individual tests and mitigate variations in local terminologies for laboratory and other healthcare procedures, for example, Gl ucose or Glucose Test. IHS began integrating LOINC values into RPMS in several pilot sites in 2002. Refer to the CRS Version 14.0 Technical Guide for a list of specific LOINC codes included in each LOINC taxonomy.

Patients with either (1) evidence of the disease, (2) a contraindication, or (3) a documented NMI refusal Logic Description Age definition: Age of the patient is calculated at the beginning of the Report Period. Therefore the age range will be adju sted to 7 through 23 months, which makes the patient between the ages of 19 through 35 months at the end of the Report Period. Because IZ data comes from multiple sources, any IZ codes documented on dates within 10 days of each other will be considered as the same immunization. Active Immunization Package Patients denominator definition: Same as User Pop definition except includes only patients flagged as active in the Immunization Package. Note : Only values for the Current Period will be reported for this denominator since currently there is not a way to determine if a patient was active in the Immunization Package during the Previous Year or Baseline Periods. Dosage and types of immunization definitions: 4 doses of DTaP: (1) 4 DTaP/DTP/Tdap; (2) 1 DTaP/DT P/Tdap and 3 DT/td; (3) 1 DTaP/DTP/Tdap and 3 each of Diphtheria and Tetanus; (4) 4 DT and 4 Acellular Pertussis; (5) 4 Td and 4 Acellular Pertussis; or (6) 4 each of Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Acellular Pertussis. 3 doses of Polio: (1) v OPV; (2) 3 IPV; or (3) combination of OPV and IPV totaling 3 doses. One dose of MMR: (1) MMR; (2) 1 M/R and 1 Mumps; (3) 1 R/M and 1 Measles; or (4) 1 each of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella. 3 doses of Hep B 3 or 4 doses of HIB , depending on the vaccine administered 1 dose of V aricella 4 doses of Pneumococcal 1 dose of Hepatitis A 2 or 3 doses of Rotavirus, depending on the vaccine administered 2 doses of Influenza Clinical Reporting System (BGP) Version 14.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2014 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic May 2014 77 NMI refusals, evidence of disease, and contraindications for individual immunizations will also count toward meetin g the definition, as defined below. Note : NMI refusals are not counted as refusals; rather, they are counted as contraindications. For immunizations that allow a different number of doses (e.g. 2 or 3 Rotavirus): To count toward the numerator with the sm aller number of doses, all of the patient's vaccinations must be part of the smaller dose series. For example, for a patient to count toward the Rotavirus numerator with only 2 doses, all 2 doses must be included in the 2- dose series codes listed in the Rotavirus definition. A patient with a mix of 2- dose and 3- dose series codes will need 3 doses to count toward the numerator. An exception t o this is for the HIB vaccine: if the first 2 doses are CVX code 49 , then the patient only needs 3 doses (even if the third dose is included in the 4- dose series). Each immunization must be refused and documented separately. For example, if a patient has an NMI refusal for Rubella only, then there must be an immunization, contraindication, or separate NMI refusal for the Measles and Mumps immunizations. For immunizations where required number of doses is greater than ( >) 1, only one NMI refusal is necessary to be counted in the numerator. For example, if there is a single NMI refusal for Hepatitis B, the patient will be in cluded in the numerator. For immunizations where required number of doses is greater than (>)1, only one contraindication is necessary to be counted in the numerator. For example, if there is a single contraindication for HiB, the patient will be included in the numerator. Evidence of disease will be checked for at any time in the child's life (prior to the end of the Report Period.) To be counted in sub- numerator A, a patient must meet the numerator definition and have a REF refusal in PCC or a Parent or P atient Refusal in the IZ program for any of the immunizations in the numerator. For example, if a patient refused Rubella only but had immunizations for Measles and Mumps, the patient would be included in sub- numerator A .

Note : NMI refusals are not counted as refusals; rather, they are counted as contraindications. Each immunization must be refused and documented separately. For example, if a patient has an NMI refusal for Rubella only, then there must be an immunization, contraindication, or separate refusal for the Measles and Mumps immunizations. For immunizations where required number of doses is greater than (>)1, only one NMI refusal is necessary to be counted in the numerator. For example, if there is a single NMI refusal for Hepatitis B, the patient will be included in the nume rator. For immunizations where required number of doses is greater than ( >)1, only one contraindication is necessary t o be counted in the numerator. For example, if there is a single contraindication for H PV, the patient will be included in the numerator. Evidence of disease will be checked for at any time in the child's life (prior to the end of the Report Period). To be counted in sub- numerator A , a patient must have evidence of disease, a contraindication, or an NMI refusal for any of the immunizations i n the numerator.

BMI calculation definition: CRS calculates BMI at the time the report is run, using NHANES II. For age 18 and under, a height and weight must be taken on the same day any time during the Report Period. For 19 through 50, height and weight must be recorded within last 5 years, not required to be on the same day. For over 50, height and weight within last 2 years, not required to be recorded on same day. Overweight but not obese is defined as BMI of 25 through 29 for adults 19 and older. Obese is defined as BMI of 30 or more for adults 19 and older. For ages 2 -18, definitions are based on standard tables. Refusals include REF, NMI, and UAS (unable to screen) and must be documented during the past year. For ages 18 and under, both the height and weight must be refused on the same visit at any time during the past year. For ages 19 and older, the height and weight must be refused during the past year and are not required to be on the same visit. Patients whose BMI either is greater or less than the Data Check Limit range shown in the BMI St andard Reference Data Table in PCC will not be included in the report counts for Overweight or Obese.

A Body Mass Index report can be run from your PCC Management Reports menu. This report can be run for all patients or for a specific template of patients that has been pre -defined with a QMan search. The BMI report will provide you with patient height, weight, date weight taken, BMI and NHANES percentile. 2. Recent guidelines indicate that height for ad ults must be taken at least once every 5 years, rather than once after age 18. Your BMI rates may be lower than anticipated because of height data that is over 5 years old. Clinical Reporting System (BGP) Version 14.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2014 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic May 2014 154 3. If height and weight measurements are being recorded as cm/kg vs. in/lbs ensure providers are noting they are cm/kg and that data entry is entering the measurements correctly in PCC, as shown below.

Patients with percentile. ( GPRA Numerator ) above the 85th percentile. Logic Description BMI calculation definition: All patients for whom a BMI could be calculated and who are between the ages of 2 and 5 at the beginning of the Re port Period and who do not turn age 6 during the Report Period are included in this measure. Age in the age groups is calculated based on the date of the most current BMI found. For example, a patient may be 2 years of age at the beginning of the time peri od, but is 3 years old at the time of the most current BMI found. That patient will fall into the age 3 group. CRS looks for the most recent BMI in the Report Period. CRS calculates BMI at the time the report is run using NHANES II. A height and weight mus t be taken on the same day any time during the Report Period. The BMI values for this measure are reported differently than in Obesity Assessment since this age group is children ages 2 through 5, whose BMI values are age -dependent. The BMI values are categorized as Overweight for patients with a BMI in the 85th to 94th percentile and Obese for patients with a BMI at or above the 95th percentile. Patients whose BMI either is greater or less than the Data Check Limit range shown below will not be included in the report counts for Overweight or Obese.

Blood pressure definiti on: CRS uses mean of last 3 Blood Pressures documented during the Report Period. If 3 BPs are not available, uses mean of last 2 BPs. If a visit contains more than one BP, the lowest BP will be used, defined as having the lowest systolic value. The mean Sy stolic value is calculated by adding the last 3 (or 2) systolic values and dividing by 3 (or 2). The mean Diastolic value is calculated by adding the diastolic values from the last 3 (or 2 ) blood pressures and dividing by 3 (or 2). If the systolic and dias tolic values do not both meet the current category, then the value that is least controlled determines the category.

Exclusions: When calculating all BPs (using vital measurements or CPT codes), the following visits will be excluded: 1) Se rvice Category H (Hospitalization), I (In Hospital), S (Day Surgery), or O (Observation); 2) Clinic code 23 (Surgical), 30 (ER), 44 (Day Surgery), C1 (Neurosurgery), or D4 (Anesthesiology). Blood pressure definition: CRS uses mean of last 3 BPs documented during the Report Period. If 3 BPs are not available, use the mean of last 2 BPs. If a visit contains more than 1 BP, the lowest BP will be used, defined as having the lowest systolic value. The mean Systolic value is calculated by adding the last 3 (or 2) systolic values and dividing by 3 (or 2). The mean Diastolic value is calculated by adding the diastolic values from the last 3 (or 2 ) blood pressures and dividing by 3 (or 2). If the systolic and diastolic values do not both meet the current category, then the value that is least controlled determines the category. For the BP documented numerator only, if CRS is not able to calculate a mean BP, it will search for CPT 0001F, 2000F, 3074F through 3080F or POV ICD-9: during the Report Period.

Logic Description Key STIs are Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, HIV/AIDS, and Syphilis. Key STI diagnoses are defined with the following codes. STI ICD and Other Logic for Identifying Patients Diagnosed with Key STI : Any patient with one or more diagnoses of any of the key STIs defined above during the pe riod 60 days prior to the beginning of the Report Period through the first 300 days of the Report Period. Logic for Identifying Separate Incidents of Key STIs : One patient may have one or multiple occurrences of one or multiple STIs during the year, except for HIV. An occurrence of HIV is only counted if it is the initial HIV diagnosis for the patient ever. Incidents of an STI are identified beginning with the date of the first key STI diagnosis (see definition above) occurring between 60 days prior to the beginning of the Report Period through the first 300 days of the Report Period. A second incident of the same STI (other than HIV) is counted if another diagnosis with the same STI occurs 2 months or more after the initial diagnosis. A different STI diagnosis that occurs during the same 60- day time period as the first STI counts as a separate incident. Example of Patient with Multiple Incidents of Single STI: Visit Total Incidents 08/01/ 13: Patient screened for Chlamydia 08/08/ 13: Patient with Chlamydia 1 10/15/ 13: Patient diagnosed with Chlamydia 2 Clinical Reporting System (BGP) Version 14.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2014 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic May 2014 255 Visit Total Incidents 10/25/1 3: Follow -up for Chlamydia 2 11/15/ 13: Patient diagnosed with Chlamydia 2 03/01/ 14: Patient diagnosed with Chlamydia 3 Denominator Logic for Needed Screenings : One patient may need mult iple screening tests based on one or more STI incidents occurring during the time period. To be included in the needed screening tests denominator, the count will be derived from the number of separate STI incidents and the type(s) of screenings recommended for each incident. The recommended screenings for each key STI are listed below. STI Screenings screenings that are further evaluated for contraindications. The following are reasons that a recommended screening is identified as not needed (i.e., contraindicated). 1. The patient has a documented STI dia gnosis corresponding to the screening type in the same time period. For example, a patie nt with both a Chlamydia and a gonorrhea diagnosis on the same visit does not need the recommended Chlamydia screening based on the g onorrhea diagnosis. 2. Only one screen ing for each type of STI is needed during the relevant time period, regardless of the number of different STI incidents identified. For example, if a patient is diagnosed with Chlamydia and Gonorrhea on the same visit, only one screening each is needed for HIV/AIDS and Syphilis. 3. A patient with HIV/AIDS diagnosis prior to any STI diagnosis that triggers a recommended HIV/AIDS screening does not need the screening ever. Numerator Logic : To be counted in the numerator, each needed screening in the denominator must have a corresponding laboratory test or test refusal documented in the period from one month prior to the relevant STI diagnosis date through 2 months after the STI incident. Key STI screenings are defined with the following codes.

Clinical Reporting System (BGP) Version 14.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2014 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic May 2014 295 Logic Description Age is calculated at the beginning of the report period. To be included in the denominator, patients must have at least two prescriptions for that particular type of medication on two unique dates of service at any time during the Report Period. Medications must n ot have a comment of RETURNED TO STOCK. For the Non -warfarin anticoagulants measures, the two unique dates of service must be at least 180 days apart and the patient must have received greater than 60 days supply of the medication during the Report Period. Patients who received one or more prescriptions for warfarin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or heparin (defined by medication taxonomy BGP PQA WARFARIN) will be excluded from the denominator. The Index Prescription Start Date is the date when the m edication was first dispe nsed within the Report Period. For all measures except Non -warfarin anticoagulants, this date must be greater than 90 days from the end of the Report Period to be counted in the denominator. The medications in the measures are defi ned with medication PDC numerator: Proportion of days covered = # of days the patient was covered by at least one drug in the class / # of days in the patient's measurement period. Clinical Reporting System (BGP) Version 14.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2014 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic May 2014 296 Measurement Period definition: The patient's measurement period is defined as the number of days between the Index Prescription Start Date and the end of the Report Period. When calculating the number of days the patient was covered by at least one drug in the class, if prescriptions for the same drug overlap, the prescription start date for the second prescr iption will be adjusted to be the day after the previous fill has ended. Note : If the medication was started and then discontinued, CRS will recalculate the # Days Prescribed by subtracting the prescription date (i.e. visit date) from the V Medication Discontinued Date. Example: Rx Date=11/15/ 2014, Discontinued Date=11/19/ 2014, Recalculated # Days Prescribed=4. Example of Proportion of Days Covered : Repo rt Period: Jan uary 1 through December 31, 2014 1st Rx is Index Rx Start D ate: 3/1/ 14, Days Rx covers 2nd Rx: 5/26/ 14, Days Supply=90 Rx covers through 8/27/ 3rd Rx: 9/11/ 14, Days Supply=180 Gap = (9/11/ 14 - 8/27/ 14) = 15 days Rx covers patient through 3/8/ 15 Patient's measurement period: 3/1/14 through 12/31/ 14 = Days Days patient was covered: 3/1/ 14 through 8/27/ 14 + 9/11/ 14 through 12/31/ 14 = 292 Days PDC = 292 / 306 = 95% For each Gap numerator: CRS will calculate whether a gap in medication therapy of 30 or more days has occurred between each consecutive m edication dispensing e vent during the Report Period. A gap is calculated as the days not covered by the days supply between consecutive medication fills. Example of Medication Gap greater than or equal to ( >=) 30 Days : Report Period: Jan uary 1 through December 31, 2014 1st Rx: 4/1/ 14, Days Supply=30 Clinical Reporting System (BGP) Version 14.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2014 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic May 2014 297 Rx covers patient through 4/30/ 14 2nd Rx: 7/1/ Days Supply=90 Gap #1 = (7/1/ 14 - 4/30/ 14) = 61 days Rx covers patient through 9/28/ 14 3rd Rx: 10/1/ 14, Days Supply=90 Gap #2 = (10/1/ 14 - 9/28/ 14) = 2 days Rx covers patient through 12/29/ 14 Gap #1 greater than or equal to ( >=) 30 days, therefore patient will be included in the numerator for that medication.

Therefore, this measure may include patients up to 25 mont hs old if they were within the eligible age range on the first day of the report period, and will not include any patients that were born after the first day of the report period. Patients born after the first day of the report period will be included in t he following report period. Infant feeding choice definition: The documented feeding choice from the file V Infant Feeding Choice that is closest to the exact age that is being assessed will be used. For example, if a patient was assessed at 45 days old as half breastfed and half formula and assessed again at 65 days old as mostly breastfed, the mostly breastfed value will be used since it is closer to the exact age of 2 months (i.e., 60 days). Another example is a patient who was assessed at 67 days as m ostly breastfed and again at 80 days as mostly formula. In this case, the 67 days value of mostly breastfed will be used. The other exact ages are 180 days for 6 months, 270 days for 9 months, and 365 days for 1 year. In order to be included in the age -specific screening numerators, the patient must have been screened at the specific age range. For example, if a patient was screened at 6 months and was exclusively breastfeeding but was not screened at 2 months, then the patient will only be counted in the 6 months numerator.
