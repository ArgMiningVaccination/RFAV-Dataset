Come away filled and refreshed God hasn't left you to do this alone. You'll be amazed how His Word speaks to your challenges and draws you closer to Him Daily encouragement, served up your style Just 10 minutes can make all the difference in your day. We help you spend focused time interacting directly with your Bible -- not devotional readings, not someone else's thoughts -- just doing your own deep study in God's Word. Be part of a community In 2012, Pam Forster blogged a 30-day Bible study challenge, with a small group of moms studying along. Seven years later, and thousands of women have enjoyed these short Bible studies, learned new study skills, and formed a larger community at Mama's Refill and in the Facebook group, [Bible Study for Busy Mamas](https://www.facebook.com/groups/487622067967767/?ref=group_cover). \"Pam Forster is so encouraging and presents the word of God in a way that lifts up, provides hope, directs, and gently corrects. Each lesson is short enough for this busy mom to complete, yet deep enough for the Holy Spirit to speak to me through every single lesson.\" -- Jess \"I love how this study is laid out, so simple to follow. Pam does a great job of guiding towards digging deeper, but in a very manageable way for busy moms. The activities for the kids are very engaging, and we have been enjoying them.\" -- Heather Your Study Leader leader Pam Forster Since her teenage years, Pam has loved studying the Bible and sharing that love with others. She met her husband John at a Bible study, and together they raised and home educated six children. Long ago, while desperately trying to keep three crazy little boys in line, she discovered that the Bible had a wealth of answers to her child-training questions. The fruits of her study include For Instruction in Righteousness, the Bible Study for Busy Mamas series, and other books from Doorposts Publishing. When Pam isn't writing, she plays the piano for church, enjoys calligraphy, watercolor, and gardening, tries to keep up with all her adult children, and enjoys hugs and kisses from her many grandchildren.
