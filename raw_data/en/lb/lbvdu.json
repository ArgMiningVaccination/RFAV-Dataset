Clearlight would like to remind users that this should not be taken as direct medical advice, and you should always consult a licensed health practitioner before making any significant changes to your lifestyle or existing pain treatment regimen. If you've been exposed to and tested for high levels of heavy metals and toxins, and you're wanting to exponentially increase the detoxification process, the niacin protocol may be the solution you're looking for. The niacin sauna protocol is an extreme measure to boost the [infrared sauna detoxification](https://infrared-sauna.co.nz/blog/benefits-of-a-sauna-detoxification) prowess, and therefore it's important that before beginning, you talk to your health physician about this protocol and any pre-existing medical conditions. How niacin vitamin B3 works for sauna detoxification is very similar to how far-infrared wavelengths work. Just like the infrared, niacin targets the fat cells and causes them to disperse, releasing heavy metals and toxins that have been stored, back into the bloodstream, allowing the detox method of the body to occur. Before we talk about the niacin protocol, it's important to know what exactly niacin is. Niacin is another name for vitamin B3 and has many different functions in the human body. Niacin helps convert food into energy and is commonly found in a [range of food sources](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/niacin-vitamin-b3/) such as whole grains, nuts, meat, and fish. More interestingly, another function of niacin is to [increase detoxification](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6862571/), and the body's physiological response taking niacin [skin flushing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19691622/), known as the niacin flush. A niacin flush is a physiological response after ingesting niacin that occurs due to the niacin reaction to cells in the body that induces [vasodilation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19691622/) in capillaries (widening of blood vessels), causing blood to flow to the surface of the body and causing red, sometimes sore, or itchy irritations on the skin usually in the face and upper body. Reaction times differ from person to person and will usually occur between 5-10 minutes after ingesting and last for about 20-30 minutes, although it can sometimes last up to an hour. Controlled doses of niacin between 50mg - 200mg are safe to ingest and may cause the niacin flush response. Amounts of up to 5000mg have been used in studies to detoxify soldiers in the [Gulf War,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6862571/) sufferers of Agent Orange, and even first responders to 9/11. For your everyday sauna user, we recommend staying within the 50-200mg range depending on your results and responses. Let's take a look at the niacin sauna detox protocol. What you will need to do in the niacin detox sauna protocol is: Ensure you have been eating and will continue to eat a nutritional and healthy diet a few days before you begin the protocol, during the length of time you continue the protocol, and after you finish the protocol. During your session, toxins will be released at many different places throughout your body. If you've eaten fibre-rich foods in the last 16 to 24 hours, the body has a better ability to remove different toxins through your digestive system. Not all toxins are thus removed through your sweat, but the digestive system is sometimes even more important as a detoxification pathway. Removing toxins from your body is essential. Different types of toxins play a major role in many different lifestyle-based diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and blood vessel and heart conditions. In the best case, avoiding the ingestion of toxins and heavy metals in your foods will lower your overall toxic load and in conjunction with the protocol, will have you as toxic-free as can be. Pre-heat your Clearlight Infrared\u00ae Sauna to your desired temperature. Your intention here is to sweat, so put it to a temperature you are using to, enjoy, and get the best results out of. Your sauna will be pre-heating for about 20-30 minutes before you get in, so make sure you set aside ample time for the entirety of the protocol. Take a small dose between 50mg - 100mg of niacin, ground up, on an empty stomach with about 4-8oz of purified water. The amount of niacin you take will be determined by the niacin flush reaction you have, so starting slowly and monitoring your reaction is important. If you do not flush within 10-30 minutes, that may mean you need to have more to first get a response. It's important to note that some people may not flush until they are in the sauna, so always start slow and monitor how you feel. For niacin to have its effect, you'll need to ingest it 20-30 minutes prior to your infrared sauna session. This gives ample time to begin step 4. While your sauna is warming up, and you're awaiting the niacin flush response, you need to engage in 20-30 minutes of moderate to high-intensity exercise to begin moving the blood, activating your lymphatic system, and inducing a sweat before you get into your sauna. If you cannot engage in moderate to high-intensity exercise, just perform a slow-cardio exercise. If you're in good shape, you can push yourself quite hard. Do keep in mind though that exercise before your infrared sauna session places more stress on your body, so only combined the two when you've adequately recovered. If not, then a relaxing gentle walk or bike ride does wonders. Take a quick, warm shower after your workout to rinse off any sweat. Do not put anything on your skin other than water. The niacin will have begun and the metals and toxins will have begun to detox through your skin. Make sure you are clean from water and dry off with a towel. Enter your Clearlight Infrared\u00ae Sauna after 20-30mins of exercise. Your sauna will be at your desired temperature and you should be red to the skin from the niacin flush response. If you're tired, light-headed, or too dizzy from your workout, rest before entering your pre-heated sauna and always stay in your means of safety. While in your sauna, use your towel to gently remove the sweat from your skin as often as possible. Be careful not to hurt your skin as it may be tender from the niacin flush. Throughout your sauna session, it's essential to ask yourself, \" [What should I drink during a sauna](https://infrared-sauna.co.nz/blog/how-much-should-i-drink-after-sauna)?\" The answer is to consistently hydrate by consuming water or an electrolyte-rich beverage, replenishing vital minerals and maintaining optimal hydration levels. Stay in your sauna for 25-60 minutes depending on your tolerance. After your sauna session, wipe yourself down with a clean towel, find somewhere to rest, and take 2-4 capsules of activated charcoal. Activated charcoal is used as a toxin binder, and you can learn more in this article about [toxin binders](https://infrared-sauna.co.nz/blog/a-powerful-tool-to-support-detoxification-post-sauna-toxin-binders). Rinse off in a cold shower. Taking a 1-minute cold shower allows the toxins that weren't taken up by the towel to be removed from your skin. You can learn in this blog about how the use of [cold after a sauna](https://infrared-sauna.co.nz/blog/how-to-use-cold-to-enhance-your-sauna) raises the body's ability to detox. Relax in a calm and safe space, rehydrate yourself with your electrolyte drink, and ensure you take your multivitamins. The excessive sweating in the protocol will deplete you with many salts, electrolytes, nutrients, and minerals, so it's extremely important to replenish your levels. Be careful that some multivitamins may be harsh on your empty stomach, so take some healthy food before having them. Avoid proteins for a 1-2hrs after your sauna sessions. Make sure to measure your responses, both of the niacin on a session-by-session basis, but also your overall heavy-metal and toxin levels over a long period of time. Conducting a niacin protocol twice a week will provide you with sufficient results if you can monitor and measure them. Otherwise, your evidence for the results will only be anecdotal based on how you feel and not quantifiable. Remember, the reason to embark on this protocol is because of a high level of heavy metals and toxins in your system. The goal should be to detoxify, and the best measure to remain toxin-free is to lower your exposure through lifestyle choices. Repetition, measuring, and building a healthy lifestyle is the most important part of the protocol.

All the steps in the niacin protocol on an individual basis work to detoxify the body, and when combined, create a compounding effect. Eating a healthy, balanced diet of organic and non-processed foods minimises the initial intake of many toxins and heavy metals, thus doing so will stop the amount introduced from rising at a natural rate. Of course, toxins come from many places, not just foods, and completely removing toxic exposure in today's life is near impossible. Exercise also engages the lymphatic system, and the sweat found from exercise has been seen to have higher trace amounts of synthetic pyrethroids, while sweat from a Clearlight\u00ae Sauna has been seen to have higher trace amounts of organophosphates.

Yes, in general, the niacin flush is good for someone who is in need of niacin supplements, has a niacin deficiency or needs niacin therapy. However, the niacin sauna detox protocol may not be for everyone as it is an extreme measure of sauna detoxification that requires tolerance and guidance for a measurable health goal. This is because large doses of supplemental niacin can cause side effects. If you have high levels of toxicity, possibly the niacin flush and sauna protocol may help you detoxify. However, we recommend not taking niacin if you have no reasons to use niacin supplements. Vitamin B3, also known as niacin or nicotinic acid, is essential for maintaining a healthy nervous system, skin, and digestive system. It also helps the body convert food into energy. Nicotinic acid is made from animal and plant sources from the amino acid tryptophan, and niacin supplementation is often used to help lower cholesterol and triglycerides, and it may also have other benefits such as improving brain function and reducing inflammation. If you are taking niacin supplements, the recommended daily allowance for vitamin B3 (niacin) varies depending on age and gender. For adult males, it is 16 mg/day, and for adult females, it is 14 mg/day. Pregnant or breastfeeding women may require higher doses. Like all dietary supplements, niacin supplements should be consulted with your medical professional. In general, it is safe to take niacin equivalents every day if you stick to an adequate intake. However, taking very large doses of niacin can cause side effects. Niacin deficiency can cause a condition called pellagra, which is characterised by skin rashes, digestive problems, and mental confusion. A deficiency of niacin is usually caused by a lack of dietary intake, such as in people who eat a diet lacking whole grains, nuts, and meat. It can also be caused by certain medical conditions or medications that interfere with niacin absorption. The tolerable upper intake level (UL) for niacin is 35 mg/day for adults. Taking more than this amount can cause liver toxicity, gastrointestinal problems, and other side effects. Taking high doses of niacin can cause symptoms such as skin flushing, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and gastrointestinal problems. There is no definitive answer to this question, as it depends on individual preferences and health goals. Some people prefer flush niacin because they believe the flushing effect helps them to feel more alert and energised. However, others prefer no-flush niacin because they find it more comfortable and easier to tolerate. Not everyone who takes niacin will experience a flush. Some people are more sensitive to niacin than others, and the severity of the flush can vary depending on the dose and the individual's overall health. There are several strategies that can help to reduce the severity of a niacin flush. These include taking a lower dose of niacin, taking niacin with food, and gradually increasing the dose over time to allow the body to adjust. Niacin, or vitamin B3, is an essential vitamin for many biological functions within the body. While the niacin flush may be uncomfortable for some, it is relatively safe and can act as an agent to trigger a niacin detox protocol. Taking regular saunas while doing the niacin detox protocol can help to open up your pores, allowing your body to release more toxins to create an even greater effect. Overall, this holistic approach of using niacin is quite powerful and effective in cleansing impurities from the body.
