The Governor's Office of Planning and Budget has attempted to present the most currently available annual data in this report. However, the most current year for which data are available at publication time for Georgia in Perspective varies considerably. For example, national data from feder- al agencies frequently have a two year lag time betwe en occurrence of events being tr acked and publication of data, due to the amount of time required to compile and publish national su mmary data for 50 stat es. Georgia state agency data are generally available for the most recently completed fiscal year; however, for some types of data the compilation time is greater fo r such reasons as fiscal closeout.

During the 1960s, Georgia's population grew by 16.3% followed by growth rates of approximately 19% during each of the succeeding two decades. The fastest pace of growth occurred in Georgia during the decade between 1990 and 2000, ranking it 6th in popula- tion growth among the 50 states. Growth increased by 26.4%, twice the national average rate of 13.2%. The overall population growth rate in Georgia for the decade between 2000 and 2010 was 18.3%. During the most recent decade, the growth rate peaked at 2.6% between 2005 and 2006. The high growth rate between 2005 and 2006 was due in part to migration following Hurricane Katrina. 02,000,0004,000,0006,000,0008,000,00010,000,00012,000,000 1900 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010Number of PersonsGeorgia's Population, 1900 -2010 Source: U.S. Census Bureau Source: U.S. Census Bureau In 2007, Georgia's population growth slowed in response to changing econom- ic conditions, reaching the lowest point (1.0%) in 2010. Between 2010 and 2012 Georgia added 205,197 new residents. Despite the 2nd lowest growth rate in more than a decade (1.1%), the state was the 4th fastest growing in the nation. Between 2010 and 2011, 3 of Geor- gia's metropolitan statistical areas ranked among the country's 25 fastest growing areas: -Hinesville -Fort Stewart ranked 1st, with a 4.1% growth rate, -Warner Robins ranked 8th with a growth rate of 2.2%, -Savannah ranked 16th with a growth rate of 2.0%, and -Fort Stewart and Warner Robins metropolitan areas are home to large military installations. 1.0% 0.7%1.8% 1.1% 0.0%0.5%1.0%1.5%2.0%2.5%3.0%Annual Growth RatePopulation Annual Growth Rate: United States and Georgia, 2000 -2012 United States GeorgiaA G ROWING GEORGIA GEORGIA IN PERSPECTIVE 9 During the last decade, Georgia, North Carolina, and Florida registered annual growth rates exceeding 1.5%. Alabama and Tennessee experienced the slowest growth rates in the region. The slowdown in population growth that occurred in the latter part of the last decade persisted into the first two years of the current decade. Population growth rates between 2010 and 2012 are well below the average annual growth rates experienced by southeastern states and the nation as a whole during the prior decade. During the last decade, Georgia and North Carolina experienced the highest growth rates in the region. In the current decade, Georgia's population grew at the 2nd fastest rate among the southeast- ern states. Population growth rates between 2011 and 2012 among the southeastern states ranged from 1.2% in Florida to 0.4% in Alabama. Population change occurs due to natural increase (number of births minus number of deaths) and net migration (people moving into the area minus people moving out). Since the shift in economic conditions in 2007, natural increase has become a larger contributor to population growth regionally. Overall, between 2000 and 2009 natural increase accounted for 45% of the state's population growth. Between 2011 and 2012, natural increase was the driving force in Georgia's population growth, accounting for 56.1% of the population increase. Migration represented more than half of the population growth in 4 of the 6 southeast states (Florida, South Caroli- na, North Carolina and Tennessee) between 2011 and 2012. Natural increase was the major contributor to growth in only 2 of the region's states (Alabama and Georgia).

However, as a per- centage of the total population, the white population declined between 2000 and 2010, from 62.7% to 55.9%. Blacks represent the second largest race group in Georgia, comprising 30% of the total population in 2010, a small increase from 28.4% in 2000. The Hispanic population experienced the fast growth between 2000 and 2010, nearly doubling from 429,976 to 853,689 during that decade. Asians represented the second fastest growing group, increasing 83.6% between 2000 and 2010. The number of persons indicating that they were of 2 or more races increased from 1.2% in 2000 to 1.6% in 2010. The Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander population increased from 3,146 to 5,152 over the last decade. Age Distribution and Population by Race White Asian Black or African American American Indian/ Alaskan Native Two or more races Hispanic Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Other Georgia had the 6th youngest popula- tion among the 50 states in 2010, with a median age of 35.3 years, and more than one-quarter of the population (25.7%), was under the age of 18 in 2010. Georgia's older population continues to increase; residents who are over the age of 65 years account for 10.7% of the total population, an in- crease of 31.4% since 2000. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that, by 2030, the population aged 65 and over will double to 71 million people nationwide. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 4 out of 5 seniors in the United States have 1 chronic health condition and half have 2 or more conditions.

The 2006 -2010 ACS data indicates that the percentage of households with residents who speak English less than very well ranges from 4 counties with 0% to 6 counties with more than 10% of households (Echols, Whitfield, Gwinnett, Hall, Atkinson, and Clayton). Spanish is the primary language spoken in 4 of Georgia's counties (Atkinson, Hall, Whitfield, and Echols) with high proportions of households with residents who do not speak English well. Clayton and Gwinnett counties have the greatest diversity of languages spoken among their residents. While Spanish is the primary non -English language spoken, approximately one -quarter of limited English proficient residents speak an Asian language.

Despite the temporary dip, Georgia experienced an overall 26.5% increase in per capita income between 2000 and 2011, from $28,541 to $36,104. National- ly, income increased at a faster pace during this period (37.4%). Although Georgia's per capita income lags behind the national average, the state has the 14th lowest cost of living among the 50 states. Income among Georgia's counties varies considerably, from $23,887 in Hancock County to $81,629 in Forsyth County. Forsyth and Fayette counties rank among the top 50 highest income counties in the country. Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is the total value of goods and services produced by a state per resident. In 2000, Georgia's per capita real GDP ($40,076) was very similar to the national average ($39,775). Nationally, per capita GDP generally increased until 2007, while in Georgia GDP remained fairly stable. As a result, there was a widening gap in GDP between Georgia and the nation as a whole. GDP declined steeply between 2008 and 2009 both nationally and in Georgia, in response to the economic recession, followed by a period of stabilization. The most current figures indicate Georgia ($37,270) lagged behind the nation ($42,070) in GDP in 2011.

There were gains, however, during 2010 and 2011. Although Georgia ranks 36th for median household income among the states, the state's median household income of $45,973 is the highest among southeast states. More than half of Georgia's population, 53.8%, is in the prime workforce ages between 25 and 64 years old.

The thresholds vary by family size. Georgia's poverty rate, 19.1% in 2011, ranked 5th highest among the 50 states, and higher than the national rate of 15.9%. The poverty rate has increased both nationally and in Georgia since the mid - 2000s. In Georgia, the poverty rate increased from 14.4% in 2005 to 19.1% in 2011. 11 of Georgia's 159 counties had poverty rates above 30% in 2010: Stewart, Calhoun, Atkinson, Clay, Dougherty, Bulloch, Clarke, Wheeler, Hancock, Burke, and Telfair. A G ROWING GEORGIA 14 GEORGIA IN PERSPECTIVE During the early part of the last decade, Georgia's unemployment rate was below the national average. However, since August 2007, the state's unemployment rate has exceeded the national average every month. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Georgia's unemployment rate peaked in late 2009 at 10.5%, but has since decreased and was 8.5% in November 2012. Annual unemployment rates vary considerably at the local level. Two of Georgia's counties registered average annual unemployment rates below 7% in 2011: Oconee and Miller. Five counties had rates exceeding 15% during that same year: Telfair, Warren, Chattahoo- chee, Jenkins, and Hancock.

The recent decline in homeown- ership rates began in 2006 nationally and in 2007 in Georgia. Homeownership rates in Georgia were slightly higher than the national rate in all but one year during the period between 2000 and 2011. Atlanta -Sandy Springs -Marietta had the 19th highest foreclosure rate among metropolitan areas in August 2012, however, foreclosures were down 22.3% compared to a year earlier.

Median housing values in Georgia were slightly below national levels, during the last decade, but the gap widened during the middle part of the past decade. Median rent in Georgia's 35 most populous counties ranged from $416 per month in Walker County to $908 in Forsyth County in 2011 according to the Census Bureau. Georgia has the 6th highest foreclosure rate in the nation, which has resulted in declining housing values. As of August 2012, there were 9,478 foreclosure filings in Georgia, representing 1 in every 431 housing units. The August figure, however, represents a decline in filings statewide, compared to June 2010 when there were 12,037 filings.

The recession and housing foreclo- sures have impacted the construction industry, which lost more than 58,000 jobs between 2001 and 2011. Employment in the manufacturing industry decreased by 28.6% between 2001 to 2011. In contrast to construction and manu- facturing, the finance, professional and business services sector remained relatively stable during the period between 2001 and 2011, increasing by 1.9%.

Fine particles can be emitted directly from smoke or formed in the atmosphere from emissions from sources such as power plants, industrial, and mobile sources. Fine particulate matter is less than 2.5 microns in diameter. Portions of Georgia, including Macon, Atlanta and Rome, have been in \"non - attainment status\" for PM -2.5. Non - Attainment occurs when the area in question does not meet the air quality standard set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. PM-2.5 concentrations declined in Georgia by 35% between 2000 and 2011, from 17.22 to 11.19. Despite fluctuations over the past decade, ozone levels have decreased from 0.094 parts per million of volume of air in 2000 to 0.074 in 2011. The number of days the Air Quality Index exceeded 100 in the Atlanta metropolitan area has also fluctuated over the past decade, from a high of 81 in 2000 to a low of 15 in 2009. The Clean Air Campaign in Georgia estimates that by using commute alternatives, Georgians reduce the amount of pollutants released into the air by 1,800 pounds per day. Commute alternatives include vanpools, carpools, teleworking and public transit. The Georgia Clean Air Campaign offers financial incentives to Georgians who use commute alternatives, including commuter cash and prizes as well as carpool rewards.

During the five -year period between 2008 and 2012, evening peak hour speed did not meet the Georgia Depart- ment of Transportation (GDOT) target in 2 years (2008 and 2012). GDOT estimated that the annual cost of congestion statewide in 2010 was $2.49 billion, a decrease of 19.4% since 2005, when the cost was estimated at $3.09 billion. One of the ways GDOT is working to reduce highway congestion is through use of Highway Emergency Response Operators (HERO). HERO units clear traffic incidents that delay traffic in metro- politan Atlanta. Average HERO response time was 13.0 minutes in September 2012. Passenger trips per transit hour re- flects the average number of unlinked passenger trips per revenue hour that trains and buses are running and are available to carry passengers in a given year. An increase in passenger trips per transit hour equates to an increase in the transit system effectiveness. The number of passenger trips per transit service hour in the Atlanta metro- politan area decreased over the past decade by 16.9% for the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), from 20 to 15 and by 25% for non-MARTA transit services, from 53 to 44.

Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities provided housing vouchers for 648 people with mental illness in FY 2012. More than 3 out of 4 (76.2%) Georgia's adult mental health consumers in 2011 reported being positive about services received, higher than the national average of 70.5%. 1.7 1.8 1.9 1.7 13.515.216.117.018.1 18.217.717.2 15.814.116.117.017.8 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011Rate per 1,000 PopulationMental Health Utilization Rates: Georgia, 2003 -2011 Hospital Utilization Community Utilization Total Utilization rate 12.8%13.9%15.1% 12.7%13.9%16.0% 0%2%4%6%8%10%12%14%16%18% 2001 2005-2006 2009-2010Percentage of Children 0 -17 YearsPercent of Children Ages 0 -17 Years with a Special Health Care Need: United States and Georgia, 2001, 2006, 2010 United States GeorgiaA H EALTHIER GEORGIA 38 GEORGIA IN PERSPECTIVE Infections caused by pneumococci are a major cause of death and disease globally. Pneumococcal vaccinations in Georgia are given year round and are administered only once after the age of 65 years. Some adults with weakened immune systems may receive more than one dose over their lifetime. Pneumonia and meningitis are the most common manifestations of invasive pneumococcal disease. Bacteria spread in the respiratory tract to cause ear infection, sinusitis or recurrent bronchitis. The highest rate of pneumococcal disease occurs in the elderly and young children and affects those suffering from chronic conditions and weakened immune systems. 61.8% of elderly Georgians were vaccinated against pneumococcal disease in 2010, the 3rd lowest rate among the states. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Immunization Survey All children attending day care or school are required to be vaccinated against: diphtheria, polio, measles, mumps and rubella, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Hepatitis B, varicella, as well as pneumonia and pertussis. To overcome barriers to vaccination, Georgia's public health departments: -Remind parents when their children's vaccinations are due -Offer extended clinic hours -Provide vaccinations on a walk -in basis -Distribute educational materials on immunization. In 2011, Georgia ranked 5th nationally for the percentage of children 19 -35 months of age who were vaccinated. Georgia ranks 1st among the six southeast states for the percentage of children vaccinated.

Low birthweight is the leading cause of death within the first months of life for infants. Babies born at low birthweight face an increased risk of physical and developmental health problems. Georgia's low birthweight rate has increased over the last decade, from 8.9% in 2002 to 9.7% in 2010. During that time, the state's rate remained above the national rate. Five of Georgia's counties had high percentages of babies born at lowest birthweight between 2006 and 2010: Taliaferro, Quitman, Terrell, Randolph, and Ben Hill. Counties with the lowest rates were Echols, White, Dawson, Brantley, and Fayette. Beginning in 2011, Georgia imple- mented a Medicaid waiver, Planning for Healthy Babies, intended to improve birth outcomes. Source: Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, National Center for Health Statistics In 2010, Georgia ranked 13th nationally for the rate of teen births per 1,000 fe- males aged 15 -19 years, and ranked 4th highest among its southeast neighbors. Georgia's teen birth rate is consistently higher than the national rate. In 2010, Georgia's rate was 41.4 compared to the national rate of 34.2. The teen birth rate has steadily de- clined both nationally and in Georgia since 2007. Children born to teen mothers are more likely to have increased health and behavioral problems and poor school performance (Child Trends 2012). Educating expectant mothers about smoking cessation during pregnancy, prenatal care, eating right and appropri- ate weight gain can help deter low birth- weight. Socioeconomic factors must also be considered; low birthweight babies and teen mothers are more likely to use Medicaid and state services.

In 2011, 15% of Georgia's high school students were obese, compared to 13% nationally. Georgia ranked 9th with re- spect to the percentage of high school students who were obese in 2011. The percentage of Georgia's high school students who are obese in- creased from 11% in 2003 to 15% in 2011. Georgia's SHAPE Initiative has provid- ed 21 schools with a total of $87,000 for projects to reduce obesity among the state's children. In 2013, the Georgia State Health Ben- efit Program coverage was expanded to include primary care and dietitian ser- vices for children age 3 -18 years with a diagnosis of obesity. Georgia's Department of Public Health (DPH) defines obesity as having a body mass index (BMI) of 24.9 or greater. Many factors, including poor diet and physical inactivity have contributed to the rise in both adult and youth obesity. Georgia's DPH estimates the annual cost of obesity in the state at $2 billion annually. Obesity increases the risk of many diseases and health conditions, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, osteoarthritis, dyslipidemia and some cancers. Despite fluctuating over the past dec- ade, the percentage of Georgia's adults who are obese increased 11.3%, from 26.6% in 2003 to 29.6% in 2010.

Georgia's high school students rank 20th among their peers nationally on the percentage who smoke. The percentage of Georgia students who have tried smoking declined be- tween 2003 and 2011, 28% among mid- dle school students and 22% among high school students. Tobacco use in adolescence is associ- ated with other risky behaviors including sexual behavior and alcohol and drug use. In 2005, Georgia banned smoking in all public places, except bars or restau- rants that do not serve children, mandat- ed separate hotel rooms for smokers, and required workplaces to have sepa- rate ventilation for smokers. Approximately 1.3 million adults in Georgia smoke cigarettes. The percentages of smokers fluctuat- ed over the past decade. Georgia saw a reduction in the proportion of adults that smoke from 22.8% in 2003 to 17.6% in 2010. However, rates in Georgia and nationally increased in 2011 to 21.2%. A 2010 study prepared by the Pennsyl- vania State University College of Medi- cine estimated that smoking accounted for $2.9 billion in direct medical expendi- tures in Georgia. Adult smokers lose an average of 16 years of life compared to adult non - smokers, and 1 out of 6 Georgians die annually from smoking related illnesses. Tobacco use during pregnancy can cause premature births, sudden infant death, and stillbirths, in addition to changes in fetal brain and nervous sys- tem development.

Like diabetes, cardiovascular disease can be moderated by living a healthier life and understanding what risk factors influence an individual's likelihood of developing the disease. Total expenditures for heart conditions nationally exceeded $107 billion in 2010 and hypertension accounted for an addi- tional $42 billion. Nearly 21,000 Georgians died of cardi- ovascular disease in 2010, representing 30% of all deaths during that year. The lowest rates were registered in Towns, Fayette, Rabun, DeKalb, and Gwinnett counties. The highest cardiovascular disease death rates were reported for Montgomery, Jeff Davis, Wilkinson, Treutlen, and Upson counties. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Behavioral Risk Surveillance System In 2010, 9.7% of Georgia adults were diabetic compared to 8.7% nationwide. The percentage of adult Georgians with diabetes declined slightly from a high of 10.1% in 2007 to 9.7% in 2010. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 25.8 million people have diabetes, the leading cause of blindness and kidney failure. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey estimates the national expenditures for the treatment of diabetes exceeded $51 billion in 2010; 10% of the cost was paid for by Medicaid. Diabetes is a disease with serious com- plications and can lead to premature death. However, those living with the disease can control the disease and re- verse the course of the disease through proper nutrition, regular physical activity and well -managed treatment plans.

Mammograms screen for breast cancer and allow for early detection. When de- tected early, especially when the woman exhibits no other signs or symptoms of the cancer, her survival rate increases by as much as 30%. Mammograms are recommended bien- nially for women over 40 years of age and annually for those over the age of 50. The percentage of women 40 years and older who have had a mammogram in the previous two years in Georgia fluc- tuated within a narrow range between 2000 and 2010, ranging from a high of 78.9% to a low of 74.5%. Georgia wom- en were screened at a slightly higher rate in 2010, (77.2%) compared to the nation as a whole (75.2%).

Georgia ranked 4th among the 50 states with respect to the percentage of women having a pap test within three years in 2010 (86.6%). The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the primary risk factor for cervical cancer, however, a woman's age and genetic factors also play a role.

Colorectal Cancer Screening and Cancer Mortality Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Behavioral Risk Surveillance System Colorectal cancer screenings are rec- ommended for both men and women over the age of 50. Colon cancer is detected through co- lonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy and fecal occult blood test. Polyps in the co- lon detected by these tests can be re- moved and prevent the onset of cancer or allow for earlier, aggressive treatment. In men, colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer deaths, after lung and prostate cancers. It is estimated that as many as 60% of deaths from colorectal cancer could be prevented if all men and women over the age of 50 years were screened routinely for colorectal cancer (CDC). Among cancers that affect men and women, colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer -related death in the United States (CDC).

Students respond to questions that assess comprehension of literary and informational text. In 2011, Georgia exceeded the national average in 4th grade reading for the first time since testing began in 1992. Since 2002, reading scores for 4th graders have increased 3%, from 215 to 221. In 2011, 1 out of 3 (34%) of Georgia's 4th grade students were reading below basic level, and 2 out of 3 (66%) were reading at or above basic level. The No Child Left Behind Act required states to participate in the biennial Na- tional Assessment of Educational Pro- gress (NAEP) tests for 4th and 8th grade reading and mathematics to provide a national comparison of student academic progress. The National Center for Education Sta- tistics administers NAEP to elementary and secondary students in various sub- ject areas. Four of the nine total subject areas are reported at the state level in- cluding mathematics. Both private and public school children are assessed, alt- hough, only public school data are avail- able for state comparisons. Georgia's 4th grade students have been steadily closing the gap with the national average math scores. In 2011, Georgia 4th grade students scored 19 points high- er in mathematics than in 2000. Note: NAEP scores range from 0 to 500.

In 2011, 8th grade students scored 13 points higher in mathematics compared to the 2000 NAEP scores. However, 8th grade mathematics stu- dents lag behind the national average by 5 points, with a score of 278. In 2011, 8th grade students scored 4 points higher in mathematics compared to 2002. The lag between Georgia's student reading scores has narrowed, from 5 points in 2002 to 2 points in 2009 and 2011. 8th grade reading score trends in Geor- gia are similar to the national trend of a slight decline in scores between 2003 and 2005, followed by improvements each year, beginning in 2007.

Georgia's dropout rate declined 47% between the 2000 -2001 and the 2010 - 2011 school years, from 7.2% to 3.7%. Georgia has the 19th highest dropout rate among the states. Research indicates that chronic school truancy is an indicator of whether a stu- dent will dropout before graduating from high school. The National Dropout Prevention Cen- ter has identified best practices for reduc- ing the number of students dropping out of school. These best practices include use of incentives and sanctions, family involvement, and creating a supportive environment for students. In 2012, the U.S. Department of Edu- cation published graduation rates based on the 2008 formula meeting federal education regulations that permits uni- formity across states. The new formula tracks the percentage of 9th grade stu- dents who graduate within 4 years. Nationally, Georgia ranks 44th in high school graduation among all states. Among the southeastern states, gradu- ation rates in 2011 ranged from a low of 67% in Georgia to a high of 86% in Ten- nessee.

The largest number of child abuse and neglect reports are received from Georgia's schools. In the early part of the last decade, the number of reports of child abuse and neglect received by DFCS climbed steeply. Abuse and neglect reports peaked in 2004 at 101,563 but has declined steadily to 63,547 in 2011. In 2011, 65 of Georgia's children died as a result of child maltreatment, a rate of 2.61 per 100,000 children, higher than the national rate of 2.10. 85,564 63,547 50,00060,00070,00080,00090,000100,000110,000 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011Number of Reports Child Abuse and Neglect Reports: Georgia, 2002 -2011 Substantiated Open 31.7% Substantiated Closed 3.5%Unsubstantiated Protective Cases Investigated by Determination: Georgia, 2011 Source: Georgia Department of Human Services, Division of Family and Children Services More than half of the 21,148 reports of suspected child abuse and neglect in Georgia investigated by DFCS in FY 2011 were substantiated (55%). Nearly 7,000 substantiated cases of abuse and neglect were serious enough to warrant on -going services be provided to the family. The maltreatment rate per 1,000 children in Georgia declined from 14.1 in 2007 to 7.4 in 2011. Neglect is the most frequent type of maltreatment identified in Georgia. In 2011, 64.3% of Georgia's substantiated cases involved this type of maltreatment. More than one out of three of Geor- gia's maltreatment victims (34.5%) are under the age of four years. In 2011, nearly 3 out of 4 (72.3%) perpetrators of substantiated abuse and neglect are parents, followed by other relatives (10.2%), and non -biological parents (5.8%).

Substantiated cases of abuse and neglect are opened by DFCS for on - going CPS action when the level of risk for recurring maltreatment is high or moderate. The monthly number of CPS cases in Georgia fluctuates considerably. Overall, the number of active cases declined 71.7% between 2004 and 2011, from 28,815 to 8,163. Active CPS cases have declined largely in response to the utilization of diversion. \"Diversion\" is an option DFCS uses to assist families when the safety of children is not in question, emphasiz- ing a strength -based, prevention -driven, community response to vulnerable children and families. DFCS refers diverted families to resources available in their communities. The monthly number of children that were in out of home care by DFCS in Georgia decreased 72.3% between July 2004 and September 2012, from 28,815 to 7,979. During FY 2012, there were a total of 13,921 children in DFCS legal custody. More than one -quarter of children in DFCS custody (29.9%) in September 2012 were under the age of 4 years. In September 2012, nearly half (47%) of children in out of home placement were placed with their siblings, and only 4.3% of these children were placed in institutions. In 2011, the majority of children (63.1%) leaving out of home placement returned home, and 74.8% of the children reunified with their families, returned home in less than 12 months.

Reported Offenses and Violent Crime Georgia's rate of reported violent crime increased between 2005 and 2007, fol- lowed by steep declines beginning in 2009. Georgia's violent crime rate was higher than the national average for 3 years during the last decade. In 2011, aggravated assault was the most frequently reported violent crime in Georgia, with a rate of 222.9 per 100,000 residents. Robbery is the se- cond most frequently reported violent crime in the state with a rate of 123.8 per 100,000 residents. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, violent offenders have a greater probability of being arrested compared to property offenders.

In 2011, the Department of Corrections and State Board of Pardons and Parole instituted the Performance Incentive Credit (PIC). PIC provides incentives to offenders to complete educational programs and work productively during incarceration for consideration of up to 12 months early consideration for parole. Criminal justice reform established an accountability court committee to implement new drug and mental health accountability courts. Similar to other states, Georgia has experienced an increase in inmates that are elderly or have chronic conditions.

The three -year felony reconviction rate is the percentage of offenders who are convicted of a new felony resulting in either prison or probation within 3 years of release from prison. The three -year return to prison rate in Georgia increased slightly in the early part of the past decade, from 31% to 33%, but has since declined to 26.7% Georgia's three -year felony reconviction rate has remained fairly stable over the past decade, from a high of 29% in 2001 to a low of 27% in four of the years since 2000. At the end of FY 2012, there were 163,265 probationers, 57,570 inmates, and 24,426 parolees in Georgia. Over the past decade, Georgia's inmate population increased by 32.9%, from 43,324 in 2000 to 57,570 in 2012. The probation and parolee populations increased more slowly between 2000 and 2012. The number of probationers increased by 22.8%, from 132,997 to of parolees increased 10.0%, from 22,211 to 24,426. Discretionary parole decisions can enhance public safety by ensuring that dangerous offenders remain incarcer- ated and by providing the necessary structure and assistance to select offenders who seek to become law - abiding citizens.

Incarceration costs vary based on security level needed to maintain the prisoner; $22,079 per year for close security prisons versus. $15,115 per year for medium security facilities. Parole supervision begins when an offender is released from prison into the community prior to serving their entire sentence. Successful completion of parole supervision* requires an offender to show success in re -integrating into the community via employment, stable residence, program completion, etc. The successful parole completion rate in Georgia increased between 2006 to 2012, from 60% to 72%. Georgia's parolees are considerably more likely to successfully complete parole compared to parolees nationwide. Nationally, the average parole comple- tion rate** has also increased, from 45% in 2006 to 52% in 2012. Note*: Successful parole completion excludes offenders who are revoked, abscond or in jail at the time of discharge from parole. Note**: National completion rates for 2011 and 2012 are estimated. A SAFER GEORGIA GEORGIA IN PERSPECTIVE 79 Reform Plan In 2012, the Georgia State Legislature passed House Bill 1176 to implement recommendations from the Criminal Justice Reform Council. The bill amended state law to focus prison bed utilization for serious offenders. Additionally, the legislation created a grant program for accountability courts that will provide treatment for drug offenders and other offenders with a mental health diagnosis as an underlying factor for their crime as opposed to incarceration. HB 1176 created different classes of offense types for burglary, theft, forgery, and drug crimes. The classes with lower - risk offense types have a new shorter maximum sentence under the statute. This allows for prison space to be afforded to the most serious and/or violent offenders in the future. The above chart, prepared by the state's contactor for prison population projections, Applied Research Services, indicates the projected prison population growth prior to the passage of House Bill 1176 in the \"Baseline\". The new \"HB 1176\" blue trend line indicates how the new statutory policies will reduce prison growth as the sentencing impact occurs on the offenders eventually being sentenced to shorter sentences for the lower level crime classifications. The true impact of the reform is not seen in the prison population until the start of 2015 because that is the approximate time the new offenders convicted under the new statutes will begin to complete their prison sentences. The Criminal Justice Reform Council expanded its role and reviewed Georgia's Juvenile Justice system in FY 2013. This resulted in the formation of two workgroups. One workgroup reviewed Community -Based Options, while the second one focused on Juvenile Dispositions and Out -of-Home Placements. Additionally, the Council continued to examine the adult corrections system. Final recommendations by the Council will be presented to the General Assembly for consideration of appropriate statutory changes.

Georgia has made significant strides on the Prudent Government ranking. In 2003 the state ranked 19th. Since 2007 Georgia has maintained its status as one of the top 5 \"Prudent Government\" states. Freedom in the 50 United States is an annual index of personal and economic freedom published by the Mercatus Cen- ter at George Mason University. The Freedom in the 50 States report ranks states in four main areas: Fiscal Policy, Regulatory Policy, Economic Freedom, and Personal Freedom. In 2011, Georgia ranked 12th in Eco- nomic Freedom, lower than the state's ranking of 10th in 2009. However, the state saw improvement in the Regulato- ry Policies area. Georgia ranked 10th in 2009 and moved up to 8th in 2011. Georgia is the highest ranking south- eastern state in the Mercatus Center's Regulatory Policy rankings and the 3rd highest ranking southeastern state in the Economic Freedom ranking.

The motor fuel tax is projected to rep- resent 5.1% of total state revenue in FY 2013. The motor fuel tax rate is 7.5 cents per gallon plus a 4% sales tax. The state constitution stipulates that motor fuel funds can only be used for the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges. The Georgia State Lottery is also an- ticipated to represent 4.5% of state reve- nue in FY 2013. On average, for every dollar spent on a lottery ticket, 25 cents funds the Pre -K and HOPE programs. Additional sources of revenue include fees and sales (6.0%), other taxes (6.0%), and Tobacco Settlement funds (0.8%). State Revenues Source: Governor's Office of Planning and Budget, Governor's Budget Report Over the decade Georgia experienced 2 periods of flat or declining revenues: 2002 -2004 and 2008 -2010. Since FY 2000, total state revenues have fluctuated, with declines during the early part of the last decade and in FY 2008 in response to dips in the econo- my. Overall during this period, revenues increased 29% from $15.0 billion to $19.3 billion. The state aggressively funded the revenue short fall reserve in FY 2006 and FY 2007, which helped cushion the impact of the latest revenue decline.

Ac- cording to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, shortfall reserve funds enabled states to meet increased ser- vice demand in the face of declining revenues during the recent recession. In 2010, the Shortfall Reserve cap was increased from 10% to 15% of previous year net revenue collections in order to increase Georgia's savings capacity. Reserve sources include state net revenues and agency surpluses. 4% of the net revenue of the preceding fiscal year must remain in the fund. The Gov- ernor is authorized to release reserve funds beyond that amount. The revenue shortfall reserve peaked at $1.5 billion in 2007 and was $378 million in FY 2012.

The better a state's bond rating, the lower the interest it must pay on the bonds it issues. Rating agency analysts use 10% debt service level as standard warning level for states approaching limited fiscal flexi- bility. Georgia has maintained its triple -A bond rating from all three rating agen- cies every year for more than a decade. Currently, Georgia is 1 of 8 states with a triple -A bond rating from all three ma- jor bond rating agencies. The other states are Delaware, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, Utah, and Vir- ginia. Georgia has implemented a formal debt management plan (DMP) to help the State fund ongoing spending priori- ties. Georgia's DMP sets target levels in three areas: Debt Per Capita, Debt Ser- vice to Revenues, and Debt to Personal Income. Georgia's Bond Ratings: 2012 Moody Investor Services Aaa Standard and Poor's AAA Fitch's Investor's Service AAA Without GARVEEs* With GARVEEs* Planning Levels Debt per Capita $1,200 $1,500 Debt Service to Prior Year Revenues 7.0% 8.0% Debt to Personal Income 3.5% 4.0% 2012 -2016 Debt Management Plan Debt Ratio Targets Source: Georgia State Finance and Investment Commission, Debt Management Plan 6.5% 6.2%7.0% 0%1%2%3%4%5%6%7%8%9% 2007 2014Proj 2015Proj 2016Percentage of Debt Service to Revenue Highest Annual Debt Service as % of Prior Year Reciepts Planning LevelHistoric and Projected Annual Debt Service as Percentage of Prior Year Recei pts, FY 2007 -FY 2016 To restrict over -borrowing, Georgia's constitution sets a debt limit at 10% of the prior year's total treasury receipts, and the state's DMP sets 7% as the planning level for debt. Debt service to prior year revenues measures the percentage of revenue dedicated to debt service. Steadily in- creasing revenue and moderate borrow- ing at low interest rates keep this meas- ure within target levels. The 2007 to 2009 recession reduced state treasury receipts. As a result, debt service to prior year revenues exceeded the 7% planning level. The debt service to revenues ratio were 7.2% in 2010 and 7.8% in 2011. To bring the debt service ratio to with- in planning levels, the state's DMP pre- scribes a $800 million general obligation bond borrowing ceiling annually. The plan anticipates that the ceiling, com- bined with increased treasury receipts, will return the debt service ratio below target planning levels by FY 2013. *Note: GARVEE bonds are tax -exempt debt instrument financing mechanisms backed by annual federal appropriations for federal -aid transportation projects. 88 GEORGIA IN PERSPECTIVE A R ESPONSIBLE & E FFICIENT GEORGIA Debt Plan Ratios Source: Georgia State Finance and Investment Commission, Debt Management Plan Source: Georgia State Finance and Investment Commission, Debt Management Plan Debt per capita measures the state debt burden per state resident. Net tax - supported debt per capita is calculated as the total tax -supported debt divided by the population of the state. Figures for the years 2007 through 2011 represent the actual debt per capita. Figures for 2012 -2016 reflect projected debt per capita. Georgia has kept the debt per capita below the target mark. The debt per capita planning level was raised in 2007 from $1000 to $1200 due to rising infrastructure costs. Net tax -supported debt items are debt items supported by the state's tax revenues and are guaranteed by the state. Items which are paid by tax revenues pledged to that payment, such as motor fuel tax pledged to certain State Road and Tollway Authority bonds, are considered tax -supported debt. Debt as a percent of personal income measures the debt burden to Georgians' personal incomes. It is calculated as the amount of tax -supported debt divided by the total personal income of the state's population. Between FY 2007 and FY 2011, the debt as a percentage of personal In- come decreased slightly, despite an 8.8% increase in debt. Debt to personal income most likely remained stable due to overall growth in personal income among Georgia's residents. The state's planning level for debt as percentage of personal income has re- mained at 3.5%. From 2007 -2011, the state debt ratio has ranged from 2.5% to 2.7%. In years FY 2012 to FY 2016, the Georgia State Financing and Investment Commission anticipates the debt as a percentage of personal income will de- crease due to rising personal incomes in the state. $867 $911 $1,200 $650$750$850$950$1,050$1,150$1,250$1,350$1,450 Capita: Georgia, FY 2007 -FY 2016 Debt per Capita Planning Level 2012 2.5% 2.1%3.5% 0.0%0.5%1.0%1.5%2.0%2.5%3.0%3.5%4.0% 2007 2015Proj 2016Debt as Percentage of Personal IncomeHistoric and Projected Debt As Percent of Personal Income, FY 2007 -FY 2016 Debt As % of Personal Income Planning Level 2012 GEORGIA IN PERSPECTIVE 89 A R ESPONSIBLE & E FFICIENT GEORGIA The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) is a standard annual financial report prepared by most gov- ernments. The CAFR includes basic information about the state, the auditor's report, financial statements and a statis- tical section. While the state budget presents the projected expectations and plan of use for state funds over a year, the state CAFR reports the historical use and fi- nancial condition of state government. Georgia created a State Accounting Office on July 1, 2005 to establish statewide standards and practices and align responsibility for the state's finan- cial reports and the accounting system. The time taken to complete the CAFR has decreased from a high of 18 months in 2003 to an approximate completion time of six months for the past 8 years. Source: State Accounting Office and Department of Audits and Accounts Source: Department of Audits and Accounts In the CAFR, the state auditor presents an unqualified or qualified opinion of the report. An unqualified opinion indicates that: - Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) have been applied. - If reporting methods differ from GAAP, methods have been applied appropriately and disclosed. - The report adheres to statutory requirements and regulations. - Material and relevant information is disclosed. Qualifications indicate instances where scope is limited or GAAP has not been applied appropriately. The goal of the State is to achieve an unqualified opinion on the CAFR. The number of qualifications to the CAFR have ranged from a high of 10 in 1998 to 0 in recent years.

More than half (56%) of these separations were voluntary, citing departure for pro- fessional and personal reasons. One in six separations was due to retirement. Involuntary turnover includes reasons such as failure to meet terms of employ- ment, dismissal, and release, and reduc- tions in workforce. There were 2,469 such terminations in FY 2012, or 20% of total separations. Between FY 2010 and FY 2012, resig- nations increased from 43% to 46% while retirements decreased slightly from 18% to 16%. The overall turnover rate among state employees was 16.4% in FY 2012, which is the highest it has been since FY 2008. The DOAS' Risk Management Ser- vices (RMS) manages claims such as workers compensation, property and auto liability claims. The Workers' Com- pensation (WC) program provides bene- fits to employees for compensable work injury or illness. In 2009, RMS introduced the Compre- hensive Loss Control Program (CLCP) to help state agencies address risk caus- es and prevent claims. Since FY 2005, the number of WC claims declined an average of 450 fewer claims per year. The cost of claims have risen about $4.4 million a year, ranging from $54 million in 2006 to $87 million in 2011. Costs have risen due to increases in medical costs, utilization of medical treatments, severity of injuries, and reha- bilitation services and costs.

Continually tracking the health of the state's major IT projects helps identify potential problems and immediately take corrective actions to mitigate the risk of a failed project. Georgia's project delivery effective- ness compares favorably with other governmental entities and the private sector. In FY 2012, Georgia completed three -fourths of state IT projects on time and on budget. According to the Standish Group's 2010 CHAOS Re- port, approximately 1 in 5 (18%) government IT projects and more than 1 in 3 (37%) of all industry IT projects are completed on time and on budget.

The Digital States Sur- vey assesses state use of information and communications technology. The 2012 Digital States survey focus- es on outcomes and assesses how technology is aligned with and being used to achieve the stated policy objec- tives of the Governor. Georgia ranked high among other Southeastern states, with Tennessee being the only state in the region to re- ceive a higher ranking. States graded as a \"B\" are trending up, measure results, and prepare for sustainable operations. The Digital States Survey uses the following criteria: approach consistent with state priorities; return on invest- ment; improvement; innovative solu- tions; effective collaboration.

Broadband speeds vary significantly depending on the particular type and level of se r- vice available. Broadband is an enabling technology for state services. Education, telemedicine and public safety are all greatly enhanced b y broadband technology. The fastest advertised broadband internet speeds tend to be in urban areas. In 2009, GTA was awarded $5.2 million in American Reinvestment Recovery Act funds for broadband data and development. A key component of this project is the creation of regional broadband plans.
