There are many different roads to medical school: the competencies and accomplishments we seek go well beyond your GPA and MCAT scores. NSU MD students have strong foundational science knowledge and academic success; a deep curiosity and passion for solving complex challenges; a teamwork-oriented background that shows their ability to support and lead others; and a genuine caring for people that mirrors our patient-first philosophy. You must have earned a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university in the United States by July 15 of the year you will begin medical school. Your degree may be in the discipline of your choice, as long as you have completed the prerequisite coursework. Academic requirements for admission to the College include adequate preparation in physics, biology, chemistry, biochemistry and mathematics. The following premedical courses are required: - Biology: 2 semesters (or equivalent) with lab. - Biochemistry: With or without lab. - General Chemistry: 2 semesters (or equivalent) with lab. - Organic Chemistry: 2 semesters (or equivalent) with lab. - Physics: 2 semesters (or equivalent) - Mathematics (college level): 1 semester (or equivalent). Calculus is not required. Statistics is acceptable. Advanced Placement (AP) courses will fulfill the prerequisite requirements if the individual courses and credits awarded are detailed on the applicant's college/university transcript. Other suggested courses can include, but are not limited to, Immunology, Anatomy, Physiology, and Genetics. The list of personal attributes that are considered during the admissions process are: Intrinsic motivation to pursue the MD degree Social skills Cultural competence Teamwork Verbal communications skills Written communication skills Ethical responsibility to self and others Reliability and dependability Resilience and adaptability Altruism Capacity for improvement Critical thinking and ability to succeed academically NSU MD does not set a minimum GPA or MCAT for consideration. However, while there are no absolute minimum cut-off scores for either the GPA or MCAT, the MCAT score (highest) and GPA will be used as part of the initial review for screening purposes only. Applicants are required to submit at least three, but no more than four letters of recommendation. - At least one of your letters should be from a professor that has taught you in a science course, and who can adequately speak to both your academic readiness and personal suitability for the pursuit and practice of medicine. - Your remaining letters can come from professors, advisors, clinical research coordinators or preceptors, supervisors, coaches, mentors, and personal and professional colleagues. - Although applicants are granted wide-ranging discretion in selecting evaluators, we strongly advise that you choose writers who know you well, and can speak honestly and knowledgeably as to your character and fitness for entering the field of medicine. (It's best to avoid recommendation letters from close relatives and/or family friends.) - If your premedical advising office provides a committee letter compiling feedback from multiple sources, this letter will suffice to satisfy your letters requirement. All evaluations must be submitted via [AMCAS](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/article/amcas-letter-service/). - These letters of evaluation must be received before you will be invited to complete the secondary application. Once your secondary application is returned to us, your application is considered complete and ready for review.

References: NSU MD students must complete a mandatory immunization form, which must be signed by a licensed health care provider. The form is available at [nova.edu/smc/forms/hpd-immunization-physical](http://nova.edu/smc/forms/hpd-immunization-physical). NSU MD students may be required to upload proof of immunizations to multiple online portals to satisfy the requirements of the affiliated hospital where they rotate. Failure to comply with this policy may result in a student's inability to satisfy the graduation requirements in his or her program. Background Checks NSU MD, a college within NSU Health Professions Division(HPD), require students to submit to background checks. Accepted applicants and students in such programs are required to authorize the NSU Health Professions Division to obtain background check(s) as per adopted policy of March 2011. If the background check(s) reveal information of concern, which the NSU Health Professions Division may deem unfavorable, HPD will request that the individual provide a detailed written explanation of the information contained in this report, along with appropriate documentation (e.g., police reports). Students may also be required to authorize clinical training facilities that they are assigned to by the Health Professions Division to obtain a background check, with the results reported to the clinical training facility. Students with questions concerning background checks should contact their respective college and/or academic program for more information. For programs that require students to submit to background checks, offers of admission will not be considered final until the completion of the background check(s), with results deemed favorable by the NSU Health Professions Division, and where appropriate, by the clinical training facilities. If information received in connection with a background check indicates that the student has provided false or misleading statements, has omitted required information, or in any way is unable to meet the requirements for completion of the program, then the student's admission may be denied or rescinded, the student may be disciplined or dismissed, or his or her enrollment may be terminated. Acceptance to an NSU Health Professions Division program does not guarantee that students with information of a concern will be accepted by clinical training facilities to which they may be assigned. Students enrolled in the NSU Health Professions Division have a continuing duty to disclose any arrest, conviction, guilty or no contest plea, or participation in a pretrail diversion program, or its equivalent, for any criminal offense. Students are required to notify their dean's office within 10 days of any arrest or subsequent conviction, guilty, or no contest plea, or participation in a pretrial diversion program, or its equivalent, for any criminal offense. Health Professions Division 2021-2022 While enrolled at NSU, students have a continuing duty to disclose all of the above, along with any arrests or pending criminal charges within 10 days of any arrest or charges are filed. Students, other than those enrolled in programs within the Health Professions Division, must notify the assistant dean for Student Affairs\u2014or designee\u2014of any arrests or pending criminal charges. A failure to timely disclose any arrests or pending criminal charges may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from NSU. of becoming a doctor or health care pro?
