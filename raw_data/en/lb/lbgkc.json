This article discusses the homeopathy treatment of myasthenia gravis along with the best homeopathic medicine for myasthenia gravis treatment. Myasthenia gravis is a chronic disorder characterized by weakness and rapid fatigue of any of the muscles underyour voluntary control. It's caused by breakdown in the normal communication between nerves and muscles. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that results in progressive skeletal muscle weakness. MG causes rapid fatigue (fatigability) and loss of strength upon exertion that improves after rest. Myasthenia gravis is caused by a defect in the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles. Normally when impulses travel down the nerve, the nerve endings release a neurotransmitter substance called acetylcholine. In myasthenia gravis, antibodies produced by the body's own immune system block, alter, or destroy the receptors for acetylcholine. Homeopathy Treatment & Homeopathic Remedies for Myasthenia gravis [Homeopathy](https://hpathy.com/) treats the person as a whole. It means that homeopathic treatment focuses on the patient as a person, as well as his pathological condition. The homeopathic medicines are selected after a full individualizing examination and case-analysis, which includes the medical history of the patient, physical and mental constitution etc. Following homeopathic medicines have been found effective in many cases of Myasthenia gravis: - Alumina - Conium - Gelsemium - Cocculus - Calcarea carb Plumbum met - Nux vomica - Rhus tox Alumina - Muscular paralysis. - People lack of vital heat, prematurely old people due to debility. - Heaviness, staggering and sluggishness with very bad constipation are the characteristics of the remedy. - Extremities feel paralyzed; leg feels asleep specially when sitting with legs crossed. - Heels feel numb, tenderness in soles, feel soft and swollen. - Inability to walk especially when eyes are open or in daytime.

Cannot lift the fingers. - Weakness of hands and fingers in pianists. - Legs tremble; give way in walking. Debility; paralysis. Plumbum metallicum - Lead paralysis is chiefly of extensors, forearm or upper limb, from center to periphery with partial anaesthesia (loss of sensation) or excessive hyperesthesia(over-excitability) of the nerve, preceded by pain. - Localized neuralgic pains, neuritis. - The blood, alimentary and nervous systems are the special seats of action of Plumbum. - Progressive muscular atrophy. Infantile paralysis. Locomotor ataxia. - Excessive and rapid emaciation. Bulbar paralysis. Important in peripheral affections. - The points of attack for Plumbum are the neuraxons and the anterior horns. - Paralysis of single muscles. Cannot raise or lift anything with the hand. Extension is difficult. - Paralysis from overexertion of the extensor muscles in piano players. - Pains in muscles of thighs; come in paroxysms. Wrist-drop. Cramps in calves. - Stinging and tearing in limbs, also twitching and tingling, numbness, pain or tremor. Paralysis. - Feet swollen. Pain in atrophied limbs alternates with colic. - Loss of patellar reflex. Hands and feet cold. - Pain in right big toe at night, very sensitive to touch Zincum metallicum - The word \"fag\" covers a large part of zinc action. - Poisoning from suppressed eruptions or discharges. - The nervous symptoms of most importance. Impending brain paralysis. - Period of depression in disease. - Pain, as if between skin and flesh. - In chronic diseases with brain and spinal symptoms, trembling, convulsive twitching and fidgety feet are guiding symptoms. - Lameness, weakness, trembling and twitching of various muscles. - Feet in continued motion; cannot keep still. - Transverse pains, especially in upper extremity. - Soles of feet sensitive. Steps with entire sole of foot on floor. Types of Myasthenia gravis Myasthenia gravis can be classified according to which skeletal muscles are affected. Within a year of onset, approximately 85-90% of patients develop generalized myasthenia gravis, which is characterized by weakness in the trunk, arms, and legs. About 10-15% of patients have weakness only in muscles that control eye movement. This type is called ocular myasthenia gravis. Other types of MG include congenital, which is an inherited condition caused by genetic defect, and transient neonatal, which occurs in infants born to mothers who have MG. Congenital MG develops at or shortly after birth and causes generalized symptoms. Transient neonatal MG is a temporary condition that develops in 10-20% of infants born to mothers who have MG. Transient neonatal MG is caused by circulation of the mother's antibodies through the placenta and it lasts as long as the mother's antibodies remain in the infant (usually a few weeks after birth). Incidence and Prevalence of Myasthenia gravis Myasthenia gravis affects approximately 2 out of every 100,000 people and can occur at any age. It is most common in women between the ages of 18 and 25. In men, the condition usually develops between 60 and 80 years of age. Risk factors of Myasthenia gravis - Family history of myasthenia gravis - Newborns and infants of mothers with myasthenia gravis. They show symptoms in 2 to 3 weeks. Symptoms of Myasthenia gravis - Double vision - Loss of normal facial expression - Drooping of eyelids - Difficult swallowing - Weakness of the arms and legs - Difficult clear speech - Dyspnoea or difficult breathing - Decreased functions of arms, legs, and neck muscles - Weakness of intercostal muscles - Impaired gas exchange - Impaired motor movements - Condition gets flared up after a brief period of normal muscle function and aggravated as the muscle is used. Complications of myasthenia gravis - Ocular and facial complications- Difficulty in closing eyes, aspiration, impaired communications and nutrition - Musculoskeletal complications- Inability to perform ADLs and self activities, complications related to immobility, myasthenic and cholinergic crises. - Respiratory complications- Decreased ability to walk, eat, and perform other ADLs, pneumonia - Nutritional complications- Weight loss, dehydration, malnutrition, aspiration. Diagnosis of Myasthenia gravis - Diagnosis mainly depends upon observation of symptoms, physical examination, and history. - Repeated muscle use over a very short period of time that fatigues and then improves with rest suggest a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. - Tests for this neurological condition record the effect of exercise and subsequent rest on muscle weakness. - Electromyography, with repeated neural stimulation, may help confirm the diagnosis. - The classical proof of myasthenia gravis is improved muscle function after an I.V. injection of anticholinesterase drugs. - In myasthenic patients, muscle function improves within 30 to 60 seconds and lasts up to 30 minutes. Long standing ocular muscle dysfunction may fail to respond to such testing. - This test can differentiate a myasthenic crisis from cholinergic crisis caused by acetylcholine over activity at the neuromuscular junction). The acetylcholine receptor antibody titer may be elevated in generalized myasthenia. Conventional Treatment for Myasthenia gravis Myasthenia gravis can be controlled. Some medications (Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as pyridostigmine (Mestinon) and corticosteroids) improve neuromuscular transmission and increase muscle strength, and some suppress the production of abnormal antibodies. These medications must be used with careful medical followup because they may cause major side effects. Thymectomy, the surgical removal of the thymus gland (which often is abnormal in myasthenia gravis patients), improves symptoms in certain patients and may cure some individuals, possibly by re-balancing the immune system. Other therapies include plasmapheresis, a procedure in which abnormal antibodies are removed from the blood, and high-dose intravenous immune globulin, which temporarily modifies the immune system and provides the body with normal antibodies from donated blood.
