The purpose of this care plan is to provide information to survivors and improve communication between health care professionals and patients. This care plan does not substitute health care services or advice provided by professionals. Thank you to the survivors, health care professionals and expert key informants whose insight and knowledge made the development and validation of this care plan possible. Your expertise has helped to address unmet needs in your communities and the stories you have shared have been very empowering. Production of this care plan has been made possible through funding from the Public Health Agency of Canada.

MEDICAL FOLLOW-UP Your Cancer Follow-up Schedule Medical Side Effects Fatigue Memory, Concentration and 'Chemo-Brain' RECURRENCE GENETIC COUNSELING RESOURCES Part 2: Cancer Follow-up and Side Effects After cancer treatment man y survivors experience a wide range of emotions, thoughts and concerns both medical and otherwise. Excitement, for example, can be mixed with anxiety and uncertainty about your future. You may also have many questions about your health and other issues. This care plan will make this time of transition easier - helping you know what to expect in the months and years ahead. This information is not specific to your type of cancer, but references to resources for specific cancer types are available in Part 5. Who Provides Care? Changing health care provid e rs once treatment is over can be challenging and unsettling. Many patients come to rely on their oncologist, for example, and are nervous about leaving his or her care. This transition is necessary, however, to ensure you are cared for in a timely manner. Depending on the situation, you may continue to see an oncologist for follow-up visits, but your long-term care should be managed by your local health care team. Medical Follow-up Medical follow-up includes appointments with medical professionals, physical exams, and various tests (such as CT scans or blood tests). The main goal is to detect new or recurrent disease. Another goal is to determine the effectiveness of the treatments you have already had, or look for side effects. Follow-up provided to patients depends on type of cancer, and the stage. The BC Cancer Agency provides recommendation for follow-up on their website: www.bccancer.bc.ca Follow-up should be discus s ed with your health care professional and often consists of three main categories, though depends on the type of cancer and stage: Your follow up may include: Physical examination (e.g. breast and armpit exam, colonoscopy) Blood work (e.g. tumour markers such as CEA) Diagnostic imaging (e.g. mammogram) Your Cancer Follow-up Schedu le The schedule should be based on BCCA follow-up guidelines - use the list on the left-hand side to navigate ( www.bccancer.bc.ca/HPI/CancerManagementGuidelines/de fault.htm), and advice from your oncolo gist. The dates are a suggested timeline, which your physician may adjust to fit your needs. Stage and recurrence risk level: ____________________________ Procedure/Test Recommended Schedule Target Date Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Beyond Medical Side Effects Treatment for cancer is rapidly changing. With the development of new medications and therapies, it is hard to keep up with all the long-term side effects. Further, every person is unique and so is the side effects that each will experience. Be an active participant in your care and share news of any changes in your health with any member of your health care team. This section covers common side effects, and provides a location for your health care provider to enter anticipated side effects . Treatment-Specific Side Effects Most cancer patients and survivors experience mild, short-term side effects - rarely all of them. Below is a list of the potential side effects from surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. To determine if you are at risk of developing these, or other side effects, talk to you health care provider or refer to the BC Cancer Agency Website. Surgery: side effects depend on location and type of surgery, but some general risks include: Infection Bleeding Pain Nerve damage Functional change (e.g. change in bowel movements, decreased arm mobility) Cosmetic change (e.g. breast removal, neck scar) Chemotherapy: side effects depend on type and dose of chemotherapy, but may include: Tiredness Risk of infection Hair loss Nausea/vomiting Organ damage (e.g. kidney, heart) Very rare risk of second cancer (e.g. leukemia) Radiotherapy: side effects depend on where radiotherapy is targeted and the dose, but may include: Skin irritation Hair loss in area of treatment (e.g. armpit) Pain Fatigue Very rare risk of second cancer Fatigue Fatigue is the feeli ng you may experience when you are mentally or physically tired. Fatigue is one of the more common side effects of cancer treatment. Friends and family may expect your energy levels to return to normal once treatment is over. Fatigue can have many causes and you should be aware of changes in your energy level. If you experience new or worsening symptoms talk them over with any member of your health care team. Fatigue can also be caused by dehydration, diarrhea, anemia, fever, infection, nausea, vomiting, pain and depression. To help manage your fatigue, try planning your days in advance and avoid busy schedules. If you are going to have a full day, be sure to set time aside to eat and rest between activities. Light exercise can also help improve energy levels and enhance your quality of life. Most instances of fatigue will improve with time. Sudden or severe fatigue can be caused by an infection or it could be due to the cancer treatment you received. If you suffer from this type of serious fatigue, be sure to discuss it with your health care team. Memory and Concentration Memory or concentration problems are less common side effects of cancer treatment. Some survivors do notice minor changes. Trouble remembering can also be due to the fatigue and stress caused by the cancer treatments. These issues should be discussed with any member of your health care team. Resources Getting Help for Fatigue www .cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@editorial/documents/document/acspc- 031607.pdf Fatigue www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003088.htm Possible Causes of Memory P roblems: Medications Chemotherapy drugs that weaken your immune system (Immunosuppressive drugs), antibiotics, steroids, pain management drugs, nausea/vomiting drugs, and other cancer- related symptoms can affect your memory and ability to think clearly. Symptoms caused by these medications can improve over time. Metabolic Problems Certain cancers can produce hormones that affect the brain. The thyroid gland, liver and kidneys can affect mood and mental ability if they are not working properly. Pay attention to your body and discuss any concerns you have with your health care team so that they may help alleviate some of these symptoms. Unhealthy Diet A well balanced diet is an important part of feeling well and being healthy. Making sure you are eating well can help eliminate some factors that contribute to memory and concentration problems. Symptoms of Memory Problems in Cancer: Difficulty understanding c o mplex information Easily distracted Exhausted by tasks requiring concentration Not remembering what you are talking about Forgetting what you are doing Forgetting phone numbers Asking questions only to repeat them 15 minutes later For information and tips on memory & concentration see Appendix A All of the above side effects are just examples of potential side effects. Yo u r health care provider will provide a list of side effects you could experience, and we encourage you or your health care provider to fill out the tables below. You can also refer to Part 5 of this document to find resources specific to your type of cancer. Current Side-Effects My current side effects My side effect management plan 1. 2. 3. 1. 2. 3. Recurrence It is important to discuss r ecurrence and/or attend follow-up appointments with a member of your health care team. If you are concerned about cancer returning, your health care team member will answer your questions or you can call the health link BC line that is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Dial 8-1-1 . If you experience a second cancer in the same area as the first, this is called a recurrence. When a recurrence of the original cancer occurs in a new area, it is called a metastasis. If the recurrence shows up in multiple areas, it is known as metastases. Cancer can reoccur in different areas, depending on the type and stage of your cancer. You may ask your health care provider to discuss your risk. What is the chance I will have a recurrence? Your oncologist, or another m ember of your health care team, will evaluate your risk for recurrence which depends on factors such as your age, the stage of your cancer, and the treatment you received. Discuss these risks with a member of your health care team. Signs and symptoms of recurrence depend on the location, which you should discuss with your health care provider, and then fill out the following: Signs and Symptoms to Watch for and When to Seek Advice Sign/Symptom Who to Contact 1. 2. 3. 1. 2. 3. Genetic Counseling Some tumors are considered as hereditary cancer meaning they can be passed down from family member to family member. Talk with your doctor about hereditary cancer and whether genetic testing is needed for you or your family. The following criteria indicate the possibility of a hereditary cancer: Unusually early age of cancer diagnosis Multiple cancers in a single individual The same cancer type diagnosed in close relatives Cancers occurring in multiple generations of a family Occurrence of rare tumors Uncommon tumor histology Rare cancers associated with birth defects Geographic or ethnic populations known to be at high risk of hereditary cancers For information on Genetic Counselling please visit: BC Cancer Agency - www.bccancer.bc.ca/PPI/Prevention/Hereditary/default.htm Resources (Hard copies of these reso u rces should be available from your health care team) Treatment Specific Side Eff ects /head2right BC Cancer Agency - www.bccancer.bc.ca/PPI/CancerTreatment/default.htm /head2right BC Cancer Agency (By Cancer Type) - www.bccancer.bc.ca/PPI/TypesofCancer/default.htm /head2right BC Cancer Agency - Drug Inde x www.bccancer.bc.ca/HPI/DrugDatabase/DrugIndexPt/default.htm Additional Websites /head2right Native A merican Cancer Research - www.natamcancer.org /head2right Canadian Partnership Again s t Cancer - www.cancerview.ca /head2right Canadian Partnership Again s t Cancer - www.partnershipagainstcancer.ca/ /head2right Canadian Partnership Against Cancer - First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis Resource - www.cancerview.ca/cv/port a l/Home/FirstNationsInuitAndMetis?_afrLoop=481720 985412000&_afrWindowMode=0&_adf.ctrl-state=9m8hdh00q_4 /head2right First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis Action Plan Against Cancer - www.partnershipagainstcanc e r.ca/wp-content/uploads/Partnership-Report-2011- ENGLISH-November-15-520-pm.pdf Part 3: Quality of Life and H ealthy Living After Cancer Table of Contents LIVING BEYOND CANCER Stress, Anxiety and Depression Returning to Community FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS SPIRITUALITY HEALTHY EATING Managing Some of the Side Effects of Cancer and its Treatment Alcohol PHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUN EXPOSURE CLEANSING CEREMONIES Part 3: Quality of Life and Hea lthy Living After Cancer This section includes infor m ation on factors that affect your quality of life including the emotional and psychological effects of cancer and cancer treatment and lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity and tobacco use. Additional information on this subject is included in the resource section. Living Beyond Cancer You finally made it! You sur vived your treatment and are ready to continue with your 'normal' life. Many patients and their loved ones expect life to return to normal. You may have gone through a physically, emotionally, and perhaps spiritually changing experience. As time passes, your side effects and symptoms will lessen and you will be able to start returning to a more normal routine. It is important for you, and for those around you, to realize, however, that this takes time. As time goes on you will continually gain your strength. You may have to make some changes to daily living, work or how you spend your free time, but this is not necessarily a bad move. You are not alone and there are many resources and support services to help. Stress, Anxiety and Depression Stress Stress can affect you in many different ways - physically, emotionally, spiritually and/or mentally. Review the list of symptoms on the next page and ask yourself if any of the listed symptoms are having a negative effect on your life. When they affect your day-to-day living, you should speak with a member of your health care team. \"There are other people who went through cancer: How did they live th eir life? Because, I know some people have these kinds of things like me and I just want to know how did they do it? How and what did they do? Did they go back to work? Did they go back to their normal way of life? Stuff like that. Things like that I want to know.\" \"Cancer drains you physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. It's very stressful. You deal with it for long and when you come back to the community there's nothing or no one there to help you.\" For information on how to deal with stress see appendix B Physical Emotional Mental Spiritual Muscle tension Cold sweaty hands Facial ticks Fatigue Tension headaches Indigestion High blood pressure Heart palpitations Back pain Jaw tension Nervous stomach Nausea Diarrhea Teeth grinding Appetite change Sleep disturbance Physical v iolence Anxiet y Fear Irritability Hopelessness Helplessness Impatience Depression Nervousness Feeling overwhelmed Loss of concentration Anger Sadness Disbelief Indifference Forgetfulness Decline in activity Indecisiveness Misuse of alcohol/ drugs Misuse of caffeine Misuse of tobacco Use of addictive methods of coping such as: Gambling Hoarding Over spending Social withdrawal Frustration Loss of connection Loss of identity Anxiety Ongoing physical pro b lems associated with cancer can result in anxiety. Anxiety often stems from feelings of loss of control, feeling alone and uncertain about your health. These feelings can be handled by using helpful tools and seeking support when needed. Many survivors experience problems with scheduling appointments when travelling out of community, causing anxiety and stress. It is helpful to work with your health care team to develop and confirm a plan before leaving the community for appointments. You may find the table below helpful when organizing your follow-up appointments. Travel Planning Travel Items Description Confirmed? (Yes/No) Who confirmed travel? Date Needed (dd/mm/yy) Comments Medical Appointment Accommodation Transportation Feelings of anxiety during t reatment may continue into survivorship. Survivors can feel frustrated with travel, isolation, accommodation, financial strain, and other stressors. A member of your health care team is able to help with these problems. We all experience anxiety at some time in our lives and there are ways to reduce and manage it. Identifying anxiety is the first step. From there, you can learn the cause of your anxiety and decide on ways to cope. Counseling, support groups and relaxation techniques can also be helpful. Anti- anxiety medication may be another option to talk over with your health care team. Sadness Your views on how your cancer has affected aspects of your life may create feelings of sadness. It is important to work through your emotions and express them rather than keeping them to yourself. Identify supportive people in your life whom you feel will be helpful in sorting through your emotions with you. Normal Sadness Is common during your illne s s as you experience losses Can impact sleeping and eating Comes and goes Doesn't stop your ability to look forward to the future and enjoy life May create temporary isolation from friends and family May create temporary loss of identity For information on self-esteem see appendix C Depression You may experienc e symptoms of depression. It can last longer than usual sadness. If so, speak with a member of your health care team. If you experience any number of these symptoms, contact your health care professional or call the CRISIS LINE 1-800-784-2433 Depression can reduce your quality of life. The stage at which you were diagnosed with cancer and treatment you received both have an effect on your risk of depression. If you feel any of these symptoms, see any one of your health care team to learn how you can better manage them. You may just need someone to talk with who will help you explore your emotions and provide suggestions to help you cope. The BC Crisis Line is also available for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week 1-800-784-2433 . Symptoms of Depression Persistent sad, anxious, or 'e mpty' mood Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, helplessness Don't feel like your usual self Nothing cheers you up or lifts your mood, feelings of hopelessness Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies, activities and relationships you enjoy Decreased energy or increased fatigue Difficulty concentrating, remembering, making decisions Insomnia, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping Appetite and/or weight changes Restlessness, irritability Thoughts of death or suicide, suicide attempts \"Then I can share my stories, like, what I'm going through. Maybe when I'm goin g through a hard time they could tell me, \"No, you could do it this way\" or \"try this\".\" \"I feel the support team helped in that way. And that way people don't get down and depressed because we're able to talk about it. And we can laugh and talk about what we're going through and realize it's normal. And when you have a doctor sitting in there or a, a trained nurse who would know and be able to reassure us, \"Yes, it is all part of it\".\" Returning to Community For s ome cancer survivors, returning to their community is the most important part of their cancer journey. Patients and family have been through a difficult experience and it is important to acknowledge them as they transition back to their everyday lives. Although many communities will honour their cancer survivors and families in different ways, suggestions have been made such as hosting a community gathering or feast to acknowledge the family and to give them the opportunity to discuss their journey. Speaking with your local health care team about opportunities to organize such an event is a great place to start. A few things to consider before organizing a community event are: 1) Ensure that the cancer survivor and family are ready to participate in an event. There may be physical or mental challenges that the family is going through that should be respected. 2) Ensure that the event is flexible and held at a time that is appropriate for the cancer survivor and family. 3) Ensure healthy foods are provided. 4) Ask the family the best time of day to host an event as energy levels for the cancer survivor may vary throughout the day. 5) Have fun! This is a great opportunity to acknowledge an individual, family and community and to empower everyone to come together to support one another during a difficult time. Family and Community Relati onships You may find support with y our survivorship needs through relationships with your family and community. These relationships are quite commonly a source of strength for survivors. In some cases, family members do not talk about the effects of the treatment in an effort to protect their loved ones. It is important that you talk openly about your experience. This will help your relationships so that you can work towards recovery together. The BCCA Centre for the North Patient and Family Counseling are also available at 1-855-775-7300. Cancer Chat is another resource for you and they can be reached at 1-800-663-3333 extension 4965 or 4966. Spirituality Cancer may leave you with a new outlook on life. You might find yourself searching for meaning and wanting to make the best of your life. There are many ways to bring new meaning to your life and to help make sense of what you have gone through. Some people find spirituality helpful. Reconnecting with your culture, traditions and getting out on the land can help survivors move forward. Expressing yourself through Potlatch and/or traditional ceremonies is helpful for some survivors. How to move forward every day: Be honest and caring with e ach other, laugh often Keep a regular time and place or outing when you don't discuss cancer Talk about each other's goals and dreams Find ways to exercise together Relax together and do activities that you both enjoy Try something new \"I needed help for my little girl because it was really hard f or her to see me going through my treatment. I'm glad that I could connect with someone over the phone to talk with. It helped us a lot.\" Healthy Eating Making positive changes to your lifestyle and diet are important to help you better manage the side effects of cancer treatment, improve your energy and quality of life and gain more personal control. Healthy eating also helps prevent or manage health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes and decreases your risk of cancer recurrence. Research shows that the most important lifestyle changes you can make include achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight, increasing physical activity, and limiting or avoiding alcohol. Many people question whether their diet played a role in their cancer diagnosis. Cancer is a complicated disease - and the risk of developing it is related to many factors some of which may be dietary. Certain cancers have been linked to obesity, alcohol consumption and possibly a higher fat diet from processed foods. At the same time, diet does not account for all of the cancer risk factors. Individuals with healthy diets can still develop cancer. This section includes an overview of the healthy eating habits you can use to reduce the risk of cancer returning and to improve your overall health. These suggestions are intended for people who have recovered from treatment and are interested in healthy eating. If, however, you are dealing with side effects that limit what you can eat, the suggestions below may not be the right choice until your symptoms are gone. Some side effects of cancer treatment include a change in appetite or taste in food, nausea, vomiting, and trouble digesting or eating certain foods. If you are dealing with side effects that affect your ability to eat a healthy diet, talk with your doctor or local health clinic (also see the resources below). You may also want to call a dietitian at HealthLinkBC (Dial 811) or read the Canadian Cancer Society's \"Eating Well When You Have Cancer\" for help in regaining your appetite right after treatment. Their publication, \"Eat Well, Be Active, What You Can Do\" provides advice for when you are feeling well enough to start improving your diet. You can also speak with one of their Cancer Information Specialists (1- 888- 939-3333). Many of these resources do not talk about traditional food and the health benefits of eating a traditional diet. It would be useful to review the \"Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide: First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis\" for information on culturally appropriate foods. Resources: Eating well with Canada's F ood Guide: First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/pubs/fnim-pnim/index-eng.php The following suggestions ar e not intended to replace advice from your health care team. Do not hesitate to discuss nutrition related concerns with your health care team or dietitian. About one-third of all cancers are linked to diet. Early research suggests that some of the same foods that protect against cancer are also the best choices for cancer survivors. Food First Some foods are rich in anti - cancer qualities such as vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber. Include the following as part of your diet one at a time so it is easier to manage. The following are a few examples, and does not include all recommended traditional foods. Eat less processed food s Eat more berries, plants and root vegetables which are high in vitamins Eat healthy fats that are found in fish such as salmon, trout, halibut and cod Fish heads and bones are an excellent source of calcium Fish skin and eggs are good sources of protein and vitamins Save smoked or dried fish for snacks for travelling Moose meat is an excellent source of protein and B vitamins and a good source of iron Moose meat and other wild animals are lower in fat than domestic animals such as beef, pork and chicken Small animals such as beaver, ground squirrel, groundhog (marmot) and rabbit meat are an excellent source of protein, iron and B vitamins Wild duck, ptarmigan and geese are a good source of iron Eat whole wheat baked bannock instead of fried, enriched flour bannock Use seaweed and ooligan grease We recommend using Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide: First nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis. This guide lists the number of servings and portion sizes for foods within each food group - according to age and gender to meet the nutritional needs for good health. Using the Internet, you can create your own food guide using the \"my food guide\" feature of Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide: First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis. The Dietitians of Canada website also features the Eatracker tool (See www.eatracker.ca ) which allows you to enter y our daily food intake to help track your food choices and exercise to help meet your goals. A dietitian can also help you create a specific plan to meet your specific needs (call 811 or you may want to visit www.healthlinkbc.ca ). If you do not have internet access, a n y member of your health care team can provide you with hard copies of these resources. Although you may not have a dietitian directly in your community, there are tele-health services available and registered dietitians will work with you to create a plan to improve your health. There is also a cancer dietitian based in Prince George that provides tele- health services throughout Northern BC. Any member of your health care team can put you in contact with these dietitians. If you have internet access, you can also use the 'find services tool' within HealthLinkBC ( www.healthlinkbc.ca/servicesresources ) to dietitians.

A healthy body weight lowers your risk of cancer recurrence and reduces the risk for many other diseases including heart disease, diabetes, stroke, high blood pressure, arthritis and dementia. Excess body fat is also associated with higher levels of the hormone insulin, and insulin resistance, which can increase risk for some types of cancer recurrence. Alcohol Research shows that a lcohol increases the risk of cancer specifically in the mouth, throat, larynx (voice box), esophagus (swallowing tube from mouth to stomach), liver and breast. As the amount of alcohol a person drinks increases, the risk of developing cancer increases. The link between alcohol consumption and certain cancer type recurrence is not as strong. For an outline of the food journal see Appendix D For information on the big picture of health y eating see appendix E and recommended cookbooks see appendix F Physical Activity Physical activity is an im p ortant part of healthy living. It can improve how your body works, build your strength and fitness and add to your quality of life. It can also help you better manage symptoms and reduce anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Further, physical activity can also help with stress and weight management and give you with a more positive body image. Check with your health care team before increasing your physical activity. If you have anemia (low blood count), a weakened immune system or problems with nerves that affect your balance, you may need to take special precautions. You should be aware that pain medications, such as anti-inflammatory medications, can mask pain related to physical activity. Injuries should be taken seriously and looked after right away. Use the resource below for information on funding for some supplies that can help you get physically active. When beginning any form of p hysical activity, consider your starting level and set a timeframe with short and long-term goals. Exercise for Health recommends at least 30 minutes per day of moderate exercise, 5 days a week. People who have been inactive for some time, however, should start with 10 minutes per day (or less) and increase as fitness improves. As your fitness improves, you can increase your activity 10 minutes at a time. Measure your level of exertion based on your breathing. In moderate exercise, you should be able to talk in full sentences. In vigorous exercise, you will only be able to talk in short phrases. If you feel that you are working, you probably are. It is important to listen to your body and be aware of your how much it can take. Resources: http://www.fnhc.ca/index.php/initiatives/community_health/physical_activity/ Exercise and Healthy Living You might find yourself anxious to return to good health after treatment. The recommendations for cancer survivors are the same as those for anyone wanting to live a healthier lifestyle. Small changes such as berry picking, setting snares or traps or going for a walk instead of driving are great ways to introduce more activity into your routine. Make sure you get your doctor's okay before doing any exercise. Research shows that exerci s e benefits the heart, lungs and other organs and can reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. Ease into any new routines to allow your body to adjust. This will also ensure that the changes become a part of your life and not just a phase. When we are not well we tend to separate ourselves from our traditional way of knowing and participating in traditional activities. On our path to healing, it is important to incorporate traditional activities into our daily lives. Begin by seeking support from others and establishing connections with family members and friends who are hunters, trappers, fishers or gatherers. Re-establish your spiritual connections to the land. Focus on living and maintaining a healthy life that includes traditional activities that includes being on the land and participating in hunting, fishing, trapping or gathering in any capacity that you are comfortable with. Strengthening your emotional, spiritual, mental and physical well being is important for improving your overall health. Benefits of Exercise: Improved sense of well-bein g, mood and self-esteem Improve memory Quicker recovery and may lower chance of recurrence Improved strength, endurance, muscle and bone strength Increased life expectancy Decreased depression, anxiety and fatigue Decreased symptoms of menopause and arthritis Sun Exposure Avoid overexposure to the sun a nd sunburns. Skin that has been radiated may remain sensitive to the sun after radiation treatment has ended. Cleansing Ceremonies Historically, sweet grass and s a ge have been used for traditional ceremonies such as Smudging, although it is recognized that not all communities participate in this activity . However, in recent years commercial tobacco use (including smoking and chewing tobacco) has increased significantly. Commercial tobacco is the single most preventable cause of death, disease and disability. All tobacco users have a higher risk of numerous chronic diseases and tobacco use is responsible for 30% of all cancer deaths. The harmful effects of smoking on health is widely known and there are several programs to help you quit. If you smoke, and would like information on quitting, please contact a member of your health care team. Provincial programs (British Columbia) exist to provide you with different stop smoking products free of charge. Be Sun Smart: Use sunscreen of at least SPF15 . Check the expiry date on the bottle as old sunscreen will not protect you from sun damage Re-apply at least every two hours or after swimming or sweating Seek shade especially between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Cover yourself with clothing and wear a hat If you are outdoors on a sunny day in the winter, you still need sunscreen Resources: Dial 8-1-1 and ask for smoking cessation help Or visit: http://www.quitnow.ca/database/files/library/Aboriginal_Brochure.pdf What kind of lifestyle chang es can you think about making?

Appendix Table of Contents TIPS ON MEMORY & CONCENTRATION WAYS TO DEAL WITH STRESS SELF ESTEEM FOOD JOURNAL THE BIG PICTURE ON HEALTHY EATING RECOMMENDED COOKBOOKS LISTING OF RESOURCES OTHER SURVIVORS HAVE FOUND BENEFICIAL RECOMMENDED READING LIST BC CANCER AGENCY, BC CANCER FOUNDATION, CANADIAN CANCER SOCIETY Appendix A. Tips on Memory & Concentra t ion Both daily mental and physi cal activity will increase memory and other mental functions. Training your brain by reading, doing puzzles, learning new skills and hobbies all help to strengthen your brain (think of it as mental housekeeping - unused brain power will collect 'dust'). Physical activity is also important as it increases your blood flow and triggers muscle groups and their various control centers in the brain. You can cope better with symptoms of memory and concentration by making sure you are well rested, paying attention, organizing yourself and writing reminder notes. Support groups can also help by learning of others' experiences by sharing your own. B. Ways to Deal with Stress Start the day by putting y o urself on your To-Do list. Make you a priority! Spend time doing the activities you love. Deep breathing and active relaxation are healthy and helpful techniques for dealing wit h stress. Deep Breathing Use deep breathing for a calming effect before an event that makes you anxious. Deep breathing is a simple and effective way to relieve tension and increase comfort. It can make you more comfortable if you are experiencing episodes of pain, fatigue or nausea. This method can be used before you go to bed to help ease you into a restful sleep. You can practice deep breathing anywhere. Muscle Relaxation By learning how to relax your muscles, you can actively lower your blood pres s ure, heart rate and breathing rate. Progressive muscle relaxation is the tensing and then relaxing of each muscle group of the body, one group at a time. In a comfortable position, breathe slowly taking deep breaths. The idea is to tense one muscle group at a time and hold for 5- 10 seconds (if a part of the body is painful or tender, do not tense in that area). Release the Deep breathing technique: 1 Place yourself in a comfor t able position with legs and arms uncrossed 2 Take the palm of one hand on your chest; place the other on your abdomen 3 Breathe normally. Notice how your hands rise and fall with your breathing 4 Picture your stomach as a balloon as you do this 5 Concentrate on breathing from your stomach silently keeping count 6 Say to yourself 'relax' each time you exhale Try to practice this method for 5 minutes every day tension and stay relaxed fo r 10-20 seconds. You can tense the areas of the body in any order and as much as you like. There are also tapes available that can guide you through this process. Examples of this method: clench hands into fists, flex biceps, tense abdomen, eyes (close tight, hold, and release), and arch your back to name a few. C. Self Esteem Low self-esteem can have a n egative effect on all aspects of your quality of life. People who think poorly of themselves for long periods of time can still make simple changes to improve their self esteem. Here are four steps to start recovering your positive sense of self. Step 1: Identify the main sources What lowers your self-estee m ? A troubling environment at work or home? Problems in certain relationships? Once you identify the root of the problem you can start targeting your action plan for success. Step 2: Awareness of your inner voice Pay attention to your inne r voice as you come across situations which make you say negative things about yourself. You will need to decide if you are being reasonable or if you are thinking about it in an unrealistic way. Were you thinking about any positive points or was your inner conversation mostly negative? Step 3: Challenge negative or unrealistic thoughts The first though that come s to your mind in these situations needs to be checked as to whether it makes sense. Your thought process may be so set that it will be difficult at first. You need to question whether your view of situations that leave you with thoughts that lower your self-esteem are based on facts or just your own opinion. Step 4: Changing the way you evaluate yourself Now that you have identifi e d the root of your self-esteem issues, your increased awareness of your inner voice and negative thought processes, it is time to start taking a positive outlook. Thought processes that are counterproductive: All-or-nothing thinking . Pass or fail style of thinking. : \"If I can't do this, I am a complete failur e \". Mental Filtering perceiving only the bad side of every situation: \"I made a mistake and now eve ryone will think I'm incompetent\". Converting positives into negatives. You are unable to accept compliments or achievements: \"I only succe eded because it wasn't hard to do\". Jumping to negative conclusions. In the absence of any evidence, you still reach a negative conclusion: \"My fr iend didn't return my call so they must be mad at me for something I did\". Mistaking feelings for facts Confusing your own opinion with facts: \"I feel useless therefore I am useless \" . Self put-downs. Combination of overreacting to a situation and undervaluing yourself: \"I am no t worthy of succeeding\". Thought processes that are realistic and constructive: Hopeful statements. Treat yourself how you would treat others. If you feel confident you are capa b le of the task at hand, you are more likely to succeed: \"This isn't easy, but I can do it\". Forgive yourself. Nobody is perfect and mistakes happen, but you shouldn't change your opinion o f yourself: \"I didn't do it right the first time, but that doesn't mean I am incapable of getting it right the second time\". Avoid unrealistic goals. If you are constantly placing demands on yourself and others that are not pos s ible, you are only setting yourself up to fail. Focus on the positive. If you doubt your abilities and self-worth, remind yourself of your accomplis h ments and other aspects of your life of which you are appreciative. Re-label upsetting thoughts. If your inner voice is saying you can't do something, think of a way to chang e the situation to make it more manageable: \"How can I make this less stressful?\" Encourage yourself. You need to compliment yourself. If you feel that something went well, take a m oment to acknowledge yourself and use it to inspire your next task. Don't feel discouraged if y ou need to return to step one. Do this as often as you need to. Habits can be hard to break, but if you work at it, you will notice your self-esteem begin to improve and benefit from increased confidence in all aspects of your life. If you are unable to resolve self-esteem issues on your own, or if your self-esteem interferes with your daily functioning, seek professional help. D. Food Journal Date/Time Food (amount) Drink (Amount) Where I ate Current emotions/mood E. The Big Picture on Healthy Eating This section provides sugg e stions and tools to help with changes toward healthier eating plus lists ways to identify and remove challenges. Time Many people wonder where they will find time to look for recipes, make grocery lists, or go shopping. Having a plan for what you are going to eat for several days or even a week in advance can make this process much easier. Feeding Others at Home If you have others in your household, they may not understand or want to change their eating habits in the same way you do. Try involving them in making healthy choices by inviting them to take part in the meal planning by picking a meal or adding a recipe or dish suggestion. While not all suggestions will be healthy choices, there is room for the occasional treat. Fatigue If the thought of cooking a meal, making a grocery list, or shopping sounds exhausting, you are not alone. Fatigue can be a side effect of cancer treatment that may last for some time. Try breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. People who helped out along your cancer journey are often still available, but may not know how they can help now. Ask friends and family to help with planning meals, picking up groceries or preparing meals. At the Store Check the \"Nutrition Facts\" label on products you are choosing and avoid items that are high in trans fats (common in processed and packaged foods). Also, be aware of the ingredients. If you are buying an item because it is described as 'whole grain', for example, that should be one of the first ingredients listed. Don't buy unhealthy items. If you don't bring them home, you are less likely to eat them. Meal Preparation As much as possible, prepare meals using low-fat cooking methods such as broiling, baking, steaming, and poaching. When your meal requires frying, use healthy unsaturated fats such as olive oil or canola oil. Also, add herbs and spices for flavoring in place of salt or rich dressings and sauces which may have extra fat, salt and sugar. Keep smoked, half smoked and dried meat and fish as snacks for traveling. Staying on Track Whether you are trying to be more active, eat more vegetables, or watch your fat intake, setting SMART goals can help you to stay focused. 1 Specific : Have one focus for each goal rather than a general idea. 2 Measureable : Set quantities for your goal. 3 Attainable : Set goals that you can reach! Small goals are more achievable. 4 Relevant : Stay motivated with a goal that matters to you. 5 Time based : Set a timeline for this goal be it daily, weekly or monthly. F. Recommended Cookbooks G.
