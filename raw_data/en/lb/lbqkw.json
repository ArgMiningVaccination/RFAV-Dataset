The problem may be depression, low self-esteem, anxiety (health, panic, agoraphobia, social, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Body Dysmorphic Disorder) trauma, anger or chronic pain.

Sessions are a springboard for experiments and creating your own therapy time as 'learned experiences' govern emotional, behavioural, physical and psychological change. What is EMDR ? EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitisation & Reprocessing addresses the cognitive, emotional and physiological aspects of distress, especially Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) through the processing of troubling memories and experiences that generally lead to someone feeling unable to overcome distressing past events.
