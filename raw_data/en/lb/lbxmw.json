Countries, including China, where vast proportionsof the population do not have access to piped waterand/or modern toilets, host particularly high ratesof this disease (Chen et al, 1991; Ming et al, 1991; Cui, 1992, Zhang et al, 1995; Shen et al, 1996; Zhang, 1999). At the same time that efforts are be-ing undertaken to improve the economic situationto allow widespread upgrading of sanitation andhygiene facilities, there is considerable interest in-ternationally and in China to explore the develop-ment and introduction of a vaccine against shigella(Tu et al, 1995; 1999). Since the widespread expansion of childhood immunizations during the Expanded Primary Im-munization (EPI) campaigns of the 1980s somePERCEPTIONS OF SHIGELLA AND OF SHIGELLA VACCINE AMONG RURAL CHINESE: COMPATIBILITY WITH WESTERN MODELS OF BEHAVIORAL CHANGE Gong Youlong1, Bonita F Stanton2, Lorenz Von Shanghai, China; 2Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, 3International Vaccine Institute, Seoul, Korea Abstract. Shigella remain a major source of morbidity and mortality in developing countries, including China. In response, national and international researchers are actively working to develop vaccines that will be effective against dysentery and diarrhea caused by shigella dysentariae. With the growing recog- nition of the problems associated with sustained vaccine acceptance and usage, researchers and policymakers recognize the importance of conducting theory-based qualitative research to inform vaccine de- velopment program efforts. Accordingly we undertook this qualitative study involving 81 residents of one of China's rural communities with high rates of dysentery. The semi-structured interviews suggestthat a Western model of behavioral change offered a useful research construct. Consistent with the model is the community's strong perception of 'response efficacy' of vaccines, particularly in comparison with water and sanitation and disease treatment. Residents were eager to vaccinate their children despitevariable perception of disease severity, while they were less consistent in their interest in vaccinating adults; this enthusiasm for vaccinating children was attributed to China's 'one child per couple' policy. Intervention implications are discussed. countries have enjoyed continued high rates of vaccine coverage of infants and children, while many others have experienced disappointing de-clines in coverage rates (Keja et al, 1988; Kim- Farley, Cutts, 1998;England et al, 2001; Streefland, 2001). To date, few countries have sustained high rates of vaccine cov-erage among individuals above the age ranges tar-geted by the EPI program (Isahak, 2000). As gov-ernments contemplate new vaccine initiatives, it isappropriate to assess perceptions of vaccine candi-dates and the targeted disease in an attempt to se-lect vaccines and target promotion efforts to achievehigh rates of vaccine coverage. Such assessments of perceptions of diseases and vaccines among a population need not bedone blindly. A substantial literature exists regard-ing health care and prevention behavior in bothdeveloped and developing countries (Becker et al, 1977; Cummings et al, 1980; Kendall, 1983; Commission on Health Research for Develop-ment, 1990). The past decade has witnessed thegrowing realization that these efforts should beguided by models of behavioral change (Stanton et al, 1992) and in turn, a vast research experi- ence now supports the use of models to designSOUTHEAST ASIAN J TROP MED PUBLIC HEALTH 98 Vol 35 No. 1 March 2004health prevention strategies (Keane et al, 1993). However, to date, few vaccine strategies, particu-larly in developing countries, have utilized thisapproach, and the appropriateness of western-based models of behavioral change to guide vac-cination efforts in developing countries have notbeen assessed. As part of the shigella vaccine development program for China, guided by a social cognitivemodel of behavior, we undertook a qualitativeevaluation of a rural population regarding dysen-tery and a hypothetical 'dysentery' vaccine. MATERIALS AND METHODS Description of the study area Hebei Province, located in the north, is one of China's 34 provinces. Zhengdin County, one of 149counties in Hebei Province, consists of 9 townshipswith a population of 456,826, with approximately80% of the population residing in rural areas andemployed in farming. The average annual per capitaincome is 859 RMB (2001 Local Government Sta-tistic) (8 RMB US$ 1.00). Residents report that100% of homes have piped water, compared to anational average of 57% (Ministry of HealthPeople's Republic of China, 1999), although wateris not available 24 hours a day, but only during timesof pumping (usually about 16 hours per day). Ap-proximately 10% of households have in-house flushtoilets, while the remainder have latrines, frequentlyattached to pig-sties. Nightsoil is routinely used asa fertilizer. Among the 9 townships in Zhegdin, a con- venience sample of four were selected with apopulation of approximately 80,000. Availabledata at the time of selection indicated that theannual incidence rate of shigellosis was 2.82/1,000 children at 0-4 years; 0.37/1,000 amongthose 5 to 14 years and 0.23/1,000 among sub-jects over age 15 (Harrison, 1994). More recentpilot data obtained in 2001 suggests that currentrates are much higher, at 73/1,000 per year forchildren under 5 years of age and 11/1,000 peryear for individuals 5 years or older (IVI, per-sonnel communication). Every township has 6 to10 villages, each village has 1 to 10 village clin-ics, with 1 to 10 doctors each. Almost all of thevillage doctors received two or three years oftraining (Stanton et al, 1985). Each township has one township hospital and Zhengding County has4 county hospitals. Nationally, approximatelyone-half of the population seeks outpatient carefrom the village clinics, 35% from the townshiphospitals, and 14% from the county hospital orhigher level. Vaccines are provided to the town-ship hospitals through the Anti-epidemic Centerin Zhengdin. As is the case throughout China,BCG, measles, polio, tetanus and diphtheria vac-cines are provided free to all infants and childrenand use of hepatitis A and B vaccines is wide-spread (Harrison, 1994). Description of the underlying theory of be- havior, protection motivation theory Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), a so- cial cognitive theory (Prentice-Dunn and Rogers , 1986), has been used as the guiding theoreticmodel for risk prevention efforts in Western coun-tries and in Africa. (Stanton et al, 1999). As noted below, the interview guide for this study was or-ganized around the constructs of this theory. PMTenvisions environmental and personal factorscombining to pose a potential threat, in this case,dysentery. In addition to general knowledge , con- sideration of the potential personal threat posedby a maladaptive response is mediated by a bal-ance between rewards accompanying the behav- ior (such as 'cold food tastes good'), and the per-ceived severity of and personal vulnerability to the threat (dysentery). An adaptive response ismediated by balancing the response efficacy (per- ceived likelihood that the action, in this case vac-cination, will reduce the threat) and self-efficacy (belief that the individual can complete the adap-tive response, in this case, become vaccinated,only drink boiled water, eat hot, cooked food, etc)with the response cost (barriers or inconve- niences) of completing the adaptive response (s).These two appraisal pathways combine to formprotection motivation , the intention to respond to a potential threat in either an adaptive (protectivebehavior) or maladaptive (risk behavior) manner.(Prentice-Dunn and Rogers , 1986). 'con- structs' appear in the parenthesis in sub-headingsunder 'Results'. Identification of subjects and data gathering The four study townships were selected by the investigators in collaboration with officialsRURAL CHINESE'S PERCEPTIONS OF SHIGELLA AND OF SHIGELLA VACCINE Vol 35 No. 1 March 2004 99from the Zhendhig Health Authority. From among the four study townships, two villages from twoof the townships were selected for participationin the qualitative study. The villages were selectedto show a range of socioeconomic status ( eg Shangshuitum had a higher per capita income at4,900 RMB per year and Nangang a lower one at2,400) and health indicators ( eg, Sanjiao had a mortality rate of 10.37% and Xixingjia of 6.67compared to a county average of 5.97). Subjects for the study were selected using a convenience sample. Four categories of respon-dents were identified: Key Informants (definedas people who knew what was going on in thevillage), Community Leaders (elected and offi-cial leaders of the party and health system), com-munity residents, and 'case studies' (families inwhich there had been an index case of shigella inthe past three months). The eight 'Key Informants' included three women, ranging in age from 31 to 75 years, andincluded a wide range of professions (housewife,farmer, head of the street cleaners, Chairman ofthe Town People's Congress, etc). The 20 Com-munity Leaders included eight women, rangingin age from 24 to 60 years, and included PartyLeaders, Township Leaders, and Village Commit-tee Leaders. The 30 community residents included18 women, ranging in age from 22 to 63 years,and included farmers, laborers, accountants andone doctor. The 23 respondents for the Case Stud-ies represented patients ranging in age from eightmonths to 79 years, including 12 females, all butfive of whom were from farming families. Each respondent gave written, informed con- sent. Interviews were conducted in Chinese, andall respondents were interviewed individually ina setting of their choice. Interviews wereaudiotaped. None of the identified respondentsdeclined to participate in the study. Interviewsgenerally lasted approximately 45 minutes. Re-spondents were paid 20 RMB as a gesture ofthanks, after completing their interview. The re-search protocol received clearance from the FudanUniversity Institutional Review Board and theSecretariat Committee for Research InvolvingHuman Subjects, World Health Organization,Geneva, Switzerland.Interview guides Interviews employed an open-ended, semi- structured format. Questions were organizedaround the constructs of PMT and were designedto assess beliefs of causality, perceptions of se-verity and vulnerability, reasons for engaging in'risk' behaviors, perceptions of vaccine efficacy,safety, cost and side effects, and perceptions ofthe health care system, including accessibility andease of use. The interview guide was designed inEnglish, translated into Chinese, and back-trans-lated to English. Training of the interviewers occurred at the research site and took place over 10 days. Train-ing involved practice with the survey instruments,quality control, and data management. Analysis Audiotapes were transcribed in Chinese and then translated into English. Passages relevant tothe main constructs of PMT were jointly identi-fied by Chinese investigators and foreign consult-ants offering technical assistance. The full rangeof responses on any given subject were selectedand analyzed both with respect to each other andin the context of the interview. RESULTS Beliefs, perceptions regarding the disease, its causes and sources (Knowledge) There was considerable heterogeneity in understanding of the pathogenesis of dysenterydepending on the category of respondents. TheCase Study and Community Resident interviewsreflect much misinformation regarding the etio-logy of dysentery. Frequently mentioned are ex-posure to cold/catching a cold and eating coldfood. '(I developed dysentery) because I washedmy feet with cold water the day before, and Icaught a cold'; 'I think I possibly caught a chill';'I think I possibly caught a chill when enjoyingthe cool.... in the evening'. Only the occasionalrespondent mentions hygiene/poor sanitation asa cause: '(I acquired dysentery because) I did notpay attention to hygiene habit, but I do not knowwhat kind of feculent food I had eaten'; and '(Hedeveloped dysentery because) he ate some un-clean food or caught a cold'.SOUTHEAST ASIAN J TROP MED PUBLIC HEALTH 100 Vol 35 No. 1 March 2004By contrast, most Community Leaders showed evidence of a clear understanding thatdysentery resulted from eating unclean foods andother unhygienic behaviors and were aware of theseasonality of the disease (summer); 'These dis-eases result from poor sanitation conditions in thecommunity and bad individual hygienic habit, forinstance, drinking unboiled water in summer'; and'People eat more fruits in summer because fruitsare abundant at that time. If they don't care muchfor the cleanness of the fruits, it would be veryeasy to suffer such a disease'. Some Community Leaders demonstrated awareness of the concept of acquired immunity:'Children have less resistance to this disease andthey are vulnerable. Adults have strong resistanceto it and are not so susceptible'. Prevailing beliefs regarding how to prevent dysentery/shigellosis (Response efficacy, self-efficacy and rewards) Perceptions regarding preventive measures for shigella mirrored perceptions of disease trans-mission. Therefore, people advised avoidancepotentially contaminated foods and water ('Eatclean food, drink boiled water, fresh food, nevereat the food sold on the street...), cool air or cold,('Be careful not to catch cold at night'.), and flies('Avoid flies sting on dishware'). In addition, afew home remedies were proposed: 'To drink alittle wine and garlic every garlic and shallot in autumn'; 'The bestmeasure to prevent the dysentery is to eat moregarlic and shallot'; 'Some people eat deep-friedtwisted dough sticks with and 'soup ofthe root of onion can prevent dysentery'. Opinions varied regarding the difficulty in avoiding dysentery. Many respondents expressedthe belief that avoiding dysentery would not bedifficult: 'No difficulty. It is convenient to dothose matters (eat clean food, not to catch cold,not eat dirty food which haven't washed, stingover by flies or mice and drink raw water)'; 'It isnot difficult to avoid it if we pay attention to diethabit and diet hygiene' and 'It is not difficult butsimple to avoid it because the patients with dys-entery are less in recent years'. At the same time,several believed that it would be difficult to pre-vent: 'It is difficult to prevent dysentery. Becausein rural areas dysentery is contracted through stools. Now there are no sewers existing in ourvillage and only five houses have latrines withattached pig-sties'. People readily admit that in many cases al- though they know how to avoid infection, theirpractice differs. Many admit to having raw andreheated foods ('We eat raw vegetables, and re-heat the dishes food left over the next day'); andothers wash their hands before meals but not af-ter using the toilet ('We do wash hands beforemeals every time, but don't wash hands after weuse the toilet'). Several respondents made refer-ence to eating garlic ('We also have garlic'; 'First,we often eat garlic'). A few respondents claimedto consistently follow good hygienic practices. Perceptions of severity and vulnerability (Severity and vulnerability) Opinions among Community Respondents ranged widely, as to the severity of the disease,with some viewing it as severe and others as rela-tively inconsequential, and as to its perceivedprevalence, with some believing it to be very com-mon and others never having witnessed a case.Community Respondents indicated a belief thatshigella is a serious disorder: 'It's serious. WhenI was young, this disease could cause death'; 'Se-vere. If this disease weren't treated on time, itwould lead to death'. 'More severe thanenteritis';'It is severe and can be cured by trans-fusing'; and 'In general it is not easy to cure. Itcould be cured by taking injection or taking medi-cines for several days'. At the same time, many Community Respon- dents did not consider dysentery to be a seriousdisorder: 'It seems nobody has a bad case of thedisease, neither my family nor I'; 'Not serious.Taking some medicines can cure it'; develop into anything very serious'; 'I alsohave dysentery in hot seasons, but it isn't seri-ous'; and, 'The cases of dysentery are few. Some-times it is seasonal. I think it is not serious. Peopleoften catch mild ailments. It can heal soon bymedication'. Among Community Leaders and Key Infor- mants, dysentery was generally not perceived tobe especially serious, both because it is uncom-mon and easily treated: 'No. (It isn't a seriousRURAL CHINESE'S PERCEPTIONS OF SHIGELLA AND OF SHIGELLA VACCINE Vol 35 No. 1 March 2004 101problem) because few people suffer from it and they only suffer it in summer. Patients can takesome medicine to cure it. Compared with otherconcerns, residents pay less attention to diarrhealdiseases'; 'Now they have more hygiene know-ledge and suffer it less...Dysentery is now veryrare'; 'People are less concerned about diarrhealdiseases, which is the same as catching a cold.Usually people don't go to hospital and just buysome medicine by themselves'; 'This disease iscurable. Patients will be OK after they take somemedicine. Because this disease can't lead to death,people pay little attention to it'; and 'People don'tpay much attention to it. No one dies from dys-entery as long as they get treatment in time'. Sev-eral respondents attributed the decline in dysen-tery among children to the one-child-per-couplepolicy: 'The health of children is taken seriouslybecause of the one-child-per-family policy atpresent'. Another Community Leader observedthat while dysentery is recognized to be a 'prob-lem among infants, people are still more con-cerned about other diseases of adulthood, suchas neurological disorders: 'One respondent didrecognize the potential seriousness of dysenterycompared to (simple) diarrhea: 'But up to now, itis not very severe and never epidemic in one vil-lage or town. I think we should pay attention topatients, who have loose bowels, otherwise theywould have dysentery, which is more severe.There were people who died of it in our village.So villagers pay more attention to this diseases'. Dysentery was not spontaneously listed by any respondent as a disease of high priority; rathertraditional diseases of adulthood were noted, in-cluding cancer, heart attacks, and strokes. Opinions varied widely among all catego- ries of respondents as to whom was most vulner-able to dysentery: some people believed children,others adults, some both. Several suggested thatpersons with underlying illnesses were particu-larly vulnerable, while a few offered that healthyadults were susceptible because they were notcareful with their diets, and still others profferedthat anyone could acquire dysentery. Perceptions about costliness of treatment for shigellosis (Severity and response cost) Perceptions of cost varied considerably. CaseStudy and Community Respondents had a vari- able response to questions regarding the economicimpact of the episode of dysentery which broughtthem into contact with the medical system. Whilesome indicated that it had no impact, others feltthat it had substantial implications in their house-hold incomes. Examples of ways in which it didimpact their economic status include: 'Myshigellosis disease influenced my income. It tookabout twelve/thirteen working days to treat myshigellosis disease, which make me lose abouttwenty-Yuan every day'; 'We had medical ex-penses on credit in village health station becausethere was a financial problem when my father wasill. Later the expense had been paid back'. and'My shigellosis influenced my husband's income.He had to accompany me to go to the clinic everyday'. Estimations by Community Residents as to the cost of an episode of dysentery ranged con-siderably, with price estimates of two to threeRMB for treatment that does not require intrave-nous infusions and from 15 to 16 RMB to severalhundred RMB, if intravenous therapy is required. Likewise, acceptable price ranges also varied considerably from three RMB to a few hundredRMB. These variations did not vary in any obvi-ous pattern by occupation of the respondent. Key Informants and Community Leaders in general felt that allopathic medicines were avail-able, are acceptable to the population and are af-fordable to most people; 'Most people will seedoctors promptly'; 'Now people can all get medi-cal service promptly when they are ill. Seeing thedoctor will not cost a lot. Now there are fewerpeople in difficult situations'. 'These medicationsare not expensive. They are very cheap'; 'Nowall people can get medical service promptly whenthey are ill. Moreover, now the doctors' serviceis very good'; and 'Few families can't afford themedical expenses, maybe just one or two'. A fewinformants clarified that if the dysentery respondsto oral medications (costing less than 10 or 20Yuan per day), the cost of this treatment can be afforded by most everyone; if intravenous infu-sions are required (costing approximately 100Yuan per day), this treatment may not be afford- able to some: 'We take norfloxacin for stomachand intestinal problems. ...It only costs 20 YuanSOUTHEAST ASIAN J TROP MED PUBLIC HEALTH 102 Vol 35 No. 1 March 2004in total. However, infusions are more expensive... It costs about 20 Yuan a day'. Opinions regard-ing the use of herbal, traditional or home rem-edies varied, with two persons commenting thatsuch remedies were no longer used ('Now no onewill use folk remedies' and 'There are no (tradi-tional) medications or herbs at home'), but oneperson observed 'At home there are some 'com-mon' medications for children and Chinese medi-cine'. Level of interest in vaccines against dysen- tery General. Despite varying perceptions of the importance of dysentery as a community prob-lem, most respondents were enthusiastic aboutthe possibility of a vaccine to prevent dysen-tery. Even among Community Leaders and KeyInformants, despite the perception that dysen-tery is not prevalent, that it is curable and thatthe treatment is generally not expensive, therewas considerable interest in a vaccine. For example, a man who earlier had de- scribed dysentery as 'it is usually cured promptlybefore it becomes serious' said 'my family mem-bers will take the vaccine...all of them will ac-cept it'. A woman who earlier had stated 'dysen-tery is not severe', offered that 'If the vaccine isavailable, I will take it,' while another woman whosaid 'The illness can't develop to anything seri-ous' stated 'Yes, I will use it'. Still, some concerns were expressed regard- ing vaccines. One individual feared being experi-mented upon: 'To some extent, my family mem-bers and I would (like to take the vaccine), but toanother extent we would not. We would like totake the vaccine because the vaccine is availablefor preventing disease. We would not like to takeit because we are afraid that we are regarded asexperimental things by the national government'.As noted later in the discussion, other concernswere expressed regarding the possibility of afraudulent vaccine (substituted for the real one).Finally, one individual commented that dysenteryis of such low importance relative to other con-cerns that she would not accept a vaccine underany conditions: 'No, I wouldn't take the vaccineeven if it were proved to be effective. What I ammore concerned about is cardiovascular diseaseand hepatitis'. Age. Despite the wide variation in populations perceived to be vulnerable to dysentery, allrespondents seemed more inclined to vaccinateand to pay more for the vaccine for children:'If it is too expensive, only kids will take thevaccine'; 'I would let my child take it if itwere effective. The vaccine could reduce thechild's pain'; 'It is necessary for children totake this vaccine'; 'I wouldn't take it becauseonly a few people caught this disease. Mychildren would take it because they... have morechances to touch bacteria. Adults may not takeit. If the vaccine were very effective, childrenwould surely take it and I am not sure whetheradults would take it'. The effect of the one-child-per-family policy on vaccine interest iswell recognized: 'Vaccines are welcomed here.Each family has just one child. All people wanthealthy children, so they pay more attention tothem'; 'Now people all pay attention tochildren's health. They all concern children'shealth, so they will let children take it', and'Nowadays every family has only one child, sopeople are concerned lest their children sufferdiseases. They will surely have their childrenvaccinated'. People were not wary of vaccinating young children/infants. To the contrary, there was con-siderable enthusiasm for vaccinating this agegroup: 'These (vaccines) are for children less than6 years old, especially the babies less than 1 yearold'; 'Immunizations were mainly for childrenfrom birth to 7 years of age'; 'There should bemore children under one year to take it, but thechildren over five or six years should not'; and,'The objects of immunization are children underten weeks'. In general respondents felt that parents and the elderly would be disinclined to take the vac-cine both because of the belief that they are notvulnerable and because of the cultural orienta-tion to provide for their children: 'My parentswouldn't take it, because they haven't sufferedthis disease and ignore this disease'; 'The elderlywill not accept this vaccine easily because theybelieve there is less chance of suffering from thisdisease and this disease is not serious. The youngRURAL CHINESE'S PERCEPTIONS OF SHIGELLA AND OF SHIGELLA VACCINE Vol 35 No. 1 March 2004 103children will accept this vaccine easily because their parents pay much attention to their health.The effect of age is obvious'; 'I wouldn't takethe (dysentery) vaccine, because I am old andrarely concern myself about my health, and I havenever caught this disease. But my wife and grand-son will take the vaccine, because my wife'shealth is in a bad condition and I care about mygrandson's health. The elderly people may be lesslikely to accept the vaccine. They pay less atten-tion to the disease and think it is unnecessary tobe immunized'. If it were very effective, therewas interest expressed by some respondents invaccinating adults as well: 'Adults would also liketo take it because it could reduce pain and couldn'taffect work. People would pay for it'; and, 'It'sdifferent for adults to take this vaccine. Whetheradults take this vaccine depends on its effect andperiod of validity. If the period of validity weremore than one year and price were less than 20 to30 Yuan, adults would take it. The effect is mostimportant'. Previous experience with dysentery (Sever- ity and vulnerability). All categories of re- spondents observed that those who had experi-enced dysentery would be more interested inreceiving the vaccine ( eg, would perceive greater benefit from vaccination): 'Generally, peoplecan accept it, especially people who have suf-fered this disease. People who haven't sufferedthis disease might not accept it easily becausethey pay less attention to this disease'; 'If somemembers had suffered from dysentery beforein their family, all family members would takethe vaccine'; and, 'Other members of my fam-ily are in good health and seldom suffer dysen-tery. Maybe they will not take it. Yet I oftensuffer dysentery. If the vaccine is available, Iwill take it. Then I can prevent it and won'tsuffer a lot'. Vaccine cost (Response cost). All categories of respondents generally indicated a willing-ness to pay, although the amount varied con-siderably from 3 to 100 or 200 Yuan. The ac-ceptable range did not vary in any obvious pat-tern by occupation of the respondent. Indica-tive of the trust in the health care system, somerespondents indicate that they 'would pay what-ever the doctor asked'. There was a generalwillingness to pay more for vaccines for chil- dren: 'If it is expensive, only kids will take thevaccine'; 'If the price were not more than 10Yuan, elderly would take it. If it were not more than 20 Yuan, children would take it'. Severalrespondents indicated willingness to pay accord-ing to duration of protection: 'The price shoulddepend on period of validity. If the period ofvalidity were one year, one hundred were suit-able. If the period of validity were three or fiveyears, 300 or 400 is suitable'; and 'The vac-cine should be very effective and cost no morethan 20 Yuan. Longer term protection couldcost higher. For instance, if a vaccine can pro-tect 10 years, 50 Yuan is also acceptable'. A few respondents recognized that the deci- sion to be vaccinated represented a 'cost-benefit'analysis: 'Vaccinations usually cost 20 Yuan. Ithink people will accept the vaccine if the priceis about 20 Yuan or so. But if the price rises to80-100 Yuan, I think it is too high to accept. Theincidence rate of the disease is not high and it isnot a deadly illness. If the price is too expensive,people can't accept it. People think that dysen- tery is not a severe disease. When ill, treatment costs 40 or 50 Yuan'; 'Yes, we would (take thevaccine). It does not harm your health and couldimprove your immunity. Without disease, you cansave money. A vaccination costs 10 Yuan, but, ifyou have loose bowels perhaps 100 is not enough.It will waste your more money. Prevention is pri-ority'; and 'If you have this vaccine I will take it.Since I think that now I only spend 3-5 Yuan onimmunization, but once I get diarrhea, perhaps Iwill pay much money for disease treatment. More-over it will affect my work, and I must spend timeon rest'. Vaccine efficacy/duration of effectiveness (Re- sponse efficacy). Although the general concept of 'vaccine efficacy' was important to individualsin all respondent categories, no one commentedregarding what constituted an adequate levelof protection: 'I would like to receive this vac-cine but it must be proven to be effective. Peoplewould take this vaccine for their health. Peoplewill need time to learn about the vaccine be-fore they accept it'; and 'Yes, I would like topay for it to keep my health if the vaccine wereproved to be effective'.SOUTHEAST ASIAN J TROP MED PUBLIC HEALTH 104 Vol 35 No. 1 March 2004People's perceptions of adequate duration of effect ranged from two months ('This vaccinemust be effective and its valid period in whichthe vaccine can prevent from diarrhea should bemore than two months') to a lifetime ('Its periodof validity has better than the whole life'). Sev-eral respondents indicated that there was a 'mini-mum' duration of protection below which theywould not use a vaccine: 'If its period of validitywere one year, a little more than 10 Yuan is ac-ceptable'. However, as noted above, respondentsoften considered duration of protection as an eco-nomic consideration rather than a fixed or abso-lute quality of a vaccine. (However, one individualdid suggest that people would be suspicious of avaccine whose duration of protection was 'toolong'; 'I think that if they said the validity termwas 10 years, I would doubt that a vaccine couldexist in the body for 10 years. I think if the termis too long people would not believe it'). Side effects (Response cost). Only a few re- spondents from any category alluded to thepossibility of 'side effects'; 'I would want toknow whether it has side effect?'; and 'I wantto know about the side effects of the vaccineand the functional period of the vaccine'. Preferred route of administration (oral, in- jectable) (Response efficacy and responsecost). Although many people indicated a mod- est preference for oral vaccines; few peopleindicated that they would find an injectionunacceptable. Some respondents felt that chil-dren would prefer injections and others oralvaccines. Examples of comments include: 'Iwould probably prefer oral one, as an injectionis not convenient'; 'I would prefer an oral vac-cine for it is convenient and I am afraid ofinjections. Kids would prefer an injection ifthey don't like oral vaccines...none of the kidslikes oral vaccines. If there's a difference be-tween effects, I would prefer the more effec-tive way'; and, 'Adults would prefer an oralvaccine because they feel sting is better thanbitter in mouth. Adults would be less likely totake sweet oral vaccine because they don't likesweet. Children would prefer an oral vaccinebecause they are all afraid of pain. If they takean injection, they would cry for more time thantaking an oral vaccine'.Summary. One woman attempted to synthe- size this array of considerations in decision-making: 'I have heard of dysentery, but haven'tseen such a patient. I worry about it because ithasn't spread widely. Injection brings much pain.If an oral vaccine is provided, I would choosethis kind.... Besides that, we don't know if ithas side effects. We are all afraid of its poten-tial harmfulness. If the vaccine is effective, theprice is affordable and the period of validity islifetime, I would pay for it. If the period ofvalidity is short, I would rethink about it. If Ihear of patients with dysentery in the town-ship, I would take it because this disease isvery contagious'. Perceptions of adequacy of prevention pro- grams (Response efficacy and self-efficacy) Respondents generally express a high level of satisfaction with the services offered at the cli-nics. Vaccines and drugs are available and the lo-cation of the village clinics is convenient. Whilerarely necessary to travel to the township hospi-tal for medications or treatment, even this travelis not portrayed as burdensome. There is someperception that the clinics are especially well situ-ated to care for children and that in addition toproviding services for those who seek them, theclinics are actively involved in outreach efforts.There were a few comments raising some con-cerns about the quality of medical care providedby the village clinics, especially for serious ill-nesses. Typical comments regarding the ready avail- ability of vaccines and medications include: 'Allthese vaccines are given at the village clinics' and'Medical care and medications are available intime when people need. People can receive medi-cal care at clinics on credit when they can't af-ford it'. Indicative of the many comments support- ing the accessability and affordability of healthservices are: 'Villagers be treated timely,transportation is also convenient'; 'People in thecommunity can see a doctor and buy drugs ontime. There have personnel on duty in the cliniceveryday. If someone gets a serious illness, hecan call 120 for a doctor or provide an ambulanceservice. If he occasionally has no money to pay,he can buy drugs on credit'; 'Generally speak-RURAL CHINESE'S PERCEPTIONS OF SHIGELLA AND OF SHIGELLA VACCINE Vol 35 No. 1 March 2004 105ing, when they are ill the villagers can see doc- tors and buy drugs on time and if they get worsethe doctors will have home visit and serve them.The clinic location is not too far and about 5-6minutes by walking'; and 'All the patients can beexamined in time and can afford the medicine fee.Doctors would provide home visit if the patient'sillness is serious. There are about 5% of peoplein this village that cannot afford the medical fee,such as handicapped, childless elders, and someof the people who make their living by cultivat-ing farmland. If they had no money at that time,they can go to see the doctor on credit'. Several comments suggested that while ser- vices were available for all ages, children receiveda particular focus, especially with regard to vac-cines: 'Yes, there are immunization programs. Butmost target children 0-7 old'; 'Yes, thereare vaccinations for adults. But for hem-orrhagic fever and iodine deficient disease'; 'Yes,these efforts were done mainly for children frombirth to 7 years of age, eg measles vaccine, en- cephalitis vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine'; 'Mostof the immunizations are aimed at children under7 years old, for example measles vaccine, Japa-nese type-B encephalitis vaccine, hepatitis B vac-cine and, 'There is acounty-township-village three tiers network forpreventing care. But they mainly provide servicefor children under 14 years old'. Some respondents provided examples of the extensive outreach provided by the clinics to as-sure that patients received the services that theyrequire: 'Here all of children should take the vac-cine. No child will be missed because in the clinicthere have records about which children have beeninjected and who have not. Today you should takeand tomorrow he should do. So if some peopleforget it, the doctor will inform you by broad-cast. So we can reach 100% injection'. There were only two comments that raised any concerns about the quality of services. Onecomment suggested that serious illnesses mightnot be treated on a timely basis: 'People can seekmedical care and buy drugs for common diseasesin time. But some emergency or serious diseasescannot be cured in time'. Another comment sug-gested that doctors in rural areas might not be welltrained: 'You can see that the clinics with gooddoctors are located in central places, and the clin- ics with poor doctors were located outside of thecenter, while they were not very far from the cen-ter, when people want to buy some medicines theyonly chose the nearest clinics'. Opinions on how should information be con- veyed (Response efficacy) Respondents from all categories felt that the information could be conveyed by the staff in thePrevention Centers, the prevention doctors andthe doctors in the village health stations. Massmedia, including the local broadcast system (loudspeakers in each home) and television could beused to transmit the message. 'Information canbe provided by the doctor'; 'It is okay throughoral communication or by broadcast'; 'The doc-tors in the village health station should provideinformation'; 'It is enough for us to broadcast theeffect about the vaccine or to simply introducethe vaccine by the doctors in the village healthstation'; 'The doctors in the village health stationor township health center should provide infor-mation' and 'It is enough for us that the doctorssimply introduce the vaccine'. Several respondents indicated the potential strength of a collaborative effort on the part ofpublic health agencies and the mass media; 'Ithink that the department of public health shouldissue a document about the vaccine to hospitalsand then be delivered to clinics whose practitio-ners are familiar with this case and can make feed-back quickly. They should spread the informa-tion through broadcast, blackboard bulletins andleaflets or handbills'. A few respondents suggested that the schools might be a good vehicle for vaccine promotionand a few others suggested that a 'half-price sale'might stimulate interest: 'At first, if people canget the half-price or free charge vaccine, this willhelp the vaccine to be accepted. In addition, sus-ceptible population take the vaccine firstly, andif it has a good effect they will tell others, whichis helpful'; and, 'The price for these people whofirst want to be vaccinated should be free ofcharge, or the fee should be reduced by 50%,which can be taken as an advertising function.These people who can easily accept the vaccinecan be vaccinated first, then they can spread theinformation, maybe the effect will be better'.SOUTHEAST ASIAN J TROP MED PUBLIC HEALTH 106 Vol 35 No. 1 March 2004Opinions on types of information/messages that should be part of vaccination promo-tional activities (Response efficacy and re-sponse cost) Information perceived to be important about vaccines includes issues identified earlier regard-ing vaccine effectiveness, duration of protection,vaccine cost, and mode of administration. In ad-dition, respondents indicated that they wished toknow about vaccine safety, side effects andcontraindications. The occasional respondent wascontent to know that the vaccine had been ap-proved by the government and therefore felt thatno further information was required. Concernswere also expressed regarding the authenticity ofthe product. Examples of comments reflecting the need to know information about vaccine effectiveness,duration of protection, vaccine cost, mode of ad-ministration, vaccine safety and side effects in-clude: 'I want to know what happens after receiv-ing the vaccine and what's the benefit'; What dis-ease it can prevent? How long is its period of ef-fectiveness? Whether it has side effects. I haven'tthought about price'; 'I am concerned about thesecurity, side effect, target disease to prevent, ef-fectiveness, price, oral administration or not';'Effect? Period of validity? If it proved to be ef-fective, I would have no concern because expertsmanufacture it'; 'Yes, I need information aboutits validity, side effectand price'; and 'I want to know what kind of dis-ease it could prevent from and the period of va-lidity'. An example of someone who was contentto know that it had been approved by the govern-ment was: 'I needn't have any information (solong as the) government desires the vaccine'. Onerespondent was interested in contra indications:'I want to know about the side effects of the vac-cine, the functional period of the vaccine, the situ-ations for using it, for instance, if it can be usedat a time one catches a cold or has a fever'. Ex-amples of concerns about vaccine authenticityinclude: '...I want to know...whether it is fake ornot'; 'It should be provided by the government,not by a private source. It mustn't be a fake vac-cine'; 'Apply a laser anti-bogus label. People caneasily find out whether the vaccine is a real one';and 'It must be authentic and not a false one'.Other respondents asked for assurance that the vaccine has not exceeded its shelf-life ('It is noteasy to preserve vaccinations and we are con-cerned about whether it has lost its efficacy'). Onerespondent wanted to know if the vaccine werestill on trial or had it been demonstrated to beeffective while another would want to know if itwere a traditional Chinese vaccine or a modernWestern vaccine. DISCUSSION General These findings suggest that Protection Mo- tivation Theory offers a reasonable, albeit imper-fect, model on which to develop an understand-ing of vaccine utilization in China. Consistentwith this model, is the community's strong per-ception of 'Response Efficacy' of vaccines, par-ticularly in comparison with other preventivemaneuvers ( eg, the vaccine works while other preventive measures are less certain) and a highinterest in vaccines. While the disease was vari-ably perceived as 'severe' in the general popula- tion, the high value placed on children as a result of the 'one-child-per-couple' policy renders anydisease among children as a significant threat.People were accounting for potential 'ResponseCosts' in that most were interested in the price ofthe vaccine, side effects and trade-offs ( eg, should their money be spent on other vaccines againstdiseases which were more important). A few in-dividuals commented on the difficulty in avoid-ing cool fruits and fresh water in the summer sug-gesting that there are 'rewards' to be gained fromthe behaviors that place them at risk. Somewhat paradoxically however, given the constructs of this model, most individuals did notconsider themselves or their family members tobe particularly susceptible to the disease ('vul-nerability') although they were still interested inreceiving the vaccine. The perception of a rela-tively low prevalence of the disease is surprisingas higher shigellosis rates were observed in thissite compared to sites in Vietnam, Thailand,Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Indonesia (unpublisheddata). The prevalence of the disease may well berelated to the sanitation available in the region.Virtually all latrines inspected were directly con-RURAL CHINESE'S PERCEPTIONS OF SHIGELLA AND OF SHIGELLA VACCINE Vol 35 No. 1 March 2004 107nected to pig pens, where pigs are raised on hu- man excrement and other waste products (unpub-lished observations). While sanitation was notdirectly referred to by many responsible as a riskfactor, a misperception that cooling the bodythrough a drop in ambient temperature, particu-larly through a cold wind, can cause shigellosis,was frequently repeated. In general, there werenot substantial differences in perceptions betweenrespondents of different categories. One excep-tion to this similarity was a somewhat higher per-ception of severity among Community Residentsand Case Study respondents compared to KeyInformants and Community Leaders. Virtually allrespondents spoke highly of the health care fa-cilities in general and of the prevention programin particular. Several respondents expressed a fearof being sold fake vaccines through the privatesector, there was a sense of confidence that theofficial health care providers would provide thegenuine article. While no reports of fake vaccineshave been published, the distribution of fake drugswithout biological activity has been well docu-mented in Southeast Asia. (Newton et al, 2001). All respondents reflected sentiments indicative ofthe high value of children in society and attrib-uted it to China's policy on child bearing. Thereseemed to be a consensus to prioritize vaccina-tions for younger children, but there was also aninterest in being vaccinated by some of the adults. Potential limitations As with all qualitative studies, these results should be taken as hypothesis generating ratherthan confirmatory. The respondents were not ran-domly selected but rather by convenience sam-pling, and therefore may or may not be represen-tative of the views of the society at large. How-ever, the deliberate attempt to include differentcategories of individuals covering a wide agerange and professional range and both gendersshould mitigate against over-representation of asingle perspective. The finding that in generalviews were consistent across all these factors pro-vide additional evidence that these views are re-presentative of the local society. Finally, China isa large country and thus these views may or maynot be representative of perspectives from otherparts of the nation.Implications of the findings These data suggest that vaccine-seeking be- havior in China can be understood from the per-spective of Protection Motivation Theory, al-though quantitative confirmation of this hypo-thesis would be useful. Given these findings, avaccine promotion campaign could be designedaround the constructs of PMT. The respondentsindicate that any such campaign should involvethe health professionals as they are highly re-garded and trusted by society.
