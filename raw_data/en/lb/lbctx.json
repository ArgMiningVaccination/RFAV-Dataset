The mission of the DC Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency is to support and coordinate homeland security and emergencymanagement efforts, ensuring that the District of Columbia's all-hazardsemergency operations are prepared to protect against, plan for, respond to,and recover from natural and man-made hazards. This is accomplished by: Developing plans and procedures to ensure emergency response and recovery capabilities for all emergencies anddisasters; Coordinating emergency resources for emergencies and disaster incidents; Providing training for all emergency first responders, city employees, and the public; Conducting exercises; and Coordinating all major special events and street closings. In addition, in furtherance of its mission, HSEMA also: Serves as the central communications point during regional emergencies; Conducts an assessment of resources and capabilities foremergencies; Provides public awareness and outreach programs, and Provides 24-hour emergency operations center capabilities . In carrying out its mission the agency works closely with other emergency response agencies, including the Metropolitan Police Department, theDistrict of Columbia Department of Fire and Emergency Medical Services,the District of Columbia Department of Health and other District and fed-eral agencies, as well as with the major utility companies and non-profitand volunteer organizations such as the Red Cross and the Salvation Army. You and your community can be better prepared by learning how to prevent disasters before they strike. Contact HSEMA at 202-727-6161 or visit the website at http://hsema.dc.govdc-2 HSEMA ACUATION The District Department of Transportation ( DDOT ) has installed numerous emergency evacuation (E-Route) signs throughout the city. TheE-Route signs clearly identify the primary emergency evacuation routes,directing motorists to I-495 or the Mall. Citizens can easily identify the E-Routes by the Blue Evacuation signs on top of the streetsign as well as District stars and bars emblem located on the street signs.During an emergency, stay tuned to your local emergency station or listento emergency officials for instructions on which route to follow. The HSEMA website -- http://hsema.dc.gov -- contains information on emergency preparedness, the District Preparedness System, and other materials. The DDOT website -- http://ddot.dc.gov -- contains additional evacuation information. And, for general information or to report signal outages, call DDOT's 24-hour Hotline: 202-671-DDOT (3368) EV ACUATION MAP The map shown on the next page highlights the primary corridors radiating from downtown Washington, DC that have been identified asemergency event/evacuation routes (in red). Each of the routes extendsto the Capital Beltway (I-495) and beyond. During a major event or emergency situation, radial evacuation routes featuring traffic signals will be retimed. Selected traffic signals on eachradial corridor will be recalibrated to operate on a cycle length of 240seconds (4 minutes) with maximum green time allocated to the mainstreet. Signalized intersections between these selected traffic signals willbe operated on flash with yellow for the main street and red for the sidestreet. In addition, 20 intersections on the event/evacuation routes within Washington, DC will be manned with uniformed police officersto expedite the flow of traffic and to prevent bottlenecks. Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, between Rock Creek Park and the U.S. Capitol serves as the dividing line for event/evacuation routes. When evacuation is ordered, motorists north of Pennsylvania Avenue will be directed North, East, and West on radial event/evacuation routes; motorists south of Pennsylvania Avenue will be directed South, East, and West on radial event/evacuation routes. None of the routes cross and no vehicles will be permitted to cross Pennsylvania Avenue during an emergency evacuation. dc-3 HSEMA http://hsema.dc.gov WASHINGTON DC A REAEvent/Evacuation Routes N NATIONAL OCEANIC ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA) W EATHER RADIO NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) broadcasts National Weather Service (NWS) warnings, watches, forecasts,and other non-weather related hazard information 24hours a day. During an emergency, NWS sends a special tone that activates weather radios in the listening area. Weather radios equipped with a specialalarm tone feature can sound an alert and provide immediate informationabout a life-threatening situation. NOAA Weather Radios are found in many electronics stores and cost about $25-$100. Some features to consider are alarm tone, battery backup, and\"Specific Area Message Encoding\" (SAME) programming. NWR broadcasts warnings and post-event information for all types of hazards - weather (blizzards, winter/ice storms and torrential rain) , natural (floods, hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes), technological (chemical or oil spills, nuclear power plant emergencies, etc.) and national security emergencies . NOAA collaborates with other Federal agencies and the FCC's Emergency Alert System (EAS) to issue non-weather related emergency messages including the issuance of\"AmberAlerts\". Local NWS offices broadcast non-weather related emergency messages on NWR at the request of local or state government officials . During this type of emergency, officials provide text information about the hazard andrecommend protective actions for the affected areas. Programming Your NOAA Weather Radio After purchasing an NWR with \"Specific Area Message Encoding\", you should program it with coding for your area. Follow the manufacturer'sdirections to program your receiver using the six-digit SAME code(s) forthe warning areas of interest to you.

The confusion immediately following a disaster is scary - especially if you have not prepared yourself in advance and discussed these ideas with yourfamily members. Hopefully every time you see or hear about a disaster it makes you stop and think... \"What if that was me or my family?\" But what have YOU done to get yourself and your family ready? The best thing you can do to deal withany type of emergency situation is... BE AWARE ... BE PREPARED ... and... HA VE A PLAN ! If you do these 3 things, the life you save could be your own... because what you don't know CAN hurt you! The more the public is prepared for a disaster, the less strain we place on our local emergency services. Any major disaster will temporarily swampFirst Responders, therefore, both the Red Cross and the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency recommend persons to try to be self-sufficient for atleast 72 hours following a disaster. And if you are prepared for a longerperiod (like 2 to 4 weeks or more)... that's even better! A majority of this information was compiled from various publications provided by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, FEMA, PublicSafety Canada, the CDC, the Public Health Agency of Canada and othersto help assist you in preparing for various types of disasters and basic firstaid. It also offers suggestions on personal checklists and importanttelephone numbers for your family members and emergency groups thatcan be written in the spaces provided or attached inside this manual. Mostimportantly, there are many web sites throughout the book to help you findmore information. We realize you may not experience every type of disaster in your part of the world, but if you ever travel you could potentially be placed in a disaster situation so please educate yourself and your family. Please stop your hectic lives for just a few hours and sit down with your entire family (from children to seniors) to read this Manual and discuss howeach of you would handle these types of situations. It will be quality time with your loved ones and could save your lives! iv www.itsadisaster.net or call . . . . . . . . . . . .148 Tips call 1-888-999-4325Tips on Reducing the Spread of . . &Intl) . . .211About the for the Unexpected) . . . . . . FACTS & F IGURES Both natural and man-made disasters are becoming more common all around the world. El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events impact billions of peoplesince these climate extremes disrupt jet streams and regions of high and lowpressure. These disruptions can potentially increase or decrease weather-related disasters such as extreme heat and cold, floods, hurricanesand thunderstorms. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory Tropical Atmosphere Oceanproject, El Ni\u00f1o happens when tropical Pacific Ocean trade winds die outand ocean temperatures become unusually warm. La Ni\u00f1a occurs when thetrade winds blow unusually hard and sea temperatures become colder thannormal. These warm and cold phases are referred to as El Ni\u00f1o/SouthernOscillation, or ENSO, which has a period of roughly 3-7 years. AlthoughENSO originates in the tropical Pacific system, it has effects on patterns ofweather all over the world. 1 El Ni\u00f1o (warm episodes) occur about every 4-5 years and can last up to 12to 18 months. 2La Ni\u00f1a (cold episodes) conditions recur every few years and typically last 9 to 12 months but can persist for as long as 2 years.3 There are also periods where the system is neither warm nor cold (calledneutral conditions). Even though there is still much to learn about these systems and their impacts on the global community, ENSO forecasts can help individuals,businesses, and governments prepare for these events. To learn more about NOAA' s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory Tropical Atmosphere Ocean project visit www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao/ In addition to the climate extremes mentioned above, some key elements inthe increasing numbers of worldwide disasters include: Global warming / cooling, volcanic activity, sunspots, etc. Larger cities are sprawling into high-risk zones World population is over 7 billion and growing causingglobal water consumption to increase Humans damaging our natural resources (e.g. pollution, destroying rain forests, coral reefs, wetlands, etc.) As the warming and cooling debate rages on, keep in mind there's a lot of scientific data supporting and refuting both sides and many unknowns. Butone thing is for certain ~ disasters happen daily no matter what. www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325GENERAL FACTS & F IGURES ONDISASTERS As our violent planet's surface continues to shift and move it will continue to alter sea levels, food and water supplies and climate conditions aroundthe world. The costs of weather-related disasters in just the United States alone average $1 billion per week. Year after year it appears the most frequent natural disasters are wind- storms and floods, which combined usually account for 80%-90% of theworldwide economic losses. Every year hundreds of millions of people worldwide are evacuated or driven from their homes due to natural disasters. According to Munich Re, the following summarizes major catastrophes: Worldwide # of Major # of deaths by Year Economic Losses Disasters Major Disasters 2013 $125 billion (in US$) 880 20,000 2012 $160 billion (in US$) 900 9,5002011 $400 billion (in US$) 820 27,0002010 $130 billion (in US$) 950 295,0002009 $50 billion (in US$) 850 10,0002008 $200 billion (in US$) 750 220,0002007 $82 billion (in US$) 960 11,0002006 $45 billion (in US $) 850 18,0002005 $220 billion (in US $) 670 101,0002004 $150 billion (in US $) 650 245,4732003 $65 billion (in US $) 700 89,000 Please note the above figures do not include economic losses and deaths caused by smaller natural disasters that occur daily around the world. Alsonote that the years with a small number of deaths are usually due to the factthat few severe catastrophes occurred in developing countries, where disasters tend to have more human losses due to poor infrastructure, etc. Now let's look at some facts and figures on specific types of disasters to get a better understanding of how they impact our world. 2 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325FACTS & F IGURES BYTYPEOFDISASTER Avalanches, Landslides & Mudflows There are about 1 million snow avalanches worldwide each year. Flooding in Venezuela triggered landslides and mudflows that washed away entire villages and mountain slopes claiming over 30,000 lives in 1999. Earthquakes The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that several million earthquakesoccur each year but most go undetected. About 500,000 are detected eachyear - only 100,000 are felt and 100 cause damage. The world's deadliest earthquake on record hit central China in 1556 killing an estimated 830,000 people. Scientists believe the Cascadia Subduction zone along the Northwest coast- line could produce mega-quakes similar to the 9.0 that rocked Indonesia. Some of the strongest earthquakes in U.S. history occurred on the New Madrid fault (area between St. Louis and Memphis) in 1811-1812. Thisarea still experiences about 200 earthquakes a year. Aftershocks may be felt for several days, weeks, months or even years depending on the force of a major earthquake. Extreme Heat According to NOAA's National Climatic Data Center, 80% of the contigu-ous United States was in moderate-to-extreme drought back in July 1934. Today less than half a billion people live in water-stressed countries but projections indicate by 2025 that number could increase to 3 billion. Fire Fire kills more Americans every year than all natural disasters combined. At least 80% of all fire deaths occur in residences -- and careless smoking is the leading cause of fire deaths. And cooking fires (leaving foodunattended or human error) is the leading cause of home fires. Floods According to FEMA, everyone lives in a flood zone - it's just a question ofwhether you live in a low, moderate or high risk area. 3 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325More than 90% of declared disasters include flooding. Flash floods can cause walls of water reaching heights of 20 feet (6 m). Hailstorms On May 22, 1986 an unusual killer hailstorm in China's Sichuan Province left 9,000 people injured and 100 dead. The largest known hailstone ever measured in the U.S. was found in Vivian, SouthDakota in July 2010 with a record 8-inch (20.32 cm) diameter and a circumference of 18.625 inches (over 47 cm). Hazardous Materials As many as 500,000 products pose physical or health hazards and can bedefined as \"hazardous materials\" and over 1,000 new synthetic chemicalsare introduced each year. Each year about 400 million metric tons of hazardous wastes are generated worldwide. According to FEMA, varying quantities of hazardous materials are manu- factured, used, or stored at an estimated 4.5 million facilities in the U.S. Hurricanes, Cyclones &Typhoons The 2005 U.S. season broke records with 27 named storms (previous recordwas 21 in 1933) and 15 hurricanes (previous record was 12 in 1969). TheNational Hurricane Center states this cycle could last 10-20 more yearssimilar to the above-average activity from the 1940s through the 1960s. Nine out of 10 hurricane deaths are due to storm surge (a rise in the sea level caused by strong winds). Storm surges can get up to 20 feet (6 m) highand 50 miles (80 km) wide! One of the worst cyclone disasters in recorded history struck Bangladesh and India killing between 500,000 and 1 million people back in 1970. Nuclear Power Plants Japan's Fukushima core meltdowns caused by earthquakes, tsunami anddesign flaws demonstrate how critical multi-disaster planning is for plants. The April 1986 explosion at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant burned for 10 days releasing about 5% of the radioactive reactor core intothe atmosphere exposing millions of people to varying doses of radiation. 4 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Terrorism Between 1993 and 2006 there were 1,080 confirmed incidents of illicit trafficking in nuclear materials -- with 18 of these cases involving weapons-grade materials and another 124 involving material capable of making aso-called dirty bomb that would use conventional explosives to spreadnuclear material. 4 If a nuclear device is detonated in the air high above North America, itwould create a high-density electrical field called an electromagnetic pulse.According to FEMA, most electronic devices within 1,000 miles of a high-altitude nuke could be damaged by an EMP. Experts at the 2009 World Economic Forum at Davos estimated the global damage from data loss / cybercrimes now exceeds $1 trillion a year. Thunderstorms & Lightning At any given moment, about 2,000 thunderstorms can be in progress overthe face of the earth. There are 8 million lightning strikes per day!It is a myth that lightning never strikes the same place twice -- it often strikes the same site several times in the course of one storm. Tornadoes The U.S. has more tornadoes than any other place in the world and averagesbetween 1,200 to 1,300 tornado sightings each year. According to NOAA, 2004 had a record 1,817 tornado reports in the U.S., and 2012 and 2013 were below average with less than 900 tornadoes each. Tornadoes can last for several seconds or more than an hour, but most last less than 10 minutes. The force of a tornado can strip asphalt chunks off roads, rip clothes off people and pluck feathers off chickens. Tsunamis A tsunami [soo-nah\u00b4-mee] is a series of huge, destructive waves usuallycaused by an earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide or meteorite. The 2004 seaquake-generated tsunami that slammed 12 countries in the Indian Ocean is the deadliest on record with almost 187,000 people killedand 42,883 still missing. (Per UN OSE' s web site as of October 2006) 5 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325A tsunami is NOT a tidal wave \u2014 it has nothing to do with the tides. Volcanoes More than 65 active or potentially active volcanoes exist in the U.S. and over 40 of them are in Alaska. According to the Smithsonian Institution's Global V olcanism Program, about 1,300 volcanoes have erupted in the last 10,000 years and should beconsidered \"historically active\". This does not include the large number of eruptions from an estimated 1 million young volcanoes on the ocean's floorwhich pump out roughly 3/4 of the lava reaching the earth's surface. The \"Ring of Fire\" that encircles the Pacific Ocean has about 450 histori- cally active volcanoes. V olcanic eruptions can hurl hot rocks easily 20 miles (32 km) or more. Yellowstone National Park actually sits on top of a supervolcano which erupted 3 times in the past 2 million years forming 3 massive calderas (orhuge craters). The largest one (Yellowstone Caldera) is more than 60 miles(100 km) across. Some other large calderas formed by supervolcanoes are in Alaska, eastern California, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand and South America. Winter Storms / Extreme Cold The leading cause of death during winter storms is from automobile orother transportation accidents. Cold weather puts an added strain on the heart. Exhaustion or heart attacks caused by overexertion (like shoveling snow or pushing a car) are the second most likely cause of winter storm-related deaths. The risk of hypothermia is greatest among elderly persons who literally \"freeze to death\" in their own homes. 6 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Section 1 Family Emergency Plan, Kits &Shelter 7 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325FAMILY EMERGENCY PLANCHECKLIST The next time disaster strikes, you may not have much time to act and local first responders may not be able to reach you right away. PREPARE NOWfor a sudden emergency and discuss these ideas with your entire family tocreate a Family Emergency Plan . Even though this checklist looks long and scary, it is easy to do and can help you make a plan. We suggest you and your family review this list, then readthrough the Manual since there are many tips mentioned in varioustopics and Sections that could help develop your plan. PLEASE make some time in your busy lives to prepare for a disaster... a few minutes now could possibly save a life when a disaster hits. Remember- be aware... be prepared... and have a plan ! LEARN ABOUT RISKS &E XISTING PLANS : [ ] Find out which disasters could occur in your area and ask local officials how to prepare for each disaster, but read this Manual first. [ ] Ask how you will be warned of an emergency.[ ] Learn your community's evacuation routes and map them out using a free service like Google Maps or Mapquest or order Depiction. [ ] Ask about special assistance for elderly or disabled persons.[ ] Ask your workplace about emergency plans and learn about plans at your children's school(s) or day care center(s). TIPS ON MAKING YOUR FAMILY PLAN: (Review all and complete Family Emergency Plan on pages 12-13) : [ ] Meet with household members to talk about the dangers of fire, severe weather, earthquakes and other emergencies. Explain how torespond to each using the tips in this Manual. [ ] Find safe spots in your home for each type of disaster that affects your community. (see Section 2 for explanations of each disaster) [ ] Talk about what to do when there are power outages and injuries. [ ] Take a basic first aid and CPR class (or join a CERT - see page 224). 8 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325[ ] Draw a floor plan of your home showing doors, windows and stairways. Mark locations of first aid and disaster kits, fire extin-guishers, smoke detectors, ladders, and utility shut-off points. Next,use a colored pen to draw a broken line charting at least 2 escaperoutes from each room. And practice drills! [ ] Show family members how to turn off water, gas and electricity at the main switches when necessary. [ ] Post emergency telephone numbers near telephones and teach children how and when to call 9-1-1. (see Section 3) [ ] Make sure household members understand they should turn on the radio for emergency information. [ ] Pick one out-of-state and a local friend or relative for family mem- bers to call if separated during a disaster. (It is often easier to callout-of-state than within the affected area.) [ ] Pick two emergency meeting places in case you can't go home: 1) A place near your home. 2) A place outside the neighborhood. [ ] Teach children meeting places and emergency phone numbers in case you get separated during a crisis. [ ] Put ICE before a name and number in cell phone address books so First Responders would know who to call \" In Case of Emergency\". [ ] Make sure family members know how to send and receive photos and text messages (if you have those capabilities on your cells). Alsoconsider joining a network like Twitter or a local text message alertsystem to receive emergency broadcast warnings, updates, etc. [ ] Get some FRS walkie-talkies and teach family how to use them. [ ] Practice emergency evacuation drills with all household members at least two times each year. Also learn how to get involved with America's PrepareAthon! at www.ready.gov/prepare [ ] Consider doing a Living Will and/or a Healthcare Power of Attorney. [ ] Keep family records in a water- and fire-proof container. Consider keeping another set of records in a safety deposit box offsite. [ ] Check if you have enough insurance coverage. (see Section 2 for more information on flood insurance.) 9 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPS FOR ELDERLY & D ISABLED FAMILY MEMBERS : [ ] Ask about special aid that may be available in an emergency for elderly and disabled family members. Find out if assistance isavailable for evacuation and in public shelters. FEMA suggests people with a disability register with local fire department so helpcan be provided quickly in an emergency (if available in your area). [ ] Ask your children's teachers and caregivers about emergency plans for schools, day care centers or nursing homes. [ ] If you currently have a personal care attendant from an agency, check to see if the agency will be providing services at anotherlocation if there is an evacuation -- and tell family members. [ ] Learn what to do and where to go for each type of emergency. For example, basements are not wheelchair-accessible so you should have alternate safe places for different types of disasters for disabled or elderly persons. [ ] Learn what to do in case of power outages and injuries. Know how to start a back-up power supply for essential medical equipment! [ ] If someone in the home uses a wheelchair, make sure 2 exits are wheelchair-accessible in case one exit is blocked. [ ] Consider getting a medical alert system that will allow you to call for help if you have trouble getting around. [ ] Both elderly and disabled persons should wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace at all times if they have special needs. [ ] Talk to your doctor to ask if you can keep a 60-90 day supply of medications and special medical parts and supplies on-hand in case of emergency. [ ] Consider setting up a \"Buddy\" system with a roommate, trusted friend or neighbor. Give buddy a copy of your Family Emergency Plan and an extra house key or tell them where one is available. [ ] Consider putting a few personal items in a lightweight draw string bag (e.g. a whistle, some medications, a small flashlight, extrahearing aid batteries, etc.) and tie it to your wheelchair or walker foremergencies. Make sure to rotate items so current and working. [ ] Visit the National Organization on Disability web site to learn more about Emergency Preparedness issues at www.nod.org . 10 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPS FOR PETS OR LIVESTOCK / LARGE ANIMALS : TIPS FOR PETS [ ] If you have to evacuate your home, DO NOT leave pets behind! Make sure you take a secure pet carrier, leash or harness with you. [ ] Emergency shelters may not accept pets (unless it is a service animal). Find out which motels and hotels in your area allow pets inadvance of needing them. Ask your veterinarian or animal shelter ifthey board animals during a disaster or emergency. [ ] Make sure identification tags are current and securely fastened to pet's collar or get a microchip implanted in your pet. Keep a currentphoto in your wallet or cell phone for identification purposes. [ ] Make sure a roommate, trusted neighbor or friend has an extra house key to evacuate your pets in the event you are unavailable. TIPS FOR LIVESTOCK / L ARGE ANIMALS [ ] Evacuate livestock whenever possible. Make arrangements for evacuation, including routes and host sites, in advance. At least twoalternate evacuation routes should be mapped out as a backup. [ ] The evacuation site should have food, water, veterinary care, handlers, equipment and proper facilities. [ ] Trucks, trailers, and vehicles for transporting animals should be available with experienced handlers and drivers to transport them. [ ] If evacuation is not possible, a decision must be made whether to move large animals to available shelter or turn them outside. This decision should be based on the type of disaster and the soundnessand location of the shelter or structure. [ ] If you board animals, ask if facility has an evacuation plan in place. Next, we suggest you sit with your family and write down your Family Emergency Plan using the next 2 pages as a guide. Then review how to put together a Disaster Supplies Kit since you may not have much time if you are told to evacuate quickly. Again, we suggest you and family members read this manual together - especially your kids - since there are many tips here that could help youmake a plan and learn what to do if the unexpected happens. You may justwant to review the book first and then come back to this Section later. 11 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325FAMILY EMERGENCY PLAN EMERGENCY CONTACT NUMBERS (Post a copy of this information near phone and in kits for easy access.) Emergency Numbers In a life-threatening emergency, call 9-1-1 or local __________________ (Evening) ________________ Local Contact Name _________________________________________________Telephone (Day) __________________ (Evening) ________________ Family & Friends Work / Cell Numbers ______________________ / School Name: __________ / ____________ PLACES (ORAREAS ) In case you get separated during an emergency or disaster, decide on two Meeting Places or Areas where you can join each other. Include children in this decision so they understand why they should meet here. 1. Near your home (within 1 mile of your house) ________________ ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 2. Away from your home (at least 5 miles from your house) __________ ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Note: If these meeting places cannot be reached, text or send pictures of a new location or a landmark you are near so others can find you. 13 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325DISASTER SUPPLIES KIT Disasters happen anytime and anywhere -- and, when disaster strikes, you may not have much time to respond. And sometimes services may be cutoff or first responders can't reach people right away. Would you and yourfamily be prepared to cope until help arrives? Both FEMAand the Red Cross recommend keeping enough supplies in your home to meet your family's needs for at least three days (we suggest 2 to 4 weeks or more in home.) Once disaster threatens or hits, you may nothave time to shop or search for supplies ... but, if you've gathered suppliesin advance in your Disaster Supplies Kit , your family could handle an evacuation or shelter living easier. And since everything is alltogether in one place... all you gotta do is GRAB & GO ! Put items you'd most likely need (water, food, first aid, emergency items, etc.) in a container that is easy-to-carry and that will fit in your vehicle. Forexample, a large trash can or storage container with a lid that snaps shuttightly (some even come with wheels), or a waterproof backpack or largeduffel bag (waterproof, if possible) would be useful. We're also including suggestions for a CAR KIT and a CLASSROOM / LOCKER / OFFICE KIT since these are usually the most common placesyou would be if and when a disaster strikes. There are seven basic categories of supplies you should stock in your home kit: water , food , first aid supplies ,tools and emergency supplies , sanitation, clothing and bedding , and special items . Take advantage of sales and stock up as you can -- also put dates on food cans or labels to show when they were purchased. Supplies should ALL be checked every 6 months to make sure they are still good and working!We suggest you mark dates on your calendar and have the entire family helpcheck all the items together. It'll be good quality time with the family andgive you all a chance to update any phone numbers or information that haschanged. WATER A normally active person needs to drink at least 2 quarts (2 litres) of watereach day and possibly as much as a gallon (4 litres) a day. [ ] Store one gallon of water per person per day (two quarts/litres for drinking and two quarts/litres for food preparation and sanitation). 14 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325[ ] Keep at least a 3 day supply of water (or more) for each person in home and store extra water for pets. Rotate new cases / bottles every 6 months. Consider getting large 55-gallon drums or containers forlong-term water storage from a reputable dealer and treat the water. [ ] Consider purchasing a certified portable water purification filter.[ ] Review TIPSONWATERPURIFICATION at end of Section 2. FOOD Choose foods that require no refrigeration, preparation or cooking and little or no water. If you must heat food, pack a can of sterno or a smallpropane camping stove. Select foods that are compact and lightweight androtate food out every 6 months. (Keep items like this handy in pantry too.) [ ] Ready-to-eat canned meats, fish, fruits, and vegetables (and put in a manual can opener !!) Make sure cans don't have dents in them. [ ] Canned juices, milk, soups (if powder or cubes, store extra water)[ ] Staples - sugar, salt, pepper[ ] High energy foods - peanut butter, jelly, crackers, granola bars, trail mix, nuts, jerky, dried fruits, Emergency Food bars, etc. [ ] Vitamins & herbs (e.g. a good multiple, Vitamins C &E, garlic pills [boosts immune], L-Tyrosine [an amino acid for stress], etc.) [ ] Foods for infants, elderly persons or persons on special diets[ ] Foods for your pet (if necessary)[ ] Comfort / stress foods - cookies, hard candy, suckers, sweetened cereal, instant coffee, tea bags, powdered drink mixes, etc. [ ] Some companies offer survival and long-term storage foods that are freeze dried and sold in months, 1-year, and 2-year supplies FIRST AIDKITS You should always be prepared and keep a First Aid Kit in your home and in every car and make sure everyone knows where kits are and how to usethem. And if you like the outdoors (hiking, biking, etc.) you should carry asmall Kit in your fanny pack or backpack as a precaution. 15 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325There are many different sizes of First Aid Kits on the market that vary in price. You can also make your own kits using things that may already be inyour home. Consider including the following items in a waterproof container or bag so you can be prepared for almost any type of emergency. We realize there are a lot of items suggested here, but the more you prepare ... the better off you and your family will be during a disaster situation. ITEMS TO INCLUDE IN FIRST AID KIT - Ace bandage(s)- Adhesive bandages in assorted sizes- Adhesive tape- Antibiotic ointment or gel- Antiseptic towelettes- Assorted sizes of safety pins &needles- Box of Baking soda- Cleansing agent (isopropyl alcohol, hydrogen peroxide and/or soap)- Cold & Heat packs- Contact lens solution and Eyewash solution- Cotton and Cotton swabs- Copy of IT'S A DISASTER! manual - Dental repair kit (usually near toothpaste section)- Disposable Face shield for Rescue Breathing- Disposable gloves- Face masks (with N95 rated particulate filter and/or Nanomasks)- Flashlight & batteries - check often to make sure it works & batteries are good (Tip: remove batteries while stored or get hand crank units) - Gauze pads- Hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol)- Hydrogen peroxide- Lip balm (one with SPF is best)- Liquid bandage (to seal cuts or scrapes) - Moleskin (for blisters on feet)- Petroleum jelly or other lubricant- Plastic bags- Roller gauze- Scissors- Small bottle of hand lotion- Snake bite kit with extractor- Sunscreen (one with SPF 30 or higher and 3 or 4 star UV Aprotection)- Thermometer- Tweezers NON-PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO INCLUDE IN FIRST AID KIT - Activated charcoal (use if advised by the Poison Control Center) 16 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325- Antacid (for upset stomach) - Anti-diarrhea medication- Antihistamine and decongestant (for allergic reactions or allergies and sinus problems) - Aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen sodium- Laxative- Potassium Iodide (see NUCLEAR POWER PLANT EMERGENCY) - Vitamins & herbs (e.g. a good multiple, Vitamins C & E, garlic pills or zinc [boosts immune sys], L-Tyrosine [amino acid for stress], etc.) PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO INCLUDE IN FIRST AID KIT Since it may be hard to get prescriptions filled during a disaster, talk to yourphysician or pharmacist about storing these types of medications. Keep a 3-month supply of medications and supplies on-hand if at all possible. Andmake sure to check labels for special instructions and expiration dates. TIPS ON SOME INEXPENSIVE FIRST AID ITEMS Activated charcoal - absorbs poisons and drugs in the stomach and intes- tines and helps prevent toxins from being absorbed into the bloodstream bycoating intestinal walls. (Check with the Poison Control Center before tak-ing since it doesn't work on all toxic substances.) It's found at natural foodsstores and pharmacies in powder, liquid, and capsule forms. Capsules canbe broken open to use powder for making a paste on insect bites and stings. Baking soda - aid for heartburn or indigestion; use as substitute for tooth- paste; sprinkle in bath water for sore muscles or bites & stings; or make apaste (3 parts baking soda to 1 part water) to use on stings or insect bites,poison ivy, canker sores, sunburn, and rashes (but too strong for infants!) Hydrogen peroxide - can help clean and disinfect wounds, treat canker sores, gingivitis, and minor earaches. Also can be used for cleaning handsor for brushing teeth. (The reason it foams up on skin or item is because ofthe oxygen at work - means it's killing germs!) Meat tenderizer - (check ingredient list on bottle for \"papain\") make a paste to use on insect bites and stings. Papain is a natural enzyme derivedfrom papaya that can help break down insect venom. Vinegar - helps relieve jellyfish stings, sunburn, and swimmer's ear.

You may not have time to shop or search for items once a disaster threatens or hits so make your kits now so you're prepared for the unexpected. Some things to keep in mind include ... Store your Disaster Supplies Kit in convenient place known to ALL family members. Keep a smaller version in the trunk or back of every vehicle (see CARKIT). Keep items in airtight plastic bags to keep them dry in kit. Take advantage of end-of-season clearance sales and grocerysales (esp. can goods) and stock up as you can. Look aroundyour home since you may be able to put a lot of these thingstogether from what is already on shelves or in drawers ormedicine cabinets. Replace your stored food and water supply every 6 months.It's best to test or replace batteries at this time too. Make agame of it by keeping track on a calendar or on a posterdrawn by children so they can help. Also, everyone shouldmeet every 6 months anyway to go over the Family Emergency Plan and update any data (phone numbers, address changes, etc.) Suggestion: Do this every Daylight Savings time - it' s twice a year on a weekend so easy toremember. Ask your physician or pharmacist about storing prescriptionmedicines. Visit the U.S. Department of Homeland Security web site formore tips about Kits at www.ready.gov 23 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325THINK ABOUT SHELTER Sheltering may take many forms since it depends on the type of disaster or situation. There may be times where you and your family may need to\"shelter-in-place\" meaning you stay put wherever you are (home, school,work or car) until wicked weather passes or local authorities say it's okayto come out. Or, in some cases, your family may have to leave your homeand go to a shelter or mass care facility determined by local officials (likea high school gym or convention center.) For example, during a tornado warning you should seek shelter in a base- ment or an inside room away from windows. However, during a hazardousspill or chemical attack you should take shelter in a room above ground andpossibly seal off room to keep gas or fumes from coming in. Or if there's awildfire nearby or a hurricane brewing along the Coast your family mayneed to evacuate your home. Some things you should talk about in advance with family include: Make a plan - Develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kits for home, car and office / locker (covered on previous pages). Make sure you include important paperwork, money, etc. Pick safe rooms - Talk about which room would be best for each type of disaster that may occur where you live. Where would we go? - Decide in advance where you would go in case you can't return home for weeks or months .. or ever. If your home is damagedor destroyed or you're forced to leave your home due to on-going threats(like mudslides or flooding), you will need to find temporary or permanentliving quarters. This could mean staying in a public shelter or hotel, livingwith friends or relatives, or renting a home or apartment in the middle of allthe chaos, so discuss several options now. Then, write down those optionsand share them with relatives and friends. Away from home - Learn \"shelter-in-place\" procedures at work and school so everyone knows what to expect for each type of disaster or incident. Also review specific disasters in Section 2 for additional things to think about and do as it relates to sheltering. For example, fallout and pole-covered trench shelters are covered in the TERRORISM topic. And seeTIPSONRECOVERINGFROMADISASTER and TIPSONSHELTERLIVING DURING OR AFTER AN EMERGENCY at the end of Section 2. By planning ahead, your family will know where to go and what to do which can help reduce some fear and anxiety that surrounds a disaster. 24 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Section 2 Disaster Preparedness, Prevention & Recovery 25 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325WHAT TO DOBEFORE A D ISASTER STRIKES (MITIGATION TIPS)... There are many things you can do to protect yourself, your home and your property BEFOREany type of natural hazard or disaster strikes. One of themost important things citizens can do is learn about hazards and risks inyour area and take personal responsibility to prepare for the unexpected. Please realize that natural disasters have common elements that overlap (like wind and floods) and we are only summarizing some key topics hereto help get you started. There are many mitigation tips and programs available from government agencies, public and private businesses, nonprofits and NGOs listed hereand in Section 4 of this book that can help you and your family learn more. WHAT IS MITIGATION ? Mitigation simply means an effort to lessen the impact disasters have onpeople, property, communities and the economy. It is also about reducing oreliminating risks before disasters strike and involves planning, commit-ment, preparation and communication between local, state and federal government officials, businesses and the general public. Some examples of mitigation include installing hurricane straps to secure a structure's roof to its walls and foundation, building outside of flood plains,securing shelves and loose objects inside and around the home, developingand enforcing effective building codes and standards, using fire-retardantmaterials ... and the list goes on and on. Remember... the more you prepare BEFORE disaster strikes, the better off you and your loved ones will be financially, emotionally and physically. FEMA' SMITIGATION DIRECTORATE The Federal Emergency Management Agency's Mitigation Directorate manages the National Flood Insurance Program and oversees a number ofFEMA's programs and activities like the National Hurricane Program,National Dam Safety Program, National Earthquake Hazards ReductionProgram and others. Plus the Divisionprovides citizens information aboutsafe rooms and flood insurance, and small businesses can learn about Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) loans and other cost-saving mitigation tips forstructures and property. Learn more at www.fema.gov 26 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Soon we'll explain what to do BEFORE, DURINGand AFTER specific types of natural and man-made disasters and emergencies. But first thereare some things you should do in advance that take time and planning... otherwise known as prevention or mitigation tips. Also review theBEFORE sections of specific topics for additional tips. MITIGATION TIPS TO HELP PREVENT DAMAGE AND LOSS AIR QUALITY MITIGATION We want to briefly mention indoor air quality here since it affects so manypeople at home, school and work (especially children and the elderly). Poorair quality often results naturally from many environmental and weather-related factors. There are things people can do like install a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA )filter in your central heating and cooling system (or get a portable filter) to remove contaminants. There are also kits available fortesting home, work and school environments so please learn more about carbon monoxide ,mold , and radon by visiting or calling ... EPA's Indoor Air Quality: www.epa.gov/iaq or call 1-800-438-4318 Center for Disease Control's National Center for Environmental Health Air Pollution & Respiratory Health: www.cdc.gov/nceh/airpollution National Radon Info Line: 1-800-SOS-Radon or www.epa.gov/radon EARTHQUAKE MITIGATION A lot of the ongoing research by scientists, engineers and emergencypreparedness officials has resulted in improvements to building codesaround the world. Proven design and construction techniques are availablethat help limit damage and injuries. There are some things you can do toreduce risk in earthquake-prone areas: Consider retrofitting your home There are options to retrofit or reinforce your home's foundation and frameavailable from reputable contractors who follow strict building codes.Other earthquake-safety measures include installing flexible gas lines andautomatic gas shutoff valves. Changes to gas lines and plumbing in yourhouse must be done by a licensed contractor who will ensure that the workis done correctly and according to code. This is important for your safety. Secure loose stuff Use nylon straps or L-braces to secure cabinets, book-cases and other tall furniture to the wall. 27 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325 Secure heavy appliances like water heaters, refrigerators, etc. using bands of perforated steel (plumber's tape). Use buckles or safety straps to secure computers, TVs,stereos and other equipment to tabletops. Use earthquake or florist putty to tack down glassware, heirlooms and figurines. FIRE MITIGATION Home fire protection is very important and covered on pages 52-53. Alsosee Wildfire Mitigation to learn additional ways to protect your home. FLOOD MITIGATION Flood damage is normally the second most common disaster-related expense of insured losses reported worldwide. Many natural disasters likehurricanes, rain, thunderstorms, and melting snow cause flooding. Livingnear a dam or levee also increases flood risks. According to FEMA, everyone lives in a flood zone - it's just a question of whether you live in a low, moderate or high risk area. There are certain partsof North America known as \"flood plains\" that are at high risk of floods.Consider contacting your local emergency management official to use theFlood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) or to develop a community-basedapproach since there may be funds available to assist you and your area. Some examples of State grant programs officials can access include the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program ( HMGP ), Flood Mitigation Assistance Pre-Disaster Mitigation ( PDM ) Program. Individual citizens cannot apply for grant money but local agencies or nonprofit organizations may apply on behalf of citizens. But I have insurance... Insurance companies will cover some claims due to water damage like abroken water main or a washing machine that goes berserk. However, standard home insurance policies DO NOT generally cover flood (or mud)damage caused by natural events or disasters! The U.S. offers a National Flood Insurance Program available in most communities and there is a waiting period for coverage. Talk to your insur-ance agent or call NFIP at 1-888-379-9531 or visit www.floodsmart.gov . Currently Canadians do not have a national flood program, however certain parts of Canada offer limited flood-damage coverage but it must bepurchased year-round and rates are relatively high. Visit www.ibc.ca 28 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Move valuables to higher ground If your home or business is prone to flooding, you should move valuables and appliances out of the basement or ground level floors. Elevate breakers, fuse box and meters Consider phoning a professional to elevate the main breaker or fuse box andutility meters above the anticipated flood level so flood waters won't damage your utilities. Also consider putting heating, ventilation and airconditioning units in the upper story or attic to protect from flooding. Protect your property Build barriers and landscape around homes or buildings to stop or reducefloodwaters and mud from entering . Also consider sealing basement walls with waterproofing compounds and installing \"check valves\" in sewer trapsto prevent flood water from backing up into drains. LIGHTNING MITIGATION Here are some safety tips to prepare your home for lightning. Install a Lightning Protection System A lightning protection system does not prevent lightning from striking butdoes create a direct path for lightning to follow. Basically, a lightningprotection system consists of air terminals (lightning rods) and associatedfittings connected by heavy cables to grounding equipment. This providesa path for lightning current to travel safely to the ground. Install surge protectors on or in home Surge protection devices (SPDs) can be installed in the electrical panel toprotect your entire home from electrical surges. Sometimes it may benecessary to install small individual SPDs in addition to the home unit forcomputers and television sets due to different ratings and voltage levels. If a home unit is too expensive, consider getting individual SPDs that plug into the wall for the refrigerator, microwave and garage door openers.Appliances that use two services (cable wire and electrical cord) mayrequire combination SPDs for computers, TVs, and VCRs. (Better yet -consider getting an uninterrupted power supply [UPS] with surge protectionand battery backup so you can shut down computers safely.) POWER LOSS MITIGATION (TIPS ON GENERATORS ) Many disasters (including human error) can cause a loss of power for hours, days or weeks. One way to prepare for a power outage is to have agenerator on-hand, but be aware of the potential hazards that come with itand learn how to use it properly! 29 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Find the right size for your home or business Generators come in many shapes and sizes. Permanent standby generators are connected to the main electrical supply of your home or building andmust be installed by a qualified, licensed electrician. Portable generators aremore convenient and less expensive, but you should determine how muchpower is needed for your facility before you buy something. Make a list of the items you'll need to run during a power outage, then total up the watts needed for each device. (Check the manufacturer's paperworkfor each unit or hire an electrician to help you calculate this total.) Alsoremember to include both \"starting\" and \"running\" wattage requirements.Starting amounts may only last a few seconds but can cause overloadingand damage your generator or appliances if not calculated properly. Generator safety tips Do not plug a generator into a wall outlet or main electri-cal supply coming into a building since it could backfeedand kill utility workers repairing the lines! NEVER use generators in homes/offices, garages, base-ments or partially enclosed places. Keep them outdoorsand away from windows, doors and vents. Read the manual that comes with your unit and follow themanufacturer's instructions. Shut off generator and let it cool before refueling, andstore fuel outside of living areas. Install carbon monoxide (CO) alarms in your home andoffice and test them often. The U.S. Fire Administration (USFA)has two fact sheets about generator safety and the dangers of carbon monoxide. Download both atwww.usfa.dhs.gov/citizens/co/index.shtm WILDFIRE MITIGATION As our population continues to grow, more and more people are buildinghomes in places that were once pristine wilderness areas. Homeowners whobuild in remote and wooded areas must take responsibility for the way theirbuildings are constructed and the way they landscape around them. Use Fire Resistant Building Materials The roof and exterior structure of your home and other buildings should beconstructed of non-combustible or fire-resistant materials. If wood siding,cedar shakes or any other highly combustible materials are used, theyshould be treated with fire retardant chemicals. 30 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Landscape wisely Plant fire-resistant shrubs and trees to minimize the spread of fire and space your landscaping so fire is not carried to your home or other surroundingvegetation. Remove vines from the walls of your home. Create a \"safety zone\" around the house Mow grass regularly. Stack firewood at least 30 to 100 feet (10 to 30 m) awayand uphill from home. Keep roof and gutters free of pine needles, leaves, andbranches and clear away flammable vegetation at least 30to 100 feet (9 to 30 m) from around structures. Thin a 15-foot (4.5 m) space between tree crowns andremove limbs within 10-15 feet (3 - 4.5 m) of the ground. Remove dead branches that extend over the roof. Prune tree branches and shrubs within 10 feet (3 m) of a stovepipe or chimney outlet. Remove leaves and rubbish from under structures. Ask power company to clear branches from power lines. Keep combustibles away from structures and clear a 10-foot (3 m) area around propane tanks, boats, etc. Protect your home Install smoke detectors, test them each month and change batteries once a year. Install protective shutters or fire-resistant drapes. Inspect chimneys twice a year and clean every year. Cover chimney and stovepipe flue openings with 1/2 inch (1 cm) or smaller non-flammable mesh screen. Use same mesh screen beneath porches, decks, floor areasand home itself. Also screen openings to attic and roof. Soak ashes and charcoal briquettes in water for two daysin a metal bucket. Keep a garden hose connected to an outlet. Have fire tools handy (ladder, shovel, rake, ax, etc.) Put address on all structures so it can be seen from road. WINDMITIGATION Wind damage is the most common disaster-related expense and usually accounts for 70% or more of the insured losses reported worldwide. Many natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, microbursts or thunderstorms, 31 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325and winter storms include damaging winds. And certain parts of the world experience high winds on a normal basis due to wind patterns. Realize when extreme winds strike they are not constant - they rapidly increase and decrease. A home in the path of wind causes the wind tochange direction. This change in wind direction increases pressure on partsof the house creating stress which causes the connections between buildingcomponents to fail. For example, the roof or siding can be pulled off or thewindows can be pushed in. Strengthen weak spots on home Experts believe there are four areas of your home that should be checkedfor weakness -- the roof, windows, doors and garage doors. Homeownerscan take some steps to secure and strengthen these areas but some thingsshould be done by an experienced builder or contractor. ROOF: Truss bracing or gable end bracing (supports placed strate- gically to strengthen the roof) Anchors, clips and straps can be installed (may want tocall a professional since sometimes difficult to install) WINDOWS and DOORS: Storm shutters (for windows, French doors, sliding glass doors, and skylights) or keep plywood on hand Reinforced bolt kits for doors GARAGE DOORS: Certain parts of the country have building codes requiring garage doors to withstand high winds (check with local building officials) Some garage doors can be strengthened with retrofit kits (involves installing horizontal bracing onto each panel) Secure mobile homes Make sure your trailer or mobile home is securely anchored. Consult themanufacturer for information on secure tiedown systems. Secure or tie down loose stuff Extreme winds can also cause damage from flying debris that can act likemissiles and ram through walls, windows or the roof if the wind speeds arehigh enough. You should consider securing large or heavy equipment insideand out to reduce some of the flying debris like patio furniture, barbequegrills, water heaters, garbage cans, bookcases and shelving, etc. 32 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Consider building a shelter or \"safe room\" Shelters or \"safe rooms\" are designed to provide protection from the high winds expected during hurricanes, tornadoes and from flying debris.Shelters built below ground provide the best protection, but be aware theycould be flooded during heavy rains. FEMA provides an excellent free booklet called \"Taking Shelter From the Storm: Building a Safe Room Inside Your House\" developed in associationwith the Wind Engineering Research Center at Texas Tech University.Learn more by visiting www.fema.gov/safe-rooms WINTER STORM & E XTREME COLD MITIGATION Severe winter weather causes deterioration and damage to homes everyyear. There are many things you can do to prepare for the bitter cold, iceand snow in advance to save you money and headaches in the long run.Some of these tips should be used by apartment dwellers too. \"Winterize\" your home Insulate walls and attic. Caulk and weather-strip doors and windows. Install storm windows or cover windows with plastic filmfrom the inside to keep warmth in. Detach garden hoses and shut-off water supply to faucets. Install faucet covers or wrap with towels and duct tape. Show family members the location of your main watervalve and mark it so you can find it quickly. Drain sprinkler lines or well lines before the first freeze. Keep inside temperature of your home at 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or higher. Wrap pipes near exterior walls with towels or heatingtape. Change furnace filters regularly and have it serviced. Make sure you have good lighting from street and drive-ways to help others see snow and ice patches and try tokeep paths clear of drifts. Remove dead tree branches since they break easily. Cover fireplace openings with fire-resistant screens. Check shingles to make sure they are in good shape. Preventing \"ice dams\" A lot of water leakage and damage around outside walls and ceilings are 33 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325actually due to \"ice dams\". Ice dams are lumps of ice that form on gutters or downspouts and prevent melting snow from running down. An attic withno insulation (like a detached garage) or a well-sealed and insulated atticwill generally not have ice dams. But if the roof has peaks and valleys, ispoorly insulated, or has a large roof overhang, ice dams usually happen. Some tips to prevent ice dams: Keep gutters and downspouts clear of leaves and debris. Find areas of heat loss in attic and insulate it properly. Wrap or insulate heating duct work to reduce heat loss. Remove snow buildup on roof and gutters using snow rake or soft broom. Consider installing roof heat tapes (electric cables) thatclip onto shingles' edges to melt channels in ice.(Remember, cables use a lot of energy and may not lookpretty but could help on homes with complicated roofs.) Preventing frozen pipes Keep doors open under sinks so heat can circulate. Run a slow trickle of lukewarm water and check waterflow before going to bed and when you get up. (First signof freezing is reduced water flow so keep an eye on it.) Heat your basement or at least insulate it well. Close windows and keep drafts away from pipes since airflow can cause pipes to freeze more often. MITIGATION TIPSSUMMARY ... Take responsibility... Basically, no matter where you live, YOU should take personal responsibil-ity and prepare yourself, your family and your property BEFORE disasters or natural hazards strike. ...and learn more! After reviewing the remainder of this manual, please contact your localemergency officials or your local building department to learn about all therisks in your area and what to expect if disaster strikes. Or visit FEMA's \"Plan, Prepare &Mitigate\" section at www.fema.gov 34 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Remember ... it's not a matter of IF but rather WHEN a disaster of some type will affect you or a loved one. The best thing you can do to deal withANY type of disaster is... BE AWARE ... BE PREPARED ... and... HA VE A PLAN ! If you do these 3 things, the life and property you save could be your own... because what you don't know CAN hurt you! Now we are going to briefly summarize some key players involved in the response process. Then we'll cover what to do BEFORE , DURING and AFTER specific types of natural and man-made disasters (sorted alphabetically). We then cover some tips on RECOVERINGFROMADISASTER (includes many \"AFTER\" tips that apply to most every type of disaster) andon SHELTERLIVING .

Section 4 contains many helpful telephone numbers and web sites of various agencies and organizations. And finally, we ask you please take some time to review the Appendixes , resources and web sites near the back of this manual. As mentioned in the Introduction, a majority of this data was compiled from various publications provided by the U.S. Department of HomelandSecurity and FEMA, the CDC, Public Safety Canada, the Red Cross andothers to assist you in preparing for various disasters. We realize you may not experience every type of disaster or emergency in your part of the world but, if you ever travel away from home, you couldpotentially be placed in a disaster situation so please educate yourself andyour family. Knowledge is power and can help reduce fear and anxiety. 35 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325WHORESPONDS DURING A DISASTER OR EMERGENCY ? During a crisis, government agencies, volunteers, nonprofits, churches, the private sector and citizens come together to help communities devastatedby a disaster or emergency. We don't have enough space to acknowledge allthe amazing groups who contribute their time and energy during theresponse and recovery phases, but here are some of the key playersinvolved. Local Fire - provides fire protection and response, EMS support, Search and Rescue and hazardous materials (HAZMAT) response among manyother roles. V olunteers make up 90% of fire companies nationwide. Local Law enforcement - work closely with agencies on scene to secure the area, gather data, maintain order, enforce laws and protect communities. Local Emergency Management - runs the emergency operations center (EOC) and manages response and recovery efforts. The EM office alsoworks closely with state and Federal officials. Local EMS - are paramedics and emergency medical technicians who can provide immediate medical assistance to the wounded. Disaster medicalassistance teams (or DMATs) made up of EMSprofessionals are oftendeployed to assist areas overwhelmed by an emergency or disaster. Local Public Health - supports EMSby sending in doctors and nurses who care for patients while health-care workers (like psychologists, social workers and others) assist with recovery. State agencies - provide support for above local agencies, especially when a crisis overwhelms an area. They also help interface with Federal officials. National Guard - can be called up by the Governor to support fire, police, EMS and health officials during a disaster. They can provide manpower byhelping distribute food, water and medicine or aid with law enforcementefforts. The NG also has heavy equipment that can help with debris removalor deliver supplies using air support. Federal agencies - respond once a Governor has requested their assistance. FEMAreviews the request and, if merited, recommends action to the WhiteHouse for the President to decide if it should be declared a major disaster. Nonprofits, volunteers, faith-based groups, businesses and citizens - donate money, time, supplies and services to victims and communities. 36 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... AV ALANCHES , LANDSLIDES & M UDFLOWS ? Avalanches - masses of loosened snow or ice that tumble down the side of a mountain, often growing as it descends picking up mud, rocks, trees anddebris triggered by various means including wind, rapid warming, snowconditions and humans. Landslides - masses of rock, earth or debris that move down a slope and can be caused by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and by humans whodevelop on land that is unstable. Mudflows - rivers of rock, earth, and other debris soaked with water most- ly caused by melting snow or heavy rains and create a \"slurry\". A \"slurry\"can travel several miles from its source and grows in size as it picks uptrees, cars, and other things along the way just like an avalanche! Please note, first we cover some very basic things on avalanches then we'll cover landslides and mudflows. Avalanche Basics Snow avalanches are a natural process and happen about a million timesper year worldwide. Contrary to what is shown in the movies, avalanchesare not triggered by loud noises like a shout or a sonic boom -- it's just not enough force. An avalanche is actually formed by a combination of several things -- a steep slope (the terrain), the snowpack, a weak layer inthe snowpack, and a natural or artificial \"trigger\". Nearly everyone caught in an avalanche is skiing, snowboarding, riding a snowmobile, snowshoeing, hiking or climbing in the backcountry and they,or someone in their party, almost always trigger the avalanche. Accordingto the American Avalanche Association, the majority of victims are white,educated men between the ages of 18-35 who are very skilled at their sport. BEFORE ANAV ALANCHE : Learn risks - Ask about local risks by contacting your local emergency management office (see Section 4 for State and Provincial listings), especially if visiting or moving to an \"avalanche-prone\" area. Take a course - Professional trainers and educators offer a variety of ava- lanche safety training courses and levels ranging from recreational novicesto backcountry experts. To learn more visit www.avalanche.org 37 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Know your colors - Learn the Avalanche Danger Scales and corresponding colors used where you live or plan to visit. Get equipped - Carry gear like portable shovels, collapsible probes, high frequency beacons (transceivers), airbag, etc. and learn how to use it! Check it out - Check forecasts and avalanche advisories before going out. Turn it on - Switch beacon on prior to entering the backcountry! Check the battery strength and verify the \"transmit\" and \"receive\" functionality witheveryone in your group to ensure beacons are picking up both signals. Secure it - Before crossing a snow covered slope in avalanche terrain, fasten clothing securely to keep snow out and remove your ski pole straps. DURING AN AV ALANCHE : Bail - Try to get out of the way if possible! (For example, if a skier or boarder - ski out diagonally... if on a snowmobile - drive downhill, etc.) If YOUare caught in the avalanche... Scream and drop it - Yell and drop your ski poles (or anything in your hands) so they don't drag you down. Start swimming - Use \"swimming\" motions, thrusting upward to try to stay near the surface of the snow. Prepare to make an air pocket - Try to keep your arms and hands moving so the instant the avalanche stops you can make an air pocket in front ofyour face by punching in the snow around you before it sets. If you see SOMEONE ELSE caught in the avalanche... Watch - Keep an eye on victim as they are carried downhill esp. the last point you saw them. AFTER AN AV ALANCHE : If YOUare caught in the avalanche... Make an air pocket ASAP! - The INSTANT the avalanche stops try to maintain an air pocket in front of your face by using your hands and armsto punch in the snow and make a pocket of air. (You only have 1-3 secondsbefore the snow sets -- most deaths are due to suffocation.) 38 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Spit and stick it out - If you're not sure which way is up, spit and gravity will show you. And if you are lucky enough to be near the surface, try tostick out an arm or a leg so that rescuers can find you. Don't panic - Keep your breathing steady to help preserve your air space and help your body conserve energy. Listen for rescuers - Since snow is a good insulator, rescuers probably won't even hear you until they are practically on top of you, so don't startyelling until you hear them. (This conserves your precious air.) If you see SOMEONE ELSE caught in the avalanche... Watch - Keep watching the victim(s) as they are carried downhill, paying particular attention to the last point you saw them. DO NOT go for help! - Sounds crazy but the victim only has a few minutes to breathe under the snow, so every second counts. Spend 30 minutes to anhour searching before going for help. Be aware - Assess the situation and dangers... in many cases it is safe to go in after the avalanche settles but proceed with caution. Look for clues - Look for signs on the surface (like poles, a hand or foot, etc.) where victim was last seen. Equipment and clothing can be ripped offduring the avalanche but can help determine the direction they were carried. Switch to \"receive\" - Turn all transceivers to \"receive\" to try to locate victim's signal (in the event victim is wearing one and has it set correctly.) Mark the spot - If you lost sight of the victim or can't find any visible clues on the surface, mark the spot where victim was last seen. Probe in a line - When searching with probes, stand shoulder to shoulder in a line across the slope and repeatedly insert probes moving down the slope. Listen - Make sure you listen for any muffled sounds as you search. Find them...dig 'em out! - If you find the victim, dig them out as quickly as possible. Survival chances reduce the longer they are buried. Now we'll briefly cover LANDSLIDES and MUDFLOWS . Realize many types of disasters like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, rain and wind erosion can cause land, rocks, debris and mud to shift and move, sometimesat rapid speeds. Compound that with gravity and these earth movementscan become extremely destructive. 39 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Another major factor is the world's growing population is sprawling out of major cities and developing in high-risk areas. There are some warningsigns to indicate if you have a potential problem. BEFORE A L ANDSLIDE OR MUDFLOW : Learn risks - Ask your local emergency management office (see Section 4 for State &Provincial listing) if your property is a \"landslide-prone\" area. Recent fires? - Be aware that areas hit by wildfires have an increased risk of landslides and mudflows once the rainy season starts. Get insurance...? - Talk to your agent and find out more about the National Flood Insurance Program since mudflows are covered by NFIP's flood policy. (Visit www.floodsmart.gov - also see FLOOD MITIGATION) Be prepared to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and leave if you are told to evacuate. (see EVACUATION) Where would we go? - Decide in advance where you would go in case you can't return home for weeks or months .. or ever. If your home is damagedor destroyed or you're forced to leave your home due to on-going threats(like mudslides or flooding), you'll need to find temporary or permanentliving quarters. This could mean staying in a public shelter or hotel, livingwith friends or relatives, or renting a home or apartment in the middle of allthe chaos, so discuss several options now. Then, write down those optionsand share them with relatives and friends. Reduce risks - Plant ground cover on slopes and build retaining walls. Inspect - Look around home and property for landslide warning signs: cracks or bumps appear on hill slopes, ground or roads water or saturated ground in areas not normally wet evidence of slow, downhill movement of rock and soil tilted trees, poles, decks, patios, fences or walls doors and windows stick or cracks appear on walls, etc. Call an expert...? - Consult a professional for advice. Or visit the National Landslide Information Center at http://landslides.usgs.gov DURING A LANDSLIDE OR MUDFLOW : Strange sounds - Listen for trees cracking, rocks banging together or water flowing rapidly (esp. if near a stream or river) - debris flow may be close 40 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325by. Move it! - Whether you are in a vehicle, outside, or in your home - GET TO SAFER GROUND! Be small - If there is no way to escape, curl into a tight ball and protect your head the best you can. (Since most other disasters cause landslides and mudflows, we'll discuss them further in those specific cases - please see other topics to learn more.) AFTER A LANDSLIDE OR MUDFLOW : Listen - Local radio and TV reports will keep you posted on latest updates or check with your local police or fire departments. Don't go there - Stay away from the area until authorities say all is clear since there could be more slides or flows. Things to watch for : flooding - usually occur after landslides or debris flows damaged areas - roadways and bridges may be buried, washed-out or weakened -- and water, gas & sewer linesmay be broken downed power lines - report them to power company Inspect - Look for damage around home and property and watch for new landslide warning signs: check foundation, chimney, garage and other structures report any broken utility lines or damaged roads to localauthorities watch for tilted trees, poles, decks, patios, fences or walls notice doors or windows stick, cracks appear, etc. Replant - Try to fix or replant damaged ground to reduce erosion, possible flash flooding or future landslides. Call an expert...? - Consult a professional landscaping expert for opinions and advice on landslide problems. Also call an expert out if you discoverstructural damage to home, chimney or other buildings. Insurance - If your home suffers any damage, contact your insurance agent and keep all receipts for clean-up and repairs. Recovery tips - Review TIPSON RECOVERINGFROMADISASTER at the end of this section. 41 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... CIVILDISTURBANCES OR CIVILUNREST ? Civil disturbances (also called civil unrest or riots) can happen for many different reasons like frustration with the government, a bad court decision,drunken mayhem after sporting events, or racial tensions in a neighbor-hood. Or sometimes a peaceful rally, concert or party can turn violent andspill over into neighborhoods or business districts. Sometimes authoritiescan block off the affected areas -- other times things may just go crazy. DURING A RIOT OR CIVILUNREST : Stay calm & be aware - If possible, avoid contact with rioters and keep a low profile. And leave the area as quickly and safely as possible. Listen - If officials tell you to leave or to shelter-in-place ... DO it! Stay updated with local radio and TV reports since rumors may be flying around. Evacuate? - If you are told to leave - do so ... and IF you have time... Secure your home or business. Lock doors and windows,back up files if possible, take valuables and importantpapers with you (or lock them up), etc. Don't try to drive through a crowd -- find another way out. Things to watch for : flying objects or gas - rioters may throw rocks, bottles, bricks, cans, fireworks, molotov cocktails ... and policemay have to use rubber bullets, bean bags or tear gas forcrowd control damaged areas - drunks and rioters may smash windows, burn tires, overturn cars and set buildings or homes on fire suspicious packages - rioters may call in bomb threats Firearms - Sometimes looting occurs but be smart about protecting your property, it's not worth getting hurt or shot defending it. (Learn more aboutfirearm safety from local law enforcement officials or at www.nra.org .) Don't go there - Stay away from the area until authorities say all is clear. National Guard - If things get out of hand, local law enforcement may request the National Guard come in and help so don't be alarmed if you seeuniformed armed forces on the streets. 42 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... ANEARTHQUAKE ? Earthquakes can cause buildings and bridges to collapse, down telephone and power lines, and result in fires, explosions and landslides. Earthquakescan also cause huge ocean waves, called tsunamis [soo-nah'-mees], whichtravel long distances over water until they hit coastal areas. Our planet's surface is actually made up of slowly-moving sections (called \"tectonic plates\") that can build up friction or stress in the crust as theycreep around. An earthquake occurs when this built up stress is suddenlyreleased and transmitted to the surface of the earth by earthquake waves(called seismic waves). There are actually millions of small earthquakes, or seismic tremors, per year around the world. Many earthquakes are too small to be felt, but whenthey happen, you will feel shaking, quickly followed by a rolling motionthat can rotate up, down, and sideways that lasts from a few seconds to several minutes. BEFORE AN EARTHQUAKE : Learn the buzzwords - Learn the terms / words used with earthquakes... Earthquake - a sudden slipping of the earth's crust that causes a series of vibrations Aftershock - usually not as strong as earthquake but can occur for hours, days, months or years after a main quake Fault - area of weakness where two sections of crust have separated Subduction zone - where 2 tectonic plates collide and one plate dives or \"subducts\" underneath the other Epicenter - area of the earth's surface directly above the crust that caused the quake Seismic Waves - vibrations that travel from the center of the earthquake to the surface Magnitude - used to define how much energy was released (A Richter Scale is the device used to measurethis energy on a scale from 0-10 ... each whole numberequals an increase of about 30 times the energy releasedmeaning a 5.0 is about 30 times stronger than a 4.0.) Liquefaction - when water-saturated ground loses strength and acts as a muddy fluid 43 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Prepare - See EARTHQUAKEand POWERLOSSMITIGATION at the beginning of this Section. Also visit www.shakeout.org Reduce risks - Look for things that could be hazardous... Place large or heavy objects on lower shelves and fastenshelves to walls, if possible. Hang heavy pictures and mirrors away from beds. Store bottled foods, glass, china and other breakables onlow shelves or in cabinets that can fasten shut. Repair faulty electrical wiring and leaky gas connections. Learn to shut off - Know where and how to shut off electricity, gas and water at main switches and valves -- ask local utilities for instructions. Do drills - Hold earthquake drills with your family to learn what to do... DROP - drop down to the floor COVER - get under heavy desk or table or against inside wall protecting head and neck with your arms HOLD ON - grab something sturdy, be ready to move with it and hold on until shaking stops! Make a plan - Review Section 1 and develop a Family Emergency Plan. Check policies - Review your insurance policies. Some damage may be covered even without specific earthquake insurance. DURING AN EARTHQUAKE : Stay calm & be aware - Watch for falling objects and find a safe spot! Realize most injuries happen when people are hit by things when runningIN or OUT of buildings. IF INDOORS - Stay inside and ... Avoid danger zones like glass, windows, heavy thingsthat can fall over or down on you. DROP , COVER and HOLD ON until the shaking stops. If there isn't a table or desk near you, cover face and headwith arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building. IF IN A HIGH-RISE BUILDING - Stay on the same floor! Move away from outside walls and windows. Stay on the same floor - you may not have to evacuate. Realize electricity may go out and alarms and sprinkler 44 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325systems may go on. DO NOT use the elevators! IF OUTDOORS - Stay outside and, if possible, move away from build- ings, signs, trees, power lines and street lights. IF IN A MOVING VEHICLE - Stop as quickly and safely as you can! Try not to stop near buildings, trees, overpasses, or powerlines and stay in vehicle until shaking stops. Watch for road and bridge damage and be ready for after-shocks once you drive again. If you are trapped in an area : light - use a flashlight (if you have one) - do not use matches or lighters in case of gas leaks be still - try to stay still so you won't kick up dust breathing - cover your mouth with a piece of clothing make noise - tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can hear you (shouting may cause you to inhale a lot of dust) AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE : Aftershocks - Usually not as strong but can cause more damage to weak- ened structures and may continue for days, months or even years. Injuries - Check yourself and people around you for injuries - do not try to move seriously injured people unless they are in danger. If you must movea person who is passed out keep their head and neck still and call for help!(see Section 3 - TIPS ON BASIC FIRST AID) Light - Never use candles, matches or lighters since there might be gas leaks. Use flashlights or battery powered lanterns. Check home - Look for structural damage -- call a professional if needed. Check chimney - First check from a distance to see if chimney looks nor- mal and have a professional check it if it looks strange. Check out theChimney Safety Institute of America's homeowner tips at www.csia.org Clean up - Any flammable liquids (bleaches, gasoline, etc.) should be cleaned up immediately. Inspect - Check all utility lines and appliances for damage: smell gas or hear hissing - open a window and leave 45 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325quickly. Shut off main valve outside, if possible, and call a professional to turn it back on when it's safe electrical damage - switch off power at main fuse box or circuit breaker water pipes - shut off water supply at the main valve toilets - do not use until you know sewage lines are okay Water - If water is cut off or contaminated then use water from your Disaster Supplies Kit or other clean water sources. (see TIPS ON WATER PURIFICATION) Power - If you use a generator, keep it outside and follow manufacturer's instructions. (see some safety tips in POWERLOSSMITIGATION) Phones - Keep calls to a minimum to report emergencies since most lines will be down. Listen - Keep up on news reports for the latest information. Things to avoid: going out - try to stay off the roads to reduce risk stay away - unless emergency crew or First Responders ask for your help stay away from damaged areas downed power wires Tsunami - If you live near the coast, a tsunami can crash into the shorelines so listen for warnings by local authorities. (see section on TSUNAMIS) RED or GREEN sign in window - After a disaster, V olunteers and Emergency Service personnel will be going door-to-door to check on people. By placing a sign in your window that faces the street near the door,you can let them know if you need them to STOP HERE or MOVE ON . Either use a piece of RED or GREEN construction paper or draw a big RED or GREEN \"X\" (using a crayon or marker) on a piece of paper and tape it in the window. RED means STOP HERE! GREEN means EVERYTHING IS OKAY...MOVE ON! Nothing in the window would also mean STOP HERE!

Evacuations are quite common and happen for a number of reasons - fires, floods, mudflows, hurricanes, or chemical spills on the roads or railways. When community evacuations become necessary, local officials provide information to the public usually through the media. Government agencies,the Salvation Army, Red Cross, churches and other relief organizations provide emergency shelter and supplies. But, as we have said before, youshould have enough food, water, clothing and emergency supplies for daysor weeks (or more) in case you cannot be reached by relief efforts. The amount of time to evacuate obviously depends on the type of disaster. Hurricanes can be tracked and allow a day or two notice to get ready, butmany types of disasters happen without much notice... so prepare NOW!! BEFORE AN EV ACUATION : Ask &learn - Ask emergency management officials about community evacuation plans and learn the routes that should be used. Also learn thesigns used for your area - and, if you're traveling, make a mental note whatevacuation signs look like in case something happens while on the road.And ask if your local officials have developed pet-friendly shelters and pet-related disaster plans through the 2006 PETS Act. Make a plan - Review Section 1 and develop a Family Emergency Plan (so you know where to meet if separated, how to contact everyone, have aDisaster Supplies Kit ready to go, etc.) If you don't have a car, make arrangements with friends, neighbors or local officials so you have a wayto evacuate. Think about your pets - Make a plan for your critters. Review Tips for Pets or Livestock / Large Animals on page 11 and pack supplies for them in yourDisaster Supplies Kit . Where do we go? - Talk with your family members and decide in advance where you would go in case you can't return home for weeks or months. Ifyour home is damaged or destroyed or you're forced to leave your homedue to on-going threats (like mudslides or flooding), you will need to findtemporary or permanent living quarters. This could mean staying in a pub-lic shelter or hotel, living with friends or relatives, or renting a home orapartment in the middle of all the chaos, so discuss several options. Then,write down your various options and share them with relatives and friends. 47 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Paperwork & money - As discussed in Section 1, put important paperwork (wills, photo I.D.s, insurance policies, list of bank and credit card numbers,etc.) in a portable fireproof container (and have copies in an off-site safetydeposit box) so you have identification to get access to your bank or to setup new accounts if you have to relocate long-term to another town. Alsokeep copies on a CD, flash drive or external drive and store media in a safeplace off-site or in a locked fireproof container. Or consider using a servicethat allows you to upload scans and securely store your documents on theirservers. Fill 'er up - Keep car fueled up -- stations may close during an emergency. (Try to stay in the habit of having at least half a tank of gas at all times.) Learn to shut off - Know where and how to shut off electricity, gas and water at main switches and valves -- ask local utilities for instructions (andkeep a wrench handy). Review tips on basic needs - Please review TIPS ONSHELTER LIVING, TIPSON USINGHOUSEHOLD FOODS, TIPS ON WATERPURIFICATION and TIPSON SANITATION OF HUMAN WASTE nearend of this section to prepare yourself and family for what to expect. DURING AN EV ACUATION : Listen - Keep up on news reports for the latest information. Grab & Go - Grab your Disaster Supplies Kit (has water, food, clothing, emergency supplies, insurance and financial records, etc. ready to go). What do I wear? - Put on protective clothing (long sleeve shirt and pants) and sturdy shoes - may even want to grab a jacket, hat or cap. Shut off utilities - Turn off main water valve and electricity (if authorities tell you to do so). Secure home - Close and lock doors and windows, unplug appliances, protect water pipes (if freezing weather), tie down boats, etc. (See specific types of disaster for additional tips on securing home.) Take quick pics - Use your camera phone to take some shots of your home and property for a last minute inventory of things. Pets - Make sure you take pets in secure carriers and bring food, water and leashes or harnesses with you. Grab medical records so you can proveimmunizations are current. Realize some shelters may not accept pets sohave a backup plan on where you'll go. If you have no alternative but toleave your pet at home, confine it to a safe area inside with dry food and 48 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325plenty of water. Leave bathroom door open and toilet lid up (or remove lid completely) so they can access additional water (but only if toilet is free ofchemicals.) If you must leave your pet outside -- don't chain it! Large animals - Hopefully you made arrangements in advance to evacuate livestock and/or large animals. If you must turn them loose, prepare haltersfor horses that include your name and phone numbers or spray paint yournumber on the animals and leave lots of food and water out. Alert family / friends - Let others know where you are going (or at least leave a message or note in clear view explaining where you can be found).If pets are left on the property, put a note on door to alert rescue workers. Twitter, Flickr, etc. - Social networking sites allow users to stay current on evacuation and recovery efforts. You may not have access to the Internetduring or after a crisis, but text messages can sometimes get through whencell and phone systems are down. The Salvation Army, Red Cross, FEMA,local emergency officialsand other relief groups use Twitter to send instantmessages (called tweets) about evacuations and shelter information. AndFEMAand DHS partnered with Facebook and MySpace so users can getemergency broadcast warnings and stay updated on friends and familiesdisplaced by storms. Social media is also a great way to post photos andvideos using tools like Flickr, Facebook, Vine and Instagram. Things to avoid : bad weather - leave early enough so you're not trapped shortcuts - may be blocked -- stick to the recommended Evacuation routes flooded areas - roadways and bridges may be washed-out downed power lines Review tips on basic needs - Make sure you review tips onSHELTER LIVING, USINGHOUSEHOLD FOODS, WATER PURIFICATION andSANITATION OF HUMAN WASTE at end of this section to prepare yourfamily for the unexpected. 49 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... EXTREME HEAT? What is Extreme Heat? Temperatures that hover 10 degrees or more above the average high temperature for that area and last for several weeksare considered \"extreme heat\" or a heat wave . Humid and muggy condi- tions can make these high temperatures even more unbearable. Really dryand hot conditions can cause dust storms and low visibility. Droughts occur when a long period passes without enough rainfall. A heat wave combinedwith a drought is a very dangerous situation! Doing too much on a hot day, spending too much time in the sun or staying too long in an overheated place can cause heat-related illnesses . Know the symptoms of heat illnesses and be ready to give first aid treatment. (see HEAT-RELATED ILLNESSES in Section 3) BEFORE EXTREME HEATHITS: Keep it cool - Tips to keep hot air out and cool air inside include... Close any floor heat vents nearby. Seal gaps around window units with foam or duct tape. Use a circulating or box fan to spread the cool air around. Use aluminum foil covered cardboard in windows toreflect heat back outside. Use weather-stripping on doors and windowsills. Keep storm windows up all year to help keep cool in. DURING EXTREME HEAT: Protect windows - If you hang shades, drapes, sheets, or awnings on win- dows you can reduce heat from entering home by as much as 80%. Conserve power - During heat waves there are usually power shortages since everyone is trying to cool off, so stay indoors as much as possible. Conserve water - Tips to lower water usage, esp. during drought conditions Check plumbing for leaks. Replace toilet and shower head with \"low flow\" versions. Don't leave water running while shaving, brushing teeth, washing dishes, cleaning fruit or veggies, etc. 50 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325If washing dishes or clothes, make sure it's a full load. Take short showers rather than filling up a bathtub. Limit watering lawn or washing cars. No A/C..? - If you have no air conditioning, try to stay on the lowest floor out of the sunshine and use electric fans to help keep yourself cool. Cars - Never leave children or pets in vehicles on warm or hot days!! Eat light - Light meals are best, especially fresh fruits and veggies. Drink WATER - Increase your daily intake of water, esp. in dry climates (deserts and high elevations) -- you don't realize how dehydrated you getAnd don't forget your pets! Limit booze - Even though beer and alcoholic beverages may be refreshing on a hot day, they actually cause your body to dehydrate more. What to wear - Light-colored (to reflect heat) loose-fitting clothes are best... and cover as much skin as possible. Dark colors absorb the sun'sheat. Also, wear a wide-brimmed hat to protect face and neck. Use sunscreen - Apply lotion or cream at least 20 minutes before going out- side so skin can absorb and protect, esp. face and neck (SPF 30 to 50 witha 3 or 4 star UV A protection is best). You usually burn within the first 10minutes outside, so take care of your skin... especially children ! A sunburn slows the body's ability to cool itself and can be extremely dangerous. Working outdoors - If you have to do yard work or other outdoor work, try to do it in the early morning hours to limit exposure in the sun. The mostpowerful sun is between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. (when you burn the quickest)so limit outdoor activity during the heat of the day, if possible. Ozone alerts - These can cause serious danger to people with breathing and respiratory problems (especially children and the elderly) so limit your timeoutdoors when alerts are announced on the radio, newspapers or TV . ozone - a colorless gas that is in the air we breathe and is a major element of urban smog. ground-level ozone - an air pollutant that can lower resistance to colds, cause problems for people with heartand lung disease, and cause coughing or throat irritation ozone levels - Air Quality Index between 0-50 is fine, but anything above 100 is extremely dangerous! Heat Index - Visit NOAA's heat safety page at www.weather.gov/om/heat 51 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... FIRES & W ILDFIRES ? Since fire spreads so quickly, there is NO time to grab valuables or make a phone call! In just two minutes a fire can become life threatening! In five minutes a house can be engulfed in flames. A fire's heat and smoke are more dangerous than the actual flames since you can burn your lungs by inhaling the super-hot air. Fire produces poisonous gases that make you drowsy and disoriented (confused). Insteadof being awakened by a fire, you could fall into a deeper sleep. First we will discuss FIRES like you might encounter in your home or apartment, then we will cover WILDFIRES since there are many things people need to think about when living near wilderness areas. BEFORE A F IRE(FIRESAFETY TIPS): Install smoke andcarbon monoxide (CO) detectors! - Test alarms 1-4 times a month, replace batteries once a year, and get new units every 10 years. Make a plan - Review Section 1 and create an Escape Plan that includes two escape routes from every room in the house and walk through the routeswith your entire family. Also... Make sure your windows are not nailed or painted shut. Make sure security bars on windows have a fire safety opening feature so they can be easily opened from theinside...and teach everyone how to open them! Teach everyone how to stay LOW to floor (air is safer). Pick a spot to meet after escaping fire (meeting place) . Clean up - Keep storage areas clean - don't stack up newspapers & trash. Check power sources - Check electrical wiring and extension cords -- don't overload cords or outlets. Make sure there are no exposed wires anywhereand make sure wiring doesn't touch home insulation. Use caution - Never use gasoline or similar liquids indoors and never smoke around flammable liquids! Check heat sources - Check furnaces, stoves, cracked or rusty furnace parts, and chimneys. Always be careful with space heaters and keep them at least3 feet (1 m) away from flammable materials. 52 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Know how to shut off power - Know where the circuit breaker box and gas valve is and how to turn them off, if necessary. (And always have a gascompany rep turn on a main gas line.) Install A-B-Cs and remember P-A-S-S - Install A-B-C fire extinguishers in the home since they work on all types of fires, and teach family membershow to use them. Remember P-A-S-S = Pull the pin; Aim at the base of the fire; Squeeze the trigger; Sweep side to side. Call local fire - Ask local fire department if they will inspect your home or business for fire safety and prevention. Teach kids - Explain to children that matches and lighters are TOOLS, not toys... and if they see someone playing with fire they should tell an adultright away! And teach them how to report a fire and when to call 9-1-1. Prevent common fires - Pay attention when cooking & don't smoke in bed! DURING A F IRE: If only a small fire that's not spreading too fast ... Try to put out...? - Use a fire extinguisher or water (unless it's an electrical or grease fire) ... and never try to put out a fire that's getting out of control! electrical fire - never use water... use a fire extinguisher approved for electrical fires oil or grease fire in kitchen - smother fire with baking soda or salt (or, if burning in pan or skillet, carefully put alid over it -- but don't try to carry pan outside!) If fire is spreading ... GETOUT - DO NOT take time to try to grab anything except your family members! Once outside, do NOT try to go back in (even for pets) - let thefiremen do it! Ask a neighbor to call fire department if not already called. GET DOWN - Stay low to the ground under smoke by crawling on your hands and knees or squat down and walk like a duck... but keep moving tofind a way out! Closed door - Using the back of your hand (not your palm)always feel the top of the door, doorknob, and the crack between the door and door framebefore you open a closed door! if door is cool - leave quickly, close door behind you and crawl to an exit if door is hot - DO NOT open it ... find another way out 53 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325No way out - If you can't find a way out of the room you're trapped in (door is hot and too high to jump) then hang a white or light-colored sheet, towelor shirt outside a window to alert firemen. Use stairs - Never take the elevator during a fire ... always use stairs! If YOUare on fire - If your clothes ever catch fire, STOP what you're doing, DROP to the ground, cover your face and ROLL until the fire goes out. Running only makes the fire burn faster! Toxic gas - Plastics in household goods create deadly fumes when burned. AFTER A F IRE: Don't go in there - Never enter a fire-damaged building until officials say it's okay and watch for signs of smoke in case the fire isn't totally out. Evenif a fire's out, hydrogen cyanide and other toxic fumes can remain. Utilities - Have an electrician check your household wiring before you turn the power back on and DO NOT try to reconnect any utilities yourself! Damage - Look for structural damage (roof, walls, floors, etc.) since they may be weak. Call for help - Local disaster relief service (Red Cross, Salvation Army, etc.) can help provide shelter, food, or personal items that were destroyed. Insurance - Call your insurance agent or representative and... Keep receipts of all clean-up and repair costs (for both insurance and income taxes). Do not throw away any damaged goods until an officialinventory has been taken by your insurance company. If you rent - Contact your landlord since it is the owner's responsibility to prevent further loss or damage to the site. Move your stuff - Secure your personal belongings or move them to another location, if possible. Recovery tips - Review TIPSON RECOVERINGFROMADISASTER at end of this Section. To learn more about fire safety and fire prevention visit the U.S. Fire Administration' s web site www.usfa.dhs.gov or contact your local fire department, emergency official, or your insurance agent / representative. 54 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Wildfires are intense fires that are usually caused by careless humans or lightning. Campfires, children playing with matches or lighters, and ciga-rettes are the most common things that cause brush fires or wildfires soplease be careful when you're out in deserts, mountains, or any other heavy vegetation areas. And please don't toss cigarettes out when driving! NEVER leave a campfire burning - make sure it is completely out using plenty of water before leaving the area. Stir the coals around with a stick orlog while pouring water over them to ensure all the coals get wet and theyare no longer hot. Any hot coals left unattended can be easily ignited bywind since they can stay hot for 24 - 48 hours. When building a campfire, always choose a level site, clear away any branches and twigs several feet from the fire, and never build a fire beneathtree branches or on surface roots. Also, build at least 10 feet (3 m) from anylarge rocks that could be blackened by smoke or cracked from a fire's heat. See your local Forest Service office or Ranger Station for more information on campfires and permits. Or visit www.fs.fed.us or www.pc.gc.ca BEFORE A W ILDFIRE (FIRESAFETY TIPS): Prepare - See WILDFIREMITIGATION at beginning of this Section. Learn fire laws - Ask fire authorities or the forestry office for information on fire laws (like techniques, safest times to burn in your area, etc.) Could they find &reach you? - Make sure that fire vehicles can get to your property and that your address is clearly marked. Safety zone - Create a 30-100 foot (9-30 m) safety zone around your home. (see WILDFIREMITIGATION) Teach kids - Explain to children that matches and lighters are TOOLS, not toys... and if they see someone playing with fire tell an adult right away.And teach kids how to report a fire and when to call 9-1-1. Tell authorities - Report hazardous conditions that could cause a wildfire. Be ready to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and leave if you are told to evacuate. (see EVACUATION) DURING A W ILDFIRE : Listen - Have a radio to keep up on news, weather and evacuation routes. 55 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Evacuate? - If you are told to leave - do so ... and IF you have time also... Secure your home - close windows, vents, all doors, etc. Turn off utilities and tanks at main switches or valves. Turn on a light in each room to increase the visibility of your home in heavy smoke. See WILDFIREMITIGATION at front of this section. Head downhill - Fire climbs uphill 16 times faster than on level terrain (since heat rises) so always head down when evacuating the area. Food & water - If you prepared ahead, you'll have your Disaster Supplies Kithandy to GRAB & GO ... if not, gather up enough food and water for each family member for at least 3 days or longer! Be understanding - Please realize the firefighters main objective is getting wildfires under control and they may not be able to save every home. Tryto understand and respect the firefighters' and local officials' decisions. AFTER A W ILDFIRE : Don't go there - Never enter fire-damaged areas until authorities say it's okay and watch for signs of smoke or heat in case the fire isn't totally out. Critters - Don't try to care for a wounded critter -- call Animal Control. Utilities - Have an electrician check your household wiring before you turn the power back on and DO NOT try to reconnect any utilities yourself! Damage - Look for structural damage (roof, walls, floors) -- may be weak. Call for help - Local disaster relief services (Red Cross, Salvation Army, etc.) can help provide shelter, food, or personal items that were destroyed. Insurance - Call your insurance agent or representative and... Keep receipts of all clean-up and repair costs Do not throw away any damaged goods until an official inventory has been taken by your insurance company.

Recovery tips - See TIPSON RECOVERINGFROMADISASTER. 56 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... A F LOOD ? Floods are the most common natural disaster. Some floods develop over a period of several days, but a flash flood can cause raging waters in just afew minutes. Mudflows are another danger triggered by flooding that canbury villages without warning, especially in mountainous regions. Everyone is at risk from floods and flash floods, even in areas that seem harmless in dry weather. Always listen to the radio or TV to hear the latestupdates. Some other types of radios are the NOAA Weather Radio andEnvironment Canada Weatheradio with battery backup and tone-alert feature that alert you when a Watch or Warning has been issued. BEFORE A F LOOD (ORHEA VY RAIN): Prepare - Review FLOODMITIGATION at beginning of this Section. Learn the buzzwords - Learn the terms / words used with floods... Flood watch - flooding is possible Flash flood watch - flash flooding is possible so move to higher ground if in a low-lying area Flood warning - flooding is occurring or will occur soon so listen to radio or TV for updates or evacuation alerts Flash flood warning - flash flood is occurring so seek higher ground on foot immediately Urban and Small Stream Advisory - flooding of small streams, streets and low-lying areas is occurring Learn risks - Ask local emergency management office if your property is a flood-prone or high-risk area and what you can do to reduce risks to yourproperty and home. Find out what official flood warning signals are andwhat to do when you hear them. Ask if there are dams or levees nearby andif they could be hazards. (also see Landslides & Mudflows on pages 39-41.) Be ready to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and leave if you are told to evacuate. (see EVACUATION) Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit .

Get insurance...? - Talk to your agent and find out more about the National Flood Insurance Program . (see FLOOD MITIGATION) Did you know... ... you can buy federal flood insurance through most major insurance companies and licensed agents?! ... you do not have to own a home to have flood insurance as long as your community participates in the NFIP ?! ... NFIP offers coverage even in flood-prone areas and offers basement and below ground level coverage?! Put it on film/chip/drive - Either videotape or take pictures of home and personal belongings and store them in a safe place with important papers. DURING A F LOOD (ORHEA VY RAIN): Be aware - Listen to local news and watch for flash floods especially if near streams, drainage channels, and areas known to flood. Be prepared to filland place sandbags in areas as instructed to help combat rising waters. Get to higher ground - If in a low-lying area, move to higher ground. Prepare to evacuate - (see EVACUATION ), and IF time also... Secure home and move important items to upper floors. Turn off utilities at main switches or valves if instructed by authorities and DO NOT touch electrical equipment ifyou are wet or standing in water! Fill up your car with fuel. Obey warnings - If road signs, barricades, or cones are placed in areas - DO NOT drive around them! Find another way or you may get fined. Things to avoid : moving water - 6 inches (15 cm) of moving water can knock you off your feet and 2 ft (0.6 m) can float a car flooding car - if flood waters rise around your car, get out and move to higher ground if you can do it safely bad weather - leave early enough so you're not trapped flooded areas - roadways and bridges may be washed-out downed power lines - extremely dangerous in floods!! 58 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325AFTER A F LOOD (ORHEA VY RAIN): Things to avoid : flood waters - avoid since they may be contaminated by oil, gasoline or raw sewage or may be electrically chargedfrom underground or downed power lines - local authori-ties will say when it's okay to return moving water - 6 inches (15 cm) can knock you off your feet and 2 ft (0.6 m) can float a car flooded areas - roadways and bridges may be washed-out downed power lines - extremely dangerous and report them to the power company Obey warnings - If road signs, barricades, or cones are placed in areas - OBEY THEM! Most areas fine people who ignore posted warnings. DONOT drive around barricades... find another way to get there! Strange critters - Watch out for snakes and other wildlife in areas that were flooded. Don't try to care for a wounded critter since it may try to attackyou... call your local animal control office or animal shelter. Flooded food - Throw away food that has come into contact with flood waters since eating it can make you sick. Drinking water - Wait for officials to advise when water is safe to drink. If you have a well that gets contaminated, find another source or boil water. Wash your hands - Wash hands often with clean water and soap since flood waters are dirty and full of germs! Use bleach - The best thing to use for cleaning up flooded areas is house- hold bleach since it helps kill germs. Sandbags - If any sandbags come into contact with floodwaters, wear rubber gloves when removing them and follow officials' instructions onwhere to discard them since they're most likely contaminated. Listen - Continue listening to radio or TV for updates on weather and tips on getting assistance for housing, clothing, food, etc. Insurance - Call your insurance agent or representative to discuss claims. Mold - Consider asking a restoration professional to inspect your house for mold.

Hail is the largest form of precipitation that begins as tiny ice pellets and grows by colliding with supercooled water droplets as it gets tossed aroundviolently in strong updraft winds. As the pellet continues to be tossed, itbuilds layer by layer until it becomes so heavy that it drops out of the skyas hailstones. Hailstone diameters can range from 1/16 of an inch to 5 inches (2 mm to 13 mm) - basically meaning they can range in size from tiny pebbles to golfballs to softballs. One of the largest hailstones ever recorded in the U.S.weighed 1 pound 15 ounces and had a 18.62 inch (47 cm) circumference. Hail is usually present in powerful storms like tornadoes, thunderstorms and even some winter storms mainly due to the strong winds and rapidlyrising air masses needed to form hailstones. The U.S. averages about 3,000 hailstorms each year across the country and a majority of the storms occur between March and June. Hail occurs allacross Canada but more frequently in the Canadian Prairies (particularly theCalgary-Medicine Hat area). This region can expect up to 10 hailstorms ayear and most damaging hailstorms generally occur from May to October. BEFORE A HAILSTORM : Since hailstorms are pretty localized events, it is difficult to prepare for\"hail\", however please review the other topics that create hailstorms(Thunderstorms, Tornadoes and Winter storms) to learn what to do andhow to protect yourselves during these events. Listen - Keep up on local radio or TV weather forecasts and updates. Park it - If possible, secure vehicles in a garage or under substantial cover. Bring 'em in - Put pets and livestock in a shelter for their safety. Stay put - Stay inside until the entire storm system passes. DURING A HAILSTORM : Listen - Keep radio or TV tuned in for more information and updates on weather conditions and other types of warnings. 60 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325IF INDOORS - Stay inside until the storm passes and don't try to go out and protect your property. IF OUTDOORS - Take shelter under the strongest structure you can find (especially if hailstones are large!) IF IN A VEHICLE - Carefully pull over to the shoulder and seek shelter under an overpass or the closest substantial structure available. AFTER A HAILSTORM : Listen - Continue listening to radio or TV for updates on weather. Check it out - Check for damage to trees and shrubs because, if damaged, your roof most likely is too. Also check your vehicles and structures fordamage but don't put yourself in danger if storms are still active! Stop leaks - Cover up holes in your roof and broken windows in your car and home to keep water out. Insurance - Call your insurance agent or representative to set up a visit to your home or to take your vehicle down for inspection. Recovery tips - Review TIPSON RECOVERINGFROMADISASTER at end of this Section. 61 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ? Chemical plants are one source of hazardous materials, but there are many others that exist in large industry, small businesses, and homes. There areabout 500,000 products that could pose a physical or health hazard -- thingsranging from waste produced by a petroleum refinery to materials used bythe dry cleaners to pesticides stored in your home. Most hazardous materials are transported around the country by road, rail and through pipelines potentially causing spills on highways, near railroadtracks or underground. Many U.S. communities have a Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC ) that keeps local planners, companies and members of the community informed of potential risks. All companies thathave hazardous chemicals must report to the LEPC every year and the pub-lic is encouraged to get involved. We [the public] should all learn moreabout hazardous materials and how they can affect our lives so contact youremergency management office to learn more. We're going to cover two topics here -- HAZARDOUSMATERIALS DISASTER (where a spill or incident affects an area or community) and HOUSEHOLDCHEMICALEMERGENCIES (how to handle products and react if there's an emergency in the home). Also, please review theTERRORISM topic since it covers several chemical and biological agents that are also classed as \"hazardous materials\". BEFORE A HAZARDOUS MATERIALS DISASTER : Learn the buzzwords - Ask your local officials about emergency warning procedures and terms... Outdoor warning sirens or horns - ask what they mean and what to listen for Emergency Alert System (EAS) - information and alerts via TV and radio \"All-call\" telephoning - an automated system for sending recorded messages via telephone Residential route alerting - messages announced from vehicles equipped with public address systems (loud speakers on top of car or van) Learn risks - Ask Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Emergency Management Office, or Fire Department about communityplans for responding to a hazardous materials accident at a plant or a 62 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325transportation accident involving hazardous materials. Ask about the Emergency Planning and Community Right To Know Act (or EPCRA) andhelp your community become better informed. Make a plan - Use LEPC's or agency's information to determine if your family is at risk (especially people living close to freeways, railroads, orfactories which produce or transport toxic waste). And review Section 1 todevelop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit . Take a tour - LEPCs sometimes visit facilities that produce or transport toxic waste and include community groups, local officials and the media. Pick a room - It could take authorities time to determine what the hazardous material is (if any) so pick a room in advance that your family could use as\"shelter-in-place\" if told to stay indoors for several hours. It's best to pickan internal room where you could block out air, if instructed to do so. Tosave critical time consider measuring, cutting and labeling plastic sheets inadvance for each opening (vents, windows, and doors). Remember, toilets/ drains are vented meaning outside air comes in constantly or when flushed/ open (depends on design) - in case you're using bathroom as safe room. Calculate air for room - Keep in mind people can stay in a sealed off room for only so long (or you'll run out of air.) FEMA suggests 10 square feet offloor space per person (like 5ft x 2ft / 1.5m x 0.6m ) will provide enoughair to prevent carbon dioxide buildup for up to 5 hours. Be ready to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and leave if you are told to evacuate. (see EVACUATION) DURING A HAZARDOUS MATERIALS DISASTER : Call for help - If you see a hazardous materials accident, call 9-1-1, local emergency number, or the fire department. Listen - Keep radio or TV tuned in for more information, especially if you hear a warning signal... and stay calm! IF INDOORS - If instructed to stay inside, prepare to \"shelter-in-place\"... Close windows, vents, and fireplace dampers and turn offA/C or heat and fans to reduce air drawn in from outside. Keep a radio with you at all times. Grab Disaster Supplies Kit and get to a closed off room. Seal gaps under doorways and windows with wet towels or plastic and duct tape (see above tips on picking a roomand calculating air!) 63 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325IF OUTDOORS - Stay upstream, uphill, or upwind from the disaster since hazardous materials can be carried by wind and water quickly. Try to get atleast 1/2 mile or kilometer away or as far away as possible! IF IN A VEHICLE - Close your windows and shut off vents to reduce risk. Stay away - Get away from the accident site to avoid contamination. Evacuate...? - If told to leave... DO it! If officials say you have time, close windows, shut vents and turn off attic fans. (see EVACUATION) What to wear - Keep your body fully covered and wear gloves, socks and shoes. (Even though these may not keep you totally safe, it can help.) Things to avoid: chemicals - spilled liquid materials or airborne mists contaminated food or water - don't eat or drink food or water that may have been exposed to hazardous materials AFTER A HAZARDOUS MATERIALS DISASTER : Don't go there - Do not return home until local authorities say it is safe. Air out - Open windows, vents and turn on fans in your home. Listen - Keep up with local reports from either the radio or TV . Clean up - A person, critter or item that has been exposed to a hazardous chemical could spread it. decontamination - follow instructions from local author- ities since it depends on the chemical. May need to rinseoff or may be told to stay away from water - check first! strange symptoms - if unusual symptoms show up, get to a hospital or medical expert right away. Remove contam-inated clothing and put on fresh, loose, warm clothing andlisten to local reports on the radio. store clothes & shoes - put exposed clothing and shoes in tightly sealed containers/bags without touching othermaterials and ask local authorities how to get rid of them tell people you've been exposed - tell everyone who comes in contact with you that you may have beenexposed to a toxic substance land and property - ask authorities how to clean area 64 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Strange vapors or danger - Report any strange vapors or other dangers to the local authorities immediately. To learn more about hazardous materials, check out the Programs under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Emergency Management at www.epa.gov/emergencies ... or visit the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials SafetyAdministration at http://phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat Or visit Environment Canada at www.ec.gc.ca ...or the Canadian Transport Emergency Centre of the Department of Transport atwww.tc.gc.ca/canutec/ BEFORE A HOUSEHOLD CHEMICAL EMERGENCY : Learn risks - Call your local public health department or the Environmental Protection Agency for information about hazardous household materials. And check out the National Library of Medicine's HouseholdProducts Database that provides information on over 13,000 common household products and their potential health effects athttp://householdproducts.nlm.nih.gov / Read labels - Always read product labels for proper use, safe storage and disposal of chemicals. Recycle it? - Call your local recycling center or collection site to ask what chemicals can be recycled or dropped off for disposal -- many centers takethings like car batteries, oil, tires, paint or thinners, etc. Store it - Keep all chemicals and household cleaners in safe, secure locations out of reach of small children. Put it out - Don't smoke while using household chemicals. DURING A HOUSEHOLD CHEMICAL EMERGENCY : Call for help - Call your local Poison Control Center (or 1-800-222-1222), 9-1-1, fire department, hospital or emergency medical services. If possible,have container handy since medical professionals may need specific datafrom label.

HURRICANES , CYCLONES & T YPHOONS ? Hurricane season in North America is generally between June and November. Hurricanes are tropical cyclones with torrential rains and windsof 74 - 155 miles per hour (120 - 250 km/h) or faster. These winds blow ina counter-clockwise direction (or clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere)around a center \"eye\". The \"eye\" is usually 20 to 30 miles (32 to 48 km)wide, and the storm may be spread out as far as 400 miles (640 km)! As the hurricane approaches the coast, a huge dome of water (called a storm surge) will crash into the coastline. Nine out of ten people killed in hurri-canes are victims of storm surge. Hurricanes can also cause tornadoes,heavy rains and flooding. What's with all the different names? You may have heard different words used to describe storms depending onwhere you live in the world. It's a little confusing but hopefully thisexplains the various names. Cyclone - an atmospheric disturbance with masses of air rapidly rotating around a low-pressure center... (sort of like a dust devil or a tornado) Tropical Depression - maximum surface winds of less than 39 miles per hour (62 km/h) over tropical or sub-tropical waters with storms and circu-lar winds Tropical Storm - a tropical cyclone is labeled a Tropical Storm if winds are between 39-73 mph (62 - 117 km/h) and given a name to track it Hurricane, Typhoon, Tropical cyclone - surface winds are higher than 74 mph (120 km/h)... and depending on where it is happening will determinewhat it is called Where in the world do they use these names? (Please note: We are only listing a few major countries or areas for each name.) Cyclone - used in several parts of the world - Indian Ocean, Australia, Africa, SW and southern Pacific Ocean Hurricane - used in North Atlantic Ocean, Northeast Pacific Ocean (east of the dateline), or South Pacific Ocean (east of 160) - both coasts of North America, Puerto Rico, Caribbean Islands, and Central America 66 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Typhoon - used in Northwest Pacific Ocean west of the dateline - Guam, Marshall Islands, Japan, Philippines, Hong Kong, coastal Asia Tropical cyclone - used in Southwest Pacific Ocean west of 160E or most of Indian Ocean - Australia, Indonesia, Africa, Middle East Hurricanes are classed into five categories based on wind speeds, central pressure, and damage potential. The chart below is the Saffir-SimpsonHurricane Wind Scale with examples of damage provided by NOAA: Scale # Sustained Wind Damage (examples of potential (Category) Winds damage) 1 74-95 mph Dangerous winds will produce some damage 119-153 km/h (Untied mobile homes, vegetation & signs) 2 96-110 mph Extremely dangerous winds/extensive damage 154-177 km/h (All mobile homes, roofs, small crafts, floods) 3 111-129 mph Devastating damage will occur 178-208 km/h (Small buildings, low-lying roads cut off) 4 130-156 mph Catastrophic damage will occur 209-251 km/h (Roofs and mobile homes destroyed, trees down, beach homes flooded) 5 > 156 mph Catastrophic damage will occur > 251 km/h (Most bldgs and vegetation destroyed, major roads cut off, homes flooded) BEFORE A HURRICANE : Prepare - Review FLOOD, LIGHTNING, POWERLOSS and WIND MITIGATION at beginning of this Section. Learn the buzzwords - Learn the terms / words used with hurricanes... Hurricane/Tropical Storm Watch - hurricane/tropical storm is possible within 48 hours so listen to TV and radioupdates Hurricane/Tropical Storm Warning - hurricane/tropical storm is expected within 36 hours -- may be told to evac-uate (if so, do it) and listen to radio or TV for updates Short term Watches and Warnings - warnings provide detailed information on specific hurricane threats (likeflash floods and tornadoes) Storm surge - large dome of water formed as the winds push water towards the shore. Surges can be up to 20 feet(6 meters) tall and 50 to 100 miles (80-160 km) wide. 67 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Eye wall - area that circles the eye of the storm and con- tains the most damaging winds and heaviest rains Outer bands - the outer rings or bands of thunderstorms that make landfall first Listen - Keep local radio or TV tuned in for weather forecasts and updates. (Some other radios to consider are Environment Canada's Weatheradio andNOAA's Weather Radio with battery backup and tone-alert feature thatautomatically alert you when a Watch or Warning has been issued.) Be ready to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and leave if you are told to evacuate. (see EVACUATION) Pets & large animals - Make arrangements for pets since shelters may not allow them. If you have horses or livestock, make a plan for an alternate sitein case they must be evacuated. (see tips on page 11 and in EVACUATION) Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit . Learn to shut off - Know where and how to shut off electricity, gas and water at main switches and valves -- ask local utilities for instructions. Batten down - Make plans to protect your property with storm shutters or board up windows with plywood that is measured to fit your windows.Tape does not prevent windows from breaking. (see WINDMITIGATION) Get insurance...? - Talk to your agent and find out more about the National Flood Insurance Program . (see FLOOD MITIGATION) Put it on film/chip/drive - Either videotape or take pictures of home and personal belongings and store them in a safe place (like a fireproof box ora safety deposit box or up in the cloud) along with important papers. DURING A HURRICANE THREAT : Listen - Have a battery-operated radio available to keep up on news reports, tornado warnings and evacuation routes. Evacuate? - If you are told to leave - do it! (see EVACUATION) And if you have time also... Secure your home - close storm shutters or put up boardson windows, moor your boat, and secure outdoor objectsor put them inside since winds will blow them around. Turn off utilities at main switches or valves, if instructed. 68 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Fill up your car with fuel. Make arrangements for pets in case you can't take them with you. Food & water - If you prepared ahead, you'll have your Disaster Supplies Kithandy to GRAB & GO... if not, gather up enough food and water for each family member for at least 3 days! IF INDOORS - Stay inside! Find a SAFE SPOT - get to small interior room, closet orhallway ... or lie on the floor under a heavy desk or table. Move away from windows and glass doors. IF IN A MULTI-STORY BUILDING - Go to the first or second floor! Find a SAFE SPOT - get to a small interior room or hall-way ... or lie on the floor under a heavy desk or table. Move away from outside walls and windows. Realize electricity may go out and alarms and sprinkler systems may go on. Things to avoid : moving water - 6 inches (15 cm) can knock you off your feet and 2 ft (0.6 m) can float a car flooding car - if flood waters rise around your car, get out and move to higher ground if you can safely bad weather - leave early enough so you are not trapped flooded areas - roadways and bridges may be washed-out downed power lines - extremely dangerous in floods!! Stay indoors - If you do not evacuate, stay indoors and stay away from glass doors and windows. Keep curtains and blinds closed and remember, a lullin the storm could only be the middle of the storm (the \"eye\") and windscan start again. Keep listening to radio or TV reports. Nasty weather - Be aware of other hazards like high winds, heavy rain, flooding and tornadoes. And realize weather can move hundreds of milesinto the mainland too. Right front quadrant - The northeast part or right front quadrant of a hurricane typically has the strongest winds and highest storm surge. If it'sa high tide when the storm slams ashore you could have serious problems. Limit phone calls - Only use phones in an emergency so it keeps lines open for local authorities. 69 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325AFTER A HURRICANE : Stay put - Stay where you are (if you're in a safe location) and don't return home (if you've been evacuated) until local authorities say it's okay.Realize it may take weeks, months or years before some areas will beclassed as \"safe\" due to health hazards or massive destruction from thestorm. Listen - Continue listening to your battery-powered radio for updates on weather and tips on getting assistance for housing, clothing, food, etc. Stick together - Keep family together since this is a very stressful time. Try to find chores for children so they feel they're helping with the situation. Things to avoid : flood waters - stay away from flood waters since it may be contaminated by oil, gasoline or raw sewage or may be electrically charged from underground or downed powerlines - wait for local authorities to approve returning toflooded areas moving water - 6 inches (15 cm) can knock you off your feet and 2 ft (0.6 m) can float a car flooded areas - roadways and bridges may be washed-out or weakened downed power lines - extremely dangerous and report them to power company Things to watch out for : weak structures - be careful since buildings and homes could have been weakened by wind or floods looting, guns and panicked people - be aware people may become violent trying to find loved ones, water orfood (or there may be criminals and jerks out stealingwhatever they can) bodies - strong storm surges, floods, and high winds may cause deaths so be aware there may be dead human andanimal carcasses scattered around Drinking water - Use bottled water or purify water until officials advise it is okay to drink out of the tap. (see TIPSONWATERPURIFICATION) Flooded food - Throw away any food that has come into contact with flood waters since eating it can make you sick! Wash your hands - Use clean water and soap when washing hands. 70 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Use bleach - The best thing to use for cleaning up flooded areas is house- hold bleach since it will help kill germs. Insurance - Call your insurance agent to set up a visit to your home. Mold - Consider asking a restoration professional to inspect your house for mold. (see AIRQUALITYMITIGATION) No power? - If you use a generator, keep it outside and follow the manufac- turer's instructions. (see some safety tips in POWERLOSSMITIGATION) Donations - Lots of people want to help victims of a hurricane and here are some tips... wait & see - don't donate food, clothing or personal items unless they are specifically requested money - donations to a known disaster relief group, like the Red Cross, Salvation Army, churches, etc. is alwayshelpful volunteers - if local authorities ask for your help, bring your own water, food and sleeping gear Recovery tips - Review TIPSON RECOVERINGFROMADISASTER at end of this Section. 71 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... A N UCLEAR POWER PLANT EMERGENCY ? Please note: Nukes [nuclear devices] and dirty bombs [radiological dispersion devices or RDDs] are both covered in the next topic called TERRORISM, but review next several pages before moving on. The World Nuclear Association reports as of February 2014 there are 434 commercial nuclear power reactors in 31 countries with 553 more reactorsunder construction, planned or proposed. The U.S. has over 100 commer-cial power plants and Canada has 19 power stations meaning millions ofcitizens live within 10 miles (16 km) of a reactor. And WNA reports thereare 240 research reactors (54 in the U.S.) mainly on university campuses. Even though governments and associations monitor and regulate construc- tion and operation of plants, accidents are possible and do happen. Anaccident could result in dangerous levels of radiation that could affect thehealth and safety of the public living near a nuclear power plant, as well aspeople many miles away depending on winds and weather - so millions ofNorth Americans could potentially be affected. Some other incidents involving possible radiation exposure may be a nuclear missile or suitcase nuke (plutonium creates massive energy anddestruction) or a \"dirty bomb\". (Again, these are covered in TERRORISM.) How is radiation detected? You cannot see, feel, taste or smell radiation, but special instruments candetect even the smallest levels of it. If radiation is released, authorities will monitor levels of radioactivity to determine the potential danger so they canalert and protect the public. Learn about detection devices on page 112. What is best way to reduce radiation exposure? Limit the amount of radiation you are exposed to by doing 3 things ... Distance - The more distance between you and the source of radiation, the less you'll receive. During a serious accident you may be told to evacuate. Shielding - Heavy, dense materials between you and radiation is best - this is why you want to stay indoors since the walls in your home should begood enough to protect you in some cases... but listen to radio and TV tolearn if you need to evacuate. Time - Most radioactivity loses its strength rather quickly. Limiting your time near the source of radiation reduces the amount you receive. 72 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What is the most dangerous part of a nuclear accident? Radioactive iodine - nuclear reactors contain many different radioactive products, but a dangerous one is radioactive iodine which, once absorbed,can damage cells of the thyroid gland. The greatest population that suffersin a nuclear accident is children (including unborn babies) since their thy- roid is so active, but all people are at risk of absorbing radioactive iodine. How can I be protected from radioactive iodine? Potassium iodide (KI) - can be purchased over-the-counter now (usually from companies selling disaster-related kits) and is known to be an effec-tive thyroid-blocking agent. In other words, it fills up the thyroid with goodiodine that keeps radioactive iodine from being absorbed into our bodies. What if I am allergic to iodine? According to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission Office ofNuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, the FDA suggests that risks ofallergic reaction to potassium iodide are minimal compared to subjectingyourself to cancer from radioactive iodine. Ask your doctor or pharmacistwhat you should keep on hand in the event of an allergic reaction. Many European countries stockpile potassium iodide (KI), especially since the Chernobyl incident. Several states are considering or already havestockpiles of KI ready in case of an accident or incident. As of 2005, the FDA has approved 3 KI products - Iosat, ThyroSafe, and ThyroShield. Learn more at www.fda.gov (do a search on KI) or www.bt.cdc.gov/radiation/ki.asp . In an emergency, other options may be taking KIO3, applying iodine solution to your skin, or taking kelp or seaweed pills. Community Planning for Emergencies (U.S. and Canada) Local, state and provincial governments, Federal agencies and utilities have developed emergency response plans in the event of a nuclear power plantaccident. United States' plans define 2 \"emergency planning zones\" (EPZs) Plume Exposure EPZ - a 10-mile radius from nuclear plant where people may be harmed by radiation exposure NOTE: People within a 10-mile radius are given emergency informa- tion about radiation, evacuation routes, special arrangements forhandicapped, etc. via brochures, phone books, and utility bills. Ingestion Exposure EPZ - about a 50-mile radius from plant where accidentally released radioactive materials could con-taminate water supplies, food crops and livestock 73 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Canada's Provincial Nuclear Emergency Response Plans define 3 \"zones\" Contiguous Zone - approximately 3 kilometres from nuclear facility where evacuation and sheltering may be ordered Primary Zone - approximately 10 kilometres from the nuclear facility where evacuation and sheltering may be ordered Secondary Zone - approximately 50 kilometres from the nuclear facility where radioactive contamination couldcause monitoring and/or bans on some food and water sources NOTE: Public Education brochures are available to residents and businesses within the Primary Zone (10 km) of each nuclear facility. BEFORE A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT EMERGENCY : Learn the buzzwords - Know terms used in both countries to describe a nuclear emergency at a plant: U.S. / (Canada )... Notification of Unusual Event / (Reportable Event )- a small problem has occurred. No radiation leak is expected.Federal, state/provincial and county/municipal officials willbe told right away. No action on your part will be necessary. Alert / (Abnormal Incident )- a small problem has occurred, and small amounts of radiation could leak inside plant. Thiswill not affect you and you shouldn't have to do anything. Site Area Emergency / (Onsite Emergency )- a more seri- ous problem... small amounts of radiation could leak fromthe plant. If necessary, officials will act to ensure public safety. Area sirens may be sounded and listen to your radio orTV for information. General Emergency / (General Emergency )- the MOST serious problem... radiation could leak outside the plant andoff the plant site. In most cases sirens will sound so listen tolocal radio or TV for reports and updates. State/Provincial andcounty/municipal officials will act to assure public safety andbe prepared to follow their instructions! Learn signals - Ask about your community's warning system and pay atten- tion to \"test\" dates to learn if you can HEAR it. Nuclear power plants arerequired to install sirens and other warning devices to cover a 10-mile areaaround the plant in the U.S. (If you live outside the 10-mile area you willprobably learn of the event through local TV and radio, but just be awarewinds and weather can impact areas as far as 200 miles [320 km] away!!) Learn risks - Ask the company operating the plant for brochures and data. 74 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit . Double check on emergency plans for schools, day cares or places family may be and where they'll go if evacuated. And please review the Nuclear section in TERRORISMtopic to learn more about long-term sheltering, protection from fallout, radiation detection devices, etc. Go? - Listen to authorities and leave if told to go. (see EVACUATION) DURING A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT EMERGENCY : Stay calm - Not all accidents release radiation - may be contained in plant. Listen - Turn on radio or TV . Authorities will give specific instructions and information... pay attention to what THEY tell you rather than what is written in this Manual since they know the facts for each specific incident. Stay or go..? - Evacuate if told to do so by local authorities ... and ... Grab your Disaster Supplies Kit . Close doors, windows and fireplace damper. Cover your mouth and nose with face mask or cloth. Close car windows and vents and use \"re-circulating\" air. Keep listening to radio for evacuation routes & updates. As long as you are NOT told to evacuate, do the following... IF INDOORS - Stay inside and prepare to \"shelter-in-place\"... Close doors and windows and your fireplace damper. Turn off air conditioner, ventilation fans, furnace and other intakes (they pull in air from outside). Go to a basement or underground area (if possible). Keep a battery-operated radio with you to hear updates. Stay inside until authorities tell you it is safe to go out! IF OUTDOORS - Get indoors as soon as possible! Cover mouth and nose with a cloth or napkins and findshelter. Once inside, remove clothing, shower & wash hair and put on fresh clothing and different shoes. Put clothes and shoes you were wearing in plastic bags, seal andstore. Local authorities can tell you what to do with bags. IF IN A VEHICLE - Keep windows up, close vents, use \"recirculating\" air and keep listening to radio for updates. If possible, drive away from site. 75 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Pets & livestock - Get them in shelters with clean food and water that has not been exposed to air-borne radiation, especially milk-producing animals. Food - Put food in covered containers or in refrigerator -- any food that was not in a covered container should be washed first. Take potassium iodide..? - IF radioactive iodine has been released into the air from a power plant accident, some states may decide to provide KI pills mentioned at beginning of this topic to people in a 10-mile radius. NOTE: Take KI pills ONLY as directed by local public health authorities and follow instructions on the package exactly! (see page 73) AFTER A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT EMERGENCY : Listen - Keep radio and TV tuned in -- stay in until authorities say all clear. Clean up - If you were possibly exposed to radiation... store clothes & shoes - put clothing and shoes in tightly sealed containers or plastic bags and ask health officials what to do with them shower - wash your body and hair to remove radioactive particles land and property - ask authorities how to clean up area Weird symptoms - Seek medical attention if you have symptoms like upset stomach or feel queasy after a reported incident since it could be related toradiation exposure. (see page 114 for more about radiation sickness) Gardens &crops - Authorities will provide information concerning safety of farm and homegrown products -- or check with agricultural extensionagent. Unharvested crops are hard to protect but crops that are alreadyharvested should be stored inside, if possible. Milk - Local officials should inspect cows' and goats' milk before using. Recovery tips - Review TIPSON RECOVERINGFROMADISASTER More tips - See TERRORISM for more information about a nuke crisis. 76 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... TERRORISM ? Terrorism is the use of force or violence against persons or property usually for emotional or political reasons or for ransom. The main goal of terrorists is to create public fear and panic. Obviously there is a lot of anxiety since the September 11, 2001 attacks on the U.S., however, being afraid or worrying is very unhealthy - especiallyabout something you have little control over. But remember, terroristattacks are a very low risk possibility. Let's put a few \"risks\" in perspective ... the chances of having high blood pressure is 1 in 4 ... the odds of dying from cancer is 1 in 500 ... and theodds of dying from anthrax is 1 in 56 million ! People need to remain calm about the threat of terrorist attacks and learn about some of the types, how to prepare for them, and what to expect insome cases. Discuss this with everyone - even the kids so they can talkabout their feelings too. Stay current on news but don't obsess over it ... andjust be aware of your surroundings as you go about your daily routines. One type of terrorism that we can help prevent is the use of guns and bombs by children and youth against other groups of children at schools. A keysolution to stopping this type of school violence is through communication,education and awareness - and it starts within the FAMILY ! (see also APPENDIXC - SCHOOLSAFETYRESOURCES) The Federal Bureau of Investigation categorizes terrorism in two ways: Domestic terrorism - terrorist activities are directed at certain groups or parts of the government within the U.S. without foreign direction. Some examples of domestic terrorism include shootings and bomb threats at schools, the Oklahoma City bombing of theFederal Building, and the letters mailed to various groupswith a white powdery substance (anthrax scares). International terrorism - terrorist activities are foreign-based by countries or groups outside the U.S. Some examples of international terrorism include bombings like the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen and U.S. Embassies in othercountries, the attacks on the Pentagon and World TradeCenter, hostage situations with civilians in various coun-tries, or threats with weapons of mass destruction. 77 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Until recently, most terrorist attacks involved bombs, guns, kidnappings and hijackings, but some other forms of terrorism involve cyber attacks orCBRN (chemical or biological agents, radiological or nuclear devices). Cyber attacks - computer-based attacks from individuals, networking groups, terrorist groups or nations causing severe problems for govern-ment, businesses and public in general (sometimes causing or leading toinjury and death) Chemical agents - poisonous vapors, liquids or solids that can kill or slow down or weaken people, destroy livestock or crops -- can be absorbedthrough the skin, swallowed or inhaled Biological agents - infectious microbes (tiny life forms), germs or other substances that occur naturally or are \"designed\" to produce illness or deathin people, animals or plants -- can be inhaled, enter through a cut in theskin, or swallowed when eating or drinking Radiological threat or device - a \"dirty bomb\" or RDD uses conventional explosives to spread radioactive materials over a general or targeted area Nuclear device - a bomb or missile using weapons grade uranium or plutonium -- requires long-term sheltering from the deadly fallout. Anddevices can range in size and yield from suitcase-sized nukes toIntercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Terrorism is quite an extensive topic now -- below we are listing some basic things to do before ANY type of terrorist attack followed by several pagesexplaining the National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS). Then we will cover specific types of potential terrorist attacks shown above in red - including what to do BEFORE, DURINGand AFTER each and where to find more information. We also threw in some tips for handling\"bomb threats\"or \"suspicious packages\" and suggest some sheltering andshielding tips in the event of a nuclear crisis. Keep in mind, the best thing you can do about terrorism is prepare yourself and your family for the unexpected, so please review this entire topic. Bylearning about potential threats, we are all better prepared to know how toreact if the unthinkable happens. Americans are very fortunate since we have a strong, talented network of First Responders who rapidly respond to threats and incidents. But let's look at some statistics. The U.S. has approximately 800,000 active Law Enforcement Officials (includes Police & Sheriff), 1.1 million 78 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Firefighters (over 70% are volunteers) and 210,000 EMT / paramedics. That means there are about 2.1 million First Responders supporting over 310 million people..! And there are millions of active military personnel, Federal agents and observant citizens you could add to the mix ... but the numbers of eyes andears could increase exponentially if more people would pay attention BEFORE ANYTYPE OF TERRORIST ATTACK : Be alert - You should always be aware of your surroundings and report any suspicious activities to local authorities. Be vigilant - Dictionary.com defines vigilant as \"keeping careful watch for possible danger or difficulties\". It also is defined as \"watchful, alert, obser-vant, guarded, attentive, awake, cautious, careful, wary, on the alert, on thelookout\" ... among other things. We are not implying you become a snitchor panicked, but just be aware of your surroundings as you go through yourday to day activities. Some things you can do to be more vigilant include... Stay calm - As mentioned at the beginning of this topic, terrorist attacks are a very low risk possibility so there isno need to worry or panic. Be aware & watch - Stay current on news, alerts and threats - but don't obsess over them - then start making ahabit of being aware of your surroundings. You don't haveto be paranoid or obvious - just watch for things that lookstrange or out of place especially if you walk or drive thesame route day after day. If you see something, say somethingTM- This program is spreading across the nation, and it's a good suggestion. Weare not implying you spy on your neighbors, but as you goabout your day, watch for suspicious activities -- likesomeone wearing a heavy coat on a hot day or unattendedbags, briefcases or backpacks in odd places -- and reportanything that seems out of the ordinary. It may be com-pletely harmless ... but it might not. Many crimes andplots have been thwarted by citizens who saw somethingweird and reported it to officials. Know the targets - Terrorists prefer areas that are easy to access by the public like airports, train or bus stations,military and government buildings, major events, schools,malls, etc. Some other high risk targets include water andfood supplies, nuclear power plants, and high-profile 79 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325landmarks. When you are at these types of facilities, try to pay more attention to activities going on around you. Get involved - Talk to your local Fire, Police, Health, Sheriff and Emergency Management offices and ask ifthey have volunteer programs available for citizens andbusinesses. (Learn about Citizen Corps or CERT on pages 222-224) Some agencies even have safety classes and programs for youth and children too. Stay current on threats - Both U.S. Department of Homeland Security www.dhs.gov and Public Safety Canada www.publicsafety.gc.ca post alerts online. Things to watch out for: unknown packages - DONOT accept a package or case from a stranger unattended bags - report unattended bags or backpacks to authorities and don't ask strangers to watch your stuff orleave bags or purses alone (esp. when traveling) emergency exits - always be aware of where EXITS are... just casually look around for signs since most aremarked well in public places Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit . And Appendix B has plans andsuggestions for businesses. ABOUT THE NATIONAL TERRORISM ADVISORY SYSTEM The National Terrorism Advisory System, or NTAS, replaced the color-coded Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS) as of 2011. NTAS willmore effectively communicate information about terrorist threats by providing timely, detailed information to the public, government agencies,first responders, airports and other transportation hubs, and the private sector. It recognizes that Americans all share responsibility for the nation's security, and should always be aware of the heightened risk of terroristattack in the United States and what they should do. NTAS Alerts Imminent Threat Alert - Warns of a credible, specific, and impending terrorist threat against the United States. 80 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Elevated Threat Alert - Warns of a credible terrorist threat against the United States. The NTAS Alerts will be based on the nature of the threat: in some cases, alerts will be sent directly to law enforcement or affected areas of the private sector, while in others, alerts will be issued more broadly to theAmerican people through both official and media channels. Additionally, NTAShas a sunset provision meaning individual threat alerts will be issued with a specific end date. Alerts may be extended if newinformation becomes available or if the threat evolves significantly. How does the new NTAS system work? When there is credible information about a threat, an NTAS Alert will beshared with the American public. It may include specific information, ifavailable, about the nature of the threat, including the geographic region,mode of transportation, or critical infrastructure potentially affected by thethreat, as well as steps that individuals and communities can take to protectthemselves and their families, and help prevent, mitigate or respond to thethreat. The advisory will clearly indicate whether the threat is Elevated (if DHS has no specific information about the timing or location) or Imminent (if officials believes the threat is impending or very soon). How can you help? Citizens should report suspicious activity to their local law enforcementauthorities. The \" If You See Something, Say Something TM\" campaign across the U.S. encourages all citizens to be vigilant for indicators of potential terrorist activity, and to follow NTAS Alerts for information aboutthreats in specific places or for individuals exhibiting certain types of suspicious activity. Visit www.dhs.gov/ifyouseesomethingsaysomething to learn more. Learn more and find NTAS print materials and tools at www.dhs.gov/alerts or follow DHS on FB at www.facebook.com/NTASAlerts or on Twitter http://twitter.com/NTASAlerts ABOUT CYBER ATTACKS There are 3 key risk factors related to information technologies systems: A direct attack against a system \"through the wires\" alone(called hacking) -- meaning an attacker or user \"hacks\" inor gains \" access \" to restricted data and operations. 81 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325An attack can be a physical assault against a critical IT element meaning an attacker changes or destroys data,modifies programs or takes control of a system (basicallycan cause a loss of data \" integrity \" = data is no good). The attack can be from the inside -- meaning private information could get in the wrong hands and becomepublic or identities stolen (basically \" confidentiality \" is broken = data is no longer secure or private). Cyber attacks target computer networks that run government, financial, health, emergency medical services, public safety, telecommunications,transportation and utility systems - also known as \"critical infrastructure\".Because technologies have improved our access to information, we haveopened ourselves up for attacks by our enemies to destroy or alter this data. Cyberterrorism is different than computer crime or \"hacktivism\" (which can be costly and a pain to fix but doesn't threaten lives or public safety.) Cyberterrorism is usually done with a minimal loss of life but there are some groups that could use cyber attacks or cyber warfare to cause humancasualties or fear by disrupting transportation or public safety systems. For example, prior to Russia invading Georgia in 2008, Georgian Internet servers were overloaded by multiple coordinated distributed denial of service (or D.D.O.S.) attacks. These attacks crippled Georgia's govern-ment, media, communications and transportation web sites before and afterRussian troops entered South Ossetia. It's the first time a cyberattack coincided with a shooting war according to some Internet experts. 6 We are not trying to cause worry or panic, but understand the possibilityexists and services could be disrupted or cut off or man-made disasterscould happen due to cyber attacks. For example, services like banking, gaspumps, or internet access could be down or slow. And some emergencyplanners are concerned a cyber attack combined with a physical act of terrorism (like a \"dirty bomb\"or releasing a chemical or biological agent)could potentially interfere with response capabilities. As we have seen in news reports, many systems (including military and government systems) have been breached repeatedly and over the course ofmany years or even decades by rogue hackers and nations. Many expertsfeel the next major conflict could be a cyberwar rather than conventionalwarfare. Most countries have agencies committed to securing and monitoring critical infrastructure and share information on a regular basis. Businessesand consumers can help too by taking some preventative measures. 82 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325BEFORE A CYBER ATTACK : Protect computers - Make sure your computers and wireless devices have current anti-virus software and firewalls, and update and scan them often. Learn more - Consumers and businesses should take some time to visit the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team or NCSA and learnmore about Internet security at www.us-cert.gov or www.staysafeonline.org Stay current on threats & alerts - The Department of Homeland Security www.dhs.gov and Public Safety Canada www.publicsafety.gc.ca post alerts and news about national security online. What .. no services? - Think about how you would handle not having access to the Internet, phones, ATMs and other electronic devices you use daily. Acyber attack could disrupt or crash systems so have a backup plan and listen to authorities for updates. Business Continuity tips - See APPENDIX B to learn about resources that can help businesses and employees prepare for the unexpected. ABOUT CHEMICAL AGENTS Chemical agents are toxic vapors (gas), sprays (aerosols), liquids or solidsthat can poison people, animals and the environment. Some compounds oragents do have industrial uses, but many are man-made substancesdesigned, developed and stockpiled as military weapons around the world. A known terrorist tactic combines bombs and chemical trucks to spread deadly fumes. Most chemical agents are difficult to produce and very hardto deliver in large quantities since they scatter so quickly. Most are liquidsand some may be odorless and tasteless. They could be inhaled, absorbedinto the skin, or swallowed from a contaminated food or water source.Chemical agents can take effect immediately or over several hours or days- and can be deadly if exposed to enough of the agent. If exposed, the bestthing to do is distance yourself from the agent and area and get fresh air. What chemical agents could be used in an attack? According to the CDC, there are several categories of chemical agents that could potentially be used in a terrorist attack - some common ones include: Blister Agents / Vesicants (Sulfur Mustard / Mustard Gas or Lewisite) - primarily cause blisters but can also damageeyes, airways, and digestive system Blood Agents (Arsine or Cyanide) - gets in blood stream and prevents cells from absorbing oxygen so cells die 83 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Choking / Lung / Pulmonary Agents (Ammonia or Chlorine) - cause breathing problems and lack of oxygendamages organs Incapacitating Agents (BZ or LSD) - disrupts central nervous system, causes confusion, and slows breathing(makes you woozy or knocks you out) Nerve Agents (Sarin, Soman, Tabun or VX) - the most toxic agents -- basically turns \"off\" the body's ability tostop muscles and glands from twitching (body goes intoconvulsions). Most agents were originally developed aspesticides / insecticides. Some other categories include ... Biotoxins (like Abrin or Ricin), Caustics (Hydrofluoric Acid), Metals (Arsenic or Mercury), Organic Solvents (Benzene), Riot Control Agents / Tear Gas (CS or CN), Toxic Alcohols (Ethylene Glycol), and Vomiting Agents (Adamsite). Remember, many chemical weapons - or chemical warfare - have been around since World War I ... it's unfortunate we have to even discuss it buttry not to let this topic frighten you. Educate yourselves about the types andwhere to find more information so you are prepared to react in the event ofa chemical threat or attack. How could chemical agents be used in an attack? There are several ways chemical agents could be spread: Vapors / Gas / Aerosols - spread into air by a bomb or from aircraft, boats or vehicles -- could spread for miles Liquids - could be released into the air, water or soil or touched by people or animals Solids - could be absorbed into water, soil or touched Some chemical agents can remain in the environment and cause problems long after they are released. Keep in mind, both the Center for DiseaseControl and Environmental Protection Agency are working closely withvarious Departments of Defense and Energy and officials around the country to monitor systems and security and develop plans. The same goesfor Health Canada and other Canadian government agencies. In the event of a public health emergency, officials will tell people what actions need to be taken. But learn as much as you can before a crisis tohelp alleviate some stress, fear and problems. What are the names of some chemical agents and what can they do? According to the CDC's Emergency Preparedness andResponse site, there 84 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325are many types of chemical agents - too many to list here. We're only men- tioning several common agents in alphabetical order, but there are manyothers we are not covering that could potentially be used. Always listen toauthorities for instructions in the event of a chemical threat or attack. BZ(Incapacitating ) - and other stun agents (LSD, etc.) disrupt the central nervous system causing confusion, short-term memory loss and immobili-ty (means you can't move or are incapacitated). How it spreads :BZcould be released by a bomb or sprayed into the air as an aerosol but has been proven unpredictable if used outdoors. Signs & Symptoms :Depends on how person is exposed to BZand varies by person -- basically it disrupts your nervous system causing confusion,dream-like feelings or strange visions (called hallucinations), dilation of thepupils (means pupils bigger than normal), slurred speech, and loss of motorskills (can't move). It can also slow down breathing and heart rate. Treatment :BZis treated with an antidote that reverses symptoms for an hour. May need repeated doses since effects can last for hours or days. Chlorine (Choking / Lung / Pulmonary ) - is used in industry (to bleach paper or cloth), in water (to kill germs), and in household products.Chlorine can be in the form of a poisonous gas or gas can be pressurizedand cooled into a liquid. When gas comes in contact with moist tissues(eyes, throat, or lungs), an acid is produced that can damage these tissues.Chlorine is not flammable but reacts explosively if mixed with certainliquids. Terrorists use bombs on chlorine trucks to spread deadly fumes. How it spreads :Chlorine could be released into water, food or air. People can be exposed by drinking or eating something contaminated with excessamounts of chlorine or by inhaling the poisonous gas. Chlorine gas is yel-low-green, smells like bleach, and stays close to the ground as it spreads. Signs & Symptoms :Depends on how much and how exposed but signs may show up during or right after exposure to dangerous amounts of chlorine : Skin - if gas: burning pain, redness, and blisters if liquid: skin white or waxy, numbness (like frostbite) Eyes - burning feeling, blurred vision, watery eyes Nose, throat &lungs (respiratory tract) - burning feeling in nose and throat, tightness in chest, coughing, hard timebreathing or shortness of breath, fluid builds up in lungswithin 2 to 4 hours Stomach / gastrointestinal : puking, sick to stomach 85 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Treatment :- There is no antidote for chlorine exposure -- main things are to remove it from body and seek medical attention as soon as possible. First - leave area as quickly as possible ... if outdoors - get to high ground (avoid low-lying areas)... if in building - get outside to high ground and upwind If inhaled - get fresh air as quickly and calmly as possible If on clothing or skin - remove clothes and shoes that are contaminated but don't pull anything over head - cut it offbody. If possible, seal clothing in plastic bag, then seal thatbag in a bag. Immediately wash body with clean water andsoap. Ask officials how to dispose of bags. If in eyes - remove contacts and put in a bag - do not put back in eyes! If eyes burning or vision blurred, rinse eyeswith plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If wearing glasses,wash them with soap and water before putting back on. If swallowed - if someone drinks or eats something exposed to chlorine, doNOT make them puke or drinkfluids - call 9-1-1 Cyanide (Blood ) - is a very fast acting and potentially deadly chemical that exists in several forms. The CDC categorizes cyanide as \"blood\" agents butsometimes called \"cyanide or cyanogen\" agents. Cyanide can be a colorlessgas (cyanogen chloride or hydrogen cyanide) or a crystal solid form (likepotassium or sodium cyanide). It may smell like \"bitter almonds\" but mostoften is odorless. Cyanide is naturally present in some foods or plants - it'salso in cigarette smoke or given off when some plastics burn. It is also usedto make paper or textiles and in chemicals used to develop photos. How it spreads :Cyanide could enter water, soil or air as a result of natu- ral or industrial processes or be spread indoors or outdoors as a weapon.People can be exposed by breathing gas or vapors or cigarette smoke, bydrinking or eating something contaminated (either accidentally or on pur-pose) or by touching soil or clothing that was exposed to cyanide. The gasdisappears quickly and rises (less dense than air) so pretty useless outdoors. Signs & Symptoms :Basically cyanide prevents the cells from absorbing oxygen so cells die. No matter how exposed (breathing, absorbed throughskin, or eating / drinking) some or all signs show up within minutes: Exposed to small amount - rapid breathing, gasping for air, dizziness, weakness, headache, sick to stomach, puking, restlessness, rapid heart rate, bluish skin or lips(due to lack of oxygen in blood) Large amount - above signs plus convulsions, low blood pressure, slow heart rate, passes out, stops breathing 86 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325leading to death. Survivors of serious poisoning may develop heart and brain damage due to lack of oxygen. Treatment :Cyanide poisoning is treated with antidotes and supportive medical care (mainly to help symptoms). The main things are to avoid areawhere it was released and seek medical attention as soon as possible. First - leave area as quickly as possible ... if outdoors - move upwind and stay low to ground... if in building - get outside and get upwind If inhaled - get fresh air as quickly and calmly as possible If on clothing or skin - remove contaminated shoes and clothes but don't pull anything over head - cut it off. Sealall in a bag then put that bag in a bag - ask how to disposeof. Immediately wash body andhairwith soap & water. If in eyes - remove contacts if necessary. If eyes burning or vision blurred, rinse eyes with water for 10-15 minutes. If swallowed - if someone drinks or eats something exposed to cyanide, doNOT make them puke or drinkfluids - call 9-1-1 Sarin (Nerve ) - is a clear, colorless, odorless and tasteless liquid that could evaporate into a vapor (gas) and contaminate the environment. It is man-made and originally developed to kill insects. Nerve agents basically turn\"off\" the body's ability to stop muscles and glands from twitching. How it spreads :Sarin could be released into the air, water, or soil as a weapon. People can be exposed by breathing vapors, by drinking or eatingsomething contaminated, or by touching water, soil or clothing exposed tosarin. A person's clothing can release sarin for about 30 minutes after beingexposed to vapor. Because sarin vapor is heavier than air, it settles in low-lying areas creating a greater exposure hazard. Signs & Symptoms :Depends on how much, what form, and how people are exposed to sarin . No matter how exposed (breathing, absorbed through skin, or eating / drinking it), the following may show up within seconds(vapor or gas) or within minutes to 18 hours (liquid)... Head - runny nose, drooling or excess spittle, headache Eyes - watery, small pupils, blurred vision, eye pain Lungs - cough, tight feeling in chest, fast/rapid breathing Nervous system - confusion, drowsiness, weakness Heart/blood - slow/fast pulse, rise/drop in blood pressure Stomach/gastrointestinal - abdominal pain, puking, sick to stomach, diarrhea, pee lot more than normal ... plus ... 87 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325If exposed to small amount - just a drop of sarin on skin can cause sweating and muscle twitching If large amount - can cause convulsions (body can't stop the muscles and glands from twitching), paralysis (can'tmove), pass out, stops breathing leading to death Treatment :Sarin poisoning is treated with antidotes and supportive med- ical care. Mainly want to avoid area where released, get decontaminated(strip &wash), and seek medical attention as soon as possible. First - leave area as quickly as possible ... if outdoors - move to higher ground and stay upwind... if in building - get outside to highest ground possible If inhaled - get fresh air as quickly and calmly as possible If on clothing or skin - remove contaminated clothes and shoes but don't pull anything over head - cut it off body.Seal all in plastic bag, then seal that bag in a bag and askhow to dispose of. Immediately wash body with cleanwater and soap. If in eyes - remove contacts if any. If eyes burning or vision blurred, rinse eyes with water for 10 -15 minutes. If swallowed - if someone drinks or eats something exposed to sarin, doNOT make them puke or drink fluids- call 9-1-1 Sulfur Mustard / Mustard gas (Blister/Vesicant ) - (also known as mus- tard agent) can be in the form of a vapor, an oily-textured liquid or a solidand be clear to yellow or brown when in liquid or solid form. It is not normally found in the environment, however, if released, can last for weeksor months under very cold conditions. During normal weather conditions,it usually only lasts a day or two. Mustard gas is fairly easy to develop so many countries that decide to have chemical warfare agents usually stock up on this one. Sulfur mustard wasoriginally produced in the 1800's but first used as chemical warfare inWorld War I and in many wars since. Exposure to mustard gas is usually notfatal but could have long-term health effects. How it spreads :Sulfur mustard / mustard gas can be released into the air as a vapor or gas and enter a person's body by breathing or get on skin orin eyes. The vapor would be carried for long distances by wind so couldaffect a wide area. Sulfur mustard is heavier than air so vapors will settle inlow-lying areas. A liquid or solid form could be released into water and aperson could be exposed by drinking it or absorbing it through the skin.Since it often has no smell or smell doesn't raise a red flag (can smell likegarlic, onions or mustard), people may not realize they have been exposed. 88 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Signs & Symptoms :Depends on how much, what form, and how a per- son is exposed to sulfur mustard / mustard gas and may not occur for 2 to 24 hours ... some immediate signs include... Skin - redness and itching of skin may occur 2 to 48 hours after exposure -- changes to yellow blistering of skin Eyes - a mild case causes irritation, pain, swelling and watery eyes within 3 to 12 hours -- a more severe casecauses same within 1 to 2 hours - may also include lightsensitivity, severe pain or temporary blindness (lasting upto 10 days) Nose &lungs (respiratory tract) - runny nose, sneezing, sinus pain, bloody nose, short of breath, may get hoarse,and cough (mild exposure shows within 12 to 24 hours --severe shows within 2 to 4 hours) Digestive tract - abdominal pain, sick to stomach, diarrhea, puking, and fever Some long-term health effects may include ... Burns or scarring - exposure to the liquid (not gas) may produce second- and third-degree burns and later scarring Breathing problems or disease - severe exposure could cause chronic respiratory disease, infections, or death Blindness - severe exposure can blind you permanently Cancer - may increase risk of lung or respiratory cancer Treatment :There is no antidote for sulfur mustard / mustard gas exposure - the best thing to do is avoid it by leaving the area where it was released. First - leave area as quickly as possible ... if outdoors - move upwind and get to higher ground... if inside - get outside, upwind and to higher ground If inhaled - get fresh air as quickly and calmly as possible If on clothing or skin - remove everything that got con- taminated. Seal clothing and shoes in plastic bag, then sealthat bag in a bag - ask how to dispose of later. Immediatelywash exposed body parts (eyes, skin, hair, etc.) with plain,clean water. If in eyes - remove contacts if any. Flush eyes with water for 5 - 10 minutes but do NOT cover eyes with bandages- put on shades or goggles to protect them. If swallowed - if someone drinks or eats something con- taminated with sulfur mustard (mustard gas), doNOTmake them puke it up -- give the person some milk todrink and call 9-1-1 89 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325VX(Nerve ) - is an oily liquid that is odorless, tasteless, amber or honey- yellow in color, and evaporates about as slowly as motor oil. VX is the mostpotent of all nerve agents, which basically turn \"off\" the body's ability tostop muscles and glands from twitching. Like other nerve agents, VXis aman-made chemical originally developed to kill insects and pests. How it spreads :VXcould be released into the air or water as a weapon, however it does not mix with water as well as other nerve agents. If VX gasor vapors are released into the air, people can be exposed by breathing oreye or skin contact and a person's clothing can release VX for about 30minutes after being exposed. If VX liquid is put in food or water source,people could get it from eating, drinking or touching something exposed tothe liquid. VX vapor is heavier than air so settles in low-lying areas. Under average weather conditions, VX can last for days on objects that come in contactwith the agent, but in cold weather it could last for months. The liquid takestime to evaporate into a vapor so could be a long-term threat to the environment. Signs & Symptoms :VXis similar to sarin - depends on how much, what form, and how people are exposed. No matter how exposed (breathing,absorbed through skin, or eating / drinking it) the following may show upwithin seconds to hours ... Head - runny nose, drooling or excess spittle, headache Eyes - watery, small pupils, blurred vision, eye pain Lungs - cough, tight feeling in chest, fast/rapid breathing Nervous system - confusion, drowsiness, weakness Heart/blood - slow/fast pulse, rise/drop in blood pressure Stomach/gastrointestinal - abdominal pain, puking, sick to stomach, diarrhea, pee more than normal ... plus ... If exposed to small amount - a tiny drop of VX on skin can cause sweating and muscle twitching If large amount - can cause convulsions (body can't stop the muscles and glands from twitching), paralysis (can'tmove), may pass out, stops breathing leading to death Treatment :VXpoisoning can be treated with antidotes but must be given shortly after exposure to be effective. The main things are avoid area whereagent was released, get decontaminated (strip & wash), and seek medicalcare as soon as possible. First - leave area as quickly as possible ... if outdoors - move to higher ground and stay upwind 90 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325... if in building - get outside to highest ground possible If inhaled - get fresh air as quickly and calmly as possible If on clothing or skin - remove clothes and shoes contam- inated with VX but don't pull anything over head - cut itoff body. Seal all in plastic bag, then seal that bag in a bagand ask how to dispose of. Immediately wash body withclean water and soap. If in eyes - remove contacts if any. If eyes burning or vision blurred, rinse eyes with water for 10 to 15 minutes. If swallowed - if someone drinks or eats something exposed to VX, doNOT make them puke or drink fluids -call 9-1-1 BEFORE A CHEMICAL ATTACK : Watch & listen for signs - Many chemical agents can cause watery eyes, choking, trouble breathing, coughing or twitching. If you see or hear a lotof people doing this or see a bunch of birds, fish or critters sick or dead, itshould raise a red flag. Learn about some common potentially hazardouschemical agents (see previous pages) and stay current by listening to radioand TV to hear what local authorities tell people to do -- and DOit! Report strange things - Be aware of your surroundings -- watch for strange or suspicious packages, luggage or backpacks ... or spray trucks or cropdusters in weird places at strange times ... and report suspicious activities tolocal authorities. Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit . Some key items include a battery-powered radio (with extra batteries), food and drinking water, duct tape, plastic and scis-sors, first aid kit, and sanitation items (soap, extra water and bleach). Pick a room - It could take authorities time to determine what (if any) agent was used so pick a room in advance your family could use if told to\"shelter-in-place\" for several hours. It's best to pick an internal room whereyou could block out air IF told to do so. To save time consider measuring, cutting and labeling plastic sheets in advance for openings (vents, windows,and doors). Remember, toilets / drains may be vented meaning outside aircomes in constantly or when flushed / open (depends on design) - in caseyou're using a bathroom as a safe room. Calculate air for room - Keep in mind people can stay in a sealed off room for only so long (or you'll run out of air.) FEMA suggests 10 square feet offloor space per person (like 5ft x 2ft / 1.5m x 0.6m ) will provide enoughair to prevent carbon dioxide buildup for up to 5 hours. 91 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Be ready to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and leave if you are told to evacuate. (see EVACUATION) DURING A CHEMICAL ATTACK : During any type of chemical attack, local authorities will instruct the public on where to go and exactly what to do if exposed to an agent (whichmay require immediate attention with professional medical staff). Watch for signs - If you see or hear a lot of people choking, coughing or twitching or see a bunch of sick or dead critters - leave area quickly! Don't panic -- Listen - Stay calm and listen to radio, TV and officials to ... Determine if your area is or was in danger. Learn signs and symptoms of some agents (see previouspages briefly describing BZ, chlorine, cyanide, sarin, sulfur mustard / mustard gas , and VX). Find out if and where antidotes are being distributed. IF INDOORS - Stay inside and prepare to \"shelter-in-place\"... Close your windows, vents and fireplace damper and turn off A/C and fans to reduce air drawn in from outside. Seal gaps under doorways and windows with wet towels, plastic (if available)and duct tape. If you picked a safe room in advance, grab your Disaster Supplies Kit and seal off that room - remember, you can only stay there for so many hours or you'll run out of air. Some vapors and gases may sink so avoid basements(unless instructed otherwise). IF OUTDOORS - Stay upwind from the disaster area since many agents can be carried by wind. Try to find a shelter as quickly as possible. IF IN A VEHICLE - Close your windows and shut off vents to reduce risk and drive away and upwind from the attack site, if possible. Cover up - Cover mouth and nose to filter air but still let you breathe (like a T-shirt or towel or several layers of paper towel, napkins or tissues). Feel sick...? - Some agents can cause immediate symptoms and some take a while to show up so watch family members for signs of illness. Evacuate...? - If you are told to evacuate... DO it! If officials say you have time, close windows, shut vents and turn off attic fans. (see EVACUATION) 92 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Things to avoid: chemicals - any spilled liquid materials, vapors or gas contaminated food or water - don't eat or drink any food or water that may have been exposed to materials Stay away - Get away from the attack site to avoid contamination. AFTER A CHEMICAL ATTACK : Feel sick...? - In some cases, people won't be aware they have been exposed to an agent -- most cause immediate symptoms and some take a while toshow up so continue watching for signs of illness. Don't panic -- Listen - Stay calm and listen to radio, TV and officials to ... Determine if your area is or was in danger. Learn signs and symptoms of specific chemical agent(s). Find out if antidotes are being distributed by authoritiesand, if so, where you can get them. Don't go there - Don't return home until local authorities say it is safe. Air out - Open windows, vents and turn on fans to air things out. Clean up - A person, critter or item that has been exposed could spread it... decontamination - follow instructions from authorities since it depends on chemical. May need to shower with orwithout soap or may be told to avoid water - check first strange symptoms - if unusual symptoms show up, get to a hospital or medical expert right away store clothes & shoes - put exposed clothing and shoes in tightly sealed containers or bags and ask local authoritieshow to get rid of them tell people you've been exposed - tell everyone who comes in contact with you that you may have beenexposed to a chemical agent land and property - ask local authorities how to clean up Strange vapors or danger - Report these to local authorities immediately. For more information about chemical agents , visit the CDC Emergency Preparedness &Response site at www.bt.cdc.gov .. or .. call CDC Hotline at 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636) or 1-888-232-6348 (TTY). 93 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325ABOUT BIOLOGICAL AGENTS Biological agents are actually tiny life forms or germs that can occur naturally in plants, animals and soils or can be developed for scientific ormilitary purposes. Many biological agents affect humans by being inhaled,absorbed into the skin through a cut, or by swallowing contaminated foodor water. But there are things that make it difficult for some biologicalagents to live like sunlight (ultraviolet light) or dry conditions. Wind couldcarry agents long distances but also spreads it out making it less effective. Many animals and insects carry diseases that affect humans but most don't make us sick when eaten or inhaled because our immune systems are strongenough to fight them. But, if a person's immune system is weak (like inbabies or the elderly),it's possible that person could become sick or die. What biological agents could be used in an attack? There are 3 basic groups of biological agents that could be weaponized and used in an attack (but realize there are some that occur naturally too): Bacteria - tiny life forms that reproduce by simple divi- sion and are easy to grow -- diseases they spread are killedby strong or boosted immune system or antibiotics Viruses - organisms that need living cells to reproduce and are dependent on the body they infect -- most diseasescaused by viruses don't respond to antibiotics but some-times antiviral drugs work (and a boosted immune systemmay fight invading organisms - depends on type of virus) Toxins - poisonous substances found in and extracted from living plants, animals or microorganisms; some toxins can be produced or altered -- some toxins can betreated with specific antitoxins and selected drugs Remember, biological weapons - or germ warfare - have been around for centuries so it's not anything new ... it's unfortunate we have to discuss itat length, but try not to let this topic frighten you. Educate yourself aboutthe types and where to find more information so you are prepared to react. How could biological agents be used in an attack? As mentioned earlier, most biological agents break down when exposed tosunlight or other conditions, and they are very hard to grow and maintain. There are 3 ways biological agents could be spread: Aerosols - dispersed or spread into air by a number of methods forming a fine mist that could drift for miles Animals and insects - some diseases can be carried and 94 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325spread by critters like birds, mice or rodents, mosquitoes, fleas, or livestock -- called bioterrorism or agroterrorism Food and water contamination - most organisms and toxins are killed or deactivated when we cook food andboil or treat water but some may continue living Some biological agents could remain in the environment and cause problems long after they are released. Again, keep in mind both the CDCand EPA work closely with Departments of Defense and Energy and manyother agencies to monitor systems and security and develop plans. Thesame goes for Health Canada and many Canadian government agencies. What are the names of some biological agents and what can they do? According to CDC's Emergency Preparedness andResponse site, there aremany types of biological diseases and agents - in fact, too many to list here.The CDC has categorized biological agents into 3 groups (A, B and C). Thediseases and agents listed in Category A are considered \"highest priority\".Since most agents were also listed on Public Health Agency of Canada'sEmergency Preparedness site, we are covering 7 specific agents (6 inCategory A plus ricin from Category B) in alphabetical order. Anthrax - is an infection caused by bacteria ( Bacillus anthracis ) found naturally in soil where it can live for years. The bacteria form a protectivecoat around themselves called spores which are very tiny, invisible to thenaked eye, and odorless. Anthrax is most common in cows and sheep butcan also infect humans (primarily people who work with hoofed animals). How it spreads :Anthrax cannot spread person to person. People come into contact with bacteria by breathing in spores ( inhalation ), by getting it through a cut in skin ( cutaneous ) or by eating something containing bacte- ria - like undercooked meat from an infected animal ( gastrointestinal ). Signs & Symptoms :Signs depend on type of anthrax you're exposed to: Inhalation - most serious form - first signs similar to cold or flu (sore throat, fever and extremely tired but no runny nose) -- after several days may lead to severe breathing problems, shock, then possibly death Cutaneous - least serious form - first symptom is a small sore that turns into a blister -- a day or two later blisterturns into a skin ulcer with a black area in the center. Thesore, blister and ulcer do not hurt. Gastrointestinal - first nausea, loss of appetite, bloody diarrhea and fever -- followed by bad stomach pain Symptoms for all 3 types can appear within 7 days of coming in contact with anthrax, but inhalation symptoms may take up to 42 days to appear. 95 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Treatment :All three forms of anthrax are treatable with antibiotics. Chances of coming into contact with anthrax are very low, and your bodynaturally fights off bacteria so you may not even become ill. Botulism - is a muscle-paralyzing disease caused by a toxin made by a bacterium called Clostridium botulinum . C. botulinum occurs naturally and can be found in soil, water, animals, contaminated foods or crops.According to Health Canada, the toxin produced by C. botulinum is the most potent toxin known and can affect humans, animals and even fish.There is only one form of human-made botulism known to date. How it spreads :Botulism cannot spread person to person. People come into contact with the naturally formed bacteria by eating something ( food- borne - usually due to improper storage or home canning methods), through a cut in the skin ( wound ), or a small number of infants (typically less than a year old) can eat bacterial spores that get into intestines ( infant botulism ). The only human-made form has been known to be transmitted from monkeys to veterinarians and lab workers ( inhalation ). Signs & Symptoms :Depends on type of botulism you're exposed to and the degree of exposure to the toxin but generally ... Foodborne - rare - signs usually appear in 6 to 36 hours Wound - first signs usually appear in 4 to 8 days Infant botulism - signs usually appear in 6 to 36 hours Inhalation - first signs usually appear in 72 hours Early symptoms for ALL forms of botulism include double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, hard to speak or swallow, dry mouth and fatigue(very tired). Muscle weakness starts at top of body and goes down causingnerve damage that results in paralysis of face, head, throat, chest, arms andlegs -- could possibly lead to death since breathing muscles do not work. Treatment :There is an antitoxin for botulism , but it must be treated as quickly as possible since it may or may not reverse effects of the diseasebut can stop further paralysis. Antibiotics are not effective against toxins. Plague - is caused by a bacterium called Yersinia pestis that affects animals and humans. Y. pestis is found in rodents and their fleas in many areas of the world, including the U.S. The bacterium is easily killed by sunlight anddrying but could live up to an hour when released into the air depending onweather conditions. How it spreads :There is only one cause of plague but three different types of illness the infection can cause. One type of infection comes from the biteof an infected flea or gets in through a cut in the skin by touching material 96 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325infected with bacterium ( bubonic ), another can be spread through the air and inhaled ( pneumonic ), and a third occurs when plague bacteria multi- plies in the blood of a person already infected with plague ( septicemic ). Signs & Symptoms :Plague types may occur separately or in combination with each other ... and all start with fever, headache, weakness, chills (pos-sibly puking and diarrhea) usually within 1 to 10 days of being exposed. Bubonic - most common - also develop swollen, tender lymph glands (called buboes). Does not spread person to person. Pneumonic - least common but most deadly -- could be used in attack but hard since sunlight kills it. Also get rapidly developing pneumonia with shortness of breath,chest pain, cough, and sometimes bloody or watery spittle.May cause respiratory failure, shock or death. Can spread person to person through air (inhaling droplets from acough, sneeze, etc.) Septicemic - can occur with either bubonic or pneumonic plague due to bacteria multiplying in blood. Also developabdominal pain, shock, and bleeding into skin and otherorgans. Does not spread person to person. Treatment :There are several antibiotics that can effectively treat plague . (It is very important to get treatment for pneumonic plague within 24 hours of first symptoms to reduce the chance of death.) Ricin - is said to be one of the most toxic natural poisons made very easily from the waste left over from processing castor beans. A castor bean plantis a shrub-like herb with clustered seed pods containing bean-like seeds.Accidental poisoning by ricin is unlikely -- it would have to be a plannedact to make and use the toxin as a weapon. Ricin can be in many forms andis not weakened much by extreme hot or cold temperatures. (Note: Ricinis also classed as a \"biotoxin\" under the CDC's chemical agents' list.) How it spreads :Ricin cannot spread person to person. People come into contact with ricin by breathing in a mist or powder spread into the air(inhalation ), by eating or drinking something containing toxin ( ingestion ), or by having a ricin solution or pellet stuck into the body ( injection ). It can also irritate skin and eyes if exposed to the powder or mist. It is hard to say how much ricin could kill a person since it depends on how that person was exposed to the toxin. For example, about 500 micrograms(about the size of the head of a pin) could kill a person if injected into thebody, but it would take a lot more if inhaled or swallowed. Ricin preventscells from making proteins they need when toxin gets inside the body. Cellswill die without proteins and eventually entire body shuts down and dies. 97 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Signs & Symptoms :Depends on how much ricin a person is exposed to - - in large amounts death could occur within 36 to 72 hours. If a person livesmore than 3-5 days without problems, there's a good chance they'll survive: Inhalation - within a few hours of breathing in large amounts of ricin, the first signs are usually coughing,tightness in the chest, hard time breathing, fever, nausea(sick to stomach), and heavy sweating. In the next fewhours excess fluid would build up in lungs making it evenharder to breathe and skin may turn blue. Finally, bloodpressure drops and breathing will stop leading to death. Ingestion - if a large amount of ricin is swallowed it will cause internal bleeding of the stomach and intestines,leading to puking and bloody diarrhea within 2 to 6 hours-- and most likely lead to liver, spleen and kidneys shut-ting down, and person could die within several days Injection - if enough ricin is injected into a person, it immediately kills muscles and lymph nodes around areawhere it entered body ~ eventually organs will shut down Skin or eyes - mist or powder can cause redness and pain Treatment :There is no antidote for ricin exposure. Supportive medical care can be given based on how a person was exposed to ricin (like oxygen[if inhalation] or I.V . fluids or flushing stomach with activated charcoal [ifingestion]), but care mainly helps symptoms. If a mist or powder was released, get the ricin off or out of body asap: First - leave area as quickly as possible ... if outdoors - move away and upwind from area ... if in building - get outside to high ground and upwind If inhaled - get fresh air as quickly and calmly as possible If mist or powder on clothing or skin - remove contami- nated clothes and shoes but don't pull anything over head- cut it off. Seal items in a bag, then seal that bag in a bag.Immediately wash body with clean water and soap. If mist or powder in eyes - remove contacts and put in bags with clothing. If eyes burn or vision is blurred, rinseeyes with water for 10 to 15 minutes. If wearing glasses,wash them with soap and water before putting back on. Smallpox - is a very serious, highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease caused by the variola virus. The most common form of smallpoxcauses raised bumps on the face and body of an infected person. There hasnot been a case of smallpox in the world since 1977, however in the 1980sall countries consolidated their smallpox stocks in two government- 98 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325controlled laboratories in the U.S. and Russia. These secured laboratories still have the virus in quantities for research purposes, but it is very possi-ble some vials have gotten or could get into the hands of terrorist groups. Smallpox disease killed over 300 million people in the 20th century and experts say it is the most dangerous infectious disease ever. There is no curefor smallpox and most patients infected with the disease recover, but deathmay occur in as many as 3 of every 10 persons infected. How it spreads :Smallpox is primarily spread person to person through droplets that are inhaled but usually requires close contact. It can also bespread by infected bodily fluids (especially fluid from bumps) or from bedlinens or clothing from an infected person. It is very rare but the virus couldcarry in the air of an enclosed area like a train or building. Smallpox onlyinfects humans and is not known to be transmitted by insects or animals. Someone carrying the virus may not even know they have it since it lies dormant (incubation period) for up to 17 days. A person with smallpox ismost contagious from the time the rash starts until the last scab falls off(usually about 1 month). Anyone face-to-face with an infected person(within 6 - 7 feet / 2 meters) will most likely get the virus by inhalingdroplets or dried fluids or by touching infected materials. Signs & Symptoms :According to the CDC, exposure to the smallpox virus has an incubation period of 7 to 17 days (average is 12 to 14 days) where people feel fine, show no symptoms and are not contagious, then... Prodrome phase - first symptoms of smallpox include fever, weird or uneasy feeling (malaise), head and bodyaches, and sometimes puking. Fever may be high(between 101F-104F or 38C-40C) -- may be contagious.Phase can last 2 - 4 days. Spotty mouth - small red spots appear on the tongue and in the mouth (this is start of the \"early rash phase\") Spots become sores - spots turn into sores that break open and spread large amounts of the virus into the mouth andthroat -- person is VERY contagious at this point! Rash - as sores in mouth break down, a rash starts on the face and spreads to arms andlegs, then hands and feet --usually takes about 24 hours to cover body. As the rashappears, fever drops, and person may feel a little better. Raised bumps - by third day, rash turns into raised bumps Bumps fill up - by fourth day, bumps fill with a thick, clear fluid -- each bump has a dent in center (like a bellybutton) Bumps become pustules - fever returns and bumps become pustules (which is a raised bump, usually round, 99 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325firm and feels like there's something hard inside - like a BB pellet) -- lasts about 5 days Pustules become scabs - fever still high, next the pustules form a crust turning into scabs - lasts about 5 days -- about2 weeks after rash first appears most of the sores will bescabbed over Scabs fall off - takes about 6 days for all the scabs to fall off leaving a scar or dent in the skin where each scab was(most are gone about 3 weeks after early rash firstappears). Person is no longer contagious when all scabs have fallen off. Treatment :There is no cure or treatment for smallpox . A vaccination with- in 4 days of being exposed could help stop disease but, if vaccinated yearsago, it's doubtful you'd be protected now. Many countries are stockpilingvaccine and considering vaccinations for all citizens, but many experts feelthat may not be necessary yet. There are certain people who should not getthe vaccine. If you do decide to take vaccination, consider boosting yourimmune system before getting shots -- may help your body fight anyadverse reactions. If you have concerns or questions about smallpox , visit the CDC' s Emer- gency Preparedness &Response site at www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox or the Public Health Agency of Canada' s Emergency Preparedness site atwww.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ep-mu/smallpox-eng.php Tularemia - (also known as \"rabbit fever\") is a disease caused by a strong bacterium, Francisella tularensis , found in wild animals and some insects (especially rabbits, hares, beavers and other rodents, mosquitoes, deerfliesor ticks) and found in soil, water sources and vegetation in those critters'habitats. F . tularensis is one of the most infectious bacteria known and it doesn't take much to cause the disease, plus it can remain alive for weeksin water and soil. Tularemia has been considered useful as an airborneweapon worldwide since the 1930s which is why there's valid concern itcould be used today in a terrorist attack. How it spreads :Tularemia is not known to spread person to person. Some wild animals carry the disease - usually because they were bitten by aninfected bug or drank or ate from contaminated water or soil. Hunters andpeople who spend a lot of time outdoors can get the disease from crittersthrough a bite or handling a diseased carcass ( skin), from eating an infected animal not properly cooked or by drinking contaminated water(stomach ), or from breathing in dust from contaminated soil ( lungs ). Signs & Symptoms :Depends on how person is exposed to tularemia and all symptoms may not occur -- all 3 usually appear in 3 to 5 days (or take 100 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325up to 14 days) ... may include fever, chills, joint pain, weakness, and ... Skin - may also include a bump or ulcers on bite, swollen and painful lymph glands Stomach - may also include sore throat, abdominal pain, ulcers on or in mouth, diarrhea or puking Lungs - may also include dry cough, chest pain, bloody spittle, trouble breathing or stops breathing Treatment : Tularemia can be treated with antibiotics but exposure to F. tularensis should be treated as soon as possible since it can be deadly. Viral hemorrhagic [hem-o-RAJ-ik] fevers (VHFs) - are a group of diseases or illnesses caused by several families of viruses. There are manytypes of VHFs - some the public may recognize are Ebola, Marburg or hantavirus. Some VHFs cause mild reactions or illnesses while others aredeadly. Most VHFs are highly contagious and associated with bleeding(hemorrhage), but that's usually not life-threatening. In severe cases, theoverall vascular - or blood vessel - system is damaged so the body can't regulate itself thus causing organs to shut down. Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs ) are quite an extensive and complex topic so we are only mentioning it here since it's on the CDC's Category A list.Both the CDC and the Public Health Agency of Canada cover VHFs atlength on their web sites if you would like to learn more. We're just brieflyexplaining how it can spread and listing some general signs and symptomsin the event you ever hear about \"viral hemorrhagic fevers\" in the news. How it spreads :Most viruses associated with VHFs naturally reside in animals (mice or other rodents) or insects (ticks or mosquitoes). Some VHFviruses could spread to humans by the bite of an infected insect or bybreathing in or touching an infected animal's pee, poop, or other body fluids. (For example, a person crawling in a rat-infested area could stir upand breathe in a virus, or someone slaughtering livestock infected by aninsect bite could also spread the virus.) Some other viruses spread person toperson through close contact with an infected person's body fluids. Signs & Symptoms :Signs vary (from minor to deadly) by the type of VHF , but first symptoms often include sudden fever, fatigue (very tired), dizziness, weakness and headache. Person could also have a sore throat,abdominal pain, puking, and diarrhea. Severe cases often show signs ofbleeding under the skin, in internal organs, or from the mouth, eyes, or ears.Blood loss is not usually life-threatening, but the damaged vascular systemcan cause shock, coma, seizures, organ failure or death. Treatment :There is no specific cure or vaccine for most VHFs . 101 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Hospitalization and supportive care can be given in strict isolation to pre- vent the virus from spreading to others, but care mainly helps symptoms.Keeping rodents and mosquitoes out of your home is good prevention. BEFORE A BIOLOGICAL ATTACK : Watch & listen for signs - Many biological agents do not give immediate \"warning signs\" -- and most symptoms show up hours or days later so it'shard to say what to watch for, but learn about some common agents (seeprevious pages) and stay current by listening to radio and TV reports to hearwhat local authorities tell people to do -- and DOit! Report strange things - Be aware of your surroundings -- watch for strange or suspicious packages ... or spray trucks or crop dusters in weird places atstrange times ... and report suspicious activities to local authorities. Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit . Get rid of pests - Keep home clean and put food away that might attract rats or mice and get rid of \"standing water\" sources around yard (like buckets,tires, pots, or kiddie pools) since they are breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Be ready to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and leave if you are told to evacuate. (see EVACUATION) DURING A BIOLOGICAL ATTACK : During any type of biological attack, local authorities will instruct the public about where to go and exactly what to do if exposed to an agent(which may require immediate attention with professional medical staff).It's possible there may be signs (as seen with the anthrax mailings), butmore likely it would be discovered after the fact when local health care workers have a wave of sick people seeking emergency medical attentionor there are reports of unusual illnesses or symptoms. Don't panic -- Listen - Stay calm and listen to radio, TV and officials to ... Determine if your area is in danger or if you werein the area when it was contaminated. Learn signs and symptoms of agent or disease (seeprevious pages briefly describing - like Ebola or Marburg]). Find out if medications or vaccines are being distributed 102 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325by authorities and, if so, where you can get them. Cover up - Cover your mouth and nose with layers of fabric to filter air but still let you breathe (like 2-3 layers of cotton T-shirt or towel or severallayers of paper towel, napkins or tissues). Clean up - Wash with soap and water to keep from spreading germs. Stay away - Get away from the attack site to avoid contamination. Evacuate...? - If you are told to leave... DO it! If officials say you have time, close windows, shut vents and turn off attic fans. (see EVACUATION) Things to avoid: powder - white powdery substance in strange places aerosol mists - could drift for miles / may be hard to see contaminated food or water - don't eat or drink any food or water that may have been exposed to agents Feel sick...? - Many symptoms from biological agents take time to show up so watch family members for signs of illness. AFTER A BIOLOGICAL ATTACK : Don't panic -- Listen - Stay calm and listen to radio, TV and officials to ... Determine if your area is or was in danger. Learn signs and symptoms of specific agent or disease. Find out if medications or vaccines are being distributedby authorities and, if so, where you can get them. Feel sick...? - In most cases, people won't be aware they have been exposed to an agent -- some cause immediate symptoms but many take a while toshow up so keep watching for signs of illness. Don't go there - Do not return home until local authorities say it is safe. Don't spread it - A person, critter, or item that has been exposed to a disease or biological agent may spread it so... clean up - if your skin or clothing comes in contact with a suspected visible powder or liquid, wash with soap andwater to keep from spreading germs store clothes & shoes - put exposed clothing and shoes in tightly sealed containers without touching other materialsand call local authorities to ask how to get rid of them 103 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325strange symptoms - if unusual symptoms show up, get to a hospital or medical expert right away! tell people you've been exposed - tell everyone who comes in contact with you that you may have beenexposed to a biological agent land and property - ask how to clean up (if needed) For more information about biological agents orbioterrorism , visit the CDC' s Emergency Preparedness &Response site at www.bt.cdc.gov or Public Health Agency of Canada' s Emergency Preparedness site atwww.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ep-mu/index-eng.php or call the CDC Public Response Hotline at 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636) or 1-888-232-6348 (TTY). ABOUT RADIOLOGICAL THREAT OR DEVICE Also review NUCLEAR THREATORDEVICE (covered next) since itcontains additional information about radiation and e-bombs. Another known terrorist tactic uses explosives on chemical trucks to spread deadly fumes. See previous pages covering Chemical Agents. What is a \"dirty bomb\"? A radiological dispersion device ( RDD ) - also known as a \"dirty bomb\" - uses conventional explosives (such as dynamite) to spread radioactive materials in the form of powder or pellets over a targeted area. A terrorist's main reasons for using a \"dirty bomb\" is to cause damage to buildings, contaminate an area, and spread fear or panic. This type of attackappeals to terrorists since it doesn't require a lot of technical know-how tobuild and use ... plus low-level radioactive materials are pretty easy toobtain since they are used in many fields like agriculture, research and medicine. The most harmful, high-level radioactive materials would be found in nuclear power plants and at nuclear weapons sites, but with the heightenedstate of alert at many of these locations, it'd be hard for terrorist organiza-tions to get them within the U.S. Note, nuclear power plant accidents are covered on pages 72-76 and nukes are covered next. What are the dangers of an RDD (\"dirty bomb\")? According to the Center for Disease Control, the primary danger from adirty bomb would be the blast itself - not necessarily the radiation.Knowing how much (if any) radiation might be present at the attack site is 104 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325difficult when the source of the radiation is unknown until site is tested. However, since many RDDs use low-level radioactive materials, thereprobably would not be enough radiation to cause severe illness. Has anyone used a \"dirty bomb\" before? According to a United Nations report, Iraq tested a dirty bomb device in1987 but found the radiation levels were too low to cause significant damage.Thus, Iraq abandoned any further use of the device. 7 What if you or your office receives a \"bomb threat\"? Bomb threats are usually received by a telephone call or in the mail. It ishighly unlikely a terrorist organization using a \"dirty bomb\" would giveanyone advance warning or call with a bomb threat, however, in the eventyou or someone in your office receives a bomb threat, do the following... If you ever receive a bomb threat, get as much informationfrom the caller as possible (e.g. what kind of bomb, whatdoes it look like, where is it, when will it go off, etc.) Try to keep caller on phone as long as you can and writedown everything that is said! (Since you'll be nervous or scared, good notes will be very helpful to officials later.) Notify the police and building management. Calmly evacuate the building, keep the sidewalks clearand stay away from windows. What if you or someone in your office receives a \"suspicious package\"? According to the United States Postal Service, the likelihood of you everreceiving a bomb in the mail is remote. But there have been a small number of explosive devices and biological agents that have surfaced in themail over the years. Some possible motives for an individual or group sending a \"suspicious package\" include revenge, extortion, love triangles,terrorism, and business disputes. The following are some unique signs or characteristics from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service that may help identify a \"suspect\" piece of mail ... Package may have restricted markings like \"Personal\" or\"Private\" to one who doesn't receive personal mail atoffice or to someone no longer working there. Package is sealed with excessive amounts of tape or hasway too much postage on it. Postmark city different than Return Address city. Misspelled words, written badly or done with letters cutfrom newspaper or magazine and pasted on. 105 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Package has wires or aluminum foil sticking out, oil stains, smells weird or sounds funny (sloshing noise). Package may feel strange or look uneven or lopsided. If you are unsure about a letter or package and are not able to verify the Sender or contents with the person it is addressed to then... DONOTopen it, shake it, bump it or sniff it! Cover it with a shirt, trash can or whatever is handy. Evacuate the area quickly and calmly. Wash your hands with lots of soap and water. Call building security, police and your postal inspector. List all the people who were near the package or letterin case they are needed for further questioning. BEFORE A RADIOLOGICAL THREAT OR EVENT : Make a plan - Review Section 1 and check emergency plans for schools, day care and nursing home to find out where everyone goes if evacuated.Find out if there are any below ground shelters near your home, school oroffice in case you need to take cover from radiation. Learn more about radiation - Review pages 72-73 and 109-114. Report strange things - Be aware of your surroundings -- watch for strange or suspicious packages, abandoned briefcases or backpacks and report suspicious activities to local authorities. Stay current on threats - The Department of Homeland Security www.dhs.gov and Public Safety Canada www.publicsafety.gc.ca post alerts and news about national security online. Be ready to evacuate - Listen to authorities -- if told to leave - DO it! DURING A RADIOLOGICAL EVENT OR EXPLOSION : Don't panic... - Stay calm and don't stop to retrieve personal items or make phone calls - get to a safe place. Don't look... - Do not look directly at explosion, flash, blast or fireball! Things to watch out for : falling objects - if things are falling off bookshelves or from the ceiling get under a sturdy table or desk 106 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325flying debris - many blast injuries are caused by flying glass, metal and other materials fires - stay below the smoke (crawl or walk like a duck) - only use the stairs (don't use elevators) - check doors with back of hand before opening (If HOT , do NOT open - find another exit!) weak structures - be careful since floors, stairs, roofs or walls might be weakened by the blast IF INDOORS - Stay put if building is not damaged but leave if warned of a radiation release inside. Cover nose and mouth and find shelter in a build-ing not damaged by blast and prepare to \"shelter-in-place\". IF OUTDOORS - Cover mouth and nose with a cloth or handkerchief and take shelter in a safe building as quickly as possible! IF IN A VEHICLE - Keep windows up, close vents, use \"recirculating\" air and keep listening to radio for updates. If possible, drive away from site. AFTER A RADIOLOGICAL EVENT OR EXPLOSION : If you are trapped in an area: light - use a flashlight - never use matches or lighters in case there are gas leaks be still - try to stay still so you won't kick up dust breathing - cover your mouth with a piece of clothing make noise - tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can hear you (shouting may cause you to inhale a lot of dust) Rescuing others - Untrained persons should not try to rescue people who are inside a collapsed building... wait for emergency personnel to arrive -then, if they need you, they will ask. Avoid crowds - Be aware large crowds may be targeted for a second attack. Reduce exposure - Get out of area quickly and into nearest building to reduce chances of being exposed to radioactive materials (or chemicals).The less time you spend in a potentially contaminated area the better. If radioactive materials were possibly present: Don't panic -- Listen - Stay calm and listen to radio, TV and officials to ... Determine if your area is in danger or contaminated. Find out where to go for radiation monitoring and blood 107 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325tests to determine if you were exposed and what to do to protect your health if radioactive materials are found. Learn if KI(potassium iodide) is being passed out by authorities and, if so, find out where to get it. Or ask ifyou should take KI if in your Disaster Supplies Kit (more about KI on page 73). Dirty bombs don't normally haveradioactive iodide so KI may not be needed. As long as you are NOT told to evacuate: Stay put - Stay inside and prepare to \"shelter-in-place\"! Close doors, windows, vents and fireplace damper. Turn off air conditioner, ventilation fans, furnace and other intakes (they pull in air from outside). Grab Disaster Supplies Kit and go to a basement or underground area (if possible). Keep a battery-operated radio with you to hear updates. Stay inside until authorities tell you it is safe to go out! Clean up - If you were possibly exposed to radiation (or chemicals)... store clothes & shoes - put clothing and shoes in tightly sealed containers or plastic bags and ask health officials what to do with them. (Note:Do not burn contaminatedclothing, bandages or other items since fire will notdestroy radioactivity and would disperse radiation.) shower - wash body and hair to remove particles / toxins Will I get radiation sickness or cancer...? - Just because you were at the site of a dirty bomb does not mean you were exposed to radioactive materials.Radiation cannot be seen, smelled, felt, or tasted. Until doctors are able tocheck skin with sensitive detection devices or run blood tests to determinethere was any radiation - no one really knows if they were exposed (unlessyou have your own detection devices - see page 112). And, even if you wereexposed to small amounts of radioactive material, it does not mean you'llbe sick or get cancer. Stay calm -- listen to and work with medical healthprofessionals since it depends on each situation or incident. For the CDC' s information on \"acute radiation syndrome\" (radiation sickness) visit www.bt.cdc.gov/radiation/ars.asp For more information about radiological emergencies orradiation emergencies , visit the CDC' s Emergency Preparedness &Response site at www.bt.cdc.gov or visit Health Canada' s Emergencies &Disasters site at www.hc-sc.gc.ca 108 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325ABOUT NUCLEAR THREAT OR DEVICE No one wants to think about a nuclear crisis - and hopefully it will never happen - but we as a nation must accept the fact nuclear tensions are rising globally (plus Al-Qaeda and others are seeking nukes) so we should prepareourselves and our loved ones in the event the unthinkable strikes our soil. For decades, movies and some in the media have portrayed a nuclear attack as a \"doomsday\" event implying most people would be killed on impact ...and survivors would want to die once they come out of their shelters. Inreality, unless you are actually at ground zero or within a several mile radius of the blast zone (depending on the size of the nuke, of course), thereis a very high probability you will survive as long as you limit your exposure to the radiation, take shelter with proper shielding, and wait forthe most dangerous radioactive materials to decay. In other words, you CANsurvive a nuke attack ... but you MUST make an effort to learn what to do! By learning about potential threats, we are all better prepared to know how to react if something happens. Earlier we covered nuclear power plant accidents and RDDs (dirty bombs) explaining both scenarios would be fairly localized. We also listed sheltering tips and suggested items to beincluded in Disaster Supplies Kits for several days (in Section 1), howevera nuclear attack could create more extensive damage and longer shelteringrequirements meaning more preparation is needed. In this topic we'll explain a nuke scenario, give some tips on sheltering and supplies, and suggest what to do BEFORE, DURINGand AFTER anattack. Please realize this topic is being written with small nuke devices in mind (like a 1-kiloton to 1-megaton device - similar to what a terrorist group maytry to obtain and use). A larger device or a nuclear war would cause morewide-spread damage but some of this data could still be helpful. Again, these are some very basic things you can do to prepare yourself and your family so you can survive the unthinkable. What happens when a nuke explodes? A nuclear blast produces a blinding light, intense heat (called thermal radi- ation ), initial nuclear radiation , 2 explosive shock waves ( blasts ), mass fires, and radioactive fallout (residual nuclear radiation). And, if a nuke is launched over our continent and explodes miles above the earth, it couldcreate an electromagnetic pulse (EMP ). Let's break this down a little further... 109 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325fireball / flash - a combination of heat and light so intense the flash can be seen for hundreds of miles. Just looking atthe flash or even reflected / diffracted light can cause temporary or permanent eye damage. thermal radiation - an intense heat that could cause fires for several miles around ground zero. The heat flash couldcause severe burns from direct exposure or from burningobjects like clothing, buildings, etc. initial nuclear radiation - penetrating invisible rays that can be lethal in high levels blast - explosive shock wave that happens a split second after the fireball. The blast could destroy most buildingsfor several miles depending on the size of the nuke andstrength of the structures. A blast can also cause serious orlethal injuries to people from being thrown by the shockwave or getting hit by flying objects or debris. radioactive fallout (residual nuclear radiation) - created when the fireball vaporizes everything inside it (includingdirt and water). Vaporized materials mix with radioactivematerials in the updraft of air forming a mushroom cloud.Fallout can be carried by winds for hundreds of miles andbegin falling to the ground within minutes of the blast ortake hours, days, weeks or even months to fall. The heav-iest fallout would hit ground zero and areas downwind ofthat, and 80% of fallout would occur within 24 hours.Most fallout looks like grey sand or gritty ash and the radi-ation given off cannot be seen, smelled, tasted or feltwhich is why it is so dangerous. mass fires - any size blast would cause fires due to the intense heat, and keep in mind gas lines, chemicals andother objects just add fuel to the fires EMP - an electromagnetic pulseis a split- second silent energy burst (like a stroke of lightning) that can fry electronics connected to wires or antennas like cellphones, cars, computers, TVs, etc. Unless electronics aregrounded or hardened, North Americans could experienceanything from minor interference to crippled power, trans-portation, banking and communications systems. An EMP from a high-altitude nuke (where a nation or group succeeds in detonating a nuclear device carriedmiles into the atmosphere) could affect electronics within1,000 miles or more as shown on next page. (Evidence suggests some countries and groups are working onenhanced and non-nuclear EMP weapons or e-bombs.) 110 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325EMP AREABYBURSTS AT 30, 120 AND 300 MILES Dr. Gary Smith \"Electromagnetic Pulse Threats\", testimony to House National SecurityCommittee on July 16, 1997 Sizes of nukes - Nuclear weapons are measured in kilotons (KT = 1,000 tons of TNT)or megatons (MT = 1,000,000 tons of TNT). According toFEMA, the most common weapons today range from 100KT to 1MT. Asuitcase nuke or portable device would most likely be a 1KT to 10KTbomb. For some perspective, the device used on Hiroshima was about a15KT bomb. Damage estimates - Blast effects of a nuke depend on the size of the device and whether it's a surface blast or a high-altitude blast. For example, thenumber of miles affected by a 500KT blast is fairly small (< 6 mile radius)according to FEMAgraphics from \"Nuclear Attack EnvironmentHandbook\" (posted on www.radshelters4u.com ). Also realize a suitcase nuke or portable device used by a terrorist group would potentially be a 1KT to 10KT bomb reducing the blast zoneimmensely. In other words, if you are several miles away from Ground Zeroyour chances of survival are good if you take immediate actions to protectyourself. Map impact - An interesting widget by Carlos Labs provides a visual map of the impact a nuclear device would have by entering a city anywhereon the planet. You can also choose a weapon size between a 1KT to 50MT.Check out Ground Zero II at www.carloslabs.com/index.php?q=node/20 111 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325 What is the most dangerous part of a nuclear attack? Both the initial nuclear radiation and residual nuclear radiation (also called radioactive fallout) are extremely dangerous. But as the materials decay orspread out radiation levels will drop. Types of radiation - Nuclear radiation has 3 main types of radiation ... alpha - can be shielded by a sheet of paper or by human skin. If alpha particles are inhaled, ingested, or enter bodythrough a cut, they can cause damage to tissues and cells. beta - can be stopped by skin or a thicker shield (like wood). Beta particles can cause serious damage to internalorgans if ingested or inhaled, and could cause eye damageor possible skin burns. gamma - most dangerous since gamma rays can penetrate the entire body and cause cell damage throughout yourorgans, blood and bones. Since radiation does not stimu-late nerve cells you may not feel anything while your bodyabsorbs it. Exposure to high levels of gamma rays can leadto radiation sickness or death which is why it is critical toseek shelter from fallout in a facility with thick shielding! Detecting radiation - You cannot see, smell, taste or feel radiation, but special instruments can detect even the smallest levels of radiation. After anincident, authorities will monitor levels of radioactivity to determine thepotential danger. However, since it may take days or weeks before FirstResponders could get to you, please consider purchasing detection devices for your home and Disaster Supplies Kits. Having these devices handy during a crisis or attack could save your life! survey meter - measures rate of exposure or intensity of radiation at that specific location if you stayed there for anhour ... like a speedometer in a car (cost: $300-$1,000+) dosimeter - a pen-like device you can wear that measures total dose or accumulated exposure to radiation as youmove around (needs a charger too - cost: $45-$65+ each) KFM kit - (Kearny Fallout Meter) measures radiation more accurately than most instruments since it's chargedelectrostatically. Free plans online or available as a low-cost kit ($40-$75). And a great science project for kids. NukAlertTM- a patented personal radiation meter, monitor and alarm small enough to fit on a key chain. The unitmakes chirping sounds if it detects radiation. (cost: $160) NukAlert-ERTM- a combination geiger counter, survey meter and dosimeter in a handheld device (cost: $750) RADStickerTM- postage stamp card (cost: $2-$5 ea) 112 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Measuring radiation - Radiation was measured in units called roentgens (pronounced \"rent-gens\" and abbreviated as \"R\") ... or \"rads\" or \"rem\". AnEPA document called \"Planning Guidance for Response to A NuclearDetonation 2nd Edition June 2010\" explains ... 1 R (exposure in air) 1 rad (absorbed dose) 1 rem (whole-body dose). Although many measuring devices and older documentation use R and rem, officials and the media now use sievert (Sv) which is the SystemInternational or SI unit of measurement of radiation. The formula to convert sieverts to rems is quite simple ... 1 Sv = 100 R (rem). Radiation detection devices measure the amount of radiation at a specific location or display the total amount of radiation you've been exposed toover a period of time. Exposure limits vary from person to person. Somepeople can handle higher amounts of rad exposure than others, but the keything to remember is the less radiation you are exposed to the better. How many rads are bad? - High doses of radiation in a short span of time can cause radiation sickness or even death, but if that high dose is spreadout over a long period of time, it's not as bad. According to FEMA, an adult could tolerate and recover from an exposure to 150R (1.5 Sv) over a week or 300R (3 Sv) over a 4-month period. But300R (3 Sv) over a week could cause sickness or possibly death. Exposureto 30R (0.3 Sv) to 70R (0.7 Sv) over a week may cause minor sickness, buta full recovery would be expected. But radioactive fallout decays rapidly sostaying in a shelter with proper shielding is critical! The \"seven-ten\" rule - An easy way to estimate the decay of radioactive materials is to use the \"seven-ten\" rule. For every sevenfold increase in timeafter the initial blast, there is a tenfold decrease in the radiation rate. Thereis a small fraction of fallout that remains radioactive for many years, but themajority will decay more rapidly than most people think. Per FEMA's \"Preparedness Planning for a Nuclear Crisis\" handbook, below shows how fast radiation drops from a level of 1,000 rads (10 Sv) per hour: Hours after Fraction Level of detonation Remaining Radiation 1 ------- 1000 R / hr (10 Sv) 7 1/10 100 R / hr (1 Sv) 49 (2 days) 1/100 10 R / hr (0.1 Sv) 346 (2 weeks) 1/1000 1 R / hr (0.01 Sv) In other words, if you have shelter with good shielding and stay put for even just 7 hours ... you've really increased your chances of survival! 113 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Reduce exposure - Protect yourself from radioactive fallout with ... distance - the more distance between you and the fallout particles, the better shielding - heavy, dense materials (like thick walls, earth, concrete, bricks, water and books) between you and fall-out is best. Stay indoors or below ground. time - most fallout loses its strength quickly. The more time that passes after the attack, the lower the danger. Protect your thyroid - Slow down the absorption of radioactive iodine by taking potassium iodide (KI) . KI can be purchased over-the-counter and is known to be an effective thyroid-blocking agent. In other words, it fills upthe thyroid with good iodine that keeps radioactive iodine from beingabsorbed into our bodies. However, KI cannot protect the body fromradioactive elements other than radioactive iodine. (Learn more about KI on page 73.) A few other options to protect your thyroid include taking KIO3, applying iodine solution to your skin, or taking kelp/seaweed pills. Radiation sickness - Exposure to high levels of radiation (especially gamma rays) over a short period of time can cause severe illness or death. First symptoms - sick to stomach (nausea), puking and diarrhea can start within minutes to days after exposure.(Note:Keep in mind ... fear can cause similar symptoms.) More serious symptoms - person may look and feel healthy for a short time, then become sick again with lossof appetite, fever, nausea, puking, diarrhea, fatigue andpossibly seizures and coma. This seriously ill stage maylast from a few hours up to several months. Skin - damage can start to show up within a few hours after exposure and include swelling, itching, and rednessof skin (like a bad sunburn). Complete healing may takeseveral weeks to a few years depending on dose received. Hair - serious exposure could cause temporary hair loss Please note, radiation sickness is not contagious so will not spread person to person. Consider storing immune-boosting supplements in your DisasterSupplies Kits to help strengthen immune system and rebuild any possible cell damage in the event you are exposed to radiation. Nuke versus dirty bomb - A nuke creates a massive blast and dangerous radiation that could spread for hundreds of miles. A radiological dispersiondevice (RDD or dirty bomb) uses explosives (like dynamite) to spread low-level radioactive materials over a small, targeted area. The bomb blast itselfmay cause more damage than radiation. (RDDs covered on pages 104-108) 114 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325So how do I protect myself and my family? Some communities provide 2 types of shelters for local citizens, but not all cities have them plus you may not be able to get to one during a crisis.Contact your local office of emergency management and ask if they have: blast shelter - specifically constructed to offer some pro- tection against blast pressure, initial radiation, heat, andfire (but realize it can't take a direct hit from a nuke) fallout shelter - can be any protected space that has walls and materials thick and dense enough to absorb radiationgiven off by fallout. (Note: we are mainly focusing on these types of shelters in this section.) Basic shelter requirements - Whether you build a shelter in advance or throw together an expedient last-minute shelter during a crisis, the areashould protect you from radiation and support you for at least 2 weeks.Some basic requirements for a fallout shelter include ... shielding ventilation water and food sanitation and first aid products radiation monitoring devices, radio, tools, firearms, etc. Shielding materials - All fallout shelters must provide good protection from radioactive particles. FEMAsuggests having a minimum of several inchesof concrete or 1 to 2 feet of earth as shielding around your shelter, and themore the better. Per FEMA, the following shows examples of shieldingmaterials that equal the protection of 4 inches (10 cm) of concrete ... 5 - 6 inches (12 - 15 cm) of bricks 6 inches (15 cm) of sand orgravel 7 inches (18 cm) of earth 8 inches (20 cm) of hollow concrete block 10 inches (25 cm) of water 14 inches (35 cm) of books ormagazines 18 inches (46 cm) of wood Underground is best - Taking shelter in a basement or a facility below ground reduces exposure by 90% . Less than 4 inches (10 cm) of soil or earth can reduce the penetration of dangerous gamma rays by half . Prefab shelter - If you have money, time and land, there are many types of prefabricated shelters you can purchase and have buried on your property.Some have complete living quarters and come fully stocked with food andother items. Do your research and get references first though. 115 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Outside shelter - There are free books and pamphlets with instructions on building underground fallout shelters by FEMA, Cresson Kearny (author of\"Nuclear War Survival Skills\"), Shane Connor (CEO of KI4U, Inc.) andothers. If you have a few days, tools, property you can dig down into, anddon't mind heavy labor ... check out www.oism.org/nwss or www.ki4u.com . (Both sites describe other shelters too like lean-tos, pole- covered trench shelters, etc.) You can also find several old FEMA bookletsfrom 1980 if you do a web search on \"FEMA home fallout shelter\". Indoor shelter locations - If you don't have a fallout shelter you can access safely and quickly, these options could provide protection from dangerousradiation by using shielding materials described on the next page. basement - find the corner that is most below ground level (the further underground you are the better) 1-story home / condo / apartment - if no underground facility, find a spot in center of home away from windows trailer home - find sturdier shelter if at all possible (like a basement or a brick or concrete building) multi-story building or high-rise - go to center of the middle section of the building. Note:if the rooftop of abuilding next to you is on that same floor, move one floorup or down since radioactive fallout would accumulate on rooftops. Avoid the first floor (if possible) since falloutwill pile up on the ground outside. 116 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325 Higher numbers indicate more protection The numbers in thegraphic (on previous page) stand for a 'dose reduction factor.' A dose reduction factor of 10 means that a person in that areawould get 1/10th of the dose of a person in the open. A dose reduction factor of 200 means that a person in that area would receive 1/200th of thedose of a person out in the open. A color version of the graphic is availableat www.ready.gov/nuclear-blast Indoor shelter shielding - Below are some ways to build an expedient last- minute shelter in your home, apartment or workplace. Please realize thesetips are very basic things to help protect you from dangerous radiation. Set up a large, sturdy workbench or table in locationyou've chosen (see previous page). If no table, make oneby putting doors on top of boxes, appliances or furniture. Put as much shielding - furniture, file cabinets, appliances,boxes or pillowcases filled with dirt or sand, boxes offood, water or books, concrete blocks, bricks, etc. - allaround sides and on top of table, but don't put too muchweight on tabletop or it could collapse. Add reinforcingsupports, if needed. (See page 115 for shielding materials and remember, the more shielding you use, the better protection you'll have from radioactive fallout.) Leave a crawl space so everyone can get inside and beprepared to block opening with shielding materials. Leave 2 small air spaces for ventilation (about 4-6\" each)- one low at one end and one high at other end. (Thisallows for better airflow since warm air rises.) If you have time and ability to do so, add more mass orshielding materials (like earth) on the floor above you.Support or brace floor from below for the added weight. Have water, detection devices, radio, food and sanitationsupplies in case you have to shelter for days or weeks. Ventilation - While inside a shelter you need to circulate fresh air in to reduce carbon dioxide buildup and help reduce heat. If shelter is aboveground, the natural flow of air through cracks or windows outside sheltercan help move stale warm air out, but basements and underground sheltersmay have trouble getting airflow. Some ways to improve airflow ... open a door or window - consider opening a door or win- dow in another part of house or building to improve thenatural air circulation (but don't expose yourself to falloutor high radiation levels and don't open window in shelter) air pump - by planning ahead you can purchase or make a portable pump (read App. B at www.oism.org/nwss ) 117 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325directional fanning - make a strong 2-handled fan using 2 sticks (or folded cardboard) and tie or tape a piece of cloth (or 2 pieces of cardboard) between sticks to make arectangular fan. You want to push warm air out of the shel-ter so start with fan straight up in front of your face, thenforcefully push it out and down with your arms complete-ly extended until fan is parallel with floor (about waisthigh), pause then repeat often and as needed. Water - As mentioned throughout this manual, water is critical for survival. In addition to water tips on page 152, some more suggestions include ... Store about 1 gallon (about 4 litres) of water per personper day for drinking, cooking and sanitation. It may beweeks or months before systems can be tested or theyfunction properly so consider storing 55-gallon drums ofwater in advance. Or build or install a cistern or watercatchment system and store various filtration options. Make sure all water containers have tight-fitting lids andcover supply to protect it from bacteria, bugs and dirt. Use water as extra shielding by lining cardboard boxeswith 2 large trash bags and fill with water. If water contains fallout particles, filter it through severallayers of clean cloth or paper towels ... or ... allow waterto stand for several hours so particles settle to bottom ofcontainer. Only take water off the top (don't stir up thesettled particles), then purify it using tips on page 152. There are many types of water purification units on the market and keep in mind a stand-alone unit is the best option during a time of crisis. Somehomes have purifiers hooked up to faucets, but remember they rely on functioning utilities. If you're on a limited budget, do a search on the webon how to make a homemade water purifier using food grade 5-gallonbuckets. Also it could be very difficult to store enough water to deal with long term sheltering so if you live in a rural environment, map out different sourcesof water that could be accessed quickly and easily. Same for city dwellersbut finding useable water sources in urban areas could be tough. Kearney'sebook has an entire chapter about water at www.oism.org/nwss Food, sanitation items & supplies - Please review pages 14-23 and 151-153 for suggestions and tips on gathering food, first aid items, tools, suppliesand handling sanitation during a crisis. Store enough supplies for severalweeks (or months or longer) in your basement or shelter since services maybe disrupted for quite some time after a nuclear attack. Rotate supplies and 118 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325test batteries every 6 months as discussed on page 23. And for safety's sake, don't tell others what you've stored since you may become a target for looters. Firearms - If you decide to store guns and ammunition, learn possession laws of your state, make sure you know how to safely store and operateweapons, and ensure family members understand gun safety. Learn moreabout state laws and training programs for all ages at www.nra.org Next we're mentioning some very basic things to think about and doBEFORE, DURINGand AFTER a nuke attack (many covered in previouspages). Remember ... unless you are at ground zero or within a several mileradius of the blast zone (depending on the size of the nuke, of course), thereis a very high probability you will survive as long as you limit your exposure to the radiation, take shelter with proper shielding, and wait forthe most dangerous radioactive materials to decay. BEFORE A NUCLEAR ATTACK : Make a shelter - If you don't have a basement or underground shelter, think about how you would design a quick shelter with sufficient shielding tokeep you safe from fallout. (see page 117) Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit (but expand supplies to have at least 2 to 4+ weeks worth on-hand.) Double check emergency plans for schools, day cares orplaces family may be and where they'll go if evacuated or sheltered. Protect yourself - Purchase radiation detection devices from a reputable disaster supplies company. There are many that claim they will work butdevices are known to have calibration problems so do your homework. (see page 112) Protect electronics - An electromagnetic pulse could disrupt or fry systems that are not hardened or shielded. Unplugging devices is the best protection,but in most cases you won't get advance warning of an EMP. Electrical andhardware stores carry grounding supplies, surge protectors and batterybackup units. Look for the strongest protection available, but realize elec-tronics may still get fried. (Tip:Do a web search on \"Faraday cage\" to learn more about shielding electronic devices.)

Do NOT look at flash, blast or fireball - turn away! Duck & cover .. and watch out for flying debris or fires. Be aware the 2 shock waves have the force of a tornadoand may take 30 seconds to 2 minutes to reach you. Take shelter to protect yourself from radioactive fallout.Remember ... distance , shielding and time ! Blast could create an EMP and fry electronics like cell phones, computers, cars, pacemakers, radios, TVs, etc. IF INDOORS - If near blast, stay put if home or building is not damaged. If fires are spreading, cover nose and mouth and find shelter in a basementor building further away. Go as far below ground as possible or in the cen-ter of a tall building. The goal is to put as many walls and as much concrete,brick and soil between you and the radioactive material outside. Onceinside ... Close doors, windows and fireplace damper and turn offair conditioner, ventilation fans, furnace and other intakessince they can pull in air or fallout from outside. Go to an underground shelter or make an expedient shel-ter using as much shielding as possible (like furniture,appliances, books, boxes of dirt, etc.) in your basement orthe center of room or building. Grab your water, food and supplies and have radiationdetection devices ready to monitor radiation levels. Keep a battery-operated radio with you to hear updatesand stay inside until it is safe to go out. IF OUTDOORS - Cover mouth and nose with a cloth and take shelter immediately. Get as far below ground as possible or in the center of a tallbuilding. The goal is to put as many walls and as much concrete, brick andsoil between you and the radioactive material outside. Remember ... distance , shielding and time. IF IN A VEHICLE - Keep windows up, close vents, use \"recirculating\" air and listen to radio for updates. If possible, drive away from site. If you can'tget away and you are near the blast area, immediately seek shelter fromdeadly fallout and fires. Things to watch out for : fallout - can arrive 10-20 minutes after the blast -- looks like gray sand or gritty ash and is very radioactive the first 122 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325few days so find heavy shielding. Fallout can be carried by winds for hundreds of miles. fires - gas lines or chemicals may cause them to spread flying & falling objects - the blast and shock waves can shatter windows and hurl debris or body parts like missiles weak structures, floors or stairs - be careful since they could have been weakened or damaged by blasts Listen - Turn on radio or TV (if working) to learn projected paths of fallout or fires. Authorities will give specific instructions for people outside theblast zone -- some may need to evacuate ... others should take shelter. Stay or go..? - Evacuate if told to do so by local authorities ... and ... Grab your Disaster Supplies Kit . Close doors, windows and fireplace damper. Cover your mouth and nose with face mask or cloth. Keep listening to radio for evacuation routes & updates. Pets & livestock - If possible, get them indoors or in shelters, especially milk-producing animals. If fallout has already started, don't even try to save them -- it's not worth the risk. Take KI..? - If you are near the blast zone or in the projected fallout path, take your KI according to label instructions. AFTER A NUCLEAR ATTACK : Reduce exposure - Get out of the area quickly and into nearest building to reduce chances of being exposed to deadly radioactive materials.Remember ... distance , shielding and time. Things to watch out for : fallout - looks like gray sand and radiation levels can be deadly the first few days without proper shielding. About80% of fallout occurs within 24 hours and it can startfalling within minutes of a blast. fires - any size nuke will cause fires due to the intense heat - plus gas lines, chemicals and other objects fuel fires body parts - there may be a lot of dead bodies or body parts scattered around from the blasts weak structures - be careful since floors, stairs, roofs or walls might be weakened by the blasts looting, guns & panicked people - be aware people may 123 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325become violent trying to find loved ones, water or food HAZMAT - watch for areas marked \"HAZMAT\"or \"radiation hazard\" and don't go there Stay put - If near the blast zone or in projected fallout path ... Close doors, windows and fireplace damper and turn offair conditioner, ventilation fans, furnace and other intakessince they can pull in air or fallout from outside. Go to an underground shelter or make an expedient shel-ter using as much shielding as possible (like furniture,appliances, books, boxes of earth, food, water, etc.) inyour basement or the center of room or building. Grab Disaster Supplies Kit , have detection devices ready to monitor radiation levels, and take KI. Keep battery-operated radio with you to hear updates (if working - EMP may knock out communications systems). Realize it may take a few days or weeks before radiationlevels drop enough for people to move about safely. What .. no services? - An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) could disrupt or crash systems so you may not have access to TV or radio, phones, theInternet, ATMs, and other devices. It could also impact and hinderEmergency Services' response efforts, electrical and water systems, fooddistribution, transportation (no traffic lights or navigation tools)and more. Clean up - If you leave shelter and get exposed to fallout, remove clothes and shoes before re-entering shelter so you don't contaminate others. Rinsebody and hair but remember water may be limited. If possible, keep aponcho with a hood just outside the shelter so folks can protect head andclothing while outside. Don't bring poncho inside shelter though. Weird symptoms - Exposure to radiation may cause an upset stomach, puking or diarrhea, but fear and anxiety cause similar symptoms. A personwith radiation sickness is not contagious, but realize severe cases can belethal. (see pages 112-114) Handling a death in a shelter - If a person (or pet)dies while in a shelter, cover body with a sheet or put it in a bag (or tape several large plastic bagstogether) and move it outside the shelter. Don't try to bury it if high levelsof radiation are still in the area, but do poke several pinholes in bag so gaseswon't build up. Claiming a body - Hundreds or thousands of people could be killed at or near ground zero from the blast, fires and deadly radiation. There may be along delay before bodies can be recovered, and some may never be found. 124 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Water - Until water supplies can be tested, water should be filtered and puri- fied using tips on pages 118 and 152. Make sure everyone has enoughwater to drink daily, but use it sparingly for cleaning dishes, clothes or personal hygiene. Food - If you brought perishables into the shelter, use them first (see more tips on page 151). Limit cooking during the first few days in shelter toreduce heat, and make sure you have proper ventilation when you do. Keepin mind, healthy adults can go for weeks with little or no food, so ration outsupplies in case you cannot leave the shelter for some time or have troublefinding more. Any food that was exposed to fallout should be washed first. Milk - Children and infants should drink milk made from dried or canned products until authorities can inspect cows' milk for exposure to fallout. Sanitation - All shelters should have some form of sanitation like a bucket with disinfectant or existing toilets with trash bags since plumbing may notwork. Also realize even mild forms of radiation sickness can cause pukingand diarrhea so it could get smelly in the shelter. If possible, keep smallbags around for folks to use as barf bags and have wipes or sanitizer handyto reduce the spread of germs. (see more tips on page 153) Recovery - Some emotions people may experience after an attack include shock, fear, disbelief and anger. Everyone handles trauma differently, butadversity can also bring people together. Rebuilding would be a long, slowprocess, especially if an EMP knocks out communications, utilities andbanking systems. Once it is safe to move around outside, many volunteerswill be needed to help the area and country rebuild and recover. Also see TIPSON RECOVERINGFROMADISASTER for some additional thoughts on recovery, but realize a major nuke or EMP couldhave devastating consequences and recovery could take years or decades.Many seniors would be a wealth of information since they have knowledgeof living during \"pre-technology\" days. If more people will learn what to do during a nuclear crisis, there would be less fear and anxiety. Be aware... be prepared ... and have a plan ~ you CANsurvive a nuke. Please spread the word.

A T HUNDERSTORM ? Thunderstorms are very common... in fact, at any given moment, nearly 2,000 thunderstorms can be in progress over the face of the earth. Lightning always comes with a thunderstorm since that is what causes the thunder. If you've ever heard someone say lightning never strikes the sameplace twice... WRONG! Lightning often strikes the same place severaltimes during one storm. Severe thunderstorms can also bring heavy rains, flooding, hail, strong winds, tornadoes and microbursts (a sudden vertical drop of air). BEFORE A THUNDERSTORM : Prepare - Review FLOOD, LIGHTNING, POWERLOSS and WIND MITIGATION at beginning of this Section. Learn the buzzwords - Learn the terms / words used with thunderstorms... Severe Thunderstorm Watch - tells you when and where severe thunderstorms are possible Severe Thunderstorm Warning - severe thunderstorms have been spotted or are occurring Watch for lightning - If you hear thunder, you're close enough to be struck by lightning - take cover as quickly as possible. Be aware that lightningoften strikes miles away from the rainfall or thunderstorm cloud. Unplug it - Unplug appliances if possible - even ones on a surge protector and it's best to move plugs away from outlets. DURING A THUNDERSTORM : Listen - Keep a battery-operated radio handy for local reports on storm (especially severe storms which could cause tornadoes.) IF INDOORS - Stay inside until the storm passes. Don't shower - sounds weird, but wait since water can carry an electrical charge if lightning strikes near home Avoid corded objects - corded phones, PCs or a mouse 127 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325conduct electricity (could shock you). Cordless and cell phones or wireless devices are usually safe. IF OUTDOORS - Try to get to safe shelter quickly. Move away from tall things (trees, towers, fences orpower lines) and metal things (umbrellas, motorcycles orbicycles, wire fences, etc.) since they all attract lightning. If surrounded by trees, take shelter under the shorter trees. Get to a low lying area but watch out for flash floods. Be small - make yourself a small target by crouching down and put your hands on your knees (and don't lie flaton the ground since that makes you a bigger target!) IF IN A BOAT - Get to land and to shelter quickly! Water is extremely dangerous when there's lightning. IF IN A VEHICLE - Keep windows closed and stay out of a convertible, if possible (mainly since you may the highest target if lightning strikes). Hairy sign - If you feel your hair stand on end and feel tingly (which means lightning is about to strike)... crouch down and bend forward putting handson your knees (be small), Don't lie flat on ground... makes a bigger target! If someone is struck by lightning: Victim does not carry electrical charge - CAN be touched. Call 9-1-1 or local EMS (emergency) telephone number. Victim will have 2 wounds - an entrance and an exit burn(see BURNS [Electrical] in Section 3) AFTER A THUNDERSTORM : Things to avoid: flooded areas - stay away from flood waters since may be contaminated by oil, gas or raw sewage or electricallycharged from underground or downed power lines orlightning - wait for authorities to say it's okay to return moving water - 6 inches (15 cm) can knock you off your feet and 2 ft (.6 m) can float a car storm-damaged areas downed power lines Recovery tips - Review TIPSON RECOVERINGFROMADISASTER at end of this Section. 128 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... A T ORNADO ? The U.S. has more tornadoes than anywhere else in the world (averaging about 1,200 or so per year), with sightings in all 50 states. Canada is # 2 involume of tornadoes (averaging about 80 per year) with several high riskareas mostly in central provinces. Most injuries or deaths caused by tornadoes are from collapsing buildings, flying objects, or trying to outrun a twister in a vehicle. Tornadoes can alsoproduce violent winds, hail, lightning, rain and flooding. As of 2007, the National Weather Service uses a new scale called the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale that classifies tornadoes based on 28 Damage Indicators to more accurately estimate wind speeds. Scale Wind Estimate Typical Damage (perNOAA and Wikipedia) EF0 65-85 mph Light : damage to 105-137 km/h gutters or siding; broken branches, etc. EF1 86-110 Moderate : Strips surface off roofs; mobile 138-177 km/h homes overturned; broken windows, ripped off sturdy homes; 218-266 km/h trees debarked; heavy cars lifted & thrown, 166-200 mph Devastating : Well-constructed homes leveled; 267-322 km/h cars thrown; small missiles generated, etc. EF5 > 200 mph Incredible : All homes leveled and swept away; > 322 km/h car-sized missiles fly thru air over 100 metres (109 yards); structural damage to high-rises, etc. BEFORE A TORNADO : Prepare - Review FLOOD, LIGHTNING, POWERLOSS and WIND MITIGATION at beginning of this Section. Learn the buzzwords - Learn the terms / words used with tornado threats... Tornado watch - a tornado is possible - listen for updates Tornado warning - a tornado has been sighted so take shelter quickly and keep a radio with you for updates Learn risks - Ask local emergency management office about threats in your 129 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325area, what the warning signals are, and what to do when you hear them. Where am I? - Make sure your kids know what county or area you live in and listen for that name on radio or TV updates. Get tuned in - Keep a battery-operated radio (with spare batteries) handy for weather forecasts and updates. (Environment Canada's Weatheradio andNOAA's Weather Radio have tone-alert features that alert you when aWatch or Warning has been issued.) Be ready to evacuate - If officials say leave - DO it! (see EVACUATION) Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit . Learn to shut off - Know where and how to shut off electricity, gas and water at main switches and valves -- ask local utilities for instructions. Where do I go? - Know locations of shelters where you spend time (schools, nursing homes, office, etc.) The best place is underground (like abasement, a safe room, or storm cellar) or find a hallway, bathroom, or closet in middle of building on the lowest floor. Do drills - Practice going to shelter with your family and \"duck and cover\" (use your hands and arms to protect head and stay down low). Put it on film/chip/drive - Either videotape or take pictures of home and personal belongings and store them off-site with your important papers. DURING A TORNADO WATCH OR WARNING : Review above tips and... Listen - Keep up with local news reports tracking the twister or conditions using a battery-operated radio. Watch & listen - Some danger signs of a tornado include dark green-ish sky, clouds moving to form a funnel, large hail, or loud roar (like a train). Be ready to evacuate - Keep listening to authorities - if told to leave, DO it (esp. if you live in a mobile home or trailer). DURING A TORNADO : Listen - Use a battery-operated radio to hear reports tracking the twister. 130 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Take cover - If you hear or see a tornado coming take cover immediately! IF IN A TRAILER OR MOBILE HOME - GET OUT!!! Get to a stronger shelter... or ... Stay low to ground in a ditch and cover head with hands. If you hear or see water in the ditch, move quickly to a drier spot (in case lightning strikes nearby). IF INDOORS - Get to a safe place right away - and avoid windows!! In house or small building - Go to basement, storm cellar or middle of building on lowest floor (bathroom, closet orhallway). Get under something sturdy or put mattress orcovers over you for protection & stay until danger passes. In a school, nursing home, factory or shopping center - Go to designated shelter areas (or interior hallways on lowestfloor) -- stay away from open areas. In a high-rise building - Go to a small, interior room or hallway on lowest floor possible and avoid windows. IF OUTDOORS - Try to take shelter in a basement or sturdy building. Or lie in a dry ditch with hands covering your head, but watch and listen forflooding and be aware you're a bigger target for lightning. And if you hearor see water, move since it can carry lightning's electrical charge! IF IN A VEHICLE - GET OUT and take shelter in a building or lie flat in a ditch with hands covering head (but be aware you're a bigger target forlightning when lying flat & listen for flooding!) DO NOT try to out-drive atornado! You never know which direction one will go & it moves too fast. AFTER A TORNADO : Listen - Use a battery-operated radio to hear reports in case there are more twisters. Be aware - Watch for broken glass and downed power lines .. and avoid damaged buildings or homes until authorities give the OK to enter. Injured people - Do not try to move injured people unless they are in dan- ger and call for help immediately. (see TIPSON BASICFIRSTAID) What to wear - Use sturdy work boots and gloves. Recovery tips - See TIPSON RECOVERINGFROMADISASTER 131 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... A T SUNAMI ? A tsunami [soo-nah\u00b4-mee] is a series of huge, destructive waves caused by an undersea disturbance from an earthquake, volcano, landslide, or even ameteorite. As the waves approach the shallow coastal waters, they appearnormal and the speed decreases. Then, as the tsunami nears the coastline, itturns into a gigantic, forceful wall of water that smashes into the shore withspeeds exceeding 600 miles per hour (965 km/h)! Usually tsunamis areabout 20 feet (6 m) high, but extreme ones can get as high as 100 feet (30m) or more! A tsunami is a series of waves and the first wave may not be the largest one, plus the danger can last for many hours after the first wave hits. During thepast 100 years, more than 200 tsunamis have been recorded in the PacificOcean due to earthquakes and Japan has suffered a majority of them. The Pacific Ocean tsunami warning system was put in place back in 1949. As of June 2006, the Indian Ocean has a tsunami warning system, andNOAA expanded the Pacific system to include the Caribbean, the Gulf ofMexico and areas of the Atlantic around the U.S. coast as of mid-2007. Did you know... ... a tsunami is not a tidal wave - it has nothing to do with the tide?! ... another name used to describe a tsunami is \"harbor wave\" - \"tsu\" means harbor and \"nami\" means wave inJapanese?! ... sometimes the ocean floor is exposed near the shore since a tsunami can cause the water to recede or move back before slamming in to shore?! ... tsunamis can travel up streams and rivers that lead to the ocean?! BEFORE A TSUNAMI : Prepare - Review FLOOD, POWERLOSS and WIND MITIGATION at beginning of this Section. Learn the buzzwords - Learn words used by both the West Coast / Alaska Tsunami Warning Center (WC/ATWC - for AK, BC, CA, OR, and WA) andthe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC - for international authorities,HI and all U.S. territories within Pacific basin) for tsunami threats... 132 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Advisory - an earthquake has occurred in the Pacific basin which might generate a tsunami Watch - a tsunami was or may have been generated, but is at least 2 hours travel time from Watch area Warning - a tsunami was / may have been generated and could cause damage to Warning area - should evacuate Learn risks - If new to area, call local emergency management office and ask what the warning signals are and what to do when you hear them.Coastal areas less than 25 feet above sea level and within a mile of shore-line along coasts are at greatest risk. Or visit www.tsunamiready.noaa.gov Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit . Listen - Make sure you have a battery-operated radio (with spare batteries) for weather forecasts and updates. (Radios like Environment Canada'sWeatheradio and NOAA's Weather Radio have a tone-alert feature thatautomatically alerts you when a Watch or Warning has been issued.) Water signs - If near water or shore, watch for a noticeable rise or fall in the normal depth of coastal water - that's advance warning of a tsunami so getto high ground. Also - if water pulls away from shoreline and exposes seafloor - run to higher ground ASAP!! Feeling shaky...? - If you feel an earthquake in the Pacific Coast area (from Alaska down to Baja), listen to the radio for tsunami warnings. Is that it...? - Don't be fooled by the size of one wave - more will follow and they could get bigger ... and a small tsunami at one beach can be a giantwave a few miles away! Be ready to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and leave if you are told to evacuate. (see EVACUATION) DURING A TSUNAMI : Leave - If you are told to evacuate, DO IT! Remember - a tsunami is a series of waves - the first one may be small but who knows what the restwill bring. Grab your Disaster Supplies Kit and GO! IF ON ORNEAR SHORE - Get off the shore and get to higher ground quickly! Stay away from rivers and streams that lead to the ocean sincetsunamis can travel up them too. You cannot outrun a tsunami ... if you see the wave it's too late! 133 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325IF ON A BOAT - It depends where you are -- either get to land or go further out to sea ... In port - May not have time to get out of port or harbor and out to sea - check with authorities to see what you shoulddo. Smaller boats may want to dock and get passengersand crew to land quickly. In open ocean - DO NOT return to port if a tsunami warn- ing has been issued since wave action is barely noticeablein the open ocean! Stay out in open sea or ocean untilauthorities advise danger has passed. Don't go there - Do NOT try to go down to the shoreline to watch and don't be fooled by size of one wave - more will follow and they could get biggerso continue listening to radio and TV . AFTER A TSUNAMI : Listen - Whether on land or at sea, local authorities will advise when it is safe to return to the area -- keep listening to radio and TV updates. Watch out - Look for downed power lines, flooded areas and other damage caused by the waves. Don't go in there - Try to stay out of buildings or homes that are damaged until it is safe to enter and wear sturdy work boots and gloves when work-ing in the rubble. Strange critters - Be aware that the waves may bring in many critters from the ocean (marine life) so watch out for pinchers and stingers! RED or GREEN sign in window - After a disaster, V olunteers and Emergency Service personnel may go door-to-door to check on people. Byplacing a sign in your window that faces the street near the door, you canlet them know if you need them to STOP HERE or MOVE ON . Either use a piece of RED or GREEN construction paper or draw a big RED or GREEN \"X\" (using a crayon or marker) on a piece of paper and tape itin the window. RED means STOP HERE! GREEN means EVERYTHING IS OKAY...MOVE ON! Nothing in the window would also mean STOP HERE!

A volcano is a mountain that opens downward to a reservoir of molten rock (like a huge pool of melted rocks) below the earth's surface. Unlike moun-tains, which are pushed up from the earth's crust, volcanoes are formed bytheir buildup of lava, ash flows, and airborne ash and dust. When pressurefrom gases and molten rock becomes strong enough to cause an explosion,it erupts and starts to spew gases and rocks through the opening. V olcanic eruptions can hurl hot rocks (sometimes called tephra ) for at least 20 miles (32 km) and cause sideways blasts, lava flows, hot ash flows,avalanches, landslides and mudflows (also called lahars ). They can also cause earthquakes, thunderstorms, flash floods, wildfires, and tsunamis.Sometimes volcanic eruptions can drive people from their homes forever. Fresh volcanic ash is not like soft ash in a fireplace. V olcanic ash is made of crushed or powdery rocks, crystals from different types of minerals, andglass fragments that are extremely small like dust. But it is hard, gritty,smelly, sometimes corrosive or acidic (means it can wear away or burnthings) and does not dissolve in water. The ash is hot near the volcano but is cool when it falls over great distances. Ashfall is very irritating to skin and eyes and the combination of ash andburning gas can cause lung irritation or damage to small infants, the elderly or people with breathing problems Did you know... ... there are about 1 million volcanoes on the ocean's floor?!... volcanic eruptions can impact our global climate since they release ash and gases (like sulfur and carbon dioxide) into the earth's atmosphere and warm the oceans?! ... floods, airborne ash or dangerous fumes can spread 100 miles (160 km) or more?! ... Alaska has had over 40 active volcanoes?!... Yellowstone National Park actually sits on top of a super- volcano which erupted 3 times in the past 2 million yearsforming 3 massive calderas (or huge craters)?! BEFORE A VOLCANIC ERUPTION : Prepare - Since volcanic eruptions cause many types of disasters, review all 135 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325MITIGATION tips at beginning of this Section. Also try to cover and protect machinery, electronic devices, downspouts, etc. from ashfall. Learn more by visiting the USGS V olcano Hazards Program site athttp://volcanoes.usgs.gov/ash/ Learn alert levels - Ask emergency management office which volcano warnings or alert levels are used since they vary depending on where youlive (can be alert levels, status levels, condition levels or color codes). Make a plan - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit . (Note: Put in goggles or safety glasses and dust masks for each family member to protect eyes and lungs from ash.) Okay to go? - Don't go to active volcano sites unless officials say it's okay. Be ready to evacuate - Listen to local authorities and leave if you are told to evacuate. (see EVACUATION) DURING A VOLCANIC ERUPTION : Listen - Do what local authorities say, especially if they tell you to leave! Leave - If you are told to evacuate, DO IT! Don't think you are safe to stay home ... the blast can go for miles and cause wildfires and other hazards! Watch out - Eruptions cause many other disasters: flying rocks - hurled for miles at extremely fast speeds mudflows, landslides or lahars - they move faster than you can walk or run fires - hot rocks and hot lava will cause buildings and forests to burn lava flows - burning liquid rock and nothing can stop it gases and ash - try to stay upwind since winds will carry these -- they are very harmful to your lungs vog- volcanic smog forms when sulfur dioxide and other pollutants react with oxygen, moisture and sunlight -- cancause headaches, breathing difficulties and lung damage IF INDOORS - Stay in, but be aware of ash, rocks, mudflows or lava! Close all windows, doors, vents and dampers and turn offA/C and fans to keep ash fall out. Put damp towels under doorways and drafty windows. Bring pets inside (if time, move livestock into shelters). 136 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Listen for creaking on your rooftop (in case ashfall gets heavy -- could cause it to collapse!) IF OUTDOORS - Try to get indoors, if not... Stay upwind so ash and gases are blown away from you. Watch for falling rocks and, if you get caught in rockfall,roll into a ball to protect your head! Get to higher ground - avoid low-lying areas since poison-ous gases collect there and flash floods could happen. Use dust-mask or damp cloth to help breathing, wearlong-sleeved shirts and pants, and use goggles. Ashfall can block out sunlight and may cause lightning. IF IN A VEHICLE - Avoid driving unless absolutely required. Slow down -- keep speed at 35 mph (56 km/h) or slower,mainly because of thick dust and low visibility. Shut off engine and park in garage (driving stirs up ashthat can clog motor and damage moving engine parts). Look upstream before crossing a bridge in case a mudflowor landslide is coming. AFTER A VOLCANIC ERUPTION : Listen - Local authorities will say if and when it's safe to return to area (especially if you had to evacuate) and give other updates when available. Water - Check with authorities before using water, even if eruption was just ash fall (gases and ash can contaminate water reserves). Don't wash ashinto drainpipes, sewers or storm drains since wet ash can wear away metal. What to wear - If you must be around ash fall, you should wear long sleeve shirts, pants, sturdy boots or shoes, gloves, goggles (or safety glasses) andkeep your mouth and nose covered with a dust-mask or damp cloth. Ash - Dampen ash before sweeping or shoveling buildup so it's easier to remove and won't fly back up in the air as much - but be careful since wetash is slippery. Wear protective clothing and a dust mask too. Realize ashcan disrupt lives of people and critters for months. Protect - Cover machinery and electronic devices like computers.

Winter storms can last for many days and include high winds, freezing rain, sleet or hail, heavy snowfall and extreme cold. These types of winter stormscan shut down a city or area mainly due to blocked roads and downedpower lines. People can be stranded in their car or trapped at home for hoursor days, but there are many other hazards that come with these storms. The leading cause of death during winter storms is automobile or other transportation accidents and the second leading cause of death is heartattacks. Hypothermia (or freezing to death) is very common with the elderly who sometimes die inside their homes because it is so cold. The bestway to protect yourself from a winter disaster is to plan ahead before thecold weather begins. Take advantage of spring sales when winter items arecheaper so you're ready for next winter. BEFORE A WINTER STORM : Prepare - Review FLOOD, POWERLOSS, WIND andWINTERSTORM MITIGATION at beginning of this Section. Learn the buzzwords - Learn terms / words used with winter conditions... Freezing rain - rain that freezes when it hits the ground, creating a coating of ice on roads and walkways Hail - rain that turns to ice while suspended and tossed in the air from violent updrafts in a thunderstorm Sleet - rain that turns to ice pellets before reaching ground Winter Weather Advisory - cold, ice and snow expected Winter Storm Watch - severe winter weather such as heavy snow or ice is possible within a day or two Winter Storm Warning - severe winter conditions have begun or are about to begin Blizzard Warning - heavy snow and strong winds producing blinding snow (near zero visibility) and life-threatening wind chills for 3 hours or longer Frost/Freeze Warning - below freezing temperatures expected Be prepared - Review Section 1 to develop a Family Emergency Plan and Disaster Supplies Kit , and add the following at home for winter storms: 138 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325calcium chloride - good for melting ice on walkways (rock salt can blister concrete and kill plants) sand or kitty litter - to improve traction emergency heating equipment and fuel - have backup... fireplace - gas or wood burning stove or fireplace generator - gas or diesel models available and learn how to use it in advance (and never bring it indoors!) kerosene heaters - ask Fire Department if they are legal in your community and ask about safety tips in storing fuel charcoal - NEVER use charcoal indoors since fumes are deadly in contained room -- fine for outdoor use!! extra wood - keep a good supply in a dry area extra blankets - either regular blankets or emergency blankets (about the size of a wallet) Clean chimney - If you use a wood-burning fireplace often, have it inspected annually and consider having a professional chimney sweepclean it as needed. Learn more in the Chimney Safety Institute of America'sFAQs at www.csia.org DURING A WINTER STORM : Listen - Get updates from radio and TV weather reports. What to wear - Dress for the season... layer - much better to wear several layers of loose-fitting, light-weight, warm clothing than one layer of heavy cloth-ing (outside garment should be waterproof) mittens - mittens are warmer than gloves hat- most body heat is lost through the top of your head scarf - cover your mouth with a scarf or wrap to protect your lungs from cold air Don't overdo it - Be careful when shoveling snow or working outside since cold can put strain on the heart and cause a heart attack (even in children!) Carbon monoxide - Learn how to protect your home from winter heating dangers by visiting CDC's Carbon Monoxide site at www.cdc.gov/co/ Watch for signs - playing or working out in the snow can cause exposure so look for signs of... frostbite - loss of feeling in your fingers, toes, nose or ear lobes or they turn really pale 139 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325hypothermia - start shivering a lot, slow speech, stum- bling, or feel very tired If signs of either one ... get inside quickly and get medical help (see COLD- RELATEDILLNESSES in Section 3) . Also check out NOAA's Windchill Chart and safety information at www.weather.gov/om/windchill Power loss - If the power goes off, turn off all tools, appliances and elec- tronic equipment to reduce the load on electrical system once power isrestored. It also may protect devices from a power surge that could followthe start-up. (Tip: Leave one light switch on so you know power's back on.) Leaving? - If you decide to leave home during the winter for some time with the chance of freezing weather hitting while your gone, Canadianofficials suggest you ... Turn off main breaker or electric switch. Turn off water main where it enters house and cover thevalve and pump or meter with a blanket or insulatingmaterial. Drain the water from the plumbing system by turning onwater taps and flushing toilets a few times. Add some anti-freeze to toilet bowl, sink and bath drains. Check draining and frost protection instructions in themanuals for your dishwasher, washing machine, etc. WINTER DRIVING TIPS Driving - If you must travel, consider public transportation. Best to travel during the day, don't travel alone, and tell someone where you're going.Stay on main roads and avoid taking back roads. Winterize car - Make sure you have plenty of antifreeze and snow tires (or chains or cables). Keep gas tank as full as possible during cold weather. Winter Kit - Carry a \"winter\" car kit in trunk (see Section 1) and throw in... warm things - mittens, hat, emergency blanket, sweater, waterproof jacket or coat cold weather items - windshield scraper, road salt, sand emergency items - bright colored cloth or distress flag, booster cables, emergency flares, tow chain, rope, shovel miscellaneous - food, water, radio, etc. Stranded - If you get trapped in your car by a blizzard or break down... get off the road - if you can, drive car onto shoulder 140 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325give a sign - turn on hazard lights and tie a bright cloth or distress flag on antenna, door handle or hang out driverside window (keep above snow so it draws attention) stay in car - stay inside until help arrives (CAR KIT can provide food, water and comforts if you planned ahead) start your car - turn on car's engine and heater about 10 minutes each hour (open window slightly for ventilationso you don't get carbon monoxide poisoning) light at night - turn on inside light so crews or rescuers can see you if you walk - if you walk away from car, make sure you can see building or shelter (no more than 100 yards/10 m) exercise - DO NOT overdo it, but light exercises can help keep you warm sleeping - if others in car, take turns sleeping so someone can watch for rescue crews exhaust pipe - check exhaust pipe now and then and clear out any snow buildup AFTER A WINTER STORM : Check food - If you lost power, check food in both fridge and freezer to ensure it didn't spoil. Foods in a well-filled, well-insulated freezer won't gobad until several days after power goes off. If there are ice crystals in thecenter of food it's okay to eat or refreeze. Don't overdo it - Both adults and children need to be careful when playing or working outside in frigid conditions since cold can put strain on the heartand cause a heart attack. Restock - Stock up on items you used so you're ready for the next one. Recovery tips - Review TIPSON RECOVERINGFROMADISASTER starting on next page. 141 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPS ON RECOVERING FROM A D ISASTER Unless you've been in a disaster before, it is hard to imagine how you will handle the situation. Coping with the human suffering and confusion of adisaster requires a certain inner strength. Disasters can cause you to lose aloved one, neighbor or friend or cause you to lose your home, property andpersonal items. The emotional effects of loss and disruption can show upright away or may appear weeks or months later. We are going to briefly cover \"emotional\" recovery tips then cover some \"general\" recovery tips on what to do AFTER a disaster. Remember -- people can and dorecover from all types of disasters, even the most extreme ones, and you can return to a normal life. EMOTIONAL RECOVERY TIPS- H ANDLING EMOTIONS Since disasters usually happen quickly and without warning, they can bevery scary for both adults and children. They also may cause you to leaveyour home and your daily routine and deal with many different emotions,but realize that a lot of this is normal human behavior. It is very importantthat you understand no matter what the loss is... there is a natural grievingprocess and every person will handle that process differently. SOME NORMAL REACTIONS TO DISASTERS Right after disaster - shock, fear, disbelief, hard time making decisions, refuses to leave home or area, won't find help or help others Days, weeks or months after disaster - anger or moodiness, depression, loss of weight or change in appetite, nightmares, trouble sleeping, crying for \"noreason\", isolation, guilt, anxiety, domestic violence Additional reactions by children - thumb sucking, bed-wetting, clinging to parent(s) or guardian, won't go to bed or school, tantrums (crying orscreaming), problems at school Please note: If any of your disaster reactions seem to last for quite some time, please consider seeking professional counseling for Post-TraumaticStress Disorder (PTSD). There is nothing wrong with asking for help! TIPS FOR ADULTS & K IDS Death - You may lose loved ones or need to handle bodies during a crisis. Review some tips on pages 155-156. 142 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Deal with it - Recognize your own feelings so you can deal with them properly and responsibly. Talk or not? - Talking to others can help relieve stress and help you realize you are not alone... other victims are struggling with the same emotions,including your own family. And don't leave out the little ones ... let themtalk about their feelings and share your feelings with them. But don't forceanyone to talk about their feelings since they might cope better by keepingtheir thoughts private. Accept help - Realize that the people who are trying to help you want to help you so please don't shut them out or turn them away. Time out - Whenever possible, take some time off and do something you enjoy to help relieve stress... and do something fun with the whole familylike a hike, a picnic, or play a game. Rest - Listen to your body and get as much rest as possible. Stress can run you down so take care of yourself and your family members. Slow down - Don't feel like you have to do everything at once and pace yourself with a realistic schedule. Stay healthy - Make sure everyone cleans up with soap and clean water after working in debris. Also, drink lots of clean water and eat healthymeals to keep up your strength. If you packed vitamins and herbs in yourDisaster Supplies Kit , take them. Work out - Physical activity is good for releasing stress or pent-up energy. Hug - A hug or a gentle touch (holding a hand or an arm) is very helpful during stressful times. They're watching you - Kids look to adults during a disaster so your reac- tions will impact the kids (meaning if you act alarmed or worried - they'llbe scared, if you cry - they cry, etc.) Stick together - Keep the family together as much as possible and include kids in discussions and decisions whenever possible. Draw a picture - Ask your kids to draw a picture of the disaster to help you understand how he or she views what happened. Explain - Calmly tell your family what you know about the disaster using facts and words they can understand and tell everyone what will happennext so they know what to expect. 143 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Reassurance - Let your kids and family know that they are safe and repeat this as often as necessary to help them regain their confidence. Praise - Recognizing good behavior and praise for doing certain things (even the littlest of things) will help boost morale. Watch your temper - Stress will make tempers rise but don't take out your anger on others, especially kids. Be patient and control your emotions. Let kids help - Including children in small chores during recovery and clean up processes will help them feel like they are part of the team and give themmore confidence. Let others know - Work with your kids' teachers, day-care staff, babysitters and others who may not understand how the disaster has affected them. GENERAL RECOVERY TIPS- AFTER ADISASTER RETURNING TO A DAMAGED HOME: Listen - Keep a battery-operated radio with you for emergency updates. Twitter, Facebook, etc. - Social networking sites allow users to stay current on evacuation and recovery efforts. You may not have access to the Internetduring or after a crisis, but text messages can sometimes get through whencell and phone systems are down. FEMA, local officialsand relief groupsuse social media to post updates about evacuations, shelter information andemergency broadcast warnings. Tools like Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, Vine,Instagram and Google Maps can help you stay updated on friends and families displaced by storms or share photos and videos of an incident. What to wear - Use sturdy work boots and gloves. Check outside first - Before you go inside, walk around outside to check for loose power lines, gas leaks, and structural damage. Call a professional - If you have any doubts about the safety of your home, contact a professional inspector. Don't go in there - If your home was damaged by fire, do NOT enter until authorities say it is safe (also don't enter home if flood waters remainaround the building). Use a flashlight - There may be gas or other flammable materials in the area so use a battery-operated flashlight (do not use oil, gas lanterns, candles ortorches and don't smoke!) 144 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Watch out - Look for critters, especially snakes (flooding will carry them) and use a stick to poke through debris. Take & share pics - If you have a camera phone, take shots of the damage to your home or place of business since it may take days before an adjustergets there. It can also be a way to share updates with neighbors who aren'table to get to the site. The photos could also be uploaded to FirstResponders and/or media to help prioritize the response efforts. Things to check - Some things you want to do first... Check for cracks in the roof, foundation and chimneys. Watch out for loose boards and slippery floors. Check for gas leaks (smells like rotten eggs, hear a hissingor blowing sound or see discolored plants or grass) ... - Start with the hot water heater then check other appliances.- Turn off main valve from outside and call gas company. Check electrical system (watch for sparks, broken wires or the smell of hot insulation) ... - Turn off electricity at main fuse box or circuit breaker.- DO NOT touch fuse box, circuit breaker or wires if in water or if you're wet! Check appliances after turning off electricity at main fuse and, if wet, unplug and let them dry out. Call a profession-al to check them before using. Check water and sewage system and, if pipes are damaged,turn off main water valve. Clean up any spilled medicines, bleaches, gasoline, etc. Open cabinets carefully since things may fall out. Look for valuable items (jewelry, etc.) and protect them. Try to patch up holes, windows and doors to protect home from further damage. If possible, download Iowa Conservation and PreservationConsortium's \"Flood Recovery Booklet\" to learn how todry materials like artwork, books, photographs, CD/DVDs,etc. at www.iowaconserveandpreserve.org Clean and disinfect everything that got wet (bleach is best)since mud left behind by floodwaters can contain sewageand chemicals. Wear gloves, mask and eye protection whenusing disinfectants. If basement is flooded, pump it out slowly (about 1/3 of thewater per day) to avoid damage since walls may collapse ifsurrounding ground still waterlogged. Check with local authorities about water since it could be 145 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325contaminated. Wells should be pumped out and the water tested before using, too. Throw out food, makeup and medicines that may have beenexposed to flood waters and check refrigerated foods to see if they are spoiled. If frozen foods have ice crystals in them then okay to refreeze. Throw out moldy items that are porous (like rotten wood,carpet padding, furniture, etc.) if they're too difficult toclean and remove mold. Remove standing water and scrubmoldy surfaces with non-ammonia soap or detergent, or acommercial cleaner, rinse with clean water and dry com-pletely. Then use a mixture of 1 part bleach to 10 parts cleanwater to wipe down surfaces or items, rinse and dry. If possible, visit the EPA web site for tips on cleaning mold atwww.epa.gov/iedmold1/cleanupguidelines.html Consider having your house tested for mold. (see AIR QUALITY MITIGATION) Call your insurance agent, take pictures of damage, andkeep ALL receipts on cleaning and repairs. Protect stuff? - Secure valuable items or move them to another location, if possible. Sometimes looting can occur after a disaster, but be smart about protecting your property ... it's not worth getting hurt or shot defending it. GETTING HELP: DISASTER ASSISTANCE \"The government will save me\" - Officials and groups will try to keep basic functions working while helping as many people as possible, but it takestime so expect delays. Local First Responders will be overwhelmed andmay not be able to help if you need Police, Fire or EMS services. Listen - Local TV and radio will announce where to get emergency housing, food, first aid, clothing and financial assistance after a disaster. Help finding family - The Red Cross maintains a database to help people find family, but don't call office in the disaster area since they'll beswamped. Agencies that help - The Red Cross and Salvation Army are often stationed right at the scene of a disaster to help people with immediate medical, food,and housing needs. Some other sources of help include church groups andsynagogues, and various other Social Service agencies. President declares a \"Major Disaster\" (in U.S.) - According to FEMA's Floodsmart.gov web site, less than 10% of all weather emergencies in the 146 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325U.S. are declared. In severe disasters, the government (FEMA) steps in and provides people with ... Temporary housing (several components available to meethousing needs of victims) - Mortgage and Rental Assistance Program (if evicted) - Rental Assistance (if dwelling unlivable)- Minimal Repair Program- Mobile Homes or Other readily fabricated dwellings (may be set up when all other options are exhausted) Counseling Low interest loans and grants Businesses and farms are eligible for aid through FEMA FEMA's Disaster Recovery Centers - FEMA will set up DRCs at local schools and municipal buildings to manually process applications andwhere people can meet face-to-face with agencies to ... Discuss their disaster-related needs. Get information about disaster assistance programs. Teleregister for assistance. Learn about measures for rebuilding that can eliminateor reduce risk of future loss (mitigation tips). Learn how to complete Small Business Administration(SBA) loan application (same form used to qualify allindividuals for low cost loans or grants, including repairor replacement of damaged homes & furnishings). Request status of their Disaster Housing Application. Or people can apply for assistance with DRC by calling 1-800-621-FEMA. Also check out FEMA's site at www.disasterassistance.gov Long-term shelter - If your home is damaged or destroyed or you're forced to leave due to on-going threats (like mudslides or flooding), you may needto find temporary or permanent living quarters. This could mean staying ina public shelter or hotel, living with friends or relatives, or renting a homeor apartment. During a major disaster, FEMA and the Red Cross offer someassistance but you may be on your own in some cases. I lost my job (in U.S.) - People who lose their job due to a disaster may apply for weekly benefits using Disaster Unemployment Assistance(DUA). You can call 1-800-621-FEMA (TTY: 1-800-462-7585) or yourlocal unemployment office for registration information. Legal help (in U.S.) - Local members of the American Bar Association Young Lawyers Division offer free legal counseling to low-income 147 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325individuals after President declares a major disaster. FEMA can provide more information at DRCs or call 1-800-621-FEMA (TTY: 1-800-462-7585). Canadian disaster - In the event of a large-scale disaster in Canada, provincial or territorial government would pay out money to individualsand communities in accordance with its provincial disaster assistance program. (Federal assistance - called DF AA [Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements] - is paid direct to province or territory.) Recovering financially - The American Red Cross and FEMA developed the following list to help you minimize the financial impact of a disaster: First things first - 1) remove valuables only if residence is safe to enter, 2) try to make temporary repairs to limit further damage, and 3) notify your insurance companyimmediately! Conduct inventory - make sure you get paid for items lost Reconstruct lost records - use catalogs, want ads, Blue Books, court records, old tax forms from IRS, escrowpapers, etc. to help determine value of lost possessions Notify creditors and employers - let people you do busi- ness with know what has happened File insurance claim - get all policy numbers; find out how they are processing claims; identify your property with asign; file claims promptly, work with adjusters, etc. Obtain loans and grants - local media will announce options available for emergency financial assistance Avoid contractor rip-offs - get several estimates; don't rush into anything; ask for proof of licenses, permits andinsurance; get contract in writing; never prepay; get signedrelease of lien; check out contractors with local BetterBusiness Bureau, etc. Reduce your tax bite - you may be eligible for tax refunds or deductions but realize they can be very complex so youmay want to ask an expert for advice MITIGATION (REDUCING THE IMPACT FOR THE NEXTTIME) The last thing you want to think about after a disaster is \"what if it happensagain\"?! Before you spend a lot of time and money repairing your homeafter a disaster, find ways to avoid or reduce the impact of the next one. 148 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325FEMA recommends the following mitigation tips AFTER A DISASTER: Ask local building department about agencies that purchase property in areas that have been flooded. You may be ableto sell your property to a government agency and move toanother location. Determine how to rebuild your home to handle the shakingof an earthquake or high winds. Ask local government,hardware dealer, or private home inspector for technicaladvice. Consider options for flood-proofing your home. Determineif your home can be elevated to avoid future flood damage. Make sure all construction complies with local buildingcodes that pertain to seismic, flood, fire and wind hazards.Make sure roof is firmly secured to the main frame of thehouse. Make sure contractors know and follow the code andconstruction is inspected by a local building inspector. And please review ALL Mitigationtips at the beginning of this Section to ensure you're prepared for any future emergencies or disasters. 149 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPS ON SHELTER LIVING DURING OR AFTER AN EMERGENCY Taking shelter during a disaster could mean you have to be somewhere for several hours, days or weeks .. even months! It could be as simple as goingto a basement during a tornado warning or staying home without elec-tricity or water for several days during a major storm. In many emergencies, the Red Cross and other organizations set up public shelters in schools, city or county buildings and churches. While they oftenprovide water, food, medicine, and basic sanitary facilities, you should planto have your own supplies - especially water. Whether your shelter is at home or in a mass care facility use the following tips while staying there during or after an emergency: Don't leave - Stay in your shelter until local authorities say it's okay to leave. Realize that your stay in shelter can range from a few hours to weeks... or longer in some cases. Take it outside - Restrict smoking to well-ventilated areas (outside if it's safe to go out) and make sure smoking materials are disposed of safely! Behave - Living with many people in a confined space can be difficult and unpleasant but you must cooperate with shelter managers and others. 24-hour watch - Take turns listening to radio updates and keep a 24-hour communications and safety watch going. Toilet - Bathrooms may not be available so make sure you have a plan for human waste. (see TIPS ON SANITATION OF HUMAN WASTE) Pets - Public shelters may not allow pets (unless it is a service animal assist- ing a disabled person) so you may have to make arrangements to keep themsomewhere else. Try the Humane Society or local Animal Shelter - if theyare still functioning after a disaster. Fallout shelter - Review pages 109-126 for tips on long-term sheltering during a nuclear crisis. Next we're going to cover some basic things to think about in the event you and your family are without power, running water, and/or functioning toilets during an emergency or disaster. We suggest you read over these topics and think about things you might want to get in advance so you canbe prepared for several days or longer. 150 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPS ON USING HOUSEHOLD FOODS COOKING IN A DISASTER SITUATION When disaster strikes, you may not have electricity or gas for cooking. For emergency cooking you can use a charcoal grill, hibachi or propane camp-ing unit or stove - but only do this OUTDOORS ! Never use charcoal in an enclosed environment -- it causes deadly fumes! You can also heat food with candle warmers or a can of sterno. Canned food can be heated in the can, but remember to remove the paper label and open the can first. And be careful -- don't burn your hand since itmay be hot! Try to limit using salty foods since they can make you thirsty. Also, keep in mind dried foods (like pasta, beans, etc.) require extra water and cookingtime so may not be good choices during a disaster situation. IF THE ELECTRICITY GOES OFF , USEFOOD WISELY ... First - Use perishable food and foods from the refrigerator ... and limit opening the fridge (don't stand and stare in it like most of us do!) Therefrigerator will keep foods cool for about 4 hours without power if leftunopened. Dry ice or a block of ice can be placed inside it too if power isout more than 4 hours. Second - Use foods from the freezer and, if possible, have a list of items in the freezer taped outside or at least know how things are organized insideto find stuff quickly. (Keeping door shut keeps cold in.) Foods in a well-filled, well-insulated freezer won't go bad until several days after powergoes off. Usually there will be ice crystals in the center of food (whichmeans it's still okay to eat or refreeze) for 2-3 days after a power failure. Ifpossible, use block or dry ice to help keep freezer food cold. Third - Use non-perishable foods and staples in your pantry and cabinets. TIPFORYOUR FREEZER : Before a disaster strikes, line your freezer with bottled water. The frozenbottles can help keep food cold longer if you lose power, plus you'll haveextra water once it melts. This also helps keep freezer as full as possiblewhich makes it more energy efficient, but rotate bottles every 6 months. 151 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPS ON WATER PURIFICATION Water is critical for survival. We can go days, even weeks, without food but we must have water to live. For example, an average man (154 pounds) can lose about 3 quarts/litres of water per day and an average woman (140pounds) can lose over 2 quarts - and this could increase depending on yourweight and size, on the season, and the altitude. Your body loses preciouswater by sweating and breathing and, of course, by peeing. In fact, you cantell if you are getting dehydrated by the color of your pee. When you drinkenough water, your pee will be light-colored or bright yellow, but whendehydrated, it will be dark-colored and you'll pee in smaller amounts. The average person should drink between 2 and 2 \u00bd quarts/litres of water per day. Plan on storing about one gallon (4 litres) per day per person fordrinking, cooking and personal hygiene - and don't forget water for pets! Did you know... ... almost 6,000 children die every day from water-related disease?... about 1.1 billion people don't have access to safe water? USE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING METHODS TO PURIFY DRINKING WATER : Boiling - Boil vigorously for 2-10 minutes. Boiling water kills most harm- ful bacteria and parasites. To improve the taste of boiled water pour it backand forth between two containers to add oxygen back into it. Bleach - Add 10-20 drops of \"regular\" household bleach per gallon (about 4 litres) of water, mix well, and let stand for 30 minutes. A slight smell ortaste of chlorine indicates water is good to drink. (NOTE: Do NOT use scented bleaches, colorsafe bleaches, or bleaches with added cleaners!) Purifier - Purification tablets are inexpensive and found at sporting goods stores and some drugstores. (Look for ones that contain 5.25 to 6.0 percent sodium hypochlorite as the only active ingredient.) Or google MMS (sodi- um chlorite) since it can be used for purification and long term storage. Distillation - Involves boiling water and collecting the vapor to remove impurities. (Check with library or do a web search on distillation.) Also, learn how to remove water from other places in your home or office (like the hot water heater, ice cubes, toilet tanks [not the bowl], etc.) Andconsider purchasing a certified portable water purification device (pitcherfilter, faucet filter, etc.) and pack an extra unit in your Disaster Supplies Kit. To learn more about water safety visit www.epa.gov/drink . Also see tips on filtering water contaminated by fallout on page 118. 152 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPS ON SANITATION OF HUMAN WASTE In disaster situations, plumbing may not be usable due to broken sewer or water lines, flooding, or freezing of the system. To avoid the spread of disease, it is critical that human waste be handled in a sanitary manner! Did you know... ... one gram (0.035 oz) of human feces can contain 10 million viruses, 1 million bacteria, 1,000 parasite cysts, and 100 parasite eggs!? 8 IFTOILET OKAY BUT LINES ARE NOT... If water or sewer lines are damaged but toilet is still intact, you should linethe toilet bowl with a plastic bag to collect waste... but DO NOT flush thetoilet!! After use, add a small amount of disinfectant to bag, remove and seal bag (with a twist tie if reusing), and place bag in a tightly coveredcontainer away from people to reduce smell. IFTOILET IS UNUSABLE ... If toilet is destroyed, a plastic bag in a bucket may be substituted. (Somecompanies make plastic buckets with snap-on lids.) After use, add a smallamount of disinfectant to the bag, and seal or cover bucket. DISINFECTANTS - easy and effective for home use in Sanitation of Human Waste. Choose one to store with your Disaster Supplies Kit: Chlorine Bleach - If water is available, a solution of 1 part liquid house- hold bleach to 10 parts water is best. DO NOT use dry bleach since it canburn you, corrode or dissolve things so not safe for this kind of use. Calcium hypochlorite - (e.g. HTH, etc.) Available in swimming pool supply or hardware stores and several large discount stores. It can be usedin solution by mixing, then storing. Follow directions on the package. Portable toilet chemicals - These come in both liquid and dry formulas and are available at recreational vehicle (RV) supply stores. Use accordingto package directions. These chemicals are designed especially for toiletsthat are not connected to sewer lines. Powdered, chlorinated lime - Available at some building supply stores. It can be used dry and be sure to get chlorinated lime - notquick lime. There are also several types of portable toilets and sanitation products that range from fairly low dollars to hundreds of dollars. Or get a small shovelso you can at least dig a hole or latrine outside like campers do. 153 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPS ON HELPING OTHERS INTHEIR TIME OF NEED A disaster really brings out the generosity of many people who want to help the victims. Unfortunately, sometimes this kindness overwhelms agenciesthat are trying to coordinate relief efforts so please review the followinggeneral guidelines defined by FEMA on helping others after a disaster. In addition to the people you care for on a daily basis, con-sider the needs of your neighbors and people with specialneeds. If you want to volunteer your services after a disaster, listen to local news reports for information about where vol-unteers are needed. Until volunteers are specificallyrequested, please stay away from disaster areas. If you are needed in a disaster area, bring your own food,water and emergency supplies. This is especially importantin cases where a large area has been hit since these itemsmay be in short supply. Do not drop off food, clothing or items to a governmentagency or disaster relief organization unless a particular item has been requested. They usually don't have theresources to sort through donations and it is very costly toship these bulk items. If you wish, give check or money order to a recognized disaster relief organization like the Salvation Army or RedCross. They can process funds, purchase what is needed andget it to the people who need it most. Your entire donation goes towards the disaster relief since these organizations raise money for overhead expenses throughseparate fund drives. If your company wants to donate emergency supplies,donate a quantity of a given item or class of items (such asnonperishable food) rather than a mix of different items.Also, find out where donation is going, how it's going to getthere, who's going to unload it and how it will be distrib-uted. Without good planning, much needed supplies will beleft unused. Donate blood or help organize a blood drive. 154 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325DEALING WITH DEATH OR MASSCASUALTIES Quite often natural or man-made disasters bring not only destruction but death to a community. Sometimes First Responders cannot reach a disastersite for hours, days or weeks so citizens should be prepared to deal withdeath or the handling of dead bodies. IFI NA DISASTER SITUATION WITH CASUALTIES AND NOHELP... Dead bodies do not cause epidemics after a natural disaster.It's survivors who will most likely spread disease. Don't put yourself in danger to recover a body if there is anychemical, biological or radiological contamination in thearea or structural damage due to an earthquake, etc. People handling bodies should wear gloves and boots andavoid wiping their face or mouth with their hands. (Facemasks aren't needed but may be helpful to some handlers.)Wash hands with soap and clean water often, and disinfecttools, clothing, equipment and vehicles used to move thebodies. Bodies often leak feces after death so avoid contact with it(and body fluids)to limit exposure to any possible diseases. If no First Responders are on scene (and it may be a whilebefore any are), write down any known details about whereand when a body was found, name (if known), personalbelongings on or with the body, take a photo (if possible) tohelp with identification later, etc. IFALOVED ONE DIES... In addition to dealing with the sadness and loss, there are several thingsfamilies may need to think about and plan for if they lose a loved one during a disaster or crisis. Realize some bodies may never be recovered or could becontaminated in certain types of disasters so families maynot have the body released to them. Determine who is Executor of the will (if any) and make 10to 12 certified copies of death certificate (for probate, insur-ance benefits, bank accounts, social security, etc.) The 155 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325certificates are easier to obtain from the mortuary when the funeral arrangements are made. File with the probate court within 30 days, if necessary. Contact banks/trusts (to change names on accounts),employers (to check on any available benefits), SocialSecurity, etc. If the deceased had a safety deposit box rented in their name only, a court order will be required toopen the box. Contact credit card companies to ensure accounts are cancelled if the deceased is the only name on the account. Check on insurance policies (e.g. life, health, mortgage,auto, etc.), any 401Ks or profit sharing plans, V .A. benefits,etc. Consider pets, mail and utilities if the deceased lived alone. If the deceased is listed in your will to receive certain property, it'll need to be changed. (And mention this toother family members in case they have left property to thedeceased too.) 156 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325157 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Section 3 Information & Tips on Basic First AidWhat are YOU gonna do about... ANEMERGENCY ? Everyone should know what to do in an emergency. You should know who to call and what care to provide. Providing care involves giving first aiduntil professional medical help arrives. The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is a network of police, fire and medical personnel, as well as other community resources. People can helpEMS by reporting emergencies and helping out victims until EMS canarrive. During a major disaster, EMS groups will become swamped so if the public is prepared to handle some types of emergencies then we can helpsome of the victims until EMS arrives. Your role in the EMS system includes the following things: BE AWARE... Realize this is an emergency situation -- you could be putting yourself in danger! BE PREPARED... Know how to handle the situation. HA VE A PLAN! Check ABCs... , call 9-1-1 (or call for an ambulance) and help victim, if possible. TIPSONTHEABC S... AIRWAY , BREATHING & C IRCULATION In an emergency, you need to check the victim for ABCs... Airway . Open the airway by tilting the head back, gently lifting the jaw up, and leaving mouth open. Breathing .Place your ear over victim's mouth and nose. Look at chest, listen, and feel for breathing for 3 to 5 seconds. Circulation . Check for a pulse using fingertips (not your thumb) in the soft spot between throat and the muscle on the sideof the neck for 5-10 seconds. Note: For heart emergencies when doing CPR, the steps are now CAB ! 158 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPSONMAKING YOUR \"EMERGENCY ACTION \" PLAN 1. BE AWARE ...Make sure it's safe to approach area and victim. Use your senses... Listen for cries for help; screams; moans; explosions; humming orbuzzing noises; lots of coughing, etc. Look for broken glass; open medicine cabinet, container or bottle near victim; smoke; fire; vapors or mist; downed power lines, etc. Watch for signs like trouble breathing; trouble talking; grabbing at throat or chest; pale or blue color in face, lips or ears; lots of peoplecovering mouth or running away, etc. Smell smoke or something burning; strong odors or vapors (leave if odor is too strong), etc. Feel something burning your eyes, lungs or skin, etc. 2. BE PREPARED ...The best thing you can do is STAY CALM... and THINK before you act! Any time there's an emergency or disaster, most people are scared or confused and many don't know what to do. Take a few seconds andbreathe in through your nose and out through your mouth to helpslow your heartbeat and calm down. Always ask if you can help... either ask the victim or people around who may be helping. 3. HA VE A PLAN !Check ABCs , call 9-1-1 and help victim, if possible. ... Check victims' ABCs... Airway, Breathing, & Circulation (Note: For heart emergencies, the steps are now CAB !) ... call 9-1-1, 0 for Operator or local emergency number for an ambulance (see tips on next page) ... help the victim, if possible -- and STAY until help arrives.Before giving first aid, you must have the victim's permission. Tell them who you are, how much training you've had, and how you planto help. Do not give care to someone who refuses it - unless they are unable to respond. 159 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPSONCALLING 9-1-1 F ORANAMBULANCE Whenever there is an emergency, use the following tips to help decide if you should call 9-1-1 (or local emergency number) for an ambulance. Call if victim... ... is trapped ... is not responding or is passed out... is bleeding badly or bleeding cannot be stopped... has a cut or wound so bad and deep that you can see bone or muscles ... has a body part missing or is torn away... has pain below the rib cage that does not go away... is peeing, pooping or puking blood (called passing blood)... is breathing weird or having trouble breathing... seems to have hurt their head, neck or back... is jerking uncontrollably (called having a seizure)... has broken bones and cannot be moved carefully... acts like they had a heart attack (chest pain or pressure) If you call 9-1-1 there may be a recording or delay while your call is being processed. DONOTHANGUP -- wait for a 9-1-1 dispatcher. When you talk to 9-1-1 or the emergency number... ... try to stay CALM and describe what happened and what is wrong with the victim ... give the location of the emergency, your name and the phone number you are calling from ... follow their instructions in case they tell you what to do for the victim ... do NOT hang up until the 9-1-1 operator tells you to. 160 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325TIPSONREDUCING THE SPREAD OF GERMS ORDISEASES Whenever you perform first aid on anyone, there is always a chance of spreading germs or diseases between yourself and the victim. These stepsshould be followed no matter what kind of first aid is being done -- fromvery minor scrapes to major emergencies -- to reduce the risk of infection. BE AWARE... ... Try to avoid body fluids like blood or urine (pee). ... Cover any open cuts or wounds you have on your body since they are doorways for germs! BE PREPARED... ... Wash your hands with soap and water before and after giving first aid. ... Have a first aid kit handy, if possible.... Put something between yourself and victim's body fluids, if possible ... blood or urine - wear disposable gloves or use a clean dry cloth saliva or spittle - use a disposable Face Shield during Rescue Breathing ... Clean up area with household bleach to kill germs. ... and... HA VE A PLAN! ... see TIPS ON MAKING YOUR \"EMERGENCY ACTION\" PLAN two pages back . TIPSONGOOD SAMARITAN LAWS The definition of a \"Samaritan\" is a charitable or helpful person. Most states have Good Samaritan laws that were designed to protect citizens whotry to help injured victims with emergency care. If a citizen uses \"logical\" or \"rational\" actions while making wise or careful decisions during an emergency situation then they can be protected from being sued. To learn more about your state's Good Samaritan laws, check with your local library, search the web or contact an attorney. 161 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... BITES & S TINGS ? ANIMAL & H UMAN BITES Americans and Canadians report approximately 5 million bites each year (mostly from dogs). Both humans and animals carry bacteria and viruses intheir mouths, however, human bites are more dangerous and infection-prone because people seem to have more reactions to the human bacteria. Things to watch for... Puncture or bite marks Bleeding Infection - Pain / tenderness, redness, heat, swelling, pus, red streaks (also read about MRSA on pages 198-199) Allergic Reaction - Feeling ill, dizzy or trouble breathing What to do... Wash the bite as soon as possible to remove saliva and dirt from bite wound - use running water and soap or rinsearea with hydrogen peroxide. Control bleeding using direct pressure with cloth or gauze. Pat dry and cover with sterile bandage, gauze, or cloth -don't put cream or gel on wound -- may prevent drainage. May want to raise bitten area to reduce swelling or use acold pack, bag of frozen peas, or cloth with ice cube in it. Call local emergency number or call Animal Control Watch for allergic reactions or infection for a few days. ...also... Get to a doctor or hospital if bleeding is really bad, if youthink animal could have rabies, or if stitches are required. INSECT BITES & S TINGS Covering first aid for bites & stings in general, then West Nile Virus. Things to watch for... Stinger (Note: honeybees leave a stinger and venom sac) Puncture or bite markBurning pain or SwellingAllergic Reaction - Pain, itching, hives, redness or discoloration at site, trouble breathing, signs of shock(pale, cold, drowsy, etc.) 162 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What to do... Run away from area if there's a swarm or nest nearby. Remove stinger by scraping it away with credit card, long fingernail or using tweezers. Don't try to squeeze it out since this causes more venom to get in the victim. Wash wound with soap and water or rinse with hydrogenperoxide. Cover with a bandage or clean cloth and apply ice pack. Watch for allergic reactions for a few days and call PoisonCenter at 1-800-222-1222 with questions about reactions. Call Fire Department or bee removal expert if needed. (See WESTNILEVIRUS on next page. TICKS covered on pages 167-168.) To relieve pain from an insect bite or sting: Activated charcoal - Make a paste using 2-3 capsules and a small amount of warm water. Dab paste on sting site and cover with gauze or plastic tokeep it moist. This will help draw out venom so it collects on your skin.Note, powder makes a black mess but easily wiped off with a towel. (see FIRST AID KITS in Section 1) Baking Soda - Make a paste of 3 parts baking soda + 1 part warm water and apply to the sting site for 15-20 minutes. Clay mudpack - If in the wilderness, put a mudpack over injury and cover with bandage or cloth. The mudpack must be a mix of clay-containing soilsince clay is the key element but don't use if any skin is cracked or broken. Meat tenderizer - Mixing meat tenderizer (check ingredient list for \"papain\") with warm water and applying to the sting will help break downinsect venom. (Papain is a natural enzyme derived from papaya.) Urine (Pee) - Another remedy useful in the wilderness sounds totally gross (but has a history of medical applications in a number of cultures) is urine (pee) which reduces the stinging pain. (Unless you have a urinary tractinfection, the pee will be sterile and at the least won't do any harm!) Some potential pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory remedies: fresh aloe - break open a leaf or use 96-100% pure aloe gel lemon juice - from a fresh lemon vitamin E - oil from a bottle or break open a few gel capsules store brands - if over-the-counter methods preferred, use calamine cream or lotion and aspirin or acetaminophen 163 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325WESTNILEVIRUS West Nile virus (WNV) is primarily spread by mosquitoes that feed on infected birds. But realize, out of 700+ species of mosquitoes in the U.S.(and 74 species in Canada), less than 1% - become infected with WNV . The virus usually causes fever, aches and general discomfort. Severe cases can cause inflammation of the lining of the brain or spinal cord (meningi-tis), inflammation of the brain itself (encephalitis) or a polio-like syndromethat can result in loss of function of one or more limbs (WN poliomyelitisor acute flaccid paralysis). These conditions can be life-altering or fatal.People of all ages could develop serious health effects, but seniors and folkswith weakened immune systems are at greatest risk. Things to watch for... (Most symptoms appear 2 to 15 days after being bitten) Mild flu-like symptoms - fever, headache, feeling sick to stomach (nausea) and/or body aches Mild skin rash and swollen lymph glandsSevere symptoms - severe headache, high fever, neck stiffness, confusion, shakes, coma, convulsions, muscle weakness, vision loss, paralysis, meningitis or encephalitis What to do... There is no \"cure\" other than a body fighting off the virus naturally - mainly just watch symptoms. Consider boosting immune system to help fight virus (liketaking astragalus, Vitamin C, garlic, mushrooms, zinc,good multiple vitamin + mineral supplement, etc. - butcheck with doctor if taking prescription medications). If mild symptoms appear, keep watching person for a few weeks in case symptoms get worse. If severe symptoms appear, get medical attention quickly since it could become deadly. Mosquitoes can transmit WNV and other viruses like chikungunya, dengue, and other diseases, but there are some steps you can take to prevent bites. Things to do to avoid mosquito bites ... Stay indoors at dawn, dusk, and early evenings when mosquitoes are most active, but realize they bite anytime. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors. Spray clothing and exposed skin with repellent containingDEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) -- the higher % of DEET, the longer you're protected from bites (6.65% lasts 164 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325almost 2 hours; 20% lasts about 4 hours, etc.) Two other repellents are picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus . Don't put repellent on small children's hands since it may irritate their mouths or eyes. Get rid of \"standing water\" sources around yard and homesince they are breeding grounds for mosquitoes. The CDC says Vitamin B and \"ultrasonic\" devices areNOT effective in preventing mosquito bites! There is concern about mosquitoes and vectors like ticks or fleas spreading diseases or being used as \"bioterrorism\". Listen to officials for informationand visit below sites to learn more. Also see TICKS on pages 167-168. For more information visit CDC' s Division of Vector-Borne Diseases at www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dvbd/ ..or.. Public Health Agency of Canada' s Infectious Diseases at www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/id-mi/ SEA CRITTER (M ARINE LIFE) STINGS There are just too many types of sea critters in our oceans and seas so wecan't cover all the various kinds of stings and bites that could happen, buta few common stings are shown here. To learn about specific types of seacritters (marine life), check with your local library or on the Internet. Things to watch for... Puncture marks or tentacles on the skin Pain or burningSwelling or red marksPossible Allergic Reaction - Pain, itching, hives, redness or discoloration at site, trouble breathing, signs ofshock (pale, cold, drowsy, etc.) What to do... Rinse skin - use seawater, vinegar, ammonia, or alcohol (in whatever form is handy - rubbing alcohol or booze.)Fresh water might make it hurt worse. DO NOT rub skin - it could make it worse! Try to remove any tentacles attached to skin, if possible... but DO NOT use bare hands... use a towel or tweezers. Soak sting or make a paste (below) to help relieve pain: tropical jellyfish - soak area in vinegar stingray or stonefish - soak area in hot water Cover sting with sterile bandage or gauze, or clean cloth. Call local emergency number, if necessary. 165 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325To relieve pain from a sea critter sting: Baking Soda Paste - Make a paste of 3 parts baking soda + 1 part warm water and apply to sting site until it dries. Scrape off paste with a knife orcredit card to help remove some of the skin. (Note: two other easy pastesare sand and seawater orflour and seawater . Scrape off as above.) Urine (Pee) - Again, we know this sounds weird... but pee has a history of medical applications and can reduce stinging pain. (Unless you have a uri-nary tract infection, it will be sterile and at least won't do any harm!) SNAKE BITES According to the FDA and the National Institutes of Health, about 8,000people in the U.S. are treated for poisonous snake bites each year.Poisonous snakes have triangular heads, slit-like pupils, and two long fangswhich make puncture wounds at end of each row of teeth. Non-poisonoussnake bites leave two rows of teeth marks but no puncture wounds, butdon't use bite mark to determine type since swelling may hide wounds. Things to watch for... Puncture and/or bite marks Pain and SwellingNausea and pukingDifficulty breathing or swallowingPossible Allergic reaction - Weakness or dizziness; redness or discoloration at bite; trouble breathing; signs of shock (pale, cold, drowsy, etc.) What to do... If possible, try to identify type or color of snake but don't put yourself in danger! Wash bite wound with soap and water. Keep bitten body part below heart level, if possible. Call emergency number or animal control, if necessary. If bite is from a Poisonous snake, also do this... Remove constrictive items (like rings or watches) sinceswelling may occur. DO NOT apply tourniquet or ice. Monitor breathing and make sure airway is open. Keep victim still to slow down circulation of venom. DO NOT let victim eat or drink anything or take medica-tion since it could interfere with emergency treatment. 166 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325DO NOT use \"cut and suck\" method! Contact the Poison Center at 1-800-222-1222 Get to a doctor or hospital as soon as possible to receive antivenom. The worst effects may not be felt for hours after a bite from most poison- ous North American snakes, but it is best if antivenom is given as quicklyas possible (or at least within 12-24 hours of the bite). SPIDER BITES, SCORPION STINGS , &T ICKS There are only a dozen or so spiders that can actually cause symptoms orside effects to humans with a bite -- the most serious are black widows andbrown recluses. Tarantulas are also a little serious but do not cause extremereactions and rarely will kill a human. Scorpions will sting anything that touches them. Their sting feels like a small electrical shock (almost like a hot needle). Scorpions whip their tailsover their body and zap their enemy many times, but it happens so quick itmay only feel like one sting. You may think ticks are insects but they're actually bloodsucking arach- nids. Adult ticks have eight legs and two body segments just like spiders,mites and chiggers. Ticks grab onto a host (animals or people walkingthrough brush) and sink their harpoon-like barbed mouth and head into thehost's skin to dine until they're full of blood. Then they drop off and waitfor the next meal to pass by. Since ticks feast on one spot for days, they canspread bacteria and diseases from host to host (like from animals tohumans) - even by touching them. The main threat of both spiders and scorpions is the allergic reaction humans have to their bite or sting so symptoms need to be watched care-fully. Obviously the main threat of ticks is the risk of illness or disease (likelyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever or tick paralysis). Things to watch for... Bite or sting mark or ticks Pain or burning feelingRedness or Swelling or RashStomach pain or pukingFlu-like symptoms - fever, dizziness, weakness, headache, body aches, swollen lymph nodes, etc. Change in skin color or bruising or rash (may look kind of like a bulls-eye) Possible Allergic reactions - trouble breathing or 167 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325swallowing, signs of shock (pale, cold, etc.) What to do for SPIDERS and SCORPIONS... Try to identify the type of spider or scorpion, but don't put yourself in danger! Wash bite wound with soap and water or rubbing alcohol. Apply a cold pack (a baggie or cloth with ice will work). Get to a doctor or hospital to get antivenom (if a poison-ous spider / scorpion) or call the Poison Center at 1-800-222-1222 or local emergency number, if necessary. Watch for allergic reactions or infections for several days. What to do for TICKS... Key things are to find a tick before it feasts for days and to remove a tickslowly with head intact so it doesn't spew bacteria into the blood stream. DONOT use petroleum jelly, liquid soap, nail polish orheat - they don't work! Use tweezers or commercial tick remover (or at leastcover fingers with a tissue). Grasp tick close to skin where head is buried - don'tsqueeze it! Slowly pull tick straight up until skin puckers (may takeseveral seconds but tick will loosen it's barbs and let go). DONOT throw tick away - may need it tested! Put it inzippered baggie with moist paper towel, date it, and put inrefrigerator. Wash bite wound and tweezers with soap and water. Call local health department or vet to ask if tick needs tobe identified or tested. If not, throw away baggie. Watch for rash, infection or symptoms for a week or so. Things to do to avoid ticks ... Wear light-colored pants & long-sleeve shirt (to see ticks),a hat (to keep out of hair) and tuck in (pants in socks +shirt in pants). Do full body checks couple times a day during tick season. Use tick repellent with DEET.

BLEEDING ? CONTROLLING BLEEDING Things to watch for... Source of bleeding Pain and/or SwellingObject sticking out or stuck in wound (like a piece of metal or glass or a bullet) Shock (pale, cold or clammy, drowsy, weak or rapid pulse, etc.) What to do... Be aware of your surroundings and be prepared to call for help. ( see TIPSONCALLING 9-1-1 FOR AMBULANCE ) If there IS object sticking out of wound (or possibly deep inside): Put thick soft pads around the object (or around wound). Gently try to apply pressure to help stop the bleeding. DO NOT try to remove or press on the object! Carefully wrap with a roller bandage to hold thick pads around the object. Get medical attention immediately! If there is NO object sticking out of the wound: Be careful since there might be something inside wound. Cover wound with a clean cloth or sterile gauze pad andpress firmly against the wound... and follow above stepsif victim has an object inside the wound. If cloth or gauze becomes soaked with blood, DONOTremove it! Keep adding new dressings on top of old ones. Carefully elevate injured body part above the level of vic-tim's heart but be aware...there may be broken bones. Keep applying pressure on dressings until bleeding stops. Use firm roller bandage to cover gauze or cloth dressings. If bleeding won't stop: Put pressure on nearby artery to help slow blood flow Arm - press inside upper arm, between shoulder & elbow Leg - press area where leg joins front of the hip (groin) 169 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325INTERNAL BLEEDING Minor internal bleeding is like a bruise - a vein, artery or capillary can break or rupture spewing blood under the skin. A more serious form of internalbleeding can be caused by a major fall, crushing accident or a blow to thehead. It's very hard to tell if a person is suffering from internal bleedingsince there may not be blood outside the body. Symptoms don't alwaysappear right away but can be life-threatening so get medical help quickly. Things to watch for... Abdominal pain or tenderness Pain and/or Swelling in abdomen (around belly button) Shock (pale, cold or clammy, drowsy, weak or rapid pulse, etc.) Either a fast or slow pulseCoughing up bright, foamy blood (if dark red means been bleeding inside for a while) Blood shows up in victim's pee, poop or puke What to do... Be aware of surroundings and call for an ambulance. Don't move victim if injuries to head, neck or spine. Check ABCs... Airway, Breathing &Circulation . Stay with victim until help arrives. (Please review HEAD, NECK &SPINE INJURIES and SHOCK too) NOSEBLEEDS What to do... Have the person sit down, lean forward and pinch the softpart of the nose for about 10 minutes. Put an icepack or cold compress on the bridge of the nose. SLASHED OR SEVERED BODY PARTS /AMPUTATION What to do... Keep direct pressure on the stump to stop the bleeding. Find body part, if possible, and wrap in gauze or cleancloth. Put body part in an airtight plastic bag, put bag in icewater and take it to the hospital with the victim. 170 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... BREATHING PROBLEMS ? ASTHMA ATTACK Things to watch for... Noisy breathing or wheezing Difficulty in breathing or speakingBlueness of skin, lips and fingertips or nails What to do... Make sure victim has nothing in mouth (open airway). Have victim sit up straight to make breathing easier. If victim has medication, or an inhaler, have them take it. Try to keep victim and yourself calm. If attack is severe, call for ambulance or emergency help. Some tips that could possibly help slow down an asthma attack: (Note: These tips are NOT to be used as a replacement for medical atten- tion but could be helpful in the early stages of an asthma attack.) Pursed lip breathing - At the first sign of an attack, breathe in deeply through nose and out through mouth with lips pursed (like blowing up aballoon). It will help relax the body and may get rid of stale air in lungs. Drink a warm liquid or caffeine - Drinking one or two cups of coffee or tea that have caffeine could help relax the bronchial tubes. If you decide todrink a soda, do not use ice since cold could possibly trigger an attack - thewarmer the better. For more information about Asthma visit the CDC NCEH' s Air Pollution and Respiratory web site at www.cdc.gov/asthma/ RESCUE BREATHING (NOT BREATHING ) Rescue breathing (or mouth-to-mouth resuscitation) should only be donewhen the victim is not breathing on his or her own. Make sure the victim isnot choking on anything like vomit, blood or food (if so, see CHOKING) and check them using the ABCs... Airway , Breathing , and Circulation ! Continued on next page ... 171 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Things to watch for... Grabbing at throat Can't feel, see or hear any breathsTrouble breathing or talkingBluish color of skin, lips, fingertips/nails, and earlobes What to do... BE AWARE... make sure there's no head or neck injury first! Carefully move victim so they are flat on their back. If possible, grab a disposable mouth-to-mouth or CPRface shield. Tilt adult's head all the way back and lift chin. (Be carefulwith child's or infant's head... just tilt it a little bit!) Watch chest, listen, and feel for breathing for 5 seconds. If victim is NOT breathing begin Rescue Breathing ... Pinch victim's nose shut. Open your mouth wide to make a tight seal around the victim's mouth. (Note: For infant , cover both mouth and nose with your mouth.) Give victim 2 slow breaths to make their chest rise. Check for pulse using your fingers in soft spot between throat and the muscle on side of neck for 5-10 seconds. Continue Rescue Breathing if victim has a pulse but is not breathing... Adult - give 1 breath every 5 seconds. Child or Infant - give 1 breath every 3 seconds. Check pulse and breathing every minute until victim isbreathing on their own. ...also... If victim pukes... turn them gently on their side, wipe mouth clean, turn them back and continue RescueBreathing until they are breathing on their own. NOTE: If victim NOT breathing and DOES NOT have pulse, see HEART EMERGENCIES for tips on GivingCPR (see page 189)! 172 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... BROKEN OR FRACTURED BONES ? A fracture is the same as a break and can range from a small chip to a bone that breaks through the skin. If you suspect a fracture, use a splint to keepthe victim from moving too much and get professional help... and let thetrained medical experts decide what is wrong! Also review HEAD, NECKOR SPINE INJURIES, if needed. Things to watch for... Pain, bruising or swelling BleedingLimb or area moves strange or looks strangeShock (pale, cold or clammy, weak or rapid pulse, etc.) What to do... DO NOT move bone or try to straighten limb if bone breaks through skin! Try not to move the victim unless they are in danger. Have victim sit or lie down to rest the injured part. If possible, raise or elevate the injured part. Put a cold compress or ice pack on injury to reduceswelling. If help is delayed or you need to move victim, splint injurythe same way it was found. Be prepared to call an ambulance, if necessary. TIPS ON SPLINTING A splint can be made using magazines, newspapers, a pillow, wood, etc. Some basic tips on splinting include... ... always splint an injury the same way it was found ... make sure item being used is longer than the broken bone... use cloth strips, neck ties, thin rope, etc. for ties... put something soft between the splint and the bone... tie splint above and below the break... but not too tight! ... touch area below the splint and ask victim if they can feel it -- if not, loosen ties. ... keep the victim warm with a blanket or whatever is available. 173 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... BURNS ? Depending on how bad a burn is will determine what it is called: First degree burns - hurts only top layer of skin; turns pink or red; some pain and swelling; no blisters (usually from sun, chemicals, or touchingsomething hot) Second degree burns - hurts the two upper layers of skin; very painful and causes swelling that lasts several days; blisters and possibly scars (usuallyfrom deep sunburn, chemicals, fire or hot liquid spills) Third degree burns - hurts all skin layers and possibly tissue; charred, raw or oozing areas; destroys cells that form new skin; nerve cells are destroyedand can take months to heal (usually from being exposed to fire or electri-cal shock for a long time). Can cause severe loss of fluids, shock and death. BURNS FROM FIRE OR HOT LIQUIDS Things to watch for... Skin is red and swollen Blisters may open and ooze clear or yellowish fluidMinor to Severe Pain What to do... BE AWARE... and don't put yourself in danger! Stop the burning by putting out flames and move victim from source of the burn. (If victim is on fire, tell them toSTOP, DROP and ROLL!) Cool burn by using large amounts of running cool water for about 10 minutes. For hard to reach areas, wet a cloth,towel or sheet and carefully keep adding water. Try to remove clothing, rings or jewelry in case ofswelling. (DO NOT remove items stuck to burned areas!) Cover burn with a sterile bandage or clean cloth. (Try tokeep fingers and toes separated with bandage or cloth.) Seek medical attention, if necessary. Things you should NOT do... DO NOT break any blisters! DO NOT remove any item that sticks to skin! 174 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325DO NOT apply any creams, oils or lotions to the burns - wait for the medical experts! CHEMICAL BURNS Also see TERRORISM(in Section 2) for information, signs & symptoms,and treatment for several chemical agents in liquid, solid or aerosol formsthat may cause chemical burns. Things to watch for... Rash or blisters Trouble breathingDizziness or headacheName of the chemical What to do... Rinse area with cool running water at least 15 minutes. Remove any clothing, rings or jewelry that may have the chemical on it. Make note of chemical name for medical staff or hospital. ELECTRICAL BURNS Things to watch for... Electrical appliances or wires Downed power linesSparks and/or crackling noisesVictim may have muscle spasms or tremblingLightning during a storm What to do... BE AWARE... don't put yourself in danger! If power line is down, wait for Fire Department or Power Company. DO NOT go near victim until power is OFF! Pull plug atwall outlet or shut off breaker. Once off, okay to touch victim. If victim struck by lightning, they can be touched safely! Check ABCs ... Airway, Breathing, &Circulation if vic- tim is passed out - you may need to do Rescue Breathingor CPR. (see BREATHING PROBLEMS and HEART PROBLEMS) Continued on next page ... 175 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Don't move victim unless they are in danger. There should be 2 wounds - usually have enter and exit burns. DO NOT try to cool the burn with anything. Cover burn with a dry sterile bandage or clean cloth. Seek medical attention, if necessary. SUNBURN Sunblocks and lotions should be applied at least 20 minutes BEFORE going in the sun so it can be absorbed into skin layers, especially on your littleones! Use one with SPF 30 or higher and 3 or 4 star UV Aprotection. Remember... dark colors absorb heat so best to wear light or white colors to reflect sunlight. And you can get sunburned on cloudy days just aseasily as sunny days - if you can see a shadow, you're still catching somerays. Things to watch out for... Blisters or bubbles on the skin Swelling or pain What to do... Cool the burn by using cool cloths or pure aloe vera gel. Get out of sun or cover up to avoid further damage. Take care of blisters by loosely covering them and don't pick at them! To help relieve the pain from a sunburn if NO blisters exist: Aloe vera - Break open a fresh leaf or use 96-100% pure aloe gel. Baking soda - Add 1/2 cup baking soda to a warm bath and soak for half an hour. Vinegar - Put some regular or cider vinegar on a cloth and apply to sun- burned area. Whole milk - Apply a cool compress soaked in whole milk to the area. 176 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... CHOKING ? Things to watch for... Trouble breathing Coughing or choking for several minutesGripping the throat with one or both handsHigh-pitched wheezingBluish color of skin, lips, fingertips/nails, and earlobes ATTENTION : There are TWO separate \" What to do... \" parts here... one for ADULTS & CHILDREN (below) and one for INFANTS (see next page)! What to do... for ADULTS & CHILDREN (Children over age 1) Tell victim to try and cough it out. Ask \"are you choking?\" If victim nods yes, tell him/her you are going to help. Stand behind victim, wrap your arms around him/her andplace your fist (thumb side in) just above victim's bellybutton well below the breastbone. Grab the fist with your other hand and give quick, upwardthrusts into their abdomen. Continue giving thrusts until the object is coughed out andvictim can breathe, cough or talk or until he/she stopsresponding or passes out. If ADULT or CHILD stops responding or passes out: Yell for help, check breathing, and position victim on aflat surface so you can begin CPR (30 compressions and 2breaths) - or do Hands-only CPR - to help force object out. Find hand position in center of chest over breastbone FOR ADULTS - see illustration 3-1 on page 190 FOR CHILDREN - see illustration 3-2 on page 191 Begin chest compressions: ADULTS - Using both hands, compress chest 30 times. CHILDREN - Using one hand, compress chest 30 times. Check mouth for object after every set of 30 compressions then give 2 rescue breaths (if doing). After 5 sets, call 911. Continue doing 30:2 sets until victim moves, coughs ortalks or help arrives. 177 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What to do... for INFANTS (Newborn to age 1) If infant stops breathing, have someone call an ambulance. Turn infant face down on your forearm and support its head with that hand -- hold at angle so it's head is lowerthan chest. (May want to brace arm holding infant againstyour thigh.) Give 5 back blows between infants' shoulder blades withthe heel of your other hand. If no object comes out, turn infant over so it is facing upon your forearm (still at an angle so head lower than chest)-- use your first two fingers to find the center of the breastbone on infant's chest. Give 5 thrusts to infant's chest using only 2 fingers ! (Each thrust should be 1\u00bd inches [3.81 cm] deep!) Repeat steps until infant can breath, cough, or cry or untilhe/she stops responding or passes out. If INFANT stops responding or passes out: Place infant on a firm, flat surface above ground (like on a table or counter) so you can begin Infant CPR. Yell for help and check infant's breathing. Find finger position in center of chest over breastbone[see illustration 3-3 on page 192] Using 2 fingers only , compress chest 30 times. Open the airway and check mouth for object(s). If you see it, take it out. Give 2 breaths ... and remember, cover both mouth andnose on Infants! Repeat giving sets of 30 compressions and 2 rescuebreaths, checking the mouth for objects. After 5 sets, call911 (if they haven't already been called). Continue doing 30:2 sets until infant starts to respond orhelp arrives. 178 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... COLD-RELATED ILLNESSES ? FROSTBITE Frostbite (or frostnip which is the early stages of frostbite) is when certain parts of your body are exposed to severe or extreme cold - mainly yourfingers, toes, ears, cheeks and nose. Freezing temperatures can form icecrystals in the fluids in and around cells in your body. This damages anddries out cell tissues and membranes, and extreme cases can impact deepnerves, muscles or even bones... or even lead to the loss of a limb. Things to watch for... Skin appears white and waxy Numbness or no feeling in that areaPossible blisters What to do... Handle area gently; DO NOT rub it! Remove tight or constrictive clothing (gloves, boots, socks, etc.) and any jewelry. Warm gently using body heat or soaking area in warmwater (between 100-105 degrees Fahrenheit / between 38-41 degrees Celsius) until area is red and feels warm.(Person may feel a burning sensation or pain as the areawarms back up.) Loosely bandage area with dry, sterile dressing or cloth. If fingers or toes are frostbitten, separate them with sterilegauze or clean cloth. Try not to break any blisters. Things you should NOT do... DO NOT rub or massage the area since this may cause damage to cells! DO NOT rub snow on the area! DO NOT try to warm with dry radiant heat (meaning don'twarm with a blow-dryer or hold in front of fire or hotstove). Using warm water is best. DO NOT try to thaw a frostbitten body part if it has achance of re-freezing (if you are stuck in the wilderness)since this could cause more damage. 179 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325HYPOTHERMIA Hypothermia starts setting in when your body core (the vital organs - heart, lungs, and kidneys) drops below 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degreesCelsius). When exposed to extreme cold for a long time, your brain beginsto shut down certain bodily functions to save internal heat for the core. Things to watch for... Shivering and numbness Confusion or dizzinessStumbling and weaknessSlow or slurred speechShock (pale, cold or clammy, weak or rapid pulse, etc.) What to do... Gently move victim to a warm place. Check breathing and pulse ( ABCs... Airway, Breathing, &Circulation ). Handle victim gently and DO NOT rub body or limbs. Remove any wet clothing and replace with dry clothing and/or blankets. If possible, place victim in a sleeping bag, especially if inthe wilderness. (Note: Your body heat can help heat victim... so cuddle up - if victim says it's okay!) Cover the head and neck with a hat or part of a blanket(75% of the body's heat is lost through top of the head). DO NOT WARM VICTIM TOO QUICKLY , such as put-ting them in warm water! (If the body warms too fast, itcan dump cold blood into the heart and body core causinga possible heart attack or drop in body temperature.) If hot water bottles or hot packs are used, wrap in a towelor blanket first then place on side of the chest or on groin(hip) area. (If heat is put on arms or legs then blood couldbe drawn away from body core - keep heat on the core!) Let victim sip a warm, sweet, nonalcoholic drink. Keep watching victim's ABCs... Things you should NOT do... DO NOT rub or massage the victims limbs! DO NOT put victim in a hot bath! It will warm him/her TOO quickly. DO NOT put hot packs on arms or legs... put them againstthe body (chest or groin area). 180 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... CONVULSIONS & S EIZURES ? Convulsions are usually brought on by a high fever, poisoning or injury and is basically a violent seizure (see \"Things to watch for...\") . Seizures are usually related to epilepsy (also known as seizure disorder since seizures occur repeatedly during person's life), and about 2 millionAmericans and 300,000 Canadians suffer from epilepsy. There are manytypes and forms of seizures that range from a short episode of blank staringto convulsions -- and most seizures only last from 1-3 minutes or less. Things to watch for... Victim falls to floor and shakes or twitches in the arms, legs or body for a minute or longer Blank staring or vacant expression and minor twitch- ing of the face or jerking of the hand (usually a mild epileptic seizure) Loss of body fluids or functions (drooling, may pee or poop) No memory of what happened, confusion What to do... Have someone call for an ambulance, esp. if victim was poisoned or injured or if seizure lasts over 3-5 minutes. Stay calm... you can't stop the convulsion or seizure. DO NOT put anything between teeth or in mouth! Move things that could hurt or fall on victim. Put something soft under victim's head, if possible. When convulsion or seizure is over, help roll victim on totheir side to keep an open airway. Look for any other injuries and keep checking ABCs... Airway, Breathing &Circulation . Stay with victim until help arrives and try to calm them. If victim is epileptic: Ask if the victim takes any medications for seizures and help him/her take them according to the instructions. Also may want to review TERRORISM(in Section 2) for information, signs & symptoms, and treatment for several chemical agents that may causeconvulsions. 181 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... DIZZINESS & F AINTING ? DIZZINESS Dizziness is a symptom, usually combined with feeling sick to the stomach, sweating, and feeling some kind of movement that really isn't there. Things to watch for... If dizzy feeling does not pass quickly or is really bad Fainting or passing outVapors, mist or strange smells What to do... Have victim sit or lie down and close their eyes or focus on a nearby object that is not moving. Tell victim to try to keep their head still. FAINTING Fainting is a temporary loss of consciousness (passes out) and may indicatea more serious condition. It's usually caused due to a lack of oxygenatedblood to the brain. Be aware several types of injuries could cause fainting. Things to watch for... Visible injuries like bleeding from the ears or a bite or sting Pupils are enlarged or very small (if different sizes, it could be a stroke) Vapors, mist or strange smellsBluish color of skin, lips, fingertips or nails (may not be getting air - see BREATHINGPROBLEMS ) What to do... If victim is still passed out, put victim on their side to keep an open airway. Once victim is awake, gently roll them onto their back. Prop feet and the lower part of legs up with pillows orsomething (only if victim is not hurt). Loosen any tight clothing, esp. around neck and waist. Check ABCs... Airway, Breathing &Circulation . Make sure victim rests before trying to get up. If necessary, contact doctor if symptoms persist. 182 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... DROWNING ? Things to watch for... Signs of breathing Bluish color of skin, lips, fingertips or nails (may not be getting air) Pulse What to do... Have someone call for an ambulance. Once victim is out of the water, check ABCs... Airway, Breathing &Circulation . Check to see if there are any injuries or objects in mouth. If victim is not breathing or has no pulse, begin Rescue Breathing and/or CPR. (see BREATHING PROBLEMS for Rescue Breathing and HEART PROBLEMS for CPR) Once victim starts breathing on their own, cover with a blanket or dry towels to keep warm and have them layon their side for a while. Stay with victim at all times until medical help arrives. 183 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... EARINJURIES ? FOREIGN OBJECT IN EAR If something crawls in or gets stuck in the ear... Keep victim calm and have them sit down with head tilted sideways. Use a flashlight to try to see object in ear... if a bug - turn ear up toward sun or flashlight - most bugs are drawn to light so it might crawl out on it's own if a loose item - tilt head and try to shake it out if still in but see it -IF you see item, gently try to remove with tweezers, but DONOT do this if victim is squirmingor item is deep in ear - you could damage the eardrum! Get medical help if not successful or can't visuallylocate object (doctors have special tools for ears). NOISE-INDUCED HEARING LOSS (NIHL) Millions of people are exposed to hazardous sound levels daily. Loudimpulse noise (like an explosion) or loud continuous noise at work or playdamage the delicate hair cells of the inner ear and the hearing nerve. Sometimes damage can be temporary - like after a concert when your ears ring for a bit then go back to normal. But repeated loud noise or a massiveimpulse noise could lead to permanent damage - damage that cannot bereversed. Be aware certain types of disasters like tornadoes, a terrorist'sbomb, or even hurricanes can cause a form of hearing loss. Things to watch for... Bombs, tornadoes, power tools, loud music, jet ski, etc. Having to shout to be heard over noise (too loud)Ringing or buzzing in ears What to do... Avoid loud situations or at least wear ear plugs or muffs. Have hearing tested annually (esp. if you work around loud noises) Protect children's ears. (Note: using cotton isn't enough.)

EYEINJURIES ? Things to watch for... Severe or constant pain or burning Object stuck in the eye (like a piece of metal or glass) Redness and swellingBlurry vision, trouble keeping eye open, light sensitiveVapors or fumes in the airIf injury is from a chemical, make a note of the name for Poison Control if possible What to do... Avoid rubbing eye since this can cause more damage. Have victim sit down with their head tilted backwards. Wash hands before touching eye area. If the injury is a loose foreign object: Gently separate eyelids to see if you can locate a foreign object - can try removing it by wiping gently with damptissue. Ask victim if he/she wears contact lenses, and if so, askhim or her to remove them. Have victim lean over sink or lie on back, hold eye open,and gently flush eye with lukewarm water or a saline solu-tion. Get medical help if you are not successful. If there is an object sticking out of the eye: Put thick soft pads around the object that is sticking out. DO NOT try to remove or press on the object! Carefully wrap with a roller bandage to hold thick padsaround the object. Get medical attention immediately! If injury is from a blow to the eye: Apply an icepack to reduce pain and swelling. Seek medical attention if damage to eye or blurred vision. Continued on next page... 185 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325If the injury is from a chemical: Call your local Poison Control Center (or 1-800-222-1222 in the U.S.) and have name of chemical handy, if possible. If victim is wearing contact lenses, ask Poison Control if they should be removed and whether to keep or dispose of them ! If okay and able to take out, ask victim to remove lenses. Have victim lean over sink, lie down, or get in shower -hold eye(s) open, and gently flush with lukewarm waterfor at least 15 minutes. (If only one eye has chemical in it,make sure head is turned so it doesn't pour into the othereye.) Tell victim to roll eyeball(s) around while flushing towash entire eye. DO NOT press or rub the eyes! May want to cover eyes with clean dressing & bandagesbut ask Poison Control or check label on bottle. For exam-ple, if chemical is mustard gas (sulfur mustard) youshould not cover eyes ... but wear shades to protect them. Get medical attention immediately! Things you should NOT do... DO NOT try to remove an object that is stuck into the eye! DO NOT try to remove their contacts (if any)... let the victim do it! DO NOT try to move the eyeball if it comes out of thesocket! Things you SHOULD do... Protect your eyes with safety glasses or goggles whenplaying sports or working with tools or chemicals ... andwear shades during the day (to help reduce UV exposure). When an eye injury occurs, have an ophthalmologist (aneye physician and surgeon) examine it as soon as possible. You may not be realize how serious an injury is at first. Also may want to review TERRORISM(in Section 2)for information, signs & symptoms, and treatment on several chemical and biological agents thatmay cause eye injuries or discomfort. 186 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about...

Do not try to move victim unless they are in extreme dan- ger and support victim's head and neck during movement. Have someone call an ambulance immediately! Check to see if victim is alert and check ABCs... Airway , Breathing & Circulation ... and if you need to give them Rescue Breathing or CPR... DO NOT tilt their head back! (see BREATHING PROBLEMS for Rescue Breathing and HEART PROBLEMS for CPR) Try to control any bleeding using direct pressure. (see BLEEDING) If victim is passed out, hold their head gently betweenyour hands while waiting for help to arrive. This will keepthem from moving suddenly when/if they wake up. 187 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... HEART PROBLEMS ? Heart attacks can kill and most victims die within 2 hours of the first few symptoms. Most people deny they are having a heart attack - even if theyhave chest pains and shortness of breath... but DON'T take any chances! Aheart attack can lead to Cardiac Arrest . Cardiac arrest means that the heart stops beating and causes victim to pass out followed by no sign of breathing and no pulse. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is used to help pump oxygenated blood through the body to the brain until the medical experts arrive. Conventional CPR - combines chest compressions and Rescue Breathing using C-A-B Hands-only CPR - hard and fast chest compressions (100 per minute ~ do it to the beat of that song \"Staying Alive\"by the Bee Gees) Hands-only CPR should only be used on an adult that suddenly collapses. It should not be used on children and infants or on adults whose cardiacarrest is from respiratory causes (like near-drowning or a drug overdose).Those victims all benefit from combined CPR and Rescue Breathing. Please note : CPR is now C-A-B .. Compressions - Airway - Breathing! HEART ATTACK Things to watch for... Chest pain that can spread to shoulder, arm, or jaw Shortness of breath or trouble breathing Strange pulse (faster or slower than normal or sporadic) Pale or bluish skin color What to do... Tell victim to STOP what they're doing, sit down and rest. Call for an ambulance immediately! Loosen any tight clothing, esp. around neck and waist. Ask victim if they are taking any prescribed medicines for their heart... and if they do, have them take it! Take a couple of pure aspirin, if available. Watch victim's breathing and be prepared to give CPR. 188 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325189 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325CARDIAC ARREST (GIVING CPR) Main thing is do compressions to keep blood moving until help arrives! Things to watch for... Not responding or passed out Not breathing and no pulseBroken bones or chest, head, neck or spine injuries What to do... Yell for help. Send someone to call 9-1-1 and get an AED Take about 5-10 seconds to check for pulse and breathing. If no pulse or normal breathing is detected, begin CPR: Note: CPR steps are now C-A-B = Compressions- Airway- Breathing Circulation; Perform Chest Compressions Find hand position in center of chest over breastbone - see illustrations on next 3 pages... FOR ADULTS - [see illustration 3-1 on page 190] FOR CHILDREN - [see illustration 3-2 on page 191] FOR INFANTS - [see illustration 3-3 on page 192] Begin chest compressions (at least 100 compressions per minute) using the following guidelines: ADULTS - Using both hands, compress chest 30 times. CHILDREN - Using one hand, compress chest 30 times. INFANTS - Using 2 fingers , compress chest 30 times. Allow chest to recoil completely after each compression. Airway; Open Airway Tilt head all the way back and lift chin. (Be careful with child's or infant's head... just tilt a little bit!) Maintain airway Breathing; Breaths Give victim 2 breaths (1 second each). If not comfortablegiving rescue breaths or have trouble making chest risewithin 10 seconds, keep doing compressions. Push hard &push fast to keep blood moving through victim! Repeat 30 chest compressions (and 2 breaths, if doing)until an AEDor medical help arrives or victim recovers. If victim recovers (starts breathing or pukes and pulseresumes), turn victim onto their side to keep airway open. 190 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325CPR P OSITION FOR ADULTS (9 YEARS & OLDER ) Illustration 3-1 1.

HEAT-RELATED ILLNESSES ? There are two major types of heat illness - HEAT EXHAUSTION and HEATSTROKE . If heat exhaustion is left untreated it can lead to heat stroke. Both conditions are serious, however, heat stroke is a major medical emergency and getting victim's body temperature cooled down is more critical than getting fluids in their body. Heat stroke can lead to death. Things to watch for... Heat Cramps Muscle pains and spasms (usually first sign that body's having trouble with the heat) Heat Exhaustion Cool, clammy, or pale skinLight-headed or dizzy and weakRacing heartSick to the stomach (nausea)Very thirsty or heavy sweating (sometimes) Heat Stroke (also called Sunstroke) Very hot and dry skinLight-headed or dizzyConfusion, drowsiness or faintingRapid breathing and rapid heartbeatConvulsions, passes out or slips into a coma What to do... Get victim to a cool or shady place and rest. Lightly stretch or massage muscles to relieve cramps. Loosen clothing around waist and neck to improve circu- lation and remove sweaty clothes. Cool down victim's body - put wet cloths on victim's face,neck and skin and keep adding cool water to cloth... or ifoutdoors, use hose or stream. Also, fan the victim or getinside air-conditioned place. Have victim sip cool water (NO alcohol - it dehydrates!) If victim refuses water, pukes or starts to pass out: Call for an ambulance or call 9-1-1. Continued on next page... 193 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Put victim on their side to keep airway open. Keep cooling down their body by placing ice or cold cloths on wrists, neck, armpits, and groin area (where legmeets the hip) or keep adding water to cloths. Also fan thevictim. Check victim's ABCs... Airway, Breathing, & Circulation . Stay with victim until medical help arrives. Remember, HEAT STROKE (also known as sunstroke) is a medical emergency and can cause the victim to slip into a coma -- getting a victim'sbody temperature cooled down is more important than getting fluids in theirbody! 194 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... INFECTION ? It is important to be very careful and protect yourself against the spread of disease or infection when caring for an open wound or a wound that isbleeding. (Review TIPS ON REDUCINGTHESPREADOF GERMS OR DISEASES at beginning of this section) INFECTION Germs are the main cause of an infection so whenever you perform first aidon anyone (including yourself), there is always a chance of spreading germsor diseases. All injuries - from tiny cuts to massive wounds - must be cleaned immediately to reduce the chances of infection! And keep cleaning a wound until it is completely healed. Things to watch for... Sore or wound is red and swollen or has red streaks Sore or wound is warm or painfulWound may open and ooze clear or yellowish fluidFever or muscle aches or stiffness in the neck What to do... ALWAYS wash your hands before and after caring for a wound... even if it's your own! Immediately wash minor wounds with soap and water orrinse with hydrogen peroxide. Cover wound with sterile bandage or gauze -- best to cleanand change bandage daily. An open wound is a doorwayfor germs and infection to get inside the body. Use an antibiotic cream or gel to help disinfect the woundand kill germs. (Note: don't use cream or gel if wound is from a bite since it might seal wound and keep it fromdraining.) Boost your immune system to help fight infection (liketaking astragalus, Vitamin C, garlic, mushrooms, zinc, anda good multiple vitamin + mineral supplement, etc. - butcheck with your doctor first if taking any prescriptionmedications). If infection gets worse, you may want to see a doctor. Also may want to review INFECTIOUSDISEASESon next page. 195 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325What are YOU gonna do about... INFECTIOUS DISEASES ? The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend the body against attacks by foreign invaders suchas bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi. Because the human body providesan ideal environment for many microbes, they try to break in. It is theimmune system's job to keep them out or, failing that, to seek out anddestroy them. 9 But if a person's immune system is weak or damaged, germs and infection can settle in, leading to illness or possibly death. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, infectious diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. And with air travel andinternational trade, infectious microbes are carried across borders every dayby humans, animals, insects and contaminated foods. Some \"old\" diseases like malaria, Ebola and measles are found in certain parts of the world, but \"new\" diseases like HIV/AIDS and West Nile arespreading around the globe. Plus every year there's some form of influenzaand the common cold that spreads and affects people. There are many infectious diseases so we chose a few you may have heard of before ( flu, Ebola , MERS , C. diff and staph ). We briefly describe each illness, then summarize \"How they spread\" and \"What to do\" for all ofthem with links at the end. Educate yourself about I.D.s and listen to officials for advice on how to protect yourself and your loved ones. Influenza (flu) is a respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus that affects millions of people each year. Flu causes about 250,000 - 500,000deaths worldwide every year, and a major outbreak (called a pandemic)could increase the death toll dramatically. The best way to prevent the fluis to boost your immune system and get vaccinated, esp people with weak-ened immune systems. There are several antivirals approved for treatment. There are 3 types of flu viruses: A, B, and C. Influenza A viruses can infect humans and mammals (including pigs, horses and seals) but wild birds arethe natural host. Typically, wild birds don't get sick but A viruses can bedeadly to domestic chickens and turkeys. Influenza B viruses are normallyfound only in humans and generally don't cause severe widespread illness,while Influenza C viruses cause mild illness in humans. Since strains can mutate or cross over to other species, it could lead to wide- spread illness and death. The worst influenza A outbreak was the Spanishflu pandemic of 1918-1919 that may have killed up to 50 million peopleworldwide. 196 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Things to watch for flu (seasonal, avian, H1N1, etc.)... Possible symptoms - fever (usually high), headache, sore throat, cough, runny nose, body aches, weakness, diar-rhea or puking (more common in children) Possible complications - bacterial pneumonia (lung inflammation), shortness of breath or severe breathing problems, eye infections (avian flu), pneumonia, hospi-talization or death According to a recent worst-case scenario outlined by the World Bank, a flu pandemic of avian or other origin could kill more than 70 million peopleworldwide and lead to a \"major global recession\" costing more than $3 trillion. 10Several vaccines and antivirals are available for treatment, however when a new influenza A virus emerges, a pandemic can occur. Ebola virus species was discovered in 1976 in the Congo near the Ebola River. Since then, outbreaks have appeared sporadically in Africa. Ebola isa severe, often fatal disease in humans and primates and one of numerousViral Hemorrhagic Fevers (read more about VHFs on page 101). There is alot of misinformation with this latest outbreak so we encourage you toplease visit the Ebola websites listed on page 199 to learn more. MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus called \"Middle East Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus\" (MERS-CoV). Normally these viruses cause mild to moder-ate respiratory symptoms (like a cold) but have been linked to pneumonia.The CDC says the incubation period for MERS is 2 to 14 days. So far about30% of people with MERS died and currently there is no vaccine available. Things to watch for (MERS)... Possible symptoms - fever, cough, shortness of breath or trouble breathing, diarrhea, nausea / puking Possible complications - pneumonia, kidney failure or death C. diff (Clostridium difficile or C. difficile ) is a toxin-producing bacterium that causes diarrhea and more serious conditions like colitis(inflammation of the colon). There are many different strains and most areeasily treated. However, a mutated strain called NAP1 (or 027 or BI strain)makes about 20 times more toxins so symptoms are much more severe. Andnow NAP1 is starting to show signs of becoming drug-resistant. Experts estimate C. diff sickens about 500,000 Americans a year and the rate of infection grows by about 10% each year. One out of five people whoget the infection will get it again, and recurrences can be more severe or 197 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325even deadly. Unfortunately C. diff spores can survive on most surfaces for months, and most hospital cleaners won't kill it, but a solution of bleachand water could. Also, alcohol-based hand sanitizers used in many healthfacilities do not work so staff, patients and visitors must wash hands withsoap and water frequently to reduce spreading the infection. Things to watch for (C. diff)... Mild symptoms - watery diarrhea (at least three times a day for 2 or more days with no blood in your poop),possible cramping or minor abdominal pain or tendernessSevere symptoms - watery diarrhea 10 to 15 times a day, abdominal cramping and pain, fever, blood or pus in poop,nausea / pukey, dehydration, loss of appetite, weight loss Note: Not all cases of diarrhea are C. diff, but if you have it several times a day for 2 or more days, see your doctor immediately. Staph (staphylococcus aureus ) are bacteria about a third of the population carries on their skin or in their nose. Bacteria can enter the body through acut, bite or wound and may cause infection. Some strains of staph havebecome drug resistant (called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureusor MRSA ). According to the CDC, staph bacteria are one of the most common causes of skin infections in the U.S. Most infections are minor(like a pimple, bump or boil) and can be treated with antibiotics. However,it can quickly turn into deep, painful abscesses that require surgical draining. Sometimes the bacteria remain confined to the skin, but they canalso penetrate into the body, causing potentially life-threatening infectionsin bones, joints, surgical wounds, the bloodstream, heart valves and lungs. Staph infections, including MRSA, occur most often in hospitals, nursing homes and facilities where people have weakened immune systems. MRSAalso threatens police, firefighters and EMSworkers, school kids and thecommunity in general. In fact, the CDC reports MRSA is now killing moreAmericans each year than AIDS. Things to watch for (staph / MRSA)... Possible symptoms - skin infection that may look like a pimple or boil and can be red, swollen, painful, orhave pus or other drainage Severe - pneumonia, bloodstream or wound infections How infectious diseases spread... Most infectious diseases are spread by close person-to-person contact primarily by touching people or things contaminated with bodily fluids(like pee, poop, sweat, droplets from sneezing, etc.) -- then touching your 198 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325eyes, nose, or mouth. Other diseases (like MRSA) can be spread by sharing personal items like towels or razors or by medical staff using contaminated items like stethoscopes or blood pressure cuffs. Keep in mindsome bacteria or viruses can survive on objects for days, weeks or months. What to do to reduce the spread of infectious diseases... Wash hands often using soap and water or use hand sani-tizer (with at least 60% alcohol in it) to reduce the spreadof germs. But keep in mind sanitizers don't work againstsome bugs so it's best to wash up. Tell healthcare workers and visitors to wash their handsbefore they touch you or your stuff -- don't be timid! If you have a fever, stay home! And wait 24 hours afterfever breaks before you return to work or school. Use antibiotics only when absolutely necessary. Considerboosting your immune system to help fight infections. Sick people should cover mouth and nose with tissue orsleeve when coughing or sneezing, wash hands often, andwear a face mask around others (if very ill). Keep cuts and scrapes clean and covered until healed. Clean counters, doorknobs, fixtures, phones, remotes,nurse call buttons, linens, etc. often with a bleach solution. Don't share silverware, razors, clothing, towels, or bed-ding and wash objects with soap and hot water. Follow doctor's instructions and limit activities outsidehome until fever and symptoms have gone away. For more information, visit the following web sites ...

Things to watch for... Reddened skin or burns Poison on skin, clothing or in the area Bites or marks from insect or animal (see BITES & STINGS) Possible Allergic Reaction - Pain, discoloration or red- ness at site, trouble breathing, signs of shock (pale,cold, drowsy, weak or rapid pulse, etc.) What to do... Be aware - make sure it's safe, then ask what happened. Move victim to safety (away from poison), if necessary. Find the container (if any) or name of the poison and call local Poison Control Center or an ambulance. Remove clothing that may have poison on it - don't pullover head - cut it off. (Seal clothing in a bag then seal thatbag in a bag - ask officials how to dispose of it later.) Flush skin with running water for 10 minutes. Wash area gently with soap and water. (Note: some chem- ical agents don't suggest using soap so may want to ask.) Monitor breathing and watch for any allergic reactions. 200 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325POISON - INHALED BY BREATHING Review TERRORISM(in Section 2) for information, signs & symptoms, and treatment on several poisonous chemical and biological agents that couldbe inhaled from humans' or critters' wet or dried body fluids, from soil, orfrom powders, gas, mist, or vapors. Things to watch for... Strong odors or fumes Find the source of odor or fumes (be aware of threat) Difficulty in breathing or dizzy What to do... Be aware - make sure it's safe...then ask what happened. Get victim out to fresh air. Avoid breathing fumes - open windows & doors (if safe). Call Poison Control Center or an ambulance. If victim isn't breathing consider doing Rescue Breathing - but ONLY if sure poison cannot be spread person to per-son. (see TERRORISM then BREATHING PROBLEMS) POISON - P OISONOUS PLANTS (IVY, OAK, & SUMAC ) Three common poisonous plants found in Canada and the U.S. include: Poison ivy - can grow as a shrub or vine and is found across most of Canada and U.S. It has white or cream-colored berries (or flowers in Spring) andleaves are usually three leaflets to a stem but vary in color, size, shape andtexture around the world. [see illustration 3-4 on page 203] Poison oak - can grow as a shrub or vine and found throughout the West and Southwest (very common in Oregon and California). It also varieswidely in shapes and colors but usually has distinctive shape of an oak leafand red fuzzy berries. The leaves usually come in leaflets of three to a stembut can be in groups of five or more. It is best to learn what it looks likewhere you live. [see illustration 3-5 on page 203] Poison sumac - is a tall shrub or small tree and mostly lives in standing water (like swamps and peat bogs). It has whitish green berries and brightgreen, pointy leaves that grow 6 to 12 leaves in pairs along both sides ofeach stem plus one leaf on each tip. [see illustration 3-6 on page 204] All 3 of these plants have a sap called urushiol [oo-roo-she-ol] which is a sticky, colorless oil that stains things black when exposed to air. This sap isin the leaves, berries, stems and roots of all 3 types and can stick around 201 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325a long time if the sap stays dry (which is why you need to rinse off what- ever gets exposed - yourself, pets, clothing, shoes and laces, tools or camping stuff.) Never burn these plants since smoke can carry the oil andirritate skin, nose or lungs. The rash is caused by your body's reaction to this oil and can show up as quickly as a few hours or take several days ... or never, in some cases, sincesome people don't have reactions to urushiol. It can irritate pets' skin too. Note:the rash itself is not contagious but the OIL (urushiol) is what is transferred by hands, fingers, clothing or fur!! Make sure you wash yourhands after touching the rash to avoid spreading any urushiol. Things to watch for... Inflamed red rash Extremely itchy skin or burning feelingBlistersSwelling or feverAllergic reactions (weakness, dizziness, swelling in mouth or lips, trouble breathing or swallowing) What to do... It is CRITICAL to wash affected area with soap and run- ning water then apply rubbing alcohol using cotton ballson area to remove any excess oil as quickly as possible. Immediately and carefully remove and wash any clothingand/or shoes that got exposed to the poison. (Remember to wash pets, tools or anything else exposed to oil too.) If a rash or sores develop, use calamine lotion or bakingsoda paste several times a day on area. Take an antihistamine to reduce reaction (read label first). If condition gets worse or spreads onto large areas ofbody, eyes or face, see a doctor. To relieve pain from poison ivy, oak, or sumac: Baking soda - Make a paste using 3 parts baking soda with 1 part water and apply on rash. Jewelweed - Studies indicate a plant that grows near poison ivy called jewelweed (has tiny, orange-yellow, horn-shaped flowers with reddish orwhite spots) can be used directly on area that brushed against ivy. Crushjuicy stems in your hands and apply to the area - even if there's no rash yetsince it may help reduce inflammation.

Things to watch for... Burns on the mouth, tongue and lips Stomach painsOpen medicine cabinet; spilled or open containersDifficulty breathingConvulsions or seizuresWeakness or dizzinessPassed out What to do... Stay calm and find out exactly what, how much, and how long ago it was swallowed. Call Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222 in the U.S.)or an ambulance and have bottle or container handy (ifpossible). NEVER give victim anything to eat or drink unless told todo so by Poison Control Center or a Medical profession-al!! If victim pukes, lay them on their side to keep airwayopen. Save a sample of the vomit IF the poison isunknown so the hospital can try to identify it. If victim isn't breathing consider doing Rescue Breathing- but ONLY if sure poison cannot be spread person to per-son. (Check with Poison Control Center. Also review TERRORISM then BREATHING PROBLEMS) The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends parents no longer use syrup of ipecac (pronounced ip'- \u00ee - kak) as a poison treatment interventionin the home. Immediately contact local Poison Control Center for help. If you decide to keep a few 1 ounce bottles in your First Aid Kit ... use ONLY on the advice of a Medical professional or the Poison Control Center !

FEMA also initiates proactive mitigation activities, trains first responders, and manages the NationalFlood Insurance Program. FEMA P ARTNERS : Emergency management is not the result of one government agency alone.FEMA works with many government, non-profit and private sector agencies to assist the public in preparing for, responding to, and recoveringfrom disasters. These players make up the emergency response \"team.\" Local Emergency Management Agencies State &Territory Emergency Management Offices National Emergency Management Organizations Federal-level Partners Partnerships with the Private Sector LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCIES Even the largest, most widespread disasters require a local response. Local emergency management programs are the heart of the nation's emergencymanagement system. FEMA supports them by offering training courses foremergency managers and firefighters, with DHSfunding for emergencyplanning and equipment, by conducting exercises for localities to practiceresponse, and by promoting ways to minimize disasters' effects. FEMA alsobuilds partnerships with mayors, county boards, Tribal governments andofficials who share responsibility for emergency management. Visit your City/County web site to see if there's a link to your Emergency Management, Emergency Services or Homeland Security Office or checkthe Blue Government pages in your city or county phone book. STATE & T ERRITORY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCIES Just like local EMAs above, every state emergency management agency isan integral part of the emergency management system. State and Territoryoffices coordinate federal, state, and local resources for mitigation, pre-paredness, response and recovery operations for citizens with support fromFEMA and it's partners.

Before a disaster, they participate in train-ing exercises and conduct a variety of activities to help the nation preparefor disasters. For example, the Federal Communications Commission andthe Commerce Department's National Weather Service provide on-goingwarning and disaster tracking services. During a catastrophic disaster, FEMA coordinates the federal response, working with 28 federal partnersand the American Red Cross to provide emergency food and water, medicalsupplies and services, search and rescue operations, transportation assis-tance, environmental assessment, and more. The National Disaster MedicalSystem is a partnership set up to provide emergency medical services in adisaster, involving FEMA, Department of Health and Human Services,Department of Defense, the Veterans Administration, as well as public andprivate hospitals across the country. FEMA P ARTNERSHIPS WITH THE PRIV ATE SECTOR FEMA encourages all sectors of society -- from business and industry tovolunteer organizations -- to work together in disaster preparation, responseand recovery. ( Please review APPENDIXA and B.) NATIONAL RESPONSE FRAMEWORK The National Response Framework is a guide that details how the Nation conducts all-hazards response - from the smallest incident to the largestcatastrophe. This document establishes a comprehensive, national, all-hazards approach to domestic incident response. The NRF identifies the key response principles, as well as the roles and structures that organize national response. It describes how communities,States, the Federal Government and private-sector and nongovernmentalpartners apply these principles for a coordinated, effective nationalresponse. In addition, it describes special circumstances where the FederalGovernment exercises a larger role, including incidents where Federalinterests are involved and catastrophic incidents where a State wouldrequire significant support. It lays the groundwork for first responders,decision-makers and supporting entities to provide a unified nationalresponse. The NRF retains the same core principles of the National Incident Management System (NIMS ) in which first responders from different jurisdictions and disciplines can work together more closely to effectivelyrespond to natural disasters and emergencies, including acts of terrorism. To learn more about the National Response Framework (NRF), visit www.fema.gov/national-response-framework To learn more about the National Incident Management System (NIMS)visit www.fema.gov/emergency/nims / 217 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY CANADA As Canada's lead department for public safety, Public Safety Canada works with five agencies and three review bodies. They are united in a single portfolio and report to the same minister. The result is better integration among federal organizations dealing with national security,emergency management, law enforcement, corrections, crime preventionand borders. PARTNER AGENCIES : Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) - facilitates legitimate cross- border traffic and supports economic development while stopping peopleand goods that pose a potential threat to Canada. Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) - investigates and reports on activities that may pose a threat to the security of Canada. CSIS also provides security assessments. Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) - is responsible for managing offenders sentenced to two years or more in federal correctional institutionsand under community supervision. Parole Board of Canada (PBC) - is an independent decision making body that grants, denies or revokes parole for inmates in federal prisons. PBChelps protect society by facilitating the timely reintegration of offendersinto society as law-abiding citizens. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) - enforces Canadian laws, prevents crime and maintains peace, order and security. MANDATE : To keep Canadians safe from a range of risks such as natural disasters,crime and terrorism. To do this, Public Safety Canada coordinates and supports the efforts of federal organizations ensuring national security andthe safety of Canadians. PS also work with other levels of government, firstresponders, community groups, the private sector and other nations. EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS IN CANADA : Public Safety Canada's approach to emergency management is based onwork in four related areas: Prevention and Mitigation; EmergencyPreparedness; Responding to Emergency Events; and Recovery fromDisasters. 218 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325 PREVENTION AND MITIGATION Prevention and mitigation help reduce the financial costs of disaster response and recovery. PSC works with local governments and stake-holders to promote disaster prevention and mitigation using a risk-basedand all-hazards approach and their National Disaster Mitigation Strategy. EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS Public Safety Canada works in collaboration with other federal departmentsand provincial and territorial governments to strengthen national emer-gency preparedness, through planning, support to training, the exercisingand testing of emergency management arrangements and plans, and sharinglessons learned from events and exercises. RESPONDING TO EMERGENCY EVENTS Emergencies are managed at the local level by first responders such as hospitals, fire departments, the police and municipalities. Local authoritieswho need assistance request it from provincial or territorial governments. Ifan emergency escalates beyond their capabilities, the province or territorymay seek assistance from the federal government utilizing the NationalEmergency Response System (NERS). PSC runs the Government Operations Centre (GOC), which monitors potential threats to the national interest around-the-clock. The Centre canalso provide coordination and support in the event of a national emergency. RECOVERY FROM DISASTERS The Government of Canada supports the efforts of communities to recoverfrom emergencies and their often tragic consequences. Public SafetyCanada provides financial assistance to provincial and territorial govern-ments through the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements (DFAA), inthe event of a large-scale natural disaster where response and recovery costsexceed what individual provinces and territories could reasonably beexpected to bear on their own. EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATIONS : Provincial and territorial emergency management organizations (EMOs)are a good source of information about how to prepare for emergencies inyour region. EMO's activities include planning and research, training,response operations and the administration and delivery of disaster financial assistance programs.

MOREABOUT CERT In the United States and Canada, the Community Emergency Response Team (CERT ) program helps train volunteers to assist first responders in emergency situations in their communities. CERT members give criticalsupport to first responders in emergencies, provide immediate assistance tovictims, organize spontaneous volunteers at a disaster site, and collect disaster intelligence to support first responder efforts. The CERT course is taught in the community by a trained team of first responders who have completed a CERT Train-the-Trainer course conducted by their state training office for emergency management, orFEMA's Emergency Management Institute (EMI), located in Emmitsburg,Maryland. CERT training includes disaster preparedness, disaster fire suppression, basic disaster medical operations, and light search and rescueoperations and is usually delivered in 2-1/2 hour sessions, one evening aweek over a 7 week period. FEMA's online \"Introduction to Community Emergency Response Teams\", IS 317, is an independent study course that serves as an introduction toCERT for those wanting to complete training or as a refresher for currentteam members. It has six modules with topics that include an Introductionto CERT, Fire Safety, Hazardous Material and Terrorist Incidents, DisasterMedical Operations, and Search and Rescue. It takes between six and eighthours to complete the course. The IS 317 can be taken by anyone interested in CERT. However, to become a CERT volunteer, one must complete classroom training offered by a local government agency such asthe emergency management agency, fire or police department. To learnmore, visit www.citizencorps.fema.gov/cert/IS317/ For more information about CERT or to check if a CERT is in your community, visit www.fema.gov/community-emergency-response-teams/ ... or visit www.cert-la.com (click on \"Other CERTProgram Links\") ... or call your local, state, provincial, or territorial Emergency ManagementOffice to ask about volunteer opportunities.

Basically the concept we're focusing on means how quickly your business could reopen and function following a flood, fire, terrorist attack or evenpandemic flu. By planning in advance with managers and employees, theodds of a company surviving and recovering from a disaster increase dramatically. According to the Department of Homeland Security's Ready Business site, America's businesses form the backbone of the nation's economy; smallbusinesses alone account for over 99% of all companies with employees,employ 50% of all private sector workers and provide nearly 45% of thenation's payroll. However, according to the Insurance Information Institute,up to 40% of small businesses do not reopen after a major disaster. A commitment to planning today will help support employees, customers, the community, the local economy and even the country. TIPS ON DEVELOPING YOUR BUSINESS PLAN No matter what size your business is you should plan in advance to manageany type of emergency. Obviously, a large company's plan will be muchmore complex than a small home office or a Mom &Pop shop, but the following tips may help you get started. Please note, we are only covering some key issues here extracted from DHS' Ready Business site then listing some resources and links at the end, but realize there are many resources available to business owners includingconsultants who can develop a business continuity plan for your company. Learn risks - Ask your local emergency management office what types of disasters are common in the places where you have offices or buildings andreview those topics in this book. Learn about NTAS Alerts - Review the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's National Terrorism Advisory System to learn about NTAS Alerts and resources available for businesses and citizens. (see pages 80- 81) 224 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Travel - Stay current on travel updates and restrictions by visiting www.cdc.gov/travel or www.state.gov/travel Make a plan - Visit www.ready.gov/business to download plans, tools, etc. Also ... Find out which staff, materials, procedures and equipment areneeded to keep your business operating. Create a list of suppliers, shippers, and key contacts you use daily. Decide where you would go if your building, office or store is notuseable. (Known as a continuity of operations plan or COOP.) Plan for payroll continuity. Define who will help develop your company's emergency plan. Make sure everyone involved knows what to do and have backupstaff trained and ready to fill in, if needed. Share your plans with others in your building or complex and talkto local First Responders, vendors and others to exchange ideas,experience and knowledge. Update and review plans at least once a year if not more often. Keep employees in mind - A good plan includes your most important asset. Keep lines of communication open both ways with newsletters,alert systems through email or voicemail, Q&A sessions withmanagement and key personnel involved with planning, etc. Ensure you have plans for disabled employees and assign \"bud-dies\" to help during an emergency. Visit www.nod.org for tips. Update employee emergency contact data often and keep a currentcopy with other important papers off-site or in Grab &Go kits. Practice, practice, practice -- make sure all employees do drills andknow what to do and where to go during and after a disaster. Make or get Grab &Go kits - Review Section 1 for tips on assembling a Disaster Supplies Kit for your people. Share ideas with employees too since they may want to make their own small \"Office Kit\" with personalitems. Many companies sell pre-stocked or customized Corporate Kitsbased on number of employees and days needed - check online vendors likewww.thecuresafety.com or call your local Red Cross. Active shooter - Teach everyone how to respond to an active shooter incident and find resources and materials from DHS. (see APPENDIXD - Active Shooter Preparedness on pages 235-237) . Stay or go..? - Plan in advance how staff should shelter-in-place versus evacuate the building. (see THINK ABOUT SHELTER in Section 1 and EVACUATION topic in Section 2) 225 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Things to plan for if instructed to \"Shelter-in-place\": Listen to local authorities and tune in radio or TV for updates. If possible, know who's in the building if there is an emergency. Set up a warning system (and remember folks with hearing or vision disabilities or non-English speaking workers). Determine which room or area will be used for shelter for eachtype of disaster in advance (i.e. some emergencies require staying above ground - others may be best underground or in a sealed room- review Section 2 for tips on sheltering). Discuss ideas with oth-ers in your building or complex or with First Responders. Calculate air requirements for sealed room. (see HAZARDOUS MATERIALS or TERRORISM topic) Consider installing a safe room. (see MITIGATIONTIPS) Assign certain people to grab Kits, take headcounts, seal off room, etc. and have backups lined up in case someone's off or injured. Take a headcount or have a checklist of people in shelter. Practice, practice, practice -- make sure employees know shelter- in-place plans and be ready to explain procedures to newbies notfamiliar with your plans (like customers or suppliers who might beat your building when an event occurs). Things to plan for when making an \"Evacuation plan\": If possible, know who's in the building if there is an emergency. Decide in advance who in your staff and your building has the authority to order an evacuation. And if local authorities tell you toleave - DO it! Determine who is in charge of shutting down critical operationsand systems and locking doors (if possible) during evacuation. Draw a map of your shop or building and mark locations of exits,disaster and first aid kits, fire extinguishers and utility shut-offpoints. Plan at least two escape routes from different sections offacility. Post copies of maps so employees can find them easily andshare copies with local First Responders. Set up a warning system (and remember folks with hearing orvision disabilities or non-English speaking workers). Have flashlights handy or install emergency lighting to help staffexit safely. (Note: Never use lighters since there may be gas leaks.) Pick two meeting places (assembly sites) in advance for staff to go- one near the facility and one further away. Also discuss howemployees should notify someone if they need to leave the site oraren't able to reach one. Take a headcount or have a checklist of people at assembly site. 226 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Practice, practice, practice -- make sure employees know evacua- tion plans and be ready to explain procedures to newbies not familiar with your plans (like customers or suppliers who might beat your building when an event occurs). Practice drills with othertenants or businesses in your complex and share plans and ideas. Practice fire drills - Fire is the most common of all business disasters. Contact local Fire Marshal and request an inspection of your shopor building. Install smoke detectors and fire extinguishers and test them often! Set up a warning system (and remember folks with hearing or vision disabilities or non-English speaking workers). Do fire drills and make sure people know how to stay below thesmoke, how to test doors to see if they are hot, etc. (see tips in FIRES&WILDFIRES topic) Be prepared for medical emergencies - Provide first aid and CPR training to your staff and keep first aid kits stocked and accessible. (see Section 3 for TIPSONBASICFIRSTAID) Get involved - Join or form a CERT with your local EM. ( see page 223) Practice & fine tune - Take notes on things that should be modified during drills and get feedback from employees so your plan is continually improv-ing. Let everyone know about changes to plans and practice drills often.And don't forget your new hires - include plan in Training Programs. Encourage preparedness - Provide customized copies of this book to all your employees (and customers) so they can develop their own personalfamily plans and kits at home. Send preparedness reminder tips in emails ornewsletters. Have a communications plan - Write a crisis communications plan in advance so you are prepared to communicate with employees, customersand others during and after a disaster. Employees - Be prepared to tell workers when, if and how to report to work after an emergency (either through voicemail, emailor manual call system). Explain how the incident may affect jobs. Management - Give executives as much information as possible to protect employees, customers, vendors and nearby facilities. Public - You may need to update the media and general public about the safety or status of employees or buildings and that plansare in place for recovery. Customers - Stay in touch with clients so they know when prod- ucts or services are back in stock or online. 227 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Government - Let officials know what your company can do to help in recovery efforts and ask for help, if needed. Other Businesses/Immediate Neighbors - Be prepared to give neighboring companies or competitors updates on the nature of thesituation in case they need to make plans for their own safety. Help employees recover - Support your workers as they cope with the stress of recovering from a disaster. See TIPSONRECOVERINGFROMADISASTER ... and ... Provide time off so workers can get their home life in order. Offer care or professional counselors on-site. Get folks back into work routines once possible. TIPS ON PROTECTING YOUR BUSINESS ReadyBusiness suggests in addition to emergency planning, the following steps be taken to safeguard your company and secure your physical assets. Review insurance - Meet with your agent or provider to review policies. Ask if current coverage includes physical losses, flood coverageand business interruption. Also visit www.floodsmart.gov for tips. Plan how you would pay creditors, employees and yourself. Find out what records your provider would need after a disasterand store those papers in a safe place. Review all the Planning topics at www.ready.gov/business . Utilities - Think about what your company would do if there's no power, gas, telecommunications, sewer and other utilities. Talk to providers and ask about alternative and backup options during disruptions of service. Ask how and when to turn off utilities and never try to turn gasback on - call the gas company! Consider getting portable generators but never use them inside since they produce deadly carbon monoxide gas. Get wireless phones, walkie-talkies or other devices that don't relyon electricity so you can stay in touch with employees and cus-tomers. Keep extra batteries on-hand too. Have backup providers lined up in case your telephone or Internetservices are down locally. Make sure Disaster Supplies Kit includes sanitation items in case sewer lines are damaged. (see TIPS ON SANITATION OFHUMAN WASTE near end of Section 2) 228 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Protect assets - There are some things you can do in advance to protect your building and equipment ... Install smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and fire extin-guishers and test them often. Draw a map of your building and mark locations of exits, fireextinguishers and utility shut-off points. Post copies so employeescan find them easily and share copies with local First Responders. Consider installing extra security measures like alarm systems,automatic sprinklers, closed circuit TV , keypad or card access sys-tems, or security guards. Think about all the ways people and deliveries enter and leave yourbuilding and the potential risks associated with them. (See TERRORISM topic which covers specific things businesses shouldbe aware of about NTAS alerts and tips on handling bomb threatsand suspicious packages.) Learn about FEMA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) loans andother cost-saving mitigation tips for structures and property byvisiting www.fema.gov . Plan how you would replace machinery, computers or equipmentquickly if it's damaged or destroyed and keep extra supplies on-hand. Decide where you could run the business if your shop's not usable. Ensure any backup location complies with local, state and federalcodes and other safety regulations and ask your insurance agent ifoperating at another facility impacts your policy. Secure equipment - Use straps or L-braces to batten down cabinets or machinery, move heavy items to lower shelves and raise electrical equip-ment off the floor. (see MITIGATIONTIPS at beginning of Section 2) Airborne threats - Several types of disasters can impact the air quality of a building from mold due to flooding, airborne particles from a biologicalattack or dirty bomb, or smoke from a wildfire. Ask if there are options toimprove air quality and protection in the Heating, Ventilating and Air-Conditioning (HV AC)system. Make sure unit is in good, working condition. Practice shut-down procedures for the HV AC system. Secure outdoor air intakes but never seal them. Ask if they can berelocated to an area with limited access (especially intakes that areclose to or underground.) Consider upgrading the filtration system with High EfficiencyParticulate Arrester (HEPA) filter fans or get portable HEPA filtersto help remove dander, dust, molds, smoke and othercontaminants. (see AIR QUALITYMITIGATION) 229 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Cyber threats - Computer crime and hactivism cost businesses billions of dollars every year. Whether you use one computer or a massive network, itis critical to keep your system protected from viruses and attacks. Make sure computers and wireless devices have current anti-virus software and firewalls .. schedule them to scan daily or weekly andupdate virus patterns often. Encourage employees to protect theirpersonal home devices too. Set security preferences as high as possible on Internet browsersand virus packages. Do NOTopen emails or attachments from unknown sources. Use long passwords (best to use numbers, letters and special char-acters), change them often and don't share them with others. Backup data often and keep a daily or weekly backup off-site. Make sure someone knows how to download patches or fixes incase a computer or system gets infected. If your business is hacked, file a complaint with the Internet Crime Complaint Center at www.ic3.gov (The IC3 is a partner- ship between the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI] and theNational White Collar Crime Center [NW3C]. According to theFBI's Cyber Division, agents have been closely trained to be dis-creet, to protect your public image and your intellectual property,and to not disrupt your operations.)

Or check out National Cyber Security Alliance at www.staysafeonline.org Find tools and guides on the Institute for Business and HomeSafety's Open for Business \u00aesite at www.disastersafety.org Review ABOUT CYBER ATTACKS in TERRORISMtopic. Pandemic planning - According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, each year the flu kills 36,000-40,000 Americans, hospitalizes over 200,000 andcosts the U.S. economy over $10 billion in lost productivity and directmedical expenses. Health experts warn a pandemic flu could kill over halfa million Americans, hospitalize 2 million more, and cost the [U.S.] economy an estimated $160 - $675 billion. 11Another scenario predicted by the World Bank estimates a pandemic could kill more than 70 million people worldwide and create havoc in global markets. If a global pandemic occurs, it could change our way of life dramatically. Schools, work, transportation and other services may close for long periodsof time. (For instance, the 1918 flu pandemic lasted 18 months while otherpandemics weaken for a while then recur.) Supplies will be scarce, medical 230 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325facilities will be overwhelmed and travel will be very difficult. Planning for a crisis of this magnitude may seem overwhelming, but an informed andprepared staff and public will know how to protect themselves and decreasetheir risk during a pandemic. Talk with local public health officials and health care providers toget their input and recommendations on pandemic planning andstay current on health alerts and advisories. Get travel updates and restrictions by visiting www.cdc.gov/travel or www.state.gov/travel or www.who.int/ith/en / Adopt business practices that encourage sick employees to stayhome (like using Skype or instant messaging) and anticipate howto function with a smaller workforce for weeks or months at a time. Think about how your business would function if suppliers, banks,transportation and delivery services are limited or shut down. Andencourage staff to keep at least a few weeks supplies at home. Remind employees to reduce the spread of infections by washinghands or using alcohol-based sanitizers often, covering coughs andsneezes with a tissue or shirt sleeve, and wiping down workstations, phones and keyboards with disinfectant or bleach.

In fact,crime in schools has been decreasing since 1992. The CDC reports thenumber of children and youth homicides that are school-related make uponly 1% of the total number of child and youth homicides in the U.S.However, recent events have sparked an interest in school safety. Parents / guardians need to be proactive and work with school officials to find out what the procedures and plans are in the event of a disaster, lock-down or evacuation. Get involved by attending school safety planningmeetings, working with local PTAs or volunteering your time at the school.And keep the lines of communication open with your children starting at avery early age so kids feel comfortable coming to you with questions orproblems they may face at school.

In manycases, there is no pattern or method to the selection of victims by an activeshooter, and these situations are by their very nature unpredictable andevolve quickly. The following instructions on how to respond during an active shooter incident are provided by the State of Alabama Law Enforcement Agencywith credit to Pepperdine University. REMEMBER : Law Enforcement's first priority is to confront and disable the threat. DEVELOP A SURVIV AL MINDSET Awareness and Preparation : Take time to understand your sur- roundings and environment before an emergency occurs. Askyourself, \"What if?\" questions and develop a plan. IN AN ACTIVE SHOOTER EMERGENCY Make a decision, trusting your instincts, to take action to protect yourself to survive the situation. You generally will have three options: Run: Can you safely escape? Hide : Is there a good place to hide? Fight : Will you take out the shooter? RUN FOR SAFETY If you can and you deem it safe, get out, stay low and get to a safe place. You will have to rely partially on instinct. Leave belongings behind, but take your cell phone if it is handy. HIDING IN A SAFE PLACE Find a hidden location. Continued on next page... 235 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325Find protection behind furniture if possible. Find a room that locks if you can. If possible, close and lock the outside door to the room. Blockade the door with furniture or other heavy objects. Close the blinds, turn off the lights, remain quiet, silence cellphones, spread out away from other individuals, and move behindavailable cover. Stay on the floor, away from doors or windows, and do not peekout to see what may be happening. Make a plan with others in the room about what you will do if theshooter enters. Make a total commitment to action and act as ateam with others. Do whatever is necessary to survive the situation. If possible and safe to do so, report the location of the assailant. IF OUTSIDE WHEN A SHOOTING OCCURS Drop to the ground immediately, face down as flat as possible. If within 15-20 feet of a safe place or cover, duck and run to it. Move or crawl away from gunfire, trying to utilize any obstruc-tions between you and the gunfire. Remember that many objects ofcover may conceal you from sight, but may not be bulletproof. When you reach a place of relative safety, stay down and do notmove. Do not peek or raise your head in an effort to see what maybe happening. Wait and listen for directions from Public Safety and law enforce-ment personnel. IF SUSPECT IS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY An individual must use his/her own discretion about when he or she must engage a shooter for survival. Make a plan as to how you will survive the situation. Make a total commitment to action and act as a team with others ifpossible. Do whatever is necessary to survive the situation. HELP OUT Warn others. Help others escape. Keep others away from the danger area. Help the injured. Help others stay calm. 236 www.itsadisaster.net or call 1-888-999-4325CALLING FOR HELP Call 9-1-1 to report the appropriate authorities. Do not assume that someone else has reported the incident . Be persistent; phones may be jammed. Calmly identify yourself and your exact location. Remain calm andanswer the dispatcher's questions. The dispatcher is trained toobtain the necessary and required information for an appropriateemergency response. If safe to do so, stop and take time to get a good description of thecriminal. Note height, weight, sex, race, approximate age, clothing,method and direction of travel, and his/her name, if known. If the suspect is entering a vehicle, note the license plate number,make and model, color, and outstanding characteristics. All of thistakes only a few seconds and is of the utmost help to the respond-ing officers. WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT ARRIVES When law enforcement reaches you, do not run at them or make sudden movements. The priority of the first responders will be to identify the shooter.Law enforcement will need to ensure that you are not the shooter. Do not scream, yell, point, or wave your arms. Do not hold anything in your hands that could be mistaken for aweapon (including cell phones). Be quiet and compliant. Show the officers your empty hands and follow their instructions. Give the number of shooters. Give the location and physical description of the shooter. Give the number and types of weapons. When it is safe to do so, you will be given instructions as to howto safely exit your location. Learn more at http://le.alabama.gov/activeshooter.aspx DHS offers free courses, materials, webinars and workshops to better prepare you to deal with an active shooter situation and to raise awarenessof behaviors that represent pre-incident indicators and characteristics ofactive shooters. These tools are designed to help individuals, business owners, law enforcement officials, schools, houses of worship and others.Learn more at www.dhs.gov/active-shooter-preparedness .
