Origin - Key Ingredients - Formula - Origin The 37 synergistic ingredients in this blend promote bliss in the body, mind, spirit, and senses. The key ingredients are: Amalaki (fruit), the richest source of vitamin C in the plant world and promotes bliss in the body, mind, spirit and senses. It's also beneficial for the eyes, digestion, heart, and muscles, and enhances your body's ability to absorb iron and calcium from food. Haritaki (fruit) is beneficial for digestion and nutrient absorption. Immunity booster. Tridoshic (pacifies all three doshas). Gotu Kola is known for its anti-aging properties. It is a medhya rasayana, which means it promotes mental clarity, coordination among cells, and supports dhi (learning), dhriti (retention), and smriti (recall). Shatavari (root) enhances metabolism and nourishes all the seven Ayurvedic types of bodily tissue, particularly reproductive tissue. It's especially good for improving the quality and quantity of reproductive fluid (shukra), and increases the production of ojas (life essence). This complex formula requires quality checks at every stage of processing, from selection of raw material through packaging. The herbs are harvested at precise times to ensure maximum potency. Each ingredient is carefully prepared for processing, and the fruits are cooked at specific temperatures to eliminate degeneration of the essential intelligence of the herbs. All parts of the formulation are prepared independently in a meticulous manner as designed by the Vaidyas, and the different parts are blended in at specific stages, maintaining the appropriate temperatures and mixing times necessary to preserve the integrity of the formulation. According to Vedic lore, humanity was steeped in suffering in ancient times. One day, the Devas (gods) and the Asuras (demons) resolved to find a solution; they churned the mighty ocean, and Amrit Kalash\u2014the Nectar of Immortality\u2014appeared to restore health and happiness to humanity. Many millennia later, in the 1980s, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi gathered preeminent Ayurvedic scholars and physicians in Noida, India, to create a powerful rasayana (rejuvenative) formula for mind, body, and spirit. The result was Amrit Kalash\u2014a full-spectrum antioxidant, rejuvenative formula that represents the ultimate knowledge of the ancient Vedic texts. Reviews Ray's f Amrit helps 84-year-old recover I was a regular visitor to an elderly friend. He had started TM at age 83 and had been meditating regularly for about a year but wasn't seeing a lot of progress (probably too much backlog) and was even going downhill. There is nothing surprising about that but I suggested he try Amrit. He started with Ambrosia, taking a double-dose. Within days, lRead more about review stating Amrit helps 84-year-old recoveress than a week, his mind and his slurred speech became clear. He had more energy. This continued until he ran out of the bottle then, in less than ten days, he was back to having slurred speech, mental fog, and fatigue again. I encouraged him to get more, which he did and the same thing happened. The third time, I encouraged him to get the automatic shipments so he wouldn't run out again. He did. It is now nine months later and he is taking it regularly with no breaks now, still two at a time (he can afford it). He has since moved back to a different state and has slacked off regular meditation but when I talked to him last, his voice was still strong and his mind was clear. It was pretty amazing to see that happen. RACHEL H. I use the the Nectar tablets, the Ambrosia and the Amla Tablets twice daily, with the Traphala at night. these products provide me a \"sense\" of healthy systemic well-being. My outlook is more positive and productive. I recommend these products. If one has questions about any products offered by VPK, the customer service is exceptional. David B We started taking Amrit to boost our immune systems in the early COVID days at the suggestion of our TM coach. As things settled down once the world had a better grasp of COVID, we stopped taking it. Both of us noticed, quite independently, that, once we stopped, we were both waking up 2 or 3 time during the night, often having trouble getting bacRead more about review stating We started taking Amrit tok to sleep. Again, independently, we asked ourselves if the change was because of Amrit. We both recalled that we had been sleeping more restfully when we had been taking it and that life had changed once we stopped. We then had a conversation about our suspicions and decided that Amrit did something to make our sleep more restful and decided to make Amrit part of our lives again. Did we better, more restful sleep? ABSOLUTELY! These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
