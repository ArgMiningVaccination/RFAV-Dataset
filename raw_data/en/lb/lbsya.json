This year, why not take spring cleaning a step further than decluttering the closet and hone in on your health? Here are our top tips for cleaning up your health this spring: Enjoy In-Season Produce The start of spring is an excellent time to freshen up your diet with seasonal fruits and vegetables. Nutrient-dense produce can help you feel more energized and strengthen your immune system. Additionally, if you're trying to lose weight, eating more fiber-rich fruits and veggies can help you stay full between meals. Asparagus, peas, rhubarb, apricots, arugula, and beets are just a few of the many fruits and vegetables that are in season during spring. Take Up a New Form of Exercise As part of your healthy spring cleaning, why not try a new form of exercise? Daily exercise is crucial to your heart health, stamina, and sleep quality. During spring, when the flowers are blooming and the weather continues to warm up, you can get into outdoor activities, such as biking, hiking, or even just taking a walk around the neighborhood. In addition to exercise that gets your heart pumping, consider [yoga](https://mindbodyspiritcare.com/therapeutic-yoga-tampa/). Yoga engages both your body and mind to encourage mindfulness, strength, flexibility, and pain relief. Address Nutrient Deficiencies Nutrient deficiencies are very common. After all, it's more difficult than you might think to get all the nutrients you need from food. Symptoms like fatigue, muscle aches, brittle hair and nails, and hair loss can all point to a nutrient deficiency. This spring, consider addressing nutrient deficiencies with [IV nutritional therapy](https://mindbodyspiritcare.com/iv-nutritional-therapies-tampa/).
