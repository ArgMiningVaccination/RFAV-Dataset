Nitric oxide supplements are definitely a new trend, worth taking a closer look at. Perhaps you have heard of nitric oxide supplements mainly as \"men's\" supplements, enhancing sexual mood, stimulating sexual drive and strengthening erections. Iti Is true, a truly premium Nitric Oxide (NO) supplement manages to noticeably improve the sexual performance of any man, regardless of age. Here is how it does that. Improving blood circulation and allowing better blood supply to the genitals (and more specifically the penis). However, the same applies to women. Nitric oxide supplements do exactly the same, they also boost female libido, increase arousal and pleasure during sex, and enhance orgasm. Nevertheless, again, this is not the only action of these amazing supplements. If you are a fan of the gym, bodybuilding and wellness, then you may have heard of them as \"amazing training enhancers\". Therefore, if you are one of those people who \"sweat\" in a gym and strive for a perfect physical condition and a flawless muscular body, then take a look at this article. With nitric oxide (NO) supplements you can extend your training endurance, energize your body, boost your focus, maximize your muscle gains, and certainly minimize post-workout muscle recovery time. There are many & different (in composition & potency) nitric oxide supplements on the market. Depending on its primary ingredients, each supplement focuses on different benefits for the organism. You can find nitric oxide supplements more \"male\", aimed at male sexual enhancement and fighting sexual dysfunctions, however, also unisex supplements mainly used as pre-workout supplements. Nevertheless, are these supplements legal? Are they effective? Do they cause side effects? Read our guide to see the best four (4) nitric oxide supplements in the world right now, and what they actually do (as determined by our own testing and user reviews). 1. [Nitric MAX by CrazyBulk](https://www.wb22trk.com/WBB3BM/3QQG7/?uid=9) - Best selection for men and women for explosive workouts and muscle Building 2. [VigRX Nitric Oxide Support](https://www.vigrxnitricoxide.com/ct/520492) - Best selection for sexual enhancement for men (any age) 3. Pump Serum Stimulant-Free Pre-Workout - Best selection for extreme energy (stimulant-free) 4. Magnify Advanced Nitric Oxide Formula - Best selection for hard lean muscle mass and volume Nitric Oxide (NO) - What it is - The reason for being used as a nutritional supplement Nitric oxide, with the chemical formula NO, is a chemical compound, naturally produced by the organism itself, working to ensure its smooth cardiovascular function. Nitric oxide (NO) is a soluble gas composed of one nitrogen atom and one oxygen atom, produced in the endothelium and its role is related to dilation of arteries and normalization of blood circulation to the whole body, organs and tissues. NO, by regulating blood circulation, ensures optimal transport of valuable nutrients and oxygen to the entire body. In addition, it controls blood pressure and favors good cardiovascular function. The best nitric oxide supplements have one more important property, enhancing the release of important hormones in the organism (such as insulin and growth factors). This is one of the reasons these supplements have been in such great demand in recent years. However, let's explain everything a little better. The best natural nitric oxide supplements usually include substances such as L-citrulline and L-arginine, two very important amino acids playing a key role in protein synthesis and supporting many important body functions. There are many nitric oxide (NO) supplements on the market, some of them more aimed at male sexual enhancement, while others offer a \"workout burst\" to the user (male or female). Nevertheless, whatever their main goal is, these supplements work with the aim of improving blood circulation, which in turn leads to many important benefits for the user's organism. From physical endurance, improved athletic performance and muscle enhancement, to enhanced sexual arousal, performance, and fertility. When nitric oxide was discovered to act as a vasodilator, it completely changed the course of nutritional supplements, in sexual and athletic enhancement, and more! This discovery led the scientific community to the discovery of the well-known [ \"blue pill\" Viagra](https://www.timesofisrael.com/spotlight/4-best-over-the-counter-viagra-pills-top-non-prescription-viagra-alternatives-online/), and subsequently other related drugs and para-pharmaceuticals against erectile dysfunction. Nitric oxide (NO), as shown above, ensures many different positive effects on the organism, and on specific vital organs. Studies now confirm the improvement ensured in cardiovascular function, and in the function of the brain, liver and kidneys. This chemical was discovered in 1998 and has since changed the way we perceive fitness and manage our training. Gym enthusiasts know this very well. The researchers who discovered this chemical substance were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1998, and were indelibly written in history. Effectiveness of the best nitric oxide (NO2) supplements, in real terms In the light of all mentioned above, let's see what nitrate supplements can do for a person. A couple of very important questions come to our mind: \"Which is the target group of these supplements?\" \"Do they only apply to men?\" \"Are they only aimed at people with sexual dysfunction problems?\" \"Are there specific groups that can make use of these supplements, and under what conditions?\" Therefore, we need to clarify: Nitrate supplements are neither pure sports supplements, nor pure sexual performance and erection enhancement supplements. Nitric oxide (NO) supplements are natural supplements, enhancing blood clotting in the body and improving blood circulation. They also strengthen the transmission of messages between nerves and improve the \"nourishment\" of important organs & tissues of the organism. Precisely, due to this diversity of nitrate supplements, selection requires more care, as one product may not work for everyone. The effectiveness of such a supplement is very subjective and is related to the goals each person wants to achieve. Also, the action of a supplement varies among persons, since it is affected by various factors (such as physical condition, age, gender, body weight, general health condition, and many more factors). A thorough research on the various sites and forums by various users (of different ages and genders) can be the best guide for choosing your ideal nitric oxide supplement. Finally, are all the best nitric oxide supplements only suitable for men? Yes or no, and why? Although they have become known primarily as \"male enhancement supplements\", and as a natural (non-prescription) alternative to Viagra, the best natural nitric oxide supplements are aimed at men and women. As proven by clinical evidence, the leading nitrate supplements - promoting (using ONLY natural ingredients) the smooth circulation of oxygen and nutrients through the blood to all vital organs and tissues of the body, a unique and all natural selection of stimulation/health/energy. They promote general good health and wellness, but also (more specifically) enhanced athletic & sexual performance of the person using them. Best Nitrate Supplements - Main benefits The most important health benefits offered by these supplements (for men and women) are shown below: - weight loss - increased muscle hypertrophy - fat burning - enhanced physical endurance - energy - increased use of glucose - rapid muscle recovery (after workouts) - enhanced lung function (especially in patients with pulmonary fibrosis) - treatment of diabetic ulcers - strengthen immunity - prevent common cold - memory enhancement [fight ](https://www.ndtv.com/partner-content/health-supplements/best-nitric-oxide-supplements-for-ed-top-no2-boosters-review-2023-3886978) [erectile](https://www.ndtv.com/partner-content/health-supplements/best-nitric-oxide-supplements-for-ed-top-no2-boosters-review-2023-3886978) [ dysfunctions](https://www.ndtv.com/partner-content/health-supplements/best-nitric-oxide-supplements-for-ed-top-no2-boosters-review-2023-3886978) - enhancement of libido - reduction of high blood pressure in pregnancy [strengthen erections](https://arowsed.com) - prevent memory loss - strengthen the cognitive functions of the brain - faster recovery after serious injuries Caution.
