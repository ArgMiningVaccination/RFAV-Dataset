Vaccines have been very helpful in protecting people from many dangerous diseases for a long time now. Although they are great in protecting us, certain vaccines could be dangerous to young children. The vaccines have shown a relationship to cause autism, which affects families and children with autism greatly. Vaccines have shown reasons to be the cause of the disorder, autism, due to the contents found in the vaccines and the amount of contents in the vaccines given. The measles-mumps rubella vaccine (MMR) and the thimerosal vaccine, containing mercury, are the suspected causes. The problem may be that vaccines need to be made safer and certain contents in the vaccines need to be lowered or taken out. The thimerosal vaccine and the measles-mumps rubella vaccine have shown a relationship to autism in some way, whether scientists believe it to be true or not. The contents in the vaccines are dangerous to children and have shown evidence to a relationship with the causes of Autism. The measles-mumps rubella vaccine has many forms of evidence that reveals a relationship to autism. According to Carol Turkington, \"There has been evidence of measles virus in the gut, spinal fluid, and blood of children with autism\" (Turkington). Although the Institute of Medicine found no relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism, they said that there is a \"possibility that MMR vaccine could contribute to ASD in a small number of children\" (Institute of Medicine). The National Academy of Science, the Institute of Medicine, and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development reviewed the relationship and found that the evidence doesn't show a link between the two (Turkington). Although, experts have said that when the MMR vaccine was introduced in the U.S., autism began to rise (Miller/Reynolds). In the book Evidence of Harm, the author writes, \"many symptoms of mercury toxicity were remarkably similar, if not identical to the signs of autism\" (Kirby 51). This shows a relationship between the two. The thimerosal vaccine is the other suspected cause of autism. The thimerosal vaccine contains mercury, which has said to be dangerous to children when they are vaccinated. A study that was done by Mark Geier, "}
