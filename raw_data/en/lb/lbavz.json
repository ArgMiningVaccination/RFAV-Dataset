We can all con rm this from experience. In our patients, we may observe a decrease in suffering even despite an initial aggravation of the symptoms. How can it be that a patient feels more 'comfortable ',i s more 'composed ', experiences increased 'freedom of spirit ' and'courage 'while the symptoms intensify? Is there a place, an inner state that transcends suffering? It is as if all aroundthe winds are still blowing ercely but the patient nds himself in the eye of the hurricane and from this position witnesses how the storm initially increases and then sub-sides. Isn 't this an amazing phenomenon? Hahnemann calls this 'a kind of returning naturalness '.I suggest drop 'kind of '. It is a return to the natural state. If we look at the state of humanity, we can see that the natural state is not the norm. The normal state is far removed from our truenature. From the above we know that this natural state can be experienced even in the middle of symptoms. We can observe a person suffering from symptoms, or someone who enjoys the stillness of his natural state despite those same symptoms. In between these two different states lies the action of theremedy. Once this natural state has been reached the healing process is only a matter of time. On a spiritual and energetic levelhealing is immediate. To seep through all the layers of form \u2014 mental, emotional and physical \u2014and thus remove the signs and symptoms of the diseased state, takes some time. So, all weneed to do is wait and trust the natural process of healing. Suffering is based on identi cation. Identi cation with the story of a person. Identi cation with the body, with thoughts,emotions and sensations, a diagnosis or a disease. An illu- sionary, deluded state. If as an exercise we drop for just a moment, past and future, all of our stories, our thoughts and emotions, feelings and sensa- t i o n s ,w h a tr e m a i n sa so u re x p e rience? What remains is a sense of presence, awareness, stillness that is our natural state, the Self. The simillimum is capable of waking us up from the deluded state, to break the spell of identi cation, of ego and to restore our natural state. From identi cation with the person and its subsequent suffering, we wake up as the tranquillity of our true Self. The signs and symptoms we hadwere actually there to bring this awakening about. The disease is the cure. With the blessing of a homeopathic simillimum, this cure, the purpose of the disease, is broughtabout in a 'rapid, gentle and permanent 'manner. Cure is then not just the restoration of health in terms of becoming free from signs and symptoms, but more deeply theawakening to one 's true Self. This, I believe, is the higher purpose of homeopathy \u2014 to wake up humanity to its natural state. Changing the 'normal state 'of identi cation with the walking story of a person at war with himself and the world and longing for peace, to the 'natural state 'of recognizing one's Self as being that very peace. This is the end of suffering. This issue is published shortly before Christmas. H\u00e4ndel 's Messiah comes to mind. 'How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things '. What a blessing Samuel Hahnemann brought to this world!
