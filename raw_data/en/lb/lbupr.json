Services received outside of Michigan are administered through BlueCard\u00ae , a Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Association Program. It does not expand your Coverage to include out -of-state providers. It defines the payment method used should an incidental out -of-state claim be incurred. Overview Blue Care Net work (\"BCN\") has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensees referred to generally as \"Inter -Plan Arrangements.\" These Inter -Plan Arrangements operate under rules and procedures issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Associa tion (\"Association\"). Whenever you, the Member, access healthcare services outside the geographic area we serve, the claim for those services may be processed through one of these Inter -Plan Arrangements. The Inter -Plan Arrangements are described generally below. Typically, when accessing care outside the geographic area BCN serves, you obtain care from healthcare providers that have a contractual agreement (\"participating providers\") with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that other geog raphic area (\"Host Blue\"). In some instances, you may obtain care from providers in the Host Blue geographic area that do not have a contractual agreement (\"nonparticipating providers\") with the Host Blue. BCN remains responsible for fulfilling our contrac tual obligations to you. Our payment practices in both instances are described belo w. BCN covers only limited healthcare services received outside of our Service Area. As used in this section \"Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services\" include, emergency care, urgent care, routine care and/or follow -up care obtained outside the geographic are a we serve, subject to BCN coverage and authorization rules. Any other services will not be covered when processed through any Inter -Plan Arrangements, unless Preauthorized by your Primary Care Physician (\"PCP\") or BCN. Inter -Plan Arrangements Eligibility - Claim Types All claim types are eligible to be processed through Inter -Plan Arrangements, as described above, except for all Dental Care Benefits except when paid as medical claims/benefits, and those Prescription Drug Benefits or Vision Care Benefits that may be administered by a third party contracted by BCN to provide the specific service or services. A. BlueCard\u00ae Program The BlueCard\u00ae Program is an Inter -Plan Arrangement. Under this Arrangement, when you access Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Serv ices outside the BCN Service Area, the Host Blue will be responsible for contracting and handling all interactions with its participating providers. The financial terms of the BlueCard Program are described generally below. YOUR BENEFITS 32 CB19519 UMG 23F \u00a9 202 2 Blue Care Network Effective 1/1/202 3 Liability Calculation Method P er Claim Unless subject to a fixed dollar Copayment, the calculation of the Member liability on claims for Out-of-Area Covered Healthcare Services processed through the BlueCard Program will be based on the lower of the providers billed charges for Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services or the negotiated price made available to us by the Host Blue. Host Blues determine a negotiated price, which is reflected in the terms of each Host Blue's healthcare provider contracts. The negotiated price made available to BCN by the Host Blue may be represented by one of the following: (i) An actual price. An actual price is a negotiated rate of payment in effect at the time a claim is processed without any other increases or decreases; or (ii) An estimated price. An estimated price is a negotiated rate of payment in effect at the time a claim is processed, reduced or increased by a percentage to take into account certain payments negotiated with the provider and other claim - and non -claim -related transactions. Such transactions may include, but are not limited to, anti -fraud and abuse recoveries, provider refunds not applied on a claim -specific basis, retrospective settlements and performance -related bonuses or incentives; or (iii) An average price. An average price is a percentage of billed charges for Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Se rvices in effect at the time a claim is processed representing the aggregate payments negotiated by the Host Blue with all of its providers or a similar classification of its providers and other claim - and non -claim -related transactions. Such transactions may include the same ones as noted above for an estimated price. The Host Blue determines whether or not it will use an actual price, an estimated price or an average price. The use of estimated or average pricing may result in a difference (positive or negative) between the price you pay on a specific claim and the actual amount the Host Blue pays to the provider. However, the BlueCard Program requires that the amount paid by the Member is a final price; no future price adjustment will result in increases or decreases to the pricing of past claims. B. Nonparticipating Providers Outside of the BCN Service Area 1. Member Liability Calculation When Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services are provided outside of the BCN Service Area by nonparticipating provi ders, the amount(s) you pay for such services will generally be based on either the Host Blue's nonparticipating provider local payment or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state law. In these situations, you may be responsible for the differ ence between the amount that the nonparticipating healthcare provider bills and the payment BCN YOUR BENEFITS 33 CB19519 UMG 23F \u00a9 202 2 Blue Care Network Effective 1/1/202 3 will make for Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services as set forth in this paragraph. Payments for out -of-network emergency services will be governed by applica ble federal and state law. 2. Exceptions In some exception cases, BCN may pay claims from nonparticipating providers for Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services based on the provider's billed charge. This may occur in situations where you did not have re asonable access to a participating provider, as determined by BCN and in accordance with applicable state law. In other exception cases, BCN may pay such a claim based on the payment BCN would make if BCN were paying a nonparticipating provider for the same Covered Healthcare Services inside of BCN Service Area, as described elsewhere in this contract. This may occur where the Host Blue's corresponding payment would be more than BCN in -Service Area nonparticipating provider payment. BCN may choose to negot iate a payment with such a provider on an exception basis. Unless otherwise stated, in any of these exception situations, you may be responsible for the difference between the amount that the nonparticipating provider bills and the payment BCN will make f or the covered services as set forth in this paragraph. C. Blue Cross Blue Shield Global \u00ae Core General Information If you are outside the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (hereinafter: \"BlueCard Service Area\"), y ou may be able to take advantage of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global \u00ae Core when accessing Covered Healthcare Services. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Global \u00ae Core is unlike the BlueCard Program available in the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico a nd the U.S. Virgin Islands in certain ways. For instance, although the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global \u00ae Core assists you with accessing a network of inpatient, outpatient and professional providers, the network is not served by a Host Blue. As such, when you receive care from providers outside the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, you will typically have to pay the providers and submit the claims yourself to obtain reimbursement for these services.

Clinical Trials of experimental drugs or treatments proceed through four phases: Phase I: Researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of peo ple (20 -80) for the first time to evaluate its safety, to determine a safe dosage range and to identify side effects. Phase I trials do not determine efficacy and may involve significant risks as these trials represent the initial use in human patients. Phase II: The study drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people (100 -300) to see if it is effective and further evaluate its safety. Phase III: If a treatment has shown to be effective in Phase II, it is subjected to additional scrutiny in Phase III. In this phase, the sample size of the study population is increased to between 1,000 and 3,000 people. The goals in Phase III are to confirm the effectiveness noted in Phase II, monitor for side effects, compare the study treatment against current tr eatment protocols, and collect data that will facilitate safe use of the therapy or treatment under review. Phase IV: These studies are done after the drug or treatment has been marketed or the new treatment has become a standard component of patient care . These studies continue testing the study drug or treatment to collect information about their effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long -term use. Phase IV studies are required by the FDA when there are any remaining unanswer ed questions about a drug, device or treatment.
