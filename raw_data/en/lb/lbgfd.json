Thanks Dr. Sarah and Shelley for the awesome treatment I received. I had tingling in my fingers and pain in my forearm and shoulder due to overuse. Feels so much better. As a massage therapist this is my go to place for self care. Christi B. I cannot recommend Complete Chiropractic Care highly enough! Dr. Olga is an incredibly skilled, knowledgable and caring chiropractor. She has helped me recover from injury related back/hip pain, treated me throughout my pregnancy, and now she's treating my baby as well. They provide \"Kids Day\" once a month for kids to be treated at an extremely affordable rate, which is very appreciated. Dr. Chapman is also wonderful and holistic.
