One need only read the letter to the editor by chiropractor Lewis Singer on Sept. 1 regarding the vaccine and autism issue. To date, there has never been a reliable study that has confirmed the association between the two. On the contrary, we know what happens to children who are not vaccinated. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease. One out of 5 can contract pneumonia; one or two out of 1,000 may die. Mumps, which has no treatment other than supportive care, had been a highly contagious disease before the advent of vaccines. Complications include meningitis or encephalitis (inflammation of the brain and/or tissues covering it) and deafness. Tetanus is a bacterial infection that may result in violent convulsions and is almost entirely preventable through vaccination. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 233 cases reported in the United States from 2001 to 2008; 26 of whom died (11 percent). In children under 15 years - from 1992 through 2000 - 11 of 13 cases occurred in those who were not vaccinated (85 percent). The point of contention arises every few years despite conclusive evidence to the contrary. One of the most notable studies on the subject was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Nov. 7, 2002. It was not funded by a pharmaceutical company or vaccine manufacturer, but rather the National Alliance for Autism Research. Its conclusion: There is no association between vaccines and autism. This position is supported by the Autism Science Foundation and Autism Speaks, among other reputable groups. But, the most profound research is catalogued by the CDC looking at this link, along with the contention of thimerosal-containing vaccines. The CDC lists nine studies published between 2002 and 2013, none of which indicate a link. Instead of hearsay, anecdotal reports of supposition or gut-instinct, or taking as gospel what a desperate celebrity mother may say to a national audience, we should pivot to focus on what matters most - the children afflicted with autism-spectrum disorder. Research done and resources expended regarding vaccines as a cause should cease and instead be directed toward what interventions result in the best outcomes for these children. Searching for someone to blame is misguided and without merit; helping those affected with abnormalities in language, behavior, and/or interpersonal skills should be our highest priority. With assistance, patience and therapy many can overcome these obstacles. Joshua D.
