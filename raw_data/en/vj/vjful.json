To the extent that it is possible, the environment will be sensory-friendly, and our expert staff and our volunteers have been trained to assist children with sensory issues. Families should access the vaccine clinic through the 19th Street entrance of the Academy. Each child receiving the vaccine and one parent will get free entry to the museum, which will open for visitors at 9AM. Parkit Express provides a discounted rate for museum visitors at the Logan Square Garage at 1815 Cherry Street.
