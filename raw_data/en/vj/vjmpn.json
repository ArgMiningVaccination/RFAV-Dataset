{"title": "FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS - Dr. Murphy", "author": null, "url": "https://sites.northwestern.edu/covidglobalsurveillance/frequently-asked-questions/", "hostname": "northwestern.edu", "description": null, "sitename": "The Global SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance Project (GASSP)", "date": "2020-11-20", "cleaned_text": "Are there any reasons NOT to receive their second dose before 90 days? Scenerio A couple tested positive for Covid (mild symptoms, no long-term effects) two weeks after their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and their primary care physician instructed them to wait 90 days after their symptoms resided to receive their second doses. However, they will be traveling to Florida with their unvaccinated children and strongly believe they should get their second dose two weeks prior to their trip (66/90 days and 63/90 days). Answers - The second dose of your vaccine should be deferred until you are no longer symptomatic and meet the criteria to leave isolation. Mild to moderate symptoms: discontinue isolation at least 10 days after symptoms started, at least 24 hours after fever resolution without an antipyretic, and overall symptoms have improved. - Like their primary care physician mentioned, the short-term reaction to the vaccine may be more severe with residual antibodies remaining, however, general CDC guidelines (as of June 1, 2021) do not dictate a 90 day wait, rather the guidelines listed above. - Special Cases: **If you were treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, have a history of multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children or adults, have a history of thrombosis, or have received passive antibody therapy, CDC guidelines do recommend waiting the full 90 days** Why are Ivermectin and Remdesivir not being used as prophylactics for Covid-19? - Do not use any treatment that is not approved or authorized by the FDA, there are serious risks of harm. Ivermectin is not approved in any way for Covid-19 prevention or treatment. - Ivermectin is not an anti-viral drug, it is only FDA approved to treat specific conditions caused by parasitic worms and a topical version can be used to treat external parasites such as head lice. - There are two versions of Ivermectin, one intended for humans and one intended for animals. Never take medications intended for animals. Ivermectin is most often used on horses or cows and thus the drug has a much higher dosage. - Approved levels of ivermectin can interact with other medications ie. blood thinners and you can overdose on ivermectin. - The WHO has recommended that the use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients end, regardless of the severity of the patient's Covid infection, because there is \"currently no evidence that remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes in these patients\". (November 20, 2020) How did vaccine developers overcome the issue of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement? - Antibody-Dependent Enhancement, in the case of Covid-19, seemed to depend on which protein you chose to base your vaccine around. Specifically, ADE was previously seen in trials of vaccines that targeted the nucleoprotein antigen of the 2003 SARS coronavirus. - For this reason, the approved coronavirus vaccines target different proteins or have different mechanisms of action that have shown no signs of ADE. ADE was specifically tested for in trials involving animals and no cases of increased severity were observed. Does the Covid vaccine (specifically mRNA type vaccines) compromise our innate immune system? - Short answer: no, it does not. It actually strengthens the immune system. - The vaccine works by delivering a fragment of mRNA to your cells which can then be translated to a protein, here, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In layman's terms, the mRNA fragment you receive in the vaccine gives you the building block to produce a protein that our bodies build an immune response to (antibodies). There is no evidence that this particular fragment insertion has negative effects on the immune system. What are your thoughts on the Novavax vaccine? Do you expect the same side effects/concerns that people have raised about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines? - Novavax is a protein adjuvent vaccine. The Novavax vaccine contains the spike protein of the coronavirus formulated into a nanoparticle that cannot cause disease. Post injection, the spike nanoparticle stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies and T-cell immune responses. - Currently in phase 3 clinical trials, showing 90% effectiveness against \"lab-confirmed, symptomatic infection and 100% effectiveness against moderate and severe disease in Phase 3 trial results.\" Additionally showing 91% effectiveness for those in high-risk populations and 93% effective against \"predominately circulating variants and variants of interest.\" - Common side effects: injection site tenderness, fatigue, headache, muscle pain. Should vaccinated individuals who come in contact with many people continue to wear masks around unvaccinated persons? Specifically, around children that are still too young to receive vaccinations? Scenerio Grandmother concerned about her unvaccinated grandsons (ages 4 and 7) spending time around unmasked adults who are vaccinated and the potential risks of the kids playing unmasked with other unvaccinated children or around maskless adults. Answers - Any unvaccinated person indoors is required to wear a mask. - Any unvaccinated individuals are permitted to not wear a mask if they are outside with only members of their household or attending a small outdoor gathering where the other individuals are fully vaccinated. - If you are vaccinated, you do not need to wear a mask. However, because none of the vaccines are 100% effective, if you are in a large group setting with unvaccinated persons, it never hurts to wear your mask as well. - If you are fully vaccinated but work in a place where you interact with a lot of people who may be maskless or unvaccinated you should consider wearing a mask during those times. - **Youth specific activities** CDC guidelines for youth camps (both day and overnight camps) state that if everyone is fully vaccinated, masks do not need to be worn. In camps where not everyone is vaccinated, unvaccinated children must wear masks indoors and are also required to wear masks in crowded outdoor settings or during activities that involve sustained coles contact with other unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated individuals. Is there evidence that those who received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine will require a second dose? - Not exactly... The J&J/Janssen vaccine only requires one dose to reach the 66.3% effectiveness in preventing Covid-19. - There are currently discussions revolving around a possible booster (a single dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine) for those who received the J&J/Janssen vaccine as the Delta variant spreads. However, the CDC is currently not recommending boosters. - This may change as trials are being run to determine the need for boosting the J&J vaccine. If I am allergic to Ibuprofen, will that affect me when I receive my vaccine? No, your ibuprofen allergy is a completely separate type of allergy so you will be completely safe. What are your thoughts on kids going back to school in the fall that are not yet eligible for the vaccine? - Children between the ages of 2-12 are not yet eligible for any vaccines in the United States, but they could be as early as this fall as both Pfizer and Moderna are running trials testing the vaccine on children ages 6 months to 11 years old. - All unvaccinated individuals are required to wear masks indoors. - Because no child under the age of 12 is currently eligible for a vaccine, there is an increased risk of transmission of the spread of covid variants if the proper precautions are not taken (proper room ventilation, masking, social distancing, vaccinating all adults in the school). - The transmission risk from an unvaccinated student to a vaccinated teacher or administrator is very low. Is this a common side effect of the Pfizer vaccine? Scenerio A 12-year-old recently received the Pfizer vaccine (does not say whether the first or second dose) and three days later developed hives on her knees. Answers - Rashes or hives near the injection site are common side effects, but hives on other parts of the body* may indicate a mild allergic reaction. However, because the reaction occurred three days (rather than one or fewer days) following the vaccination, there is difficulty in clearly attributing the reaction to the vaccine. - *Common mild allergic reactions from the Pfizer vaccine include pruritus, rash, itchy and scratchy sensations of the throat, and mild respiratory symptoms. - Reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. You should have received information and instructions on how to do so from the pharmacists who administered the vaccine. Should staff still make contact tracing lists and take temperatures? Is a full choir ok without masks or face shields if everyone is vaccinated and can they share microphones? Scenerio A few questions regarding the safety of Church choirs and general procedure. Answers - If both staff and congregants have shown proof of full vaccination, then temperature checks and contact tracing are not required. If unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated congregants are in attendance, their temperature should be taken and they should continue to contact trace, and they must be masked (covering nose and mouth) and socially distanced from non-household members. - If the members of the choir have all shown proof of being fully vaccinated, the CDC does deem it safe for indoor performances without masks or face shields. Microphones can be shared between fully vaccinated individuals but should be regularly sanitized nonetheless. If I have been fully vaccinated since February, is it safe for me to attend an indoor concert in August with the rise of the Delta variant? - The CDC still recommends avoiding large events and gatherings regardless of vaccination status (as of May 20, 2021). While this is subject to change, with the rise of the Delta and other variants strains of Covid, it may be unsafe. - If the concert venue requires proof of vaccination for entry and enforces social distancing, the risk would be very much reduced. Why are the new Covid variants easier to catch? Ex: being in an infected person's presence for two minutes rather than the 15 minutes we associated with the first strains of Covid. - Variants or new strains of a virus occur when there is a mutation in the virus's genes, this was not unexpected for SARS-CoV-2 and is being continuously monitored. - Initial research on the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant-now the most common version of the coronavirus in the UK-has shown the strain is more contagious than the initial strain because it seems to affect the virus's spike protein, whose purpose is to help the virus attach to human cells in the nose, lungs, and other areas of the body. This makes the variant strain bind more tightly to our cells. Thus, there is a much shorter time frame for infection. If my platelets are low, am I at high risk for getting the vaccine? Or is it safe for me to get vaccinated? - \"A platelet count greater than 20,000 is adequate for an intramuscular injection. If your count is above 20,000 but less than 50,000, you should hold firm pressure on the injection site, without rubbing, for five minutes following the injection. If your platelets are less than 20,000, talk to your doctor about ways to increase your platelet count prior to receiving your vaccination.\" - The expected benefits of receiving the Covid vaccine outweigh the concern of the potential for a drop in the platelet count.

If you have a history of allergic reactions, you should be aware of special precautions that might be needed.\" - b. \"The vaccines in current use have been tested and approved in the US by the FDA. Clinical trials have included thousands of patients, some of whom have had thyroid conditions. Currently there is no evidence that having thyroid disease makes you at higher risk for vaccine-related problems.\" Source: https://www.thyroid.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Public-Health-Committee-COVID-Vaccine- FAQ-for-Patients_FINAL_2_2_21.pdf American Thyroid Association FAQs If I have celiac disease is it safe for me to receive the Covid vaccine? - Yes. While in older individuals there is a very small increased risk of worse outcomes of infections with coronavirus, the international celiac registry has indicated no increase of severe outcomes. - Additionally, many participants in clinical trials of FDA-approved vaccines self-reported celiac disease, and no severe outcomes were reported. If proper masking and social distancing rules are followed, is it safe to go on this Disney trip? Scenerio A family has been fully vaccinated minus their 10-year-old son and have a trip to Disney planned for later this month. They are flying and with the rise of the Delta variant, the family is particularly concerned for their 10-year-old. Answers - The CDC still recommends for all unvaccinated persons to avoid crowds and avoid close contact with potentially unvaccinated persons or non-household members. - If you are going to travel, federal requirements stand that unvaccinated persons must properly mask, maintain social distancing, and should regularly wash hands or use hand sanitizer when in airports. Masking and social distancing must also be practiced on any public transportation or indoors. - The risk is the greatest for a person who is unvaccinated Will masks be required for elementary schools this coming fall? - The CDC recommends for any person non-vaccinated over the age of two to wear a mask in public settings and around non-household members as well as social distance. - This is still up in the air. States will make their own decisions about their mandates. - Illinois specifically has voted to resume in-person classes this fall with virtual options only available to those who are not yet eligible to receive a vaccine and are under quarantine orders by a local health department. - Some major cities including Philadelphia have left more virtual options open for students. Is it safe to receive an additional 2 dose vaccine for extra protection or peace of mind? Scenerio Question submitter (65, no underlying conditions) received the J&J vaccine on March 6 as it was the appointment she could get. Answers - There are current studies looking into whether or not those who received the J&J vaccine should receive booster shots, but there are currently no recommendations by any US health agency to mix vaccines. - While more studies have been conducted studying the long-lasting effects and effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, J&J recently announced that their single-shot vaccine had even higher effectiveness in generating a strong neutralizing response to the Delta variant than previously seen against the Beta variant with their vaccine. - At this point, it is not recommended and even cautioned against receiving a booster or mixing vaccines; especially because the efficacy of the J&J vaccine, while lower than Pfizer and Moderna, has been continually tested and met or exceeded expectations. What further recommendations can you make for help? Should he see another doctor etc? Scenerio After receiving the vaccine on March 6, the patient has had continued pain in their arm and per your advice, spoke to their family practitioner who was unsure of what to do next. The pain ebbs and flows but sometimes is so great that it awakes the patient from sleep and the pain can radiate down to the elbow. The effects are from the first dose as the patient received their second in the other arm. Answers - If you are have continued pain in your arm, you should consult your primary care physician first - If the pain has been persistent for weeks, there may have been an error in administering your vaccine. If the vaccine is administered too low or the needle is inserted too deeply, the vaccine would have been injected into the bursa space below the muscle. If this is the case, treatment includes physical therapy and possible steroid injections. - In general, if you have persisting symptoms from your vaccine that last for several days or the redness and swelling near your vaccine site worsen you should contact your doctor. - Adverse vaccine reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) If I had a relatively strong case of covid, how well protected am I against Delta and other variants? - Covid antibodies can prevent reinfection in those who have them, but, this immunity varies in length, and all evidence points to longer-lasting immunity from receiving a covid vaccine rather than relying on your antibodies. - A recent study looking at patients with covid antibodies and the vaccine found that the immune system is \"trying to get ahead of the virus\". Dr. Michel Nussenzweig, who ran a recent study following this phenomenon has hypothesized that the body keeps \"reserve armies of antibody-producing cells\" as well as the cells that initially responded to the Covid infection. Some reserve cells, over time, mutate and produce antibodies that are \"better able to recognize new viral strains\". - Another recent study found that neutralizing antibodies in children and adolescents who showed no or mild covid symptoms have a \"broad, effective, and durable\" antibody response that lasts at least four months following infection. How long does covid remain contagious after a patient has died? If they had covid several months before, are they still contagious? Scenerio A funeral director is concerned about their staff's safety while embalming and preparing a body for a funeral. Answers - If the patient died from Covid-19, there is evidence that the infection could be active (meaning the patient could spread the virus) for around thirty days after death. - The staff certainly could be at risk, but there are ways to minimize the risk: avoid using aerosol-generating procedures or make sure there are proper engineering controls and PPE is worn. Postmortem testing is up to the discretion of the coroner, medical examiner, etc. - If an autopsy or embalming process is taking place on someone who was confirmed to have had covid, postmortem testing should be performed to test for covid, influenza viruses, and other respiratory pathogens because it is still unclear exactly how long the virus remains active. Is it safe to return to indoor water aerobics class if I am fully vaccinated? Sometimes there are nearly thirty people in the pool. \"I am willing to wear a mask in the pool.\" - If you are fully vaccinated, the CDC does deem it safe to return to fitness classes, even in larger groups. - The risk of infection is immensely greater for someone who is not fully vaccinated. - DO NOT WEAR YOUR MASK IN THE POOL. If your mask gets wet, it will become more difficult to breathe and will not be as effective. If you are cautious, do your best to social distance yourself from others in the pool. The patient has an underlying condition (Leukemia CLL) and has low antibody levels following their vaccine as a result. The family has two upcoming events, a 22 person outdoor wedding where the only unvaccinated guest is a four-year-old who will be tested and a retirement party with all vaccinated guests in a private room. As a precaution, the patient and their spouse have been wearing masks nearly everywhere they go. Do you have any additional advice for the family in their efforts to protect the patient? - First, in the submitter's planning, it seems as if they have taken the necessary precautions (outdoor space, small gathering, and all but one of the attendees is fully vaccinated) to have a safe event. CDC recommendations state that it is safe for a single unvaccinated person to be maskless at an outdoor small gathering where all others have been fully vaccinated, however it would be wise to require the child to wear a mask because of the immunocompromised guest, even though they are being tested. - Additionally, it would be wise to arrange for the child to be socially distant from the immunocompromised guest while eating as they cannot wear their mask while doing so. The other vaccinated guests do not need to wear masks. - If you are going somewhere that you are unsure if everyone is vaccinated, the immunocompromised individual should wear a mask and continue to social distance. (If the immunocompromised individual is not fully vaccinated they 100% should mask and social distance around non-household members anywhere) - For both events, make sure that all staff either have proof of vaccination or are wearing masks (that will likely be enforced by the restaurant or staffing company but it is good to be certain) - If everyone is fully vaccinated, CDC recommendations state it is safe to have a gathering indoors. What should the patient say if they are asked about their vaccination status? Should they seek out re-vaccination even if they are only able to receive the Moderna vaccine? Scenerio Another patient with leukemia/lymphoma received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine late Feb-mid March and has not developed antibodies as of June 15. The patient's Oncologist/Hematologist suggested the patient receive another round of vaccination as their chemotherapy likely affected their body's response to the vaccine. The patient returned to the clinic where they received their first round and was turned away from re-vaccination. Answers - Receiving a booster or full second round of vaccination is currently not recommended by the CDC or any department of health in the US for anyone. - Ongoing studies are looking into the efficacy and safety of boosters. - Because the patient has not developed antibodies, they should continue to mask and social distance. - While technically you have been vaccinated in the sense that you received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine, because you do not have antibodies, it is as if you were not vaccinated. Are there any updates on vaccine boosters on whether they will be necessary or how soon could we see booster shots being given out; Can someone receive a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine even though it is not yet approved; Should the patient receive a booster shot? If so, which one? - It is currently not recommended by any US health agency to receive a booster shot if you are not immunocompromised, however, ongoing studies are revolving around booster shots, and with Pfizer's request for emergency use authorization for a booster shot you could be able to receive a booster or a second round of vaccinations soon. Pfizer briefed US officials on their request today (yesterday when we record: Monday, July 12, 2021). - Per your WGN interview this morning (yesterday when recording), if you are immunocompromised, they (CDC) are amending their applications to allow a third dose for immunocompromised patients because of the evidence of potentially more severe infection six months post-vaccination. - There is difficulty on this subject as the CDC and FDA still recommend only receiving one round of vaccinations (whether that be one or two doses if you receive the Johnson & Johnson or Pfizer/Moderna vaccine) while Pfizer has been publicly commenting on the potential of reduced immunity in those who received the vaccine that they have seen in a relatively small test group in Israel. - The CDC and the FDA released a joint statement on July 8, 2021, stating that those who are fully vaccinated do not need to receive a booster shot but state they continuously review incoming data and are prepared for booster shots \"if and when science demonstrates they are needed.\" - Dr. Anthony Fauci was quoted saying \"Right now, given the data and the information we have, we do not need to give people a third shot,\" he said. \"That doesn't mean we stop there. ... studies are being done now ongoing as we speak about looking at the feasibility about if and when we should be boosting people.\" If I received the Moderna vaccine initially, can I get the Pfizer booster when it becomes available? - The CDC and FDA currently do not recommend boosters. - Moderna has not made any public statements of reduced immunity for their vaccine. - I was not able to get a clear answer on this question as I was not able to find any public data studying this, but medical professionals that have either received boosters in clinical trials or preemptively have mixed vaccine types, though I have only seen boosters after receiving the J&J vaccine. - We will likely have to wait and see the data coming out of clinical trials. Are Covid variants more deadly than previous strains or are they just more easily spread? - Yes, some variants can be weaker than others, however, they are beaten out by the strong, more deadly and contagious variants. Perhaps it is a scare tactic, but it is warranted and backed up by data. - Your genes and virus genes don't have a goal. The mutations do not occur as a response to a virus \"trying to stay alive\". During replication, a genome can have random copying error(s) that cause mutation(s), which can have positive or negative impacts on the genome. Statistically, mutations usually have weakening effects on the genome, however, in cases like the Delta variant, these mutations have made the variant stronger, meaning more contagious and deadly due to their increased binding efficacy (among other reasons) to our cells. - Also, increased contagion does technically make a variant more deadly on its own, as infecting more people at a higher rate ultimately has led to an uptick in covid deaths. (Seen in the CDC's Covid death tracker) - While Covid deaths were decreasing throughout May, following the Fourth of July weekend, there has been an increasing number of Covid deaths per day. If I have an Ibuprofen allergy (specifically to polyethylene glycol or polysorbate), which vaccine should I receive? - Polyethylene glycol is an inactive ingredient in ibuprofen. If you are unsure of which ingredient in ibuprofen you are allergic to, you should either consult your doctor to find out which ingredient you are allergic to (if you have had an allergy test) or talk to your doctor about getting the J&J vaccine just to be safe. - Polysorbate is confusing. It is listed as an ingredient of ibuprofen on some sites but not others, likely some drug manufacturers add polysorbate as an inactive ingredient and some do not, though I found it listed consistently as an ingredient in Advil. Regardless, if you have a polysorbate allergy you should avoid the J&J vaccine and talk to your doctor about receiving an mRNA vaccine. How do we decipher what we have historically worked through and what are symptoms, while mild, of Covid? Scenerio A patient was vaccinated in February but got Covid in April and had mild symptoms but has now fully recovered. If not for her daughter testing positive for Covid, the patient would have assumed she only had a mild cold. Before Covid, it was common practice to continue working, even in a public space, with a common cold. Answers - If you are unsure, get tested for Covid. It is free! - If you have a fever, do not go to work in person. The CDC advises employees to stay home until at least 24 hours after their fever has subsided. - If you do not have a fever and can socially distance from coworkers and you are physically well enough to go to work, wear a mask if you must go in person. A vaccinated college student is returning to campus in the fall where vaccinations are required, however, because of a heart condition, the student's roommate is medically unable to receive a vaccine. The vaccinated student has celiac which is an autoimmune disease. Is this a safe rooming combination and what steps can be taken to ensure both student's safety with the rise of Covid variants? - Because the student is vaccinated, the risk of infection and severe symptoms are drastically reduced for them. The risk lies on the student who is unable to get vaccinated. - However, with the entire campus required to be fully vaccinated, this creates herd immunity on campus to protect those who are medically unable to receive a vaccine. So, the unvaccinated student should be safe on campus. - The unvaccinated student should take extra precautions when leaving campus around those who may not be vaccinated by wearing a mask, social distancing, and regularly washing their hands. - It is important to note that while far less likely than in unvaccinated individuals, vaccinated persons still can get covid and spread it to others (possibly at a lower rate but still transmissible). The school's administration should make sure that if even a single person on campus displays covid symptoms or tests positive for covid, those medically unable to receive vaccines should be contacted and appropriate actions should be taken to ensure their safety. - The vaccinated student should also take extra precaution when leaving campus to ensure their roommates' safety by wearing a mask indoors when off campus and social distancing outdoors if they are unsure if people around them are vaccinated or not (ex: at the grocery store, getting a haircut, etc.) Couldn't find any specifics or data regarding whether or not a person with celiac and someone who cannot get vaccinated can safely live together so I will defer to your opinion, but I assume with 100% of the campus population vaccinated it should be safe due to herd immunity? Should a patient with Guillain-Barre Syndrome receive a covid vaccination? - The Guillain-Barre Syndrome warning was only added to the Johnson&Johnson/Janssen vaccine. - The good news is that no cases of GSB have been reported in the mRNA vaccines: Moderna and Pfizer, so both of those options are safe for you to take. I am fully vaccinated, is it safe to go to an indoor concert? - If you are fully vaccinated, CDC recommendations do deem it safe to attend indoor concerts. However, with the rise of the Delta variant and none of the approved vaccines in the US being 100% effective, you are still at risk, while much smaller than an unvaccinated person, of becoming infected with Covid-19. - Again, the much, much larger risk is on unvaccinated persons. - The size of the space and crowd is also important. If precautions such as proper room ventilation, social distancing, proof of vaccination, and proper masking for those who are unvaccinated are taken, then your risk of infection is significantly lowered. How effective are face shields? - Face shields on their own are not an effective face covering to prevent the spread of Covid-19 as they were developed for eye protection. - However, a face shield worn as added protection over a properly worn face mask is an effective masking technique. Parents are considering whether or not to send their 38-year-old physically and mentally disabled daughter back to her day program now that their area is in Phase 5. Their daughter is fully vaccinated (Moderna), but only 40% of the staff is vaccinated and not all of the patients are vaccinated. If their daughter does not return, she will lose her spot in the program. Should the parents be concerned for their daughter's safety if they send her back to her program? - Moderna has made no public announcements regarding waning immunity in their vaccine so your daughter is very protected from covid infection as well as severe disease. - Again, the risk mostly falls on those who are unvaccinated. - With only 40% of the staff vaccinated, there are mask mandates in place that must be followed for all unvaccinated staff. - However, because wearing masks may be difficult for some individuals with cognitive, behavioral, or sensory issues there could be some increased risk. - Facilities should be well ventilated and allow for proper social distancing. My 98-year-old mother is on Eliquis, with the vaccine potentiate her medicine, or is it safe for her to receive? - I couldn't find anything about a vaccine exacerbating the effects of a blood thinner, the only advice for what to do before and during vaccination. - It is safe for those on blood thinners to receive the Covid vaccine. - Follow the same steps as other vaccinations you have received. Try to book your vaccination appointment before you take your blood thinner or you can talk to your doctor about skipping a dose. - If you can or cannot go earlier/skip, you should talk to the clinician administering your vaccine about using the smallest needle possible (23-gauge or smaller according to MedPage), and press firmly on the injection site for two minutes following your shot without rubbing. A couple was fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine in February and have a trip planned in September to cross state lines. Should they be concerned about their immunity and should they consider getting a third dose? - It is currently not recommended by any US health agency to receive a booster shot if you are not immunocompromised, however, ongoing studies are revolving around booster shots, this may change in the future. Only immunocompromised patients are advised to receive a third dose of a vaccine. - Concern is being raised over Pfizer's announcement and data coming out of Israel and other countries showing some waning immunity over six months. - Following Pfizer's announcement, the CDC, FDA, and NIH all came out in opposition to Pfizer's statement, and Pfizer has since backtracked. A family is going on a trip to Ireland in two weeks after being fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine two months ago and a family member that is not going is concerned about their safety. Any reassurances or cautions? - Important to note even though this family is vaccinated: Do not travel internationally if you are unvaccinated. - First looking at the family's immunity, having been fully vaccinated two months ago, they are in great shape in terms of covid immunity to infection, as well as severe disease. - When in the airport and on the airplane, federal mandates require masks to be worn. Additionally, you should social distance, wash your hands regularly, and bring disinfecting wipes to clean your seat, tray table, armrests, and seatbelt on the airplane. - Ireland specifically (as of 10:47 am CDT July 14, 2021): 85 infections/ 100k residents reported in the last 7 days. Population ~49.1% fully vaccinated. - While there is a larger spike occurring in the United Kingdom, Ireland has relatively fewer cases. Still, you should remain vigilant and follow all guidelines and mandatory quarantines in place in foreign countries. Are there any reports or findings of any of the Covid vaccines reactivating polio in survivors? Or accelerating the spread of cancer? - While Covid can have similar long-term risks like polio, there have been no reports of covid or a covid vaccine reactivating polio in survivors. - While a cancer patient's antibody response may not be as strong as a two-dose vaccine, they can now get a third shot and there have been no reports of the covid vaccine accelerating the spread of cancers, although infection may be more severe. Is it safe for an expectant mother to go to a wedding and do vaccines affect fertility/pregnancy? - Pregnant people are at a higher risk of severe illness than non-pregnant people. Certain factors increase that risk including being under the age of 25 or having underlying medical conditions. - If the pregnant person was fully vaccinated before pregnancy, - If you are pregnant, you can receive the covid vaccine. J&J does issue a warning of increased chance of blood clots in women under 50. - Based on how mRNA vaccines work, they are not at risk of affecting lactating people or breastfeeding. - *Vaccines have shown no effect on male or female fertility* How soon after a covid exposure can I get tested? - If you have symptoms, get tested as soon as possible. - If you suspect you have been exposed to covid, quarantine for 14 days or until a positive test if you are unvaccinated. Watch for symptoms and if possible distance from other home members. - Tests have shown to be most accurate 5-7 days following exposure however, testing early and multiple times is an effective way to stay vigilant and potentially not spread the virus further. Are children >90% protected after one dose of the mRNA vaccine? If so, why hasn't the CDC changed the dosage as myocarditis is more common after the second shot? - The two-dose vaccines are given in two doses because the first shot is relatively weak compared to the two doses together. - Moderna's vaccine is ~69.5% effective at preventing covid symptoms between the first dose and second compared to 94.1% effective two weeks following the second dose. - Pfizer's first dose is ~52.4% effective at protecting against covid with symptoms between the first and second dose compared to 95% effective two weeks after the second dose. - As of July 12, 2021, myocarditis has been reported in 1,047 cases and myocarditis or pericarditis has been confirmed in 633 cases thus far. - Dosages have not been updated because there have been suspected cases in 0.0007% of people (159,675,163 fully vaccinated/ 1,047 suspected cases x 100%) What percentage of US adults need to be fully vaccinated to ensure the safety of children and those who cannot get vaccinated? - To achieve herd immunity to viral diseases such as Covid, a population must reach at least 70% of fully vaccinated individuals. - However, with such high levels of infection and contagion of variant strains, this number could be as high as 90%. Ideally, everyone who is eligible for a vaccine receives it. "}
