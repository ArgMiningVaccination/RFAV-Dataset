You get a LOT of good information for your money here! It is also important for readers to know that this book is a GREAT introduction to German (and European) thinking about homeopathy and natural medicine. This point of view on healing assumes that bacteria and viruses do not \"cause\" disease, but rather they are the \"results\" of disease. In fact, the German naturopathic model of healing bacteria and viruses play an important evolutionary role, and that conventional medical treatment of these infectious agents do more harm than the microbes themselves. That said, there are certain exceptions to this general rule, though the healing approach to these infectious agents still is to strengthen the person's immune and defense system rather than to attack the microbial agent. The above-described point of view of infectious disease also has deep roots in classical homeopathy, especially Kentian homeopathy. Gentle Medicine creates a comprehensive awareness for a new dimension in medicine, a medicine of the future that can be a reality today. After reading it, you will be able to clearly recognize the correlations and natural laws of health and disease and be able to use them for yourself to achieve absolute health. Joachim -F. Gr\u00e4tz, a classical homeopath from Germany with more than thirty years of clinical homeopathic practice, walks you through how to use natural laws to: cure degenerative and chronic diseases; prevent diseases from ever occurring in the first place; survive and thrive in today's fast-paced world. The author also examines the general decline of human health, our understanding of diseases and how they are diagnosed, how the media manipulates the public, the controversy surrounding vaccinations, and more. Whether you're a physician, a caregiver, someone battling a degenerative and/or chronic condition, or simply want to be proactive about staying healthy, you'll find information and insights you can use with this guide to healing. This work addresses the natural laws and correlations affecting illness and health in a generally understandable way that most are unfamiliar with. Indeed, very few have even an inkling of them because o they are diametrically opposed to their previous knowledge o they have never been revealed before and anywhere else. Nevertheless, everyone should be familiar with them from the bottom up, both for themselves and their families, since they are the key to the health of the individual as well as that of the general public and the entire planet. 652 pages! You will get your money's worth with THIS book! BOOK REVIEW GENTLE MEDICINE: THE TRUE CAUSES OF DISEASE, HEALING, AND HEALTH by Joachim-F. Gr\u00e4tz Reviewed by Francis Treuherz RSHom 2021 copyright 652 pages, paperback Originally published in \"The New Homeopath,\" Journal of the Society of Homeopaths, UK, Spring 2021 This is one of the longest, most intense and rewarding books I have ever read. It should be read and studied by all: students and teachers, newly qualified and veteran homeopaths alike. There is no index but the five-page list of contents should make it easy to find your way through the book. There are copious explanatory footnotes and a bibliography. The 25 charts at the end are in black and white in the paperback but there is a link to a free download of the colour versions. The binding on the paperback, even with so many pages, seems fine. The excellent translation into fluent American English was carried out by professional linguists at [www.translated.com](http://www.translated.com) with help from the author for technical terms. There are many references to other works by the author but they are mainly in German. His amazing and detailed anamnesis form is available as a download. Dr. Joachim-F. Gr\u00e4tz has been a classical homeopath and author for more than 30 years and is known far beyond the borders of Germany. Of course, this book was written before the pandemic and the recent vaccination campaigns. The whole book is based on a highly critical and thoroughly documented review of modern health care and a demonstration of how this can be mitigated by homeopathy and a holistic approach. The 'Chronic Laws' of homeopathy and how they were created by Hahnemann are explained in a fresh and comprehensible way. 'Chronic' is then further delineated through a detailed and innovative explanation of miasms from Hahnemann and from JH Allen. This section is the template for the rest of the book which comprises numerous case studies with their allopathic, personal, and homeopathic stories. They are fascinating to read for their explanations of both sides of the stories, allopathic and homeopathic, and include repertory charts. His most frequently remedies are Sulfur and Medorrhinum. Exacerbating miasms The sheer weight of suppressive allopathic drugging, surgery and other procedures can be depressing and the regular references to vaccinations could be controversial. But at the end of the book Gr\u00e4tz explains: (author's italics) \"I don't see myself as an opponent of vaccination! First and foremost I am a homeopath, and I pour my heart and soul into it. However, vaccine correlations play a central role in homeopathy, especially if you know how to treat chronically: they usually play a central role in the complaints people bring to me. This is because vaccinations can exacerbate existing miasms to an extreme extent and even add completely new ones.\" He aims to provide \"objective information and food for thought.\" He accepts that patients who want to get vaccinated (and to vaccinate their children) have a right to do so, and he will never banish them from his practice. Francis Treuherz MA RSHom FSHom has been in practice since 1984 and worked for the NHS from 1990 to 2003. He is a Fellow of the Society, former editor, and a board member for over 20 years. He is a former Trustee of Homeopathy UK and the Homeopathy Action Trust. He has given many seminars and conference presentations, and taught at homeopathy schools in the UK and Finland. He has written two books: one is on the story of Homeopathy in the Irish Potato Famine and the other, The Genius of Homeopathy presents forgotten stories about Hahnemann; copies are still available. He is an incurable collector of homeopathy books and artefacts.
