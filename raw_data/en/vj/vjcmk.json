The first COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States are messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines, a technology which has been studied for more than a decade. The District is using the COVID-19 Vaccination Plan to distribute available vaccines to priority populations and the general population over several months. The more people who accept a COVID-19 vaccine when it is their turn, the more quickly and effectively we can contain COVID-19 and continue to ReOpen DC. These data outline the administration, coverage, demographics and supply of vaccines in the District and to people who live and work in the District. They help us understand how well the plan is working and guide decision-making for next steps. For more information about COVID-19 vaccine safety, please see the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html). See the [Data Guide](/sites/default/files/dc/sites/coronavirus/page_content/attachments/COVID-19-Vaccination-Data-Guide-2-06-21.pdf) for more information on the data presented here. Vaccination data are scheduled to be released on a weekly basis every Wednesday by 6 pm ET. Data shows weekly trends and includes data through the previous Saturday. "}
