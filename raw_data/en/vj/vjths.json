In most cases, an essential oil is said to have the ability to \"boost\" ones immune system by usually only augmenting one or two key areas.

It is an alarm system given out by your body, reminding you to fix something that went wrong in you. Imagine that you do not feel pain when your foot gets wounded, you will not tend to it, and eventually it will be infected and yea, say goodbye to your foot. This is a condition we call diabetic foot ulcer. However, some pains are an overreaction of your body's alarm system, and hence irritating and debilitating, both fibromyalgia and postherpetic neuralgia are typical examples of such pain. This is where essential oils come into play. Essential oils reduce pain by reducing inflammation and pain-related cytokines (or you could call them \"pain molecules\"). A personal favourite of mine is peppermint essential oil, it contains \"menthol\", which acts as an antispasmodic and a mild analgesic, which helps to reduce pain, pressure and tension, this is a gospel to many of us who suffer from frequent muscle aches. Lavender essential oil contains mildly but active sedative compounds that has been used for pain and pressure relief for centuries. It also contains anti-inflammatory and analgesic property when used topically. Basically, besides taking away the \"pain molecules\", it stimulates the production of \"happy molecules\" - dopamine in your brain.
