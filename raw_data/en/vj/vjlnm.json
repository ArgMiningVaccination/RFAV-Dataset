Her and her team share their story with us below: Ashley \"Cash\" Burks B.K.A. Ashley Banks is a healer, influencer, digital entrepreneur, and investor raised in Baltimore, MD. As a military brat, she was accustomed at a young age to moving around constantly. She never really felt like anywhere was truly home. She was always meeting new people and making new friends. Ashley spent most of her developmental years in Baltimore, MD where she learned how to make something from nothing. Living in an environment full of death and negativity she was able to still see the love in all living things. Growing up in the church, her connection with God aided her in excelling to the next level and not becoming a statistic. Experiencing abuse, rape, and molestation during her youth taught her to question putting her trust into just anyone. Growing up without a father, being raised by a single mom that worked most of the time, and with the support of mainly her grandparent's life gave her no choice but to grow up fast. Even with all the obstacles that were set in her way she knew that there had to be a better quality of life. She began working at the age of 13. Understanding the value of money at a young age enabled her to see the opportunity for a future. Moving out at the young age of 15, she never looked back. Ashley decided to make a career in fashion and that would be her way out of Baltimore. She chose to move forward only trusting God. Gaining recognition around the DMV (DC/MD/VA) area for modeling, she participated in numerous runway shows, as well as promotional modeling and print work. After working with Natalie Graham of The Dollhouse Boutique as a model and junior stylist, she decided to branch out into the behind the scenes world of fashion and began freelance styling at the age of 16. She also co-produced and produced several fashion shows at a young age. At the age of 17, she was acknowledged in the Baltimore Sun newspaper for her style and fashion. After high school, where she studied pre-engineering with plans to be a civil engineer, she took a leap of faith and entered the Passion for Fashion scholarship competition from the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale. After winning second place in the competition, she knew that fashion was the industry she wanted to be in. Ashley attended the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale for Fashion Merchandising, where she gained the tools to build her brand and fashion styling career. While attending the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale, she was recognized by the Dean and President of the university for coordinating \"The Hip-Hop Timeline Runway Show and Event\", one of the largest student-produced fashion shows on campus. This event had well over 1000 attendees and incorporated every student club. Transferring to the Art Institute of Atlanta, she continued to mold her fashion career by coordinating events through her position as The Fashion Group Vice President. She became the editor and coordinator of the first-ever Fashion Group student newsletter. This landed her copywriting jobs and helped her to gain notoriety through her fashion blogging. During her internship with Icon Studios of Atlanta, under the notable Ian Burke she worked as a fashion coordinator with her first all-girl group which moved her into artist development. She also worked on her first major music video productions with clients Ki'loni Lee and Sadiq Fade. While in Atlanta, she coordinated her first major brand campaign with Flat Out of Heels. Consequently, her brand IamYourStylist Creative Services was born. She began to market her services as a Creative Director. IamYourStylist specializes in Brand Development, Graphic Design and Visual Content Creation. IamYourStylist focuses on branding public figures and businesses' by finding their brand identity, creating their professional image and marketing them to the masses. Moreover, Ashley graduated Cum Laude and received Best of Show for her graduate portfolio at the Art Institute of Atlanta. She then decided to move back to Florida, but this time to Miami to finish her studies and continue building her brand. She attended Ai Miami University of Art & Design to study the Design & Media Management master's program which broadened her horizons and welcomed her into the world of branding. While studying at Ai Miami, she began booking more branding work for small businesses and artists. Projects ranged from building brand identities to social media management to website development, logo creation, and project management. As an assistant stylist/ brand manager for celebrity stylist Alessandra Gold, she took her career to the next level by working on larger scale projects. Working with clients such as Kruzin footwear, Steph Lecor, Mucheet Muchette, K Foxx, Jack Daniels \"Jack'N for Beats\", and more. Consequently, being recognized for her creative talents she began to freelance with well-known Miami-based photographers such as Herbert Piramid, TLaniece, Humberto Vidal, Adam Kaplan, Tyson Alan Horne, Tommy Chung, and Maicol Diaz. You can find some of editorial work in Last Daze magazine, Xander magazine, and Vogue Italia. She has also worked on the styling team for Lilyana Montoya at Miami Swim Fashion Week. She eventually went from styling backstage to sitting front row at Miami Fashion Week. After learning how to create content and market it, she wanted to know how to properly pitch the projects for placement so she continued her education into journalism. She then received her master's degree in New Media Journalism from Full Sail University. The journalism degree opened up new avenues into creative direction, media, PR, video-journalism, and video-editing. She has covered many events and worked with clients such as Miami Fashion week, Miami Bridal Fashion Week, Alpina Foods, Wynwood Art walk, Mr. Kream, Small Business Expo, and numerous Poetry/ Open Mic events. She partnered with media company Planet McNair in 2015. Under the Planet McNair umbrella, she was able to work with clients such as Playboy Radio, Dash Radio, Safaree, Dream Doll, Torrei Hart, Rosa Acosta, Karlie Redd, and Master P. For over five years, she has gained recognition for branding in the tobacco and hemp industry. She has been the brand manager and project manager for Fire Grabba, Bulshitt Wraps, and OG Leaf Brand. With her branding and influence, she has helped these brands reach the masses grossing millions in sales. Nevertheless, she has continued to make strides in her modeling career working as a brand ambassador for major brands such as Aldo Shoes, Puma, Tito's Vodka, Red Stripe, Svedka Vodka, Truly, and more. Currently, Ashley has become a powerhouse owning several businesses and continuing to expand into different markets. Her main focus is helping individuals obtain spiritual and financial success. Through her quest for financial freedom and efforts to create equality in various spaces, she has collaborated with many in the pursuit to change the world. She has enabled people of all colors and backgrounds to have access to the tools needed to create financial abundance for themselves and their families. With our evolving economy and the new adaptation of digital currencies, Ashley has made it her business to be a forerunner in this transition in order to educate others. The effects of the pandemic has propelled her to find ways to help individuals heal and build for their generational line. With the lack of jobs and arising mental health effects, due to the current state of the planet, she has found it imperative to make a stance for those who don't have a voice or know where to start. Global Cash Investors is a business founded to focus on building generational wealth and financial stability globally. The company is geared towards helping you build or broaden your investment portfolio. They assist individuals in educating themselves in order to make profits in the foreign exchange market, stocks, and cryptocurrency. The company also helps individuals gain success in the industry of network marketing, which is an industry that has generated some of the youngest millionaires to date. Her most prized venture is her holistic healing and wellness company The Spiritual Detox Shop (SDS). In 2020, she was diagnosed with Fibroids and a cyst on her ovaries, which is known to produce cancer and is an illness that threatened her ability to bare children. She was looking to find holistic ways to heal herself since she was afraid of the doctors recommendation for an invasive surgery that could open her up to further illness. She also suffered from mild depression due to this. While doing the research, she found that many woman had the same issue and there was a need for this information to be shared. She did sessions with a healer that robbed her of $4500 and determined that we need a safe place we can go to truly heal. She was able to unlock her healing abilities after connecting with her higher self and doing shadow work. She then found what was needed to heal herself and created Spiritual Detox to spread knowledge of holistic healing and offer healing products and services to our communities. The Spiritual Detox Shop (SDS) is a holistic healing and spiritual guidance company that focuses on helping individuals detox the mind, body, and spirit. They offer all-natural holistic healing products to detox, heal, and replenish their clients from the inside out. They also offer healing retreats, sound healing, meditation, yoga, and diet/meal plans to aid individuals in their journey. Ashley is a cultivated individual who has utilized her life experiences to create her own lane. This has enabled her to travel and work abroad on various enriching projects. With nine countries under her belt, her quest to becoming a global citizen and sharing her gifts with the world is empowering her to truly make a global impact. We all face challenges, but looking back would you describe it as a relatively smooth road? When building any dream, there will be obstacles. During the pursuit of my passion, I was faced with a language barrier while doing work in Mexico. I knew my Spanish vocabulary was not vast but I did not let that stop me! I made friends with the locals and started practicing Spanish daily. I can definitely give thanks to high school Spanish, Google Translate and Duolingo for getting me in the door. Now I feel more confident when networking/building my businesses in any country. As you know, we're big fans of The Spiritual Detox Shop.
