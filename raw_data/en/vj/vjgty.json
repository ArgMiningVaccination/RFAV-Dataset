HPV vaccine protects against infection with the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause several types of cancer in both men and women. The vaccine also prevents most genital warts and cervical precancers. Gardasil 9, which protects against 9 HPV types, is the only HPV vaccine currently in use in the United States. What Cancers Does HPV Cause? HPV can cause oropharyngeal (back of mouth and throat), cervical, penile, anal, and vulvar cancers. HPV is estimated to cause nearly [36,500 cases of cancer](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/cases.htm) in men and women every year in the United States. HPV vaccination can prevent 33,700 of these cancers by preventing the infections that cause them. Who Should Get HPV Vaccine? When Should They Get It? All children age 9-12 years, both boys and girls, should get two doses of HPV Vaccine, given 6-12 months apart. Early protection works best. That's why HPV vaccine is recommended earlier rather than later, since it protects children best when given before they ever have contact with the virus. Teens and young adults should be vaccinated too. Everyone through age 26 years should get HPV vaccine if they were not fully vaccinated already. Some adults age 27 through 45 years who were not already vaccinated might choose to get HPV vaccine after speaking with their doctor about their risk for new HPV infections and the possible benefits of vaccination for them. How Well Do These Vaccines Work? HPV vaccination works extremely well. - Since HPV vaccination was first recommended in 2006, infections with HPV types that cause most HPV cancers and genital warts have dropped 88% among teen girls and 81% among young adult women. - Fewer teens and young adults are getting genital warts. - HPV vaccination has also reduced the number of cases of precancers of the cervix in young women. - The protection provided by HPV vaccines lasts a long time. People who received HPV vaccines were followed for at least about 12 years, and their protection against HPV has remained high with no evidence of decreasing over time. Is the HPV Vaccine Safe? HPV Vaccine is very safe. Over 15 years of monitoring have shown that HPV Vaccines are very safe and effective. Like all vaccines, scientists continue to monitor vaccines to ensure they are [safe and effective](https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/vaccinesafety.html). Where Can I Find These Vaccines?
