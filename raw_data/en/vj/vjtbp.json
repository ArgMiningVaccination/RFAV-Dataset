Albrtton 16, and Paul Lenard Jones, 19, on onecounteach of first-degree murder and one count each of attempted robbery with a firearm. Assistant State Attorney Ralph Grabel. who presented evidence for the state. said both teens will be tried as L43 1 tic\"This was a very short deliberation,\" Grabel said \"No, it doesn't surprise me, because I think the evidence was very strong -strong enough to try them as adults.' Albritton and Jones could face the death penalty if found guilty, but Grabel said the decision whether to seek the death penalty is up to State Attorney Len Register Police say Albritton and Jones drove be- hind the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house on the 1900 block of Northwest First Avenue Jan,. 17 with the intent to rob UF graduate Ronald Worth Willis and some friends he had just dropped off from his car.

The University of Florida is an EqualOpportunity Affirmative Action fIstitution F O U R FEBRUARY 15, 1990Saturday; Nobel Laureate Varmus To Speak PusoaA Local theater groups stage a sudden reverse By MaitI Upton Valentine's Day brings Gainesville theater audiences the chance to see two love stories, but with a twist Romance, Romance, produced by the Hippodrome, will be per- formed at UF's Constans Theater, while the Florida Players, traditionally grounded at the Constant, will present Com Back to the 5 and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean at the Hippodrome's mainstage The obvious question is. Why are these companies playing musi- cal theaters Hippodrome Artistic Produc- ing Director Mary Hausch Intro- duced the switch to Dr. Judith Williams, chairof the University Theater Department, last Sep- tember. Williams, also the direc- tor of Jimmy Dean, reacted enthusiastically to the Idea. Hausch knew that Romance -an extravagantly engineered musi- cal -would work better at the Constant, which seats 200 more prodcan people than the Hippodrome and allows for a pit orchestra. Conveniently, Jimmy Dean requires precisely that intimate atmosphere which the Hippodrome offers -its small stage, surrounded by the audience on three sides, is so close you can almost reach out and touch the actors \"Both of the theaters are limited,\" says Gwen West, costume designer for Jimmy Dean, \"so trading places will allow for flexibility in the programs.\" The benefits extend to the audience as well. Hausch notes that \"our subscribers o'VE ANN STOD0D Isn't It romnuwc: Stew Graji, Ellen Zachos, J. Jonathan Austin and Wendy Woods are featured in the ippodbrome's T0I Romance, Romance -at the Constans Theater. now have the chance to visit a different theater as Hippodrome regulars journey to the Constans to see Romance. Hausch hopes that during its stint on campus, the play also will expose students to the com- pany and bring them downtown in the future. Likewise, a sojourn in the community may draw a mor diversified audience for the Florida Players Staging the production ina different theater may pose some adjust- ment problems for the cast and crew, but playing at the Hippodrome will seem familiar to at least one member, LaurenCaldwell, who recently returned from an internship there in the fall. Caldwell is playing the lead character Sissy for her thesis role, as part of her work toward an MFA degree \"It's always been a play that's appealed to me,\" Caldwell says, \"because of its good, solid roles for women. The story highlights female characters from 1955 and 1975, following a 20-year reunion that focuses on the night James Dean died. Originally, the Florida Players production was to open the same night as Romance, but when One Flew Over theCuckoo's Next won its way into the Regional Festival, the schedule was pushed back a week Caldwell fne it may be fortunate for sales that the shows no longer are opening together, though she's confi- dent Jimmy Dean, with its ex- posure at the Hippodrome, would do well regardless Romance also should make a strong showing, and much of the house undoubtedly will be filled by young couples Mark Sexton, Associate Director of Development at the Hip- podrome, hopes that the promo- tion of special Valentine's packages (available at the Hip- podrome Booth in the Oaks Mall) will boost sales and help the intense fund-raising efforts of the company Other promo- tions include the chance to win a romantic dinner for two. If all this sounds a bit commercial, remember that the end will jus- tify the means As Sexton points out, \"If we don't reach our goal of $150,000 by the end of the year, the Hip- podrome will be forced to close its doors after 17 years of cultural service to the community. That would be a shame \" Romance, Romance offers a special preview tonight, and officially opens Friday The play will run through March 4, and ticket prices range from $12 to f1, with a discount price of $6 for senior citizens and students (45 minutes before showrime) Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean opens February 23 and nli play through March 3 Student tickets are 25 cents (with a fee card) and $6 50 for the general public Auacina ricsjsG Macintosh Prices Just Got Lower!

You tell him to leave, rom. Moses in the Bulrnhshe. (Demo tape, available at Hyde & Zeke and Schoolkids' Records): Pat Well, I can't find the tape, but I probably wouldn't like it anyway Tom Whoops, left it in the truck. I bet I listened to the tape and liked it aright -they've cleaned up their sound and they now have spacious 32-track recording (note to the uninitiated, this band used to be the Smegmas, for whom Pat was lead vocalist during their brief speed-metal phase), but there're a couple of decent spots of improvisational noise and a neat song in lilting 3/4 time. We can reviewthe lyric bookit'sright here .Pat. No Raw Power Time to Kill (Rotten Records, PO Box 2262, Covina, CA 91722-8262): Tom If probably wring Yng's scrawny, egomaniacal neck within minutes So this is the next best thing -speed-freak music to butter toast and to hate the government by, with muchoexces- sivo guitar leads Pat Yeah, if hoarse Italian thrash metal sounds like your bag, you'll warm up to this real quick Nice raw produc- fion sets it a bit apart from your usual denim hair-farmer music Tom. Pat says they sounded the samein'82,and why would he lie? Grant Hart Intolerance: Pat Gee, Tom, this album sounds even worse than it looks, and it looks really horrible How I wish songs like the first track, 'All My Sen- ses,\" never existed Almost destroys my faith in mustc entire- ly. I hate it. Tom Pat is now chid- ing the album-cover photo of Grant Hart, poking at his \"big, beady\" eyes and calling him \"junkie \" I dunno -\"All My Sen-ses' is light, with a lot of organ and a verse riff real close to that of Tom Petty's \"Refugee,\" which is OK, but maybe I've got the hometown Heartbreaker on the brain since that show, which was moving. Grant fart was always the coolest member of Husker Du, and the next song, \"Now that You Know Me,\" could be Neil Diamond circa \"Cherry Cherry \" Look out, harmonica solo! I like this Pat The coolest Husker was the guy with the hai dlebar mus- tache I can only loathe this the longer it plays Utter contemptible dreck The song \"Fanfare in D Major\" sounds exactly like bad Husker DO meets 'Come on Eileen\" by Dexy's Midnight Run- ners 7 Seconds Sonufforce Revolution (Restless Records)- Pat: Weak in every sense Whimper, jangle, whoosh goes the music, vomit, punch, hate goes Pat I feel better with all this utter crap to reviewI was beginning to worry about the state of music, but lot I am rewarded with some of the most unlikable, insipid drivel ever to grace your stereo, Tom Tom All the talk about 7 Secs mellowing into a U2 derivative to get a back door entrance to college-radio stardom has some merit They sound like they should be doing a Miller beer commercial soon, straight-edge philosophy or not Pat They sound like they should have given up the ghost 10 years ago Screaming Jay Hawkins Feast of the Mau-Mau Edsel -British import available at Vamp): Pat ScreamingJay Hawkins was doing crated punk psychobilly soul blues about a million years ago, and any reissue is surely worthy of being snapped up today by anyone with any kind of taste You'll laugh, you'll cry, f'll be- come part of you and you'll probably cook and eat your fam-ly Highly recommended Tom The two discs here wereorginally two separate a l bums, on live, one %tudio Mory of tsou believe there's no way somtWs blues singer could possibly be more lewd, crude or deranged than say, Motley Crue You're wrong I refer you to 'Bite It\" or 'Con- slipation Blues\" or 'Feast of the Mau-Mau,\" where you have to scoop out the eyes of a fly flying backwards, and that's just the OF petier Plus, Jay sings plaintive, straightforward ballads like 'I LoveYou,\" which isreallysubver sive, 'cut you start wondering who or what he'd make such a proclamation to, or what the line \"My love has no eyes' really means Maybe it's the fly Pat Most people have probably heard \"I Put a Spell on You\" in that TV beer commercial, and if that does anything for you there's a wealth of worthy work beyond it Don't deny yourself, check this out Sl Acda I GllWery Music SUICIDE STREET YOUR SUiPT Wi WIMW SPOT16HT Thurgood Marshall, is known Civil Rights\" for winning thirtytwo of thirty-five caref' which he argued before the United States Supreme Court In 1967, Marshall became the first black man appointed as Justice of the U S Supreme Court '11' ' v l-.a BLitk or Adverfsino run is a pulic serc co or ohn i poo enj ) 1 ' i 1 ' j L N-Nfl. t jj of'a., , k-IPIZZA E SPECIALIZING IN PIZZA'S & G 0 ITALIAN SUBS WE DELIVER FREE 4320 S.W. 20th AVE. 335-2575 Lg. 16\" Garlic Bread ILg. 16' Pizza Cheese Pizza 12P ,, with I Th, OWao do., o ol~ V1 J m \"OH ~ 4 n*d ooo f , I n *,b uM, Cofjron Not Y~.I I I;l Cop Buy 2 12\" chose 6 pk.
