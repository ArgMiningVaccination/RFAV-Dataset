The theme of the nobility of the human being runs continuously through [the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed writings](https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts). This is not to deny the existence of a lower nature. Within all of us are traits acquired over millennia of evolution that we share with the animal kingdom. But many patterns of behaviour prevalent among animals are not becoming of a human being. 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 states: \"In man there are two natures; his spiritual or higher nature and his material or lower nature. In one he approaches God, in the other he lives for the world alone. Signs of both these natures are to be found in men.\" ['Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1, Paris Talks](https://www.bahai.org/r/165303977) Each one of us has the potential to reflect the attributes of God. This is the meaning of man being created in the image of God. \"For in him are potentially revealed all the attributes and names of God to a degree that no other created being hath excelled or surpassed.\" [Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, The Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdqan](https://www.bahai.org/r/349669438) We are able to reflect divine attributes to the extent that we cleanse the mirrors of our hearts and minds through prayer, the study and application of the sacred scriptures, the acquisition of knowledge, efforts to improve our conduct and to overcome tests and difficulties, and service to humanity. Among the forces that assist us to cultivate the spiritual qualities latent within us\u2014such as kindness, justice, truthfulness, and trustworthiness\u2014are the love of God, attraction to beauty, and thirst for knowledge. The operation of these and other edifying forces contribute to strengthening our sense of purpose, impelling us both to transform ourselves and to contribute to the transformation of society. We all have the capacity to recognise God's love and reflect it towards [His creation](/beliefs/god-his-creation). \"What a power is love!\" said 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1. \"In the world of existence there is indeed no greater power than the power of love. When the heart of man is aglow with the flame of love, he is ready to sacrifice alleven his life.\" ['Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1, Paris Talks](https://www.bahai.org/r/508098000) Intimately connected to love is attraction to beauty. At one level, this attraction is manifested in our delight at [the natural world](/beliefs/god-his-creation/nature), in our engagement with, and appreciation of, the arts and music, and in our response to the elegance of an idea or a scientific theory. At another level, attraction to beauty underlies our search for order, meaning, and transcendence in the universe. The thirst for knowledge impels each person to seek out a fuller understanding of reality in all its dimensions\u2014of his or her own character, of society, of the operation of spiritual forces, and of the physical universe, to name but a few. 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 states: \"The first teaching of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h is the duty incumbent upon all to investigate reality. What does it mean to investigate reality? It means that man must forget all hearsay and examine truth himself, for he does not know whether statements he hears are in accordance with reality or not. Wherever he finds truth or reality, he must hold to it, forsaking, discarding all else; for outside of reality there is naught but superstition and imagination.\" ['Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1, The Promulgation of Universal Peace](https://www.bahai.org/r/502326955) Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h has written that \"man should know his own self and recognize that which leadeth unto loftiness or lowliness, glory or abasement, wealth or poverty\", [Tablets of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, Tar\u00e1z\u00e1t](https://www.bahai.org/r/420808045) and, elsewhere, that \"if we ponder each created thing, we shall witness a myriad perfect wisdoms and learn a myriad new and wondrous truths.\"Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, The Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys Notes Exploring this topic The Human Soul The Rational Soul Life and Death Degrees of Spirit Heaven and Hell Quotations Articles and Resources Exploring related articles Bah\u00e1'\u00ed World News Service Prayer awakens feelings of solidarity, enriches collective life Bah\u00e1'\u00ed World News Service Why religion is in the spotlight again Bah\u00e1'\u00ed World Replacing the Sword with the Word Bah\u00e1'\u00ed World News Service Religion and the integration of new arrivals into Canadian society bahai.org Prayer What Bah\u00e1'\u00eds Believe Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h and His Covenant The Life of the Spirit God and His Creation Essential Relationships Universal Peace What Bah\u00e1'\u00eds Do Response to the Call of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h Devotional Life Family Life and Children Youth Institutional Capacity Involvement in the Life of Society "}
