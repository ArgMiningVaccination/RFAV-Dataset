Microfluidic devices provide potential inexpensive platforms for high-throughput screeni ng with the advantages of preci se liquid handling, ability to control cell culture microe nvironment, and reduced reagents and cells. Because a mixture of drugs or chemical compounds can often treat diseases more effectively or act synergistically in certa in cellular pathways, a device capable of screening the combinatorial effects of multip le compound exposures on cells is highly desirable. To this end, a novel method to monolithically fabricate 3-D microfluidic networks was developed, and based on this fabrication technology, th e first cell culture device with an integrated combinatorial mi xer was constructed. The proof-of-concept chip having a three-input combinatorial mi xer and eight individually isolated micro culture chambers was fabricated on silicon utilizing the surf ace micromachining of Parylene C (poly(chloro-p-xylylene)). Un like other 3-D microflu idic fabrications, multilayer bonding process was favorably obvi ated. By incorporating several microfluidic overpass structures to allow one microfluidic channel to cross over other microfluidic channels, the combinatorial mi xer generated all the combinations of the input fluidic streams. Cell culturing on -chip was successful, and the ability to simultaneously treat arrays of cells with different combinations of compounds was demonstrated. To facilitate cell-based assay, another combinatorial cell array device was fabricated on glass with incorporated me mbrane. Characterization of the combined vi compound concentration profile at each ch amber with a fluorescence method was developed. We demonstrated functionali ty of the quantitative cell-based assay by screening three different com pounds' ability to reduce cytot oxicity of hydrogen peroxide on neuron cells and also assaying combinator ial exposures of three chemotherapeutic agents on breast cancer cells. The 3-D microf luidic fabrication process was extended to construct multilayer microfluidic device with integrated membrane . Applications of microfluidic devices for marine microbi ology were demonstrated. Based on the capabilities demonstrated in this work, devices with high-density cell array and integrated high-input combinatorial mixer can be constr ucted. At the same time, the technology has general applicability for building complex 3- D microfluidic devices, which can broaden the applications for current lab-on-a-chip systems. vii Table of Contents Chapter 1: Cell Culture and Cell-Based Assays ................................................................. 1 1.1 Introduction to Cell Culture and Platform s ........................................................... 1 1.2 Need for High-Throughput Cell Culture, Cell-Based Assay and Combinatorial Screening ..................................................................................................................... 7 1.3 Technology for High Throughput Screening....................................................... 11 Chapter 2: L ab-on-a-Chip and Microfluidic Systems....................................................... 15 2.1 Introduction ......................................................................................................... 15 2.2 Fabrication Technologies for Microfluidics ........................................................ 2.3 Microfluidic Process ........................................... 29 2.4 for Biology ............................................................................ 32 2.4.1 Controlling M icroenvironment Using Microfluidic Flow.................... 32 Cellular Analysis Using Microfluidic 34 Microf luidic Culture and Cell-Based Assay Systems ................... 35 2.5 Microfluidic Phenom ena Related to Cellular Studies ......................................... 37 2.5.1 Lam inar Flow........................................................................................ 3 : 3-D Microfluidic Network Fabrication: Making Cell Culture Array on Silicon with Integrated Combinatorial Mixer ............................................................................... 43 3.1 Introduction ......................................................................................................... 46 3.2.2 and Fluidic Testing.................................................. 52 3.2.4 Testing Parylene C as Suitable Substrate for Cell Culture ................... 54 3.2.5 Microf luidic Cell Culture ..................................................................... 54 3.2.6 Integrated Com binatorial Mixer for Cell Treatment............................. 56 3.3 Results and Discussion ........................................................................................ 57 3.3.1 Device Fabrication and Co m binatorial Mixer Testing ......................... 57 3.3.2 Parylene C as for Cell Culture ........................................... 62 3.3.3 Microf luidic Cell Culture ..................................................................... 63 3.3.4 Integrated Com binatorial Mixer for Cell Treatment............................. 65 3.4 Conclusion ........................................................................................................... 66 Chapter 4: Com binatorial Cell Assay Devi ce on Glass with Membrane-Based Cell Culture Chamber............................................................................................................... 68 ix 4.1 Introduction ......................................................................................................... 68 4.2 Experimental ....................................................................................................... 72 4.2.1 Device Design ....................................................................................... 72 4.2.2 Device Fabrication ................................................................................ 78 Device Packaging Operation 82 4.2.5 Com ................................

Cell culture has been used extensively as a model system for biology, disease, and therapeutic s. It is applie d across the discipli nes of genetics, immunology, cancer, medicine, vaccine producti on, tissue engineering, and countless other applications. The cell culture technique was devel oped over a century ago by Dr. Ross Granville Harrison in 1907 [1]. Harrison was working in experi mental embryology and devised a method to culture and obs erve frog embryo nerve fiber growth in vitro . This influential technique was gradually refined, and used in primary explants for the next 50 years. Several developments in the 1950s popul arized the cell culture technique. The use of trypsin allowed adherent cells to be di ssociated from surface so subculturing of cell lines can be done convenientl y. The use of cells to grow virus and use the virus for vaccine production has driven advancement in cell culture technology. Development of antibiotics made it eas ier to prevent the cell culture from contamination. One major breakthrough occurred in 1952 with the establis hment of the first human cell line, HeLa. George Otto Gey used cervical cancer tissu es from patient, Henrietta Lacks (hence the name HeLa), to create an immortal cell line. This laid the foundation for research in this field as HeLa rapidly became adopted in numerous labs for cancer studies and polio vaccine testing and development. The abilit y to grow human cells also stimulated interest in the use of cells as biologica l models and the use of human tissue for 2 developing cell lines. More cell lines were established an d researchers were able to develop growing media suitable for different cell lines. Cell culture for researchers became a more accessible technique as many of the cell lines, reagents and culture vessels were reliably manufactured and becam e available commercially. For example, the American Type Culture Collection (AT CC) currently has over 4,000 cell lines. In general, cells for culturing can be divided into three categories: primary, secondary, and continuous cell lines. Primar y cells are directly extracted from tissues, isolated by either mechanical methods such as dissection and filtration or chemical methods with use of enzymes such as tryps in, collagenase, or DNa se. These cells can survive outside of their original environmen t for some time but do not have the capacity to proliferate and will eventual ly die. While primary cells can be laborious to obtain and maintain, primary cells often represent the be st biological model because they closely resemble the properties of their parent tissu e. Secondary cells, like primary cells, are derived from tissues, but secondary cell lines have the capability to divide a limited number of times before senescence, the cell 's loss of ability to divide by genetically determined events. MRC-5 is a type of secondary cell that is derived from tissues of human lungs. It has capability to double approximately 50 times before dying and has been used in studies such virus infection [2 ]. Continuous cell lines are able to grow continuously. Continuous cell lines are usuall y derived from tumor cells that have an unstable chromosome number and have unde rgone transformation such as loss of function of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Cells can also be induced to become immortalized by transfection with genes such as SV40 large T antigen, which affects retinoblastoma (Rb) and p53 tumo r suppressor proteins [3]. Another method to establish 3 a continuous cell line is by indu cing cells to express telome rase. This prevents the progressive shortening of telomeres which normally leads to cell a poptosis after several generations [4]. While continuous cell lines ca n lose some of the cell properties (such as loss of contact inhibition) in vivo , or even gain certain f unctions (such as continuous proliferation), continuous cell lines are gene rally easier and less expensive to maintain than primary and secondary cells and offer an unlimited source of identical of cells. A wide selection of continuous cell lines has been developed and researchers can choose a particular type suitable for their specific study. Cell lines are generally maintained inside a cell incubator with a defined temperature and gas mixture (commonly 37oC and 5% CO 2). Culture vessels are flasks, petri dishes or well plates made up of glass or disposable plastics. Polystyrene is the most common plastic in the cell culture lab today. Polystyrene is hydrophobic and therefore requires a surface treatment, such as gas plasma, to provide a suitable substrate for cell attachment. Cultured cells are either grown in suspension or adherent cultures. Most of the cells derived from tissue require adherence to a surface, while some cells such as lymphocytes or sperm cells can be grown in suspension. Some anchorage-dependent cells can readily attach to glass or treated plastics, while others require attachment factors such as collagen, fibronectin, laminin and poly-L lysine . Each cell line is grown in a unique media consisting of the necessary growth factors, a regulated pH, a specific balanced salt concentration, and nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, vitamins and carbohydrates. Serum is commonly used to supply cell culture with growth factors, adhesion factors, lipid s and hormones. Most sera are derived from fetal bovine, 4 calf, adult horse and human. Serum-free medi a is available but is more expensive and requires a different formulati on for different cell lines. Cells should be handled caref ully to avoid contaminants. When taken outside of the incubator, cells should be handled in a laminar flow hood, where a constant flow of filtered air prevents contamination. Th e laminar flow hood can have two flow configurations. Horizontal flow hoods have f iltered air directly blowing at the worker. Vertical flow hoods blow filtered air from th e top of the hood down to the work surface. When working with cell cultures, reagents, containers and any other to ols such as pipette and pipette tips need to be sterile to prev ent contamination. Other aseptic techniques such as cleaning the work surface with biocide before use and preventing cross- contamination between bottles should be fo llowed closely. During the culture process the media has to be changed to replenish the nutrients for cells. For adherent cells, this can be done by aspirating the existing media and replacing it with new media. For suspension cells, the cells are centrifuged to se diment the cells and the media is replaced. Some cells lines continuously gr ow and can fill the culture ve ssels to reach confluency so subculturing to split cells and transfer cell s to new vessel is necessary. For suspension cells, pipetting is used. For adherent cells, cells are washed to remove medium or serum and incubated with a trypsin solution to cleave the bonding between the cells and substrate so cells can be collected in susp ension. Depending on cell types, some cells can also be suspended by using cell scrapers. Cells can then be diluted and reseeded. Cells can be stored for years using cryopreservation. This creates a \"back-up\" of cells to protect against genetic drift, contamination, or an unexpected discontinuity of cell line such as senescence or equipment failure. Cr yogenic storing can be achieved by placing 5 cells in a container w ith media and cryoprotectant, typica lly dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or glycerol. The containers are stored at cryogenic temperatures (below 130oC) by placing them in liquid nitrogen or liquid nitrogen vapor. Using cells as a model system has several advantages. Cells are maintained in a controlled environment with defined pH, temper ature, osmotic pressure and gas mixture. Variations that occur in vivo are avoided, making cell cultu re suitable for systematic studies. Cells can be exposed to media w ith specific nutrient, protein and hormone concentrations. The duration of this exposure can be controlled. As opposed to use of animals as models, the use of cells is more humane and effi cient. Unlike using tissue or animal model, cell lines are a homogeneous gro up of cells and offer the ability to study cell responses with reduced variations due to inhomogeneity in side a tissue. Experiments using cell culture can be replicated as the same cell lines can be used across different labs. Cells can be directly exposed to tested compounds such as drugs. As a result, lower amounts of precious compounds are needed than in vivo where the majority of the compounds are lost or delivered to body parts not under investigation. On the other hand, using cell culture has so me drawbacks. Great care must be taken to avoid contamination by bacteria, yeast or other cell lines a nd expertise is needed to perform cell culture experi ments under aseptic conditions. Also, great attention must be paid to assess the biologi cal relevance of cell culture experiments. While primary cells are taken directly from tissues, they have been extracted out of their original environment and continuous cell lines have undergone transformati on. Some cell-cell interactions that occur between different types of cells may be lost and effects by endocrine and nervous systems are absent. Also, unlike cells in vivo , cellular metabolism 6 in cultured cells is dominated by glycolysis and the citric acid cycle only has a minor role. Cultured cells may also have genetic and phenotypic instability as some cells may differentiate and produce heterogeneity in a population. Theref ore, the overall health and fidelity of the cell line needs to be consta ntly monitored. Straightforward methods include observing the cell morphology and c ounting to determine growth rate. Expression of specialized functions by cells can be checked by running polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or immunol ogical assays. In addition, most of the cells are maintained in serum, which is poorly defined and can vary from batch to batch. Despite these limitations, cultured cells still express certain specialized functions that are representative of the in vivo model and with proper design of experi ment, they can be used effectively. The use of cell culture ha s numerous applications. It provides a good model for studying basic biology and biochemi stry. In these areas, cells have been used to study replication and transcription of DNA, pr otein synthesis, cell metabolism, RNA processing, differentiation, apoptosis, intr acellular signal tr ansduction, membrane trafficking and many other processes. Vi rology proved to be one of the initial applications of cell cu lture because of the stringently controlled growing conditions and standardization of cell lines for culture and a ssay of viruses [1]. Cell culture has been used for virus detection in the clinical set ting and for basic science research of viral infections. Furthermore, cell cultures have been used to produce antiviral vaccines including polio, rabies, and hepatitis. In addition to vaccine production, cell culture can be used to produce other products in large sc ale. Cells can be engineered to produce monoclonal antibodies, insulin and hormones fo r medical use. Rese arch is continually underway to grow cells into tissue for tissue grafts or organ replacement. Embryonic and 7 adult stem cells have been investigated to control the differentiation and development of these cells. Cultured cells can also be used to test the to xicity of compounds such as cosmetics. In addition, they can be used to study how those compounds affect the growth and health status of certain cells such as liver cells. Because cancer cells can be cultured or normal cells can be transformed to become cancerous, cell culture has been used extensively in cancer research. Culture cells can be used to screen for potential cancer drugs and to study drug mechanisms and interact ions. Cell-based screening is important in drug development for the pharmaceutical industry. 1.2 Need for High-Throughput Cell Culture, Cell-Based Assay and Combinatorial Screening Cell-based assay has been applied to various fields. It has been integral to drug discovery and development. Various drugs for treating different diseases all require extensive screening to be done. Biochemica l/molecular assays and cell-based assays have both been used for screening. Biochemi cal assays often require specific targets for screening, and chemicals are tested for their abi lity to modify the targets. This is often done by testing for ligand binding. For example, the compounds are evaluated for their ability to stimulate or inhibit certain kina ses or receptors, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). It is also important to test for the selectivity of the potential compound because a compound that acts on an undesirable target can induce harmful results. For example, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) can be used to test for protease activity. In su ch method, an acceptor fluores cence molecule is bound to one side of a substrate while a donor that can transfer energy to the acceptor molecule is 8 bound to the other side. Upon protease cleavage of the substrate, the distance between the donor and acceptor molecules increases a nd the fluorescence fr om the donor becomes detectable. This method can also be used fo r screening protein-prot ein interactions. Cell-based assay has received increased atte ntion and has several advantages over ligand binding assay on specific targets. Cell-based screening can be miniaturized to reduce cost and provide \"information rich\" data [5]. Advances have produced assays that are while still providing sophistic ated results. While biochemical assay requires a specific target, cell-based assay a llows the potential com pound to interact with several targets. Livi ng cells are the ultimate targets of all drugs and using them as models can be more efficient than focusing on isolated genes or proteins. Cell-based assay can test for multiple targets and reveal the effect of a whole transduction pathway. Novel target sites and signal pathways can al so be discovered during the assay. The development of different cell lines from sp ecific tissues makes it convenient to screen drugs for multiple types of cancer [6]. Cell- based screening can be performed in a high- throughput manner, which is difficult and cos tly to achieve with animal models. The number of new chemical entities that can be potential drugs and number of possible drug targets have in creased, and this requires mo re screening to be done. Development in combinatorial chemistry has generated a huge libra ry of potential drug candidates that need to be tested and it has been predicted that combinatorial chemistry will generate as many as 1030-1050 small molecules to be screen ed [7]. Advancements in genomic, proteomic and metabolomics have re sulted in an increase in new chemical entities. Human antibodies, which have be en used as drugs, can be screened and optimized from a huge library of antibodies produced fr om phage, mouse antibodies 9 recombined with human antibody genes, and human antibodies raised in mouse grafted with human immune cells. Drug targets are usually enzymes and receptors and current drugs only address a total of about 500 molecu lar targets [8]. A lthough most of the targeted receptors are in the G protein-coupled receptor family, other drug targets include DNA, ion channels, nuclear receptors and hormone s. The number of possible targets that drugs can act on is increasing as new genes and their associated functions are discovered. DNA sequencing projects have revealed novel genes with ch aracteristics similar to G protein-coupled receptors. Th ere are at least 1,000 of thes e, and many research programs are underway to reveal the functions of th ese new receptors as well as analyze their potential to become drug target s. In a drug screening, panels of compounds are screened using various in vitro and cell-based assays to iden tify compounds that produce positive results, or \"hits.\" Those compounds are eith er subject to more co mplex characterization or are modified to produce more specific co mpounds for screening. In the beginning of 1990s, a large screening program would gene rate 200,000 data points, which rose to 5-6 million in mid 1990s, 50 million in 2000, and is still rising [8]. The pharmaceutical companies are also driven by the desire to lower cost while increasing efficiency. A potential drug is costly to develop from the hit discovery stage to the clinical trials, and many compounds fail at the clinical trial stag e. Therefore, better screening techniques are needed to lower late stage failure of drugs. Besides compound screening for drug discovery and development, high-throughput cell-based assays have applications in other fields. One obvious field is basic cellular biology research. Some areas requiring screening fo r different factors include identifying inhibitors or promoters of cell adhesion, signaling molecu les in inflammatory 10 responses, transcription factors, growth fact ors and molecules causing cell stress. An emerging field, systems biology, which attempts to characterize the inte raction of cellular pathways and molecular components and to pr edict the behavior of biological systems, requires an enormous amount of data. Since this type of research is generally carried out in academia, it is important that screening be done in high-throughput manner to save labor and time while reducing cost. Also, many start-up pharmaceutical companies would like to run high-throughput screenings, but do not have access to high-end equipments that large pharmaceutical companies are able to use. Most high-throughput screening instrumentations are costly and can be difficult for many labs and small companies to purchase and maintain. Th erefore, inexpensive platforms for high- throughput screening are highly desirable. Another aspect of biology that adds to the total numb er of screening experiments to be done is that multiple f actors can interact with each other to produce synergetic, additive or antagonistic results. Cells are sustained in complex environments and cell fates are dictated by the integration of nume rous extracellular si gnals. Many cellular pathways in various biological phenomena ar e governed by the combinatorial effects of several factors. The regulation of gene expression is govern ed by activators, repressors, general transcription factors, protein-protein interactions, and protein-DNA interactions [9, 10]. For example, stem cell differentiat ion is controlled by multiple factors including activators to Notch-related receptor GLP-1, ep idermal growth factors factor (TGF), Macrophage inhibitory protein 1 , and numerous others that are currently being identified and studied [11]. 11 In addition, a mixture of drugs can disp lay synergistic intera ctions and become more effective than single agent at treati ng diseases. Cancer cells can also develop resistance to certain drugs and using a combin ation of drugs can circ umvent this problem [12, 13]. For example, treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) often consists of a panel of drugs including vincristine, pr ednisone, and anthracy cline [14]. Initial includes adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine. In treating other diseases such as HIV, combination therapy has been standard [15]. As a result, drug screenings often include multiple combinations of different compounds. Th is raises the demand of high-throughput screening as the number of potential compounds and all the possible combinations to be tested grows significantly. 1.3 Technology for High Throughput Screening Currently there are several types of instru ments as well as cell-based assays that have been used to run in high-throughput manner. Some of the assay types and the technology to handle high-throughput sc reening will be reviewed. The cell proliferation assay to test cell's grow th in response to external stimuli has been implemented for high-throughput screen ing. Proliferation assay can be done by counting cells after staining with vital and dead cell dyes. Throughput can be increased by running a MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. In such method, yellow MTT is added to the cells which is then reduced to purple formazan in the mitochondria of living cells [1]. The change in color can be measured by spectrometer. Cytotoxicity is another type of assay that can be run in similar procedure. 12 Dead cells with compromised membrane can be stained with trypan blue or red fluorescent propidium iodide. Another categor y of cell-based assay is quantification of cellular messengers. Calcium, Ca2+, a key cellular messenger, can be detected using Ca2+ sensitive dyes such as Fluo-3. Membrane potential can be measured using potential indicator dyes such as bis-(1,2-dibutylbarb ituric acid) trimet hine oxonol (DiBAC 4) and such detection is important for screening drug targeting ion channels [5]. Gene expression is critical to many biological events and it can be measured in living cells, providing invaluable tool to study of cell regulation and cont rol. Most of the methods involve transfecting the cells with the genes of reporting enzymes or green fluorescent proteins. Activation of the target gene results in the production of the reporter products, which can be detected by a fluorescent, co lorimetric or luminescent method. For example, the luciferase gene can be insert ed and the subsequent activation results in production of an enzyme that converts luciferin into a luminescent form which is then detected [16]. When green fluorescent pr otein is used as the reporter, real-time characterization can be done to yield an information-rich readout of the dynamic of cellular responses. Many other assays such as measurement of pH or cAMP also exist. More assay systems that act on new targets or pathways and that increase current sensitivity are being developed. Such deve lopments will continue to assist high- throughput cell-based assay research. Numerous strategies have been develope d to run many experiments in parallel for high-throughput screening. Test volumes have continuously been shrinking, with the 96 well microplate replacing 1 mL assays, fo llowed by the development of 384 well and 1,536 well microplate. The indi vidual well sizes are about 0.2 mL, 50 \u00b5L, and 2 \u00b5L for 13 the 96, 384 and 1,536 well plates , respectively [17]. The reduction in size reduces reagents and allows experiments to be run in a high density manner. Processes are also being automated to handle vari ous tasks such as pipettin g, assay reading and sample storage. Robots have been developed to handle those tasks and make the process less labor intensive and less expensive. Other instruments such as data processing and detectors are integrated with the robots to complete the whole high-throughput screening systems. Robotic systems for automatically handling the whole cell culturing processes have been implemented. Current high-thr oughput screening robots can run as many as 100,000 assays per day, which is more than on e assay per second [17]. Companies such as Aurora Biosciences and Automation Pa rtnership are making robotic systems and partnering with pharmaceutical companies to set up high-th roughput screening labs. However, while the current robotic systems can handle numerous experiments simultaneously in an impressive manner, t hose methods are limited by some problems. Robotic systems are expensive to purchase and maintain, and many academic and small companies do not have the resources to use them. As the wells are miniaturized, the liquid handling ability of the dispenser becomes important as small variation can result in a relative large impact. As the volume becomes smaller, evaporation becomes a significant problem. Surface tension can cause th e surface of small wells in well plates to become uneven, making it difficult to image. In addition, while the wells for assay are miniaturized, the whole robotic systems are s till huge and operate in a factory-like setting. Automation Partnership's system is about 150 feet long by 30 feet high and 200 tons in weight [17]. Furthermore, it is unlikely th at a well plate with hi gher density than 1,536 wells per plate can be produced. However, it is still desirable to further miniaturize the 14 assay size to save cost and reagents. For a ll theses reasons, a technology that can perform cell-based screening of multiple combinations of compounds in an inexpensive and high- throughput manner will significantly impact a wi de spectrum of fields including systems biology, drug discovery and stem cell research. 15 Chapter 2: Lab-on-a-Chip and Microfluidic Systems 2.1 Introduction Microfluidics is the field that deals with technology and phenomena of fluid behavior and control in the submillimeter length scale. The term microfluidic device is often used interchangeably with lab-on-a-chip (LOC) and micro-total-analysis-system (\u00b5TAS). This area has been growing rapidly as a result of advances in biology and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Many believe the development of microfluidic devices has the potential to revolutionize modern biology and chemistry laboratory processes. The field of microfluid ic is interdisciplinary, combining different studies in physics, biology, engine ering, chemistry and microtechnology. The development of microfluidic system stems from the field of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), which itself is originated from the semiconductor industry. In the 1970s, resear chers started to deve lop microfabrication technology and began using silicon to build MEMS devices. In 1979, Terry el al. developed a gas chromatography device on sili con, marking the invention of the first microfluidic device [18]. More miniaturized devices based on silicon were developed in the 1980s. Devices such as miniaturized pumps, valves, mixers and sensors were invented [19-21]. The succe ssful invention of these ne w technologies spurred the understanding and exploration of novel microfluidic effects. In 1990, Manz et al. proposed that MEMS technologies could be applied to biological and chemical processes, and that a single device could incorporate many aspects of la boratory processes including sample preparation, separation, sample transport and detection [22]. Such devices have 16 been termed lab-on-a-chip or micro-tota l-analysis system and have sparked the development of microfluidic devices. Th ese miniaturized devices possess superior analytical performance while re ducing the amount of reagents required. This concept has been the motivation of the research in this field even today. One of the most prominent microfluidic devices was the electroosmotic pump, which utilized voltage applied on the electrical double layer of a channel to drive a fluid. Such devices did not rely on mechanical moving parts for pumps and valves, instead flow at different sections of the chip was controlled by adjusting voltage [23]. Electrophoresis devices, which used applied voltage to separate ch arged particles, were also very popular, and were used to separate various biological en tities [24]. The majority of research during this time involved miniaturization of analytical pro cesses and equipments. In the mid 1990s, the field of microfluidic started to bloom, a nd the growth can be shown in the dramatic increase in number of patents related to microfluidics fr om 1994 and 2004 [25]. Another important development was the use of novel mate rials other than silicon. Polymers such used to construct microfluidic devices. Recently, microfluidic devices have been integrated into novel applications such as gene sequencing, flow cytometer, fuel ce lls, and disease diagnostics. However, the field of microfluidics has many obstacles to overcome before widespread acceptance. For example, the adopt ion of microfluidic devices by researchers outside of this community has been slow because the devices are often complicated to use. External fluid delivery systems have to be care fully coupled with the microfluidic chip to provide proper sealing and true reduced reagent volumes. Unlike larger instrumentation, 17 small bubbles in the microchannel can cause de vastating device failures. Furthermore, while the microfluidic device itself is small, the external detectors, sample injection, and pumping systems are often bulky. Finally, researchers have found that simply miniaturizing existing instrumentation does not always improve functionality over the existing mature technology. Looking into th e future, microfluidic devices need to become simpler to use to gain adoption. In addition, microfluidic devices need to be used in high demand applications and provide valu able and novel utilities instead of merely miniaturizing existing technologies. Despite current challenges for widespr ead acceptance, microfluidic devices provide various advantages over macro de vices. One obvious advantage that was recognized very early was the small scale of the devices. As the le ngth scale is reduced, processes such as diffusion and thermal en ergy transfer are sign ificantly faster and devices can operate with faster analysis a nd response time. The small size also makes microfluidic devices portable for clinical or field use in point-of-care diagnostics. In addition, microfluidic devices are small enough to make them implantable devices such as drug-delivery devices or continuous blood- monitoring devices. Because the device is compact, more experiments can be run in parallel or on one single chip to increase throughput. Microfluidic devices have the cap ability to handle liquid precisely in the nanoliter range and reduce cost of running experiments by requiring less reagents. In addition, each device requires minimal mate rial cost for construction, and using microfabrication steps, devices can be ma ss produced. Mass manufactured low cost sensors can be deployed in large quantities for applications such as defense against terrorist biological warfare attacks. Devi ces can be made disposable, providing user- 18 friendly operating process and sterile experi mental conditions for each experiment. Different components of analytical or biological experimental processes can be integrated on a single microfluidic chip to provide a pl atform with multiple functionalities. 2.2 Fabrication Technologies for Microfluidics Many different methods have been develope d for fabricating microfluidic devices. The first microfluidic devices in the 1980s ut ilized fabrication tec hnology borrowed from MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) and the semiconductor industry. Most of these devices were fabricated with bulk micromach ining, which involved et ching of substrates such as silicon or glass and bonding of the different layers. Other methods that were developed eventually included surface microm achining, the deposition and patterning of various thin film layers. Recent developm ent of soft lithography, the process of micro- molding soft elastomers, has gained wide reception because of its simplicity. Other processes such as injection molding, hot embossing and laser ablation have all been applied to microfluidic fabrication. The details of the different fabrication techniques will be presented in the following sections. One common technique that is used in many microfluidic fabrications is photolithography. Photolithograp hy involves coating (usually by spin-coating) a photosensitive photoresist on a substrate and ba king of the photoresist to slightly harden it. A mask is made with a pattern that has areas that either block or allow light to pass through. Depending on the type of photoresist, exposed areas become soluble or insoluble in developer. The patterned phot oresist remains after developing and can be 19 used as masking material during etching of th e underlying substrate or as a structural or sacrificial material itself. 2.2.1 Bulk Micromachining Bulk micromachining involves patterning a su bstrate, usually silicon or glass, by selectively etching the substrate and creating st ructures such as trenches or holes inside the substrate. This is a popul ar technique because various et chants have been extensively studied and developed. Furt hermore, the etching profile (isotropic or anisotropic), selectivity and rate can be precisely controlled. To wet etch silicon isotropically, or etching with the same rate in all direction, HNA (HF, HNO 3, and CH 3COOH) can be used [26]. The HNO 3 is used to oxidize the surface while HF can dissolve the oxidized product. CH 3COOH is used for the transport of products and reactants. To create more complex shapes, chemicals for anisotropic etching can be used. The anisotropic property arises because the etchant etches one crystal orientation faster than the other. The etchant usually contains alkaline solution to dissolve silicon. have a 10 to 400 times higher et ching rate in the <1 0 0> plane than the <1 1 1> plane. EDP was the first etchant developed but suffers fr om high toxicity and less selectivity than the other two. KOH has th e best selectivity among the three and is a good chemical to use for creating grooves. Ho wever, KOH also etches away material such as SiO 2 and aluminum. TMAH has lower sele ctivity than KOH but is compatible with CMOS fabrication processes. Glass, whic h is often a preferable substrate to silicon for biological imaging applications, can be etched using HF solutions. However, the 20 etching rate can be slow and masking mate rial such as photoresist is etched too. Therefore, in many applications silicon is preferred to glass. The dry etching process using plasma can be applied for bulk micromachining of silicon. Although wet etching is typically less expensive, easier to implement, and etches at a higher rate, plasma etchin g has certain advantages. Pl asma etching produces smaller feature sizes than wet etching because the we t process can indiscriminately damage the other features on the substrate. Furtherm ore, dry etching does not cause undesirable results such as delamination of the bonded layers . Plasma etchers typically use a gas with fluorine such as SF 6 or CF 4. These gases are charged to become high energy plasma that produces fluorine free radicals. The fluorine free radicals react with the silicon to etch it. SF6 is the most common gas used in dry etching and the reaction results in gaseous products of SiF 6. Depending on the plasma etcher c onfiguration, etchi ng profiles from isotropic to slightly anisotropic to totally vertical can be produ ced. Typical plasma etchers, which have a RF power electrode at the top of the chamber, away from the substrate, produce an isotropic etching prof ile. Reactive ion etch ing (RIE), utilizes a power electrode at the bottom in contact with the substrate. This causes the plasma particles to accelerate preferentially towards the substrate, producing a more anisotropic profile. Deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) pr oduces the most vertical sidewalls by using a switching chemistry between SF 6 and C 4F8. The C 4F8 passivates the sidewalls of a trench, forming a protective layer from the subsequent SF 6 etching, which makes the trench deeper. The two gase s are continuously switched and aspect ratio of 30:1 can be achieved. 21 The etched patterns are gene rally bonded with another su bstrate such as glass or silicon to complete the microchannels. Three common bonding methods have been developed and used extensively: Si-Si fusion bonding, anodic bonding and eutectic bonding. In fusion bonding, the Si surface is cleaned and hydrated to produce OH functional groups on the surface. The two surfac es are brought in contact at one point to start a \"contact wave\" that propagates through the whole surface. Then, the two surfaces in contact are thermally annealed at 800oC to 1200oC to create covalent Si-O-Si bond with the removal of H 2O group. The bond strength can be co mparable to that of intrinsic silicon. Anodic bonding is used to join a silicon substrate with a Na+ based material such as Pyrex glass. The two surfaces are cleaned and brought into close contact. The two surfaces are heated to temperature of 200 oC-500oC, and a voltage of 200 V-1,000 V is applied with the more positive potential on the silicon. The applied voltage causes the positive Na+ to be displaced from the bonding surface, leaving negative charges at the interface. The resulting electrostatic force and migrations of ions facilitate formation of chemical bonds which would otherwise require temperature of around 1,000oC. This is a versatile technique as Pyrex can be sputtered as a thin film a nd used as a glue to bond Si to other surfaces. In eutectic bonding, eutec tic alloys such as Au/Sn are coated on the substrate and used as glue. The surface coated with the eutectic la yer is brought together with another surface and heated to the eute ctic point inside a vacuum chamber to facilitate bonding. 2.2.2 Surface Micromachining Surface micromachining involves deposition an d selective patterning of layers of sacrificial and structural thin films on the substrate. Unlike bulk micromachining, the 22 substrate remains intact. The layers are patterned with photol ithography. Sacrificial layers aid in defining the final shape of the device and are rem oved using specific solvent. Structural layers remain and form the fina l device. The process flow for the general surface micromachining process is shown in Figure 2-1. Figure 2-1. General process for fabrication of microchannel with surface micromachining. Access holes can be made from the top or bottom side of the substrate. In surface micromachining, polysilicon is most commonly used as the structural material and silicon dioxide as the sacrificial material. Both polysilicon and silicon dioxide can be deposited using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. Polysilicon can be etched using SF 6 plasma etching and silicon dioxide can be removed using HF solution. Surface micromachining is not limited to glass and silicon s ubstrates. A wide variety of materials can be used as long as th e process used for the removal of sacrificial 23 layer does not damage the structural layer. When using alternate materials for surface micromachined devices, it is important to en sure that the adhesion between the different deposited layers is strong. It is especially important to choose the proper solvent and dissolution procedure to remove the sacrific ial layer as improper choice can result in delamination of the deposited layers. Many combinations of materials have been used for surface micromachining and recently the use of polymers has drawn much attention. With polymers, photoresist can be used as the sacrificial layer and removed by dissolution in organic solvent such as acetone. Polymers such as PMMA, Parylene and SU8 can be deposited on the photoresist to form microfluidic channels. Access holes for making fluidic connection to the fluid delivery macro components can be made either at the bottom or the top of the device. Ma king access holes from bottom requires bulk micromachining to create holes through the entire substrate which is time consuming and expensive. Also, care must be taken to en sure that etching thr ough the whole wafer does not affect the features on the top side. When access holes are made on the top of the device, channels need to be protected from the coupling pieces such as o-rings and gaskets to prevent channels from collapsing. In this case, a conformal coating of thick polymers such as SU8 can be applied and patterned as a pr otective layer. 2.2.3 Soft Lithography Soft lithography refers to the micro-mold ing of soft elastomers, most commonly PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane). PDMS has th e advantage that it is flexible, optically transparent and inexpensive. Soft lithogr aphy has gained popularity since 1995 because it does not require complex equipments and has a short fabrication time. Many labs that do not have in-house cleanroom facilities can have access to microfluidic devices using 24 soft lithography. The general PDMS fabricatio n procedure starts with the fabrication of the mold. This can be done by patterning silicon wafers using DRIE or other bulk micromachining processes or patterning SU8, a negative photoresist that can achieve thicknesses of 100 \u00b5m or more. PDMS prepolymer generally consists of two components of polymer base and curing agen t. A typical PDMS, Sylgard 184, generally consists of polymer base and curing agent mixed at a ratio of 10:1. Next, the mixture is casted on the mold and cu red by heat. Sylgard 184 can be cured in 80oC oven in 30 minutes. After curing, the PD MS piece is removed from the mold. Access holes are punched through the PDMS with a blunt-end sy ringe needle. The PDMS piece is then bonded to another substrate such as glass or another piece of PDMS. To bond PDMS to glass, the two pieces can be treated w ith oxygen plasma and bonded together via hydrophilic interaction [27]. PDMS can also be bonded to another piece of PDMS to create monolithic structures [28]. This can be achieved by treating both PDMS surfaces with oxygen plasma and bonding them together . Another method is by partial curing: both pieces of PDMS are cured for a short period of time at lower temperatures (~60oC) and become hardened enough to handle but not totally cured. The tw o pieces are then brought into contact and cured together. This method has been useful in constructing PDMS valves and pumps where two layers of PDMS channels sandwich a thin PDMS layer in between them. The top control channe l is actuated pneumatically to push the thin PDMS piece down to seal the bottom fluidic channel. While PDMS has been a popular material for microfluidics, it has several shortcomings. Complex structures can be difficult to achieve and the aspect ratio is limited from 0.2 to 2 [29]. Features with sm all dimensions can be hard to replicate 25 faithfully. PDMS devices are unable to withstand high pres sure and the typical methods used to bond glass to PDMS have working pre ssures limited to a maximum of 80 psi [27]. PDMS is highly porous, and diffusion of water vapor can lead to unde sirable drying of the sample or even osmolarity change [30]. Small molecule s can diffuse into or out of the bulk of PDMS, and this can produce unde sirable effects such as decreasing the concentration of the input compounds for exposure on cells or target molecules for detection [31]. Because PD MS is permeable to most organic solvents, it swells significantly after exposure to organic com pounds. Although pretreatment of the PDMS surface is generally used to reduce permeability, it is often inadequate. This is a serious drawback and makes it impossible to use PDMS in many applications . Because of these limitations, polymers with similar properties to PDMS but more chemically resistant are currently being developed. 2.2.4 Other Fabrication Processes Conventional processes fo r making polymer parts have been applied to make microfluidic devices. Processes such as hot embossing and injecti on molding have been applied [32]. In the hot embossing process, the mold and polymer are heated to the polymer's glass transition temperature inside vacuum, and the mold and polymer are then brought in contact with an applied force. Th is results in the patt ern on the mold being stamped into the softened polymer. In inject ion molding, polymers in granular pellets are forced into a cylinder and start to melt. Th e molten polymer is injected into a cavity containing a mold at 60 to 100 MPa. While these processes are una ble to achieve highly complex structures that photolithography techno logy is capable of, these technologies are more matured and require shorter fabrication time and lower cost. Another advantage is 26 the wide range of polymer materials that ar e available including polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polycarbonate (PC). As a result, those processes are more commonly used in making commercial microfluidic products. Another method is to use laser ablation to directly create microfluidic channels on plastics or glass. In laser ablation, a lase r is shined on the material, breaking chemical bonds inside the material. Laser ablation has been applied to materi als including glass, ceramics, polymers and metals. After the pattern for the microchannel is made, bonding has to be done to enclose the channels. Process such as lamination, gluing, and thermal bonding can be applied to bond polymer-based microfluidic devices. In the lamination method, a film coated with an adhesive layer is sandwiched in between the polymer chip and another substrate such as glass. The setup is rolled into two heated rollers and the adhesive film is melted, joining the two pieces together. Gluing can also be used to join two pieces together. For both the gluing and lamination processes, ca re should be taken to avoid blocking the channel with the adhesive layer. Another way to join polymer pieces is by heating the polymers and applying pressure to seal the device. 2.3 Parylene Microfluidics Parylene has emerged as a popular c hoice of material for constructing microfluidic devices. Many of the fabrication processes presented in the following chapters are based on Parylene. Also, the type of Parylene mentioned in the rest of the thesis refers to Parylene C, unless othe rwise specified. The background, properties, 27 deposition, and pattering of Parylene for microf luidic device fabrication will be discussed in this section. 2.3.1 Parylene Background and Properties Parylene has several unique material prope rties that make it advantageous to use as a microfluidic material. Parylene is transparent, chemically inert, and biocompatible. Parylene is conformally coated onto a su rface using chemical vapor deposition method and deposition thickness can range from 0.1 to 1,000 \u00b5m. Parylene deposition is performed at room temperature and is suitabl e for encapsulating delicate items such as electronics and medical devices. Resear chers eventually discovered Parylene's compatibility with CMOS/MEMS fabrication pr ocess and its superior material property has made it the material of choice fo r constructing microf luidic devices. Parylene was first discovered in 1947 by Professor Michael Szwarc at University of Manchester in the Unite d Kingdom when he was studying the chemical bonds in molecules such as xylenes, which have a carbon attached to a benzene ring [33]. Because he was interested in studying the bond streng th, he heated the chemicals to a high temperature. He eventually noted formati on of a thin film in downstream cooler area zone, and was intrigued by the unique physical and chemical property of the film. The material was named \"Szwarcite,\" which is today's equivalent of poly-p-xylylene or Parylene N. The discovery spurred commer cial interests and William Franklin Gorman proposed a chemical vapor deposition method to create Parylene film with the dimer of the p-xylylene as starting material. The \"Gor man\" process is still used in many Parylene coaters today. However, the synthesis of stable dimer was not reliable until Donald Cram at UCLA developed a method to synthesize th e dimers in 1951. This development made 28 the commercialization of the Parylene deposition process viable. Over 20 types of Parylene were subsequently commercialized, while three types, Parylene N, Parylene C and Parylene D have been most commonly used ( Figure 2-2). The recent development of Parylene H T has introduced another Parylene with superior material properties such as increased thermal stability, improved electrical properties, increased ultraviolet stability, and a lower coefficient of friction. Figure 2-2. Chemical structures of the common Parylenes. Parylene N, poly-p-xylylene, is the most ba sic form in the Parylene family. It is completely linear with no functional groups substituted. Parylene N has high dielectric strength and has constant diel ectric across a large frequency range (2.65 from 60 Hz to 1 MHz) [34]. Parylene C has one aromatic hydrogen substitu ted with a chlorine group. Parylene D has two substituted chlorine groups a nd is able to maintain its mechanical and electrical properties at higher temperature. Parylene C is the most common Parylene for microfluidics. Parylene C has the highest mechanical strength among the three common Parylenes with Young's modulus of 400,000 psi. Because Parylene is deposited in a conformal and pinhole-free manner, it exhibits low permeability to moisture and gases and is stable toward many organic solvents [34]. Parylene C has been shown to be biocompatible and is certified with the st ringent biocompatibility rating of both United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Class VI by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 29 ISO 10993. It is resistant to corrosive body fluids and has been used to coat many chronic implantable devices [35, 36]. Paryle ne C is also preferred over the other two types of common Parylenes because it has the highest deposition rate of 2-3 \u00b5m/hr. In addition, Parylene C is transparent in the visible range which allows microfluidic devices for biological applications to be readily couple d with microscopy techniques. 2.3.2 Parylene Microfluidic Fabrication Process Fabrication of Parylene-based microf luidic networks is based on surface micromachining techniques. The Parylene deposition and etching process will be described in this section. Figure 2-3 shows the generalized Paryle ne deposition process using chem ical vapor deposition (CVD). The simplified model of the Parylene deposition consists of three distinct stages: vaporization, pyrolysis and deposition [34]. The pressure difference in each of the three zones (1, 0.5 and 0.1 torr) drives the flow of the vapor. First, the Parylene dimers are loaded into a bo at and are vaporized by heating to 150oC. At this temperature, the dimers are sublimed and the vapor enters the pyrolysis zone. The pyrolysis zone is approximately 680oC, and at such temperature, the cleavage of the methylene-methylene bond occurs. This yields the Parylene monome r, para-xylylene, a diradical monomer. Finally, the monomers enter the deposition chamber, where they adsorb and polymerize on the substrate at room temperature. When the monomers enter the deposition chamber, some adsorb to the substrate. Some of these monomers will desorp and leave the surface, while others co me in contact with each other and begin the nucleation process [37]. The polymer propagates until all the monomers are used or until the process is stopped. It ha s been shown that the deposit ion rate can be increased by 30 decreasing the substrate temperature and it was suggested that the higher deposition rate is a result of the increased condens ation of the monomers on the surface. Figure 2-3. The Parylene deposition process. (a)-(c) show the chemical structures of Parylene at corresponding time point s. Image adopted from [38]. One key advantage of this deposition process is the formation of a pinhole-free conformal coating on the substrate. Unconf ormal coatings lead to an inhomogeneous surface, and because of the large surface area to volume ratio in miniaturized devices, small inhomogeneities can be detrimental to the device. Another advantage of using CVD process is that the monomer gas is co nverted to polymer film directly, without catalysts or solvents. In addition, this coating process is substrate independent and almost all materials can be coated. The deposition occurs at room temperature and is compatible with existing MEMS/CMOS fabrication process and materials. After Parylene is deposited, it can be se lectively etched with many processes. Parylene can be removed using a solvent such as chloronaphthalene or benzolyl benzoate at 150 oC [39]. However, such pro cess is not compatible with lithographic procedures. 31 UV laser ablation is also possible but is hampered by low throughput and high cost. Using plasma etching is the most practical and common me thod to pattern Parylene. Oxygen plasma can be used to etch Parylene with photoresist. As photoresist can be etched by oxygen plasma, a photore sist slightly thicker than the Parylene th ickness has to be used. Metals such as gold or aluminum can also be used as the masking material. Plasma etching, reactive ion etching (RIE) a nd deep reaction ion etching (DRIE) can all be used to pattern Pa rylene [39]. RIE can achieve more vertical sidewall profile than plasma etching, while DRIE can achieve the most vertical sidewa ll profile. Typical etching rate is about 0.1 to 0.5 \u00b5m min1. The deposited Parylene can be etched and followed up by other lithographic processes. Photoresist can be patterned on Parylene with good adhesion. Metals such as Cr/Au, Ti/Pt and Al can be deposited on Paryle ne using thermal or e-beam evaporation. Those metal layers can be patterned by the ty pical lithographic and etching processes as Parylene is inert to most solvents. Functionalized Parylene molecules with substituted groups such as aminomethyl or carboxylic acid have been synthesized and can be used to couple molecules such as proteins [40]. A typical process to construct Parylene microchannel utilizes the surface micromachining technique. Photoresist is firs t patterned on the substrate and Parylene is deposited. Parylene is patterned to make the access holes on the top side and the sacrificial photoresist can be eluted using acetone. Alte rnatively, access holes can be patterned from the bottom side by performing bulk micromachining. To date, various integrated microfluidic devices and individu al components have been made by extending the basic surface mi cromachining procedure. Some examples 32 include peristaltic pumps, electrolysis pum ps, check valves, modular microfluidic systems and cytometers [41-44]. Parylene ha s also been applied to devices outside of microfluidic such as bioMEMS and implanta ble devices with exam ples including retinal implants and eye pressure sens ing micro devices [45, 46]. 2.4 Microfluidics for Cell Biology In recent years, the applications of mi crofluidic devices in cell biology have grown, and many believe the development in microfluidics will greatly expedite advancements in cell biology. Microfluidics will enable cell biology experimentation to be done effectively in a high-throughput ma nner, with both multicellular and single- cellular studies. Reagents requirements for microfluidics devices are a couple of orders of magnitude smaller than macro scale device s. Many microfluidic devices also offer functionalities that are unachievable by tr aditional cell biology instrumentations or methods. Such functionalities are based on the devices' ability to control the microenvironment precisely in both spatial and temporal aspects. These capabilities have allowed microfluidics devices to make biom imetic physiological conditions possible for experimentation. In this sect ion, various microfluidic devi ces applicable to cell biology will be introduced. 2.4.1 Controlling Microenvironment Using Microfluidic Flow One major challenge in studying the cells is to understand the microenvironmental factors that regulate cells. The in vivo microenvironment is composed of complex interactions of nei ghboring cells, extracellular matrix molecules, 33 soluble factors, gas concentrations, physical effects by fluid flows, and temperature effects. Microfluidic flow has provide d the ability to precisely control many microenvironmental cues for cellular studies. The field of microfluidics has excelled in creating chemical gradients on a single chip. These devices are important because chemical gradients occur readily in vivo and their consequences have intrigued scientists for years. However, a reliable gradient generation is hard to achieve in traditional de vices. Jeon et al. utilized the laminar flow and diffusion dominant propertie s of microfluidics to create a well-defined and precise chemical gradient on-chip [47]. The device ha s three inputs and a series of downstream dividers and serpentine mixers to continuous ly split the input streams and join and mix them into streams with different and defined concentrations. For example, by putting 0%, 50% and 100% of a solution into the inputs, a linear gradient was achieved at the output. More complex nonlinear gradient profiles were also achieved. Such devices have been adopted in studying wide array of phenomen a caused by chemical gradient including chemotaxis of neutrophil and cancer cells and stem cell differentiation [48-50]. Microfluidic flow has also been used to expose a single cell to asymmetric signals by placing it at the interface of fluid streams. Because flow is laminar and two streams flowing alongside each other undergo minima l mixing, part of th e cell receives the soluble factors directly while the other part does not. This has been used in studying mitochondrial movement within a single ce ll [51]. A similar mechanism has been applied to expose Drosophila embryo cells to temperature variation by placing a single cell at the interface of a warm and a cold stream [52]. Patterning of cells and proteins has been enabled by the use of microfluidic de vices, and those studi es are significant for 34 tissue engineering [53, 54]. Furt hermore, the ability to cont rol micro flow precisely has enabled the study of shear stre ss on cells in a convenient a nd systematic manner [55]. The microenvironment that cells reside in is composed of cell- cell interaction among different groups. Lee et al. developed a micr ofluidic device to precisely bring two cells in contact with each other for cell-cell interact ion studies. Such devices can be implanted for performing studies in high-throughput manne r [56]. All these instruments exploit unique properties of microflu idics to build devices and en able studies that are not possible with traditional macro devices. 2.4.2 Cellular Analysis Using Microfluidic Devices Various processes in cellular analysis were miniaturized with the ultimate goal of building a complete system with multiple functionalities integrated on a single chip. Separation and sorting of cells is one of th e routine process in cellular analysis and different cell sorting mechanisms on microflu idic platform have been developed. Some devices are miniaturizations of macro devices while others exploit unique features of microfluidics. One of the most successful methods is to use dielectrophoresis (DEP), in which particles (charged or neutral) are s ubjected to a non-uniform ac field. Cells are separated because the force on them differs depending on the cel ls' electrical properties, shapes, and sizes. Mammalian cells were sort ed using this method [57]. Another method is to use \"deterministic lateral displacement\" in which an array of post is fabricated and particles are flowed through the posts. Small particles can follow the streamlines and stay in one lane, while large particles will continue to be displaced to another lane. This method has been applied for sorting cells such as blood cells in whole blood [58]. Cell cytometers, both using optical and impedance-ba sed detection schemes have been created 35 as well [42, 59]. Cell lysis f unctionality has been made possible by either using barbs to mechanically lyse the cells or applying electric field to electr ically lyse the cells [60, 61]. In addition, chips that are capable of anal yzing cell lysates have been made. Systems such as on-chip PCR were fabricated and because of low thermal-mass of microsystems, fast cycling was possible [62]. Othe r components such as HPLC, capillary electrophoresis or isoelectric focusing ha ve all been made [43, 63, 64]. Besides analyzing cell aggregates, single cells can al so be analyzed in a high-throughput manner by taking advantage of the ability of microflu idic devices to positio n cells precisely. Carlo et al. created a device to efficiently position single ce lls in individual traps [65]. While these works focus on demonstrating the capability and advantages of using microfluidic systems, efforts must be put into improving compatibility with existing laboratory processes and integr ating the various components fo r microfluidic devices to gain wider adoption. 2.4.3 Microfluidic Cell Culture and Cell-Based Assay Systems As discussed in the previous chapter, cell culture and cell-based assay is a key process in various fields including pharmaco logy, cell biology and ti ssue engineering. High-throughput experimentation is desirable, but a reliable and cost-effective platform has been hard to achieve. Recently, many res earchers have been developing microfluidic devices as potential inexpensive tools fo r high-throughput cell-based assays. The advancements in microfabrication and micr ofluidic technologies have enabled the development of various lab-on-a- chip devices with cell cult uring functionalities. Using microfabrication techniques, chip-based devi ces with high-density arrays can be mass fabricated. Performing cell culture and assays with microfluidic devices also possesses 36 the advantages of increased throughput, prec ise liquid handling in the nanoliter range, and reduced sample volume. Fewer cells can be used for each experiment and this is beneficial for performing experi ments on rare cells such as st em cells or primary cells. Furthermore, on-chip culture systems offer culture environments with characteristic lengths at the micro scale and the cell culture environment on-chip can be designed to better mimic the in vivo culture microenvironment than traditional cell culture systems. Various on-chip culture systems with different functionalities have been developed. Prokop et al. develo ped a device to culture cells in side microfluidic channels and was able to culture cells fo r 5 days [66]. Hung et al. created a device with separate cell loading and media perfusion inlets to efficiently collect cells and perfuse them without cell loss [67]. The setup also en abled cell passaging by using trypsin, and cell culture over 2 weeks was achieve d. To date, an abundant number of cell types have been successfully cultured on-ch ip, including human hepatocytes, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, stem cells, breast cancer cells and many othe rs [68]. Devices th at integrate other microfluidic capabilities have been created. Cell culture arrays were integrated with concentration gradient generators to expos e them to a single compound at different concentrations [50, 69]. King et al. developed a chip with a high-density cell array and monitored gene expression in real time us ing reporter genes with green fluorescent proteins [70]. In a single experiment, multiple stimuli were applied to treat the cells at once and ~5,000 measurements were made. A creative device was made by Kim et al. that cultured cells under a logarithmic range of flow rates simultaneously and studied the cell responses at different flow rates [71]. Cell patterni ng and long-term studies of cellular differentiation using perfusion syst ems on-chip were demonstrated [72]. 37 However, most of the current devices are not designed to screen for multiple compounds at once. Chip-based devices that have th e capability to handle tw o or more inputs and assess the effects of multiple compound expos ures on cells are valuable for numerous screening applications. 2.5 Microfluidic Phenomena Related to Cellular Studies As the scale of the culture environment is reduced to micron scale, some of the dominant forces and physical phenomena in macro scale can become less important. On the other hand, other forces and physical pheno mena that are generally ignored in macro device design can start to dominate. This provides the opportunity to exploit novel properties of microfluidics to achieve va rious functionalities unattainable by macro devices. Also, it is important to consid er the dominant phenomena in microfluidic devices when designing devices for cellular st udies. This secti on will briefly review some of the physics at micro scale pertinent to microfluidic for cellular studies. 2.5.1 Laminar Flow In macro scale fluidic devices, flow is often turbulent, which is chaotic and unpredictable. However, in microfluidic devices, flow is generally laminar, in which the position of particle inside a fluid stream as a function of time can be predicted. In laminar flow, fluid can be treated as compositi on of several thin laye rs, or laminae, and the layers flow parallel to each other without disruption. One dimensionless number that gives an indication of the flow regime is th e Reynolds number, Re, and is defined [73] hvDRe , (2.1) 38 where is the density of the fluid, v is the velocity of the fluid, \u00b5 is the fluid viscosity and Dh is the hydraulic diameter, which is dependent on the channel's cross section geometry. Re < 2300 indicates the flow is in the la minar regime, and given the small size of microfluidic channels, most of the microfluidic flows have Re ynolds number less than 1. As a result of this, two flui d streams flowing alongside each other inside a microchannel will mix only by diffusion. Pressure driven incompressible flow is described by two equations, the Navier- Stokes equation [74]: v p v vtv 2 , (2.2) and the equation for conservation of mss: 0v, (2.3) where v is the fluid velocity, p is the pressure, \u00b5 is the fluid viscosity, t is the time and is the fluid density. For microfluidic design consideration, the analytical solution for the Navier-Stokes equation can be solved assuming the no-slip boundary cond itions. The exact solution depends on the cross sectional geomet ry of the microfluidic channel, but the flows always follow a parabolic profile. The steady state velocity profile for a rectangular channel can be a pproximated by the parallel pl ate Poiseuille flow [75]: y y hLPy vx 2)( . (2.4) The velocity in the x direction, vx, is a function of the posi tion along the channel height, y, and h is the channel height, P is the pressure difference of the two ends of the channel, L is the length of the channel, and \u00b5 is the viscosity of the fluid. 39 Flow profile can also be de scribed conveniently using a fluidic resistance concept. QR P . (2.5) The pressure drop, P, is equal to the produc t of volumetric flow ra te through a channel, Q, and fluidic resistance of the channel, R. For a rectangular channel, the fluidic resistance is [73] 1 5 , 3 , hw n n wh whLR , (2.6) where w is the width of the channel, h is the height of the channel and L is the length of the channel. For channel with width much larger than height, th e resistance can be approximated as 312 whLR . (2.7) 2.5.2 Diffusion Diffusion can be the dominant transport process in microfluidic channels. Diffusion is the process by which particles mo ve from higher concentration regions to lower concentration regions because of Browni an motion. In one dimension, diffusion can be modeled by the equation: Dt d22 , (2.8) where d is the mean distance that a particle travels, D is the diffusion constant and t is the time. Diffusion becomes important when the time is long or the distance is short, so it is inconsequential in channel with centimeter or wider widths. Typical diffusion constant for some molecules in water are 2 \u00d7 103 \u00b5m2 s1 for solute ions, 100 small 40 proteins and \u00b5m2 s1 for mammalian cells. A dimens ionless number that indicates whether convection or is the Peclet number, Pe, DvlPe , (2.9) where v is the fluid velocity, l is the characteristic length and D is the diffusion constant. When the velocity is high, convective transport dominates, while when the length is small, diffusion dominates. 2.5.3 Shear Stress Shear stress is the tangential force applied to the surface of an object. Inside a microfluidic channel, the shear stress at the wall is given by the equation, dydv , (2.10) where is the shear stress, \u00b5 is the fluid viscosity v is the fluid velocity and y is the position along the height of the channel. For rectangular shape channel, the shear stress can be described using the parallel plate model [71] w hQ 26 , (2.11) where Q is the volumetric flow rate, h is the height of the channel and w is the width of the channel. As a result, shear stress is larger in smaller channels than larger channels. Depending on the cell type, the amount of shear stress that a cell ca n tolerate is different. In addition, fluid flow can l ead to shear stress which can influence cellular behavior. For example, shear stress can cause endothelial ce lls to polarize in the direction of fluidic flow and can influence intracellular cAMP production in osteoblasts [76, 77]. 41 2.5.4 Surface Effects As the device size shrinks from macro to micro, the surface area to volume (SAV) ratio increases dramatically. The large SAV ratio would require attention to be paid to surface effects when designing microfluidic devices for cellular studies. A 35 mm culture dish with 2.5 mL of media has a SAV ratio of 4.2 cm1 [73]. On the other hand, a cylindrical micro culture chamber with diam eter of 100 \u00b5m and height of 100 \u00b5m has a SAV ratio of 600 cm1. With the increase in surface area to volume ratio, some parameters have to be taken into account. Proteins can be adsorb ed to the surface and results in the depletion of protei ns inside a microfluidic device. Also, with the increase in surface area, evaporation happe ns at faster rate. Another force that becomes prevalent is surface tension, which is a result of the attractive forces between the molecules insi de the liquid. Depending on the surface energy, liquid on solid/gas/liquid surface would result in different wetting behavior. For example, if a droplet of water is formed on a solid surface and the attraction between the liquid surface and solid is strong, this would result in strong wetting of surface. Such behavior is described as hydrophilic and the opposite effect, hydrophobicity can occur when the attraction between liquid and solid is not as strong as that in the liquid. The wetting behavior is affected by the properties of the liquid. For example, a more polar solvent such as water has stronger intermol ecular bonding of the liquid molecules at the surface, and therefore, higher surface energy th an ethanol. The wetting behavior can be quantified using the contact angle c, the angle between the liqui d and solid surface [74]. SG c LG SL cos , (2.12) 42 where SL, LG, SG, are the interfacial tensions of the solid/liquid, liquid/gas, and solid/gas interfaces, respectively. As a result of surface tension, at the in terface of liquid, solid , and gas, the surface of liquid is distorted, resulting in a pressure difference across the surface. Such pressure is described by the Young- Laplace equation [73]: )1 1( 2 1R RP , (2.13) where P is the pressure difference, is the surface tension of the liquid and R1 and R2 are the principal radii of curvature. A spherical drop of liquid would have R1 = R2, resulting in RP2 . (2.14) 43 Chapter 3: 3-D Microfluidic Network Fabrication: Making Cell Culture Array on Silicon with Integrated Combinatorial Mixer 3.1 Introduction The ability to assess the combinatorial e ffects of several com pounds on cells is an important aspect in the field of quantitative biology and drug screening. As described in chapter 1, a mixture of drugs or chemical compounds can often tr eat diseases more effectively or act synergisti cally in certain cellular pathways, and many biological phenomena are governed by the combinatorial eff ects of several gene regulatory proteins or extracellular factors. This is one of the reasons for the increase in demand for high- throughput cell-based screening technology. The popular method of using multi-well plates with robotics is limited by the pr oblems of poor small-volume liquid handling ability, large consumption of reagents, and high cost of operation. As discussed in previous chapters, microfluidic devices can overcome those problems and provide potentially inexpensive tools for high-throughput cell-based assays. Microfabrication enables inexpensive chip platforms with high -density arrays to be mass fabricated. Performing cell culture and assays with microfluidic devices also possesses the advantages of increased thr oughput, precise liquid handling in the nanoliter range, and reduced sample volume. While various on-chip culture systems have been developed, most of the current devices are designed to expose cells to a si ngle compound at once. The complexity of on-chip cell-based assay experiments can be greatly expanded by developing a cell 44 culture chip with an integrated combinator ial mixer to simultaneously deliver different combinatorial fluid streams to study cell cultures. Additionally, a chip-based combinatorial mixer can decrease the time and labor during the process of mixing and dispensing solutions. Creating a combinatorial mixer require s the fabrication of three- dimensional (3-D) microfluidic networks and different met hods for creating 3-D microfluidic network will be described. 3.1.1 Background of Three-Dimensiona Microfluidic Devices Previous fabr icating 3-D microfluidic devices often involved patterning and bonding multiple layers. Kikutani et al. fa bricated 3-D microfluidic chip by bonding several etched glass substrates [78]. Pyrex glass wa s first covered with Cr and Au to protect the substrate duri ng etching and posit ive photoresist was photolithographically patterned on top of the metal layer. Th e Cr and Au were etched with I 2/NH 4I and Ce(NH 4)2(NO 3)6, and the glass was etched with 50% HF solution at a rate of 13 \u00b5m/min. Then, the photoresist wa s removed with acetone, and the metals were removed using the I 2/NH 4I and Ce(NH 4)2(NO 3)6 solution. Two glasses were patterned using this method for the top and bottom plat es. For the middle glass plate, through holes were drilled using ultrasonic sandblasting. Finally, the glass plates were cleaned with ethanol and NaOH, and thermally bonded together inside a 650oC furnace for 5 hours. Patterned polyethylene terephthalate (Mylar D, Dupont, Washington, DC) can be bonded together to make a 3-D microf luidic network as demonstrated by Neils et al. [79]. The sheets were patterned with CO 2 laser to create channels and windows. Some sheets had dry adhesive coating (501FL, 3M), and the cut Mylar sheets were aligned, bonded and pressed to create the final microfluidic structures. A total of 9 Mylar layers were stacked 45 together in this method. PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane), a popular material for constructing microfluidic devices, has been us ed in 3-D microfluidic. Jo et al. [80] presented a method to pattern and bond severa l 2-D PDMS layers to form complex 3-D channels. To create the 2-D layers, PDMS prepolymer mixture wa s cast onto a master created by patterned SU-8 on si licon wafer and a transparency film was lowered onto the PDMS prepolymer mixture. The stack was then clamped together with top and bottom flat aluminum plates, a Pyrex wafe r and rubber sheet, and cured at 100oC for three hours. The 2-D layers were peeled off from the master, and the surfaces were cleaned with diluted HCl solution. Finally, the layers were treated with oxygen plasma in reactive ion etching systems and aligned and bonded together. 3.1.2 Motivations for Monolithic 3-D Microfluidic Fabrication While functional devices have been demonstrated, multilayer bonding process suffers several unavoidable drawbacks. Pe rforming the bonding proc ess can result in possible misalignment from layer to layer a nd such process can be challenging to batch fabricate for large-scale producti on. Furthermore, as the nu mber of inputs for the 3-D microfluidic device increases, the number of layers can increase and result in an undesirably thick device. Possible delamina tion of the layers and device failure can result from contamination of the surface. In addition, many of the materials have not undergone extensive testing for biocompatibility and might not be suitable for cellular studies. Therefore, a monolithic fabrication process using biocompatible material to build the devices would be desirable. Such process should also have the capability to be scaled up to fabricate chip with large number of channe ls, inputs and outputs with only minor or no modification to the process. 46 This chapter will discuss the development of an integrated method to fabricate monolithic 3-D microfluidic networks and th e fabrication of an on-chip cell culture device with an integrated co mbinatorial mixer based on such technology. As a first example, the device has a combinatorial mixer with three inputs and one control channel. The combinatorial mixer is capable of ge nerating the eight combinatorial streams simultaneously for delivery to the eight cultu re chambers. Our fabrication method is based on the surface micromachining of Parylene C and can be scaled up to achieve high- throughput combinatorial cell-based assays. The packaging scheme to provide fluidic connection to the chip has been developed, and the capability to perform cell culture on this device has been demonstrated. Finally , the integrated combinatorial mixer has successfully been used to expose cells to different combinations of compounds. 3.2 Experimental 3.2.1 Chip Design Figure 3-1 shows the device design layout. In e ssence, the device has an array of cultu re chambers, where cells will be grown, and an integrated combinatorial mixer, which delivers different solution combinati ons to the culture chambers. The array consists of 8 individually isolated micro cultu re chambers with cell loading inlets that enable cell introduction into the culture chambers. Each culture chamber also has an outlet so fluidic samples can be collected. The chamber dimensions are L 1500 \u00b5m \u00d7 W 700 \u00b5m \u00d7 H 32 \u00b5m. The chamber height of 32 \u00b5m is tall enough to accommodate a wide range of mammalian cells, as many of them ha ve height around 10 \u00b5m. The device has a combinatorial mixer with three inputs, and the combinatorial mixer recombines those 47 inputs into the seven possible outputs. For example, compounds A, B, and C, will be recombined into A, B, C, A+B, A+C, B+C, and A+B+C. Note that one control channel that receives an unmixed input stream is also included as the 8 th output. One key feature of the chip is the overpass structure that allows one microfluidic channel to cross over other microfluidic channels, and such fluidic network component makes the combinatorial mixer possible. Solutions c ontaining different compounds will be injected into the chip via the fluid inlets of the combinatorial mixer, and the outputted combinatorial streams will flow into the culture chambers. Figure 3-1. Layout of the device design showing the components of the 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm chip. The device is realized by the surface micromachining of Parylene C (poly(chloro- p-xylylene)). Several of the beneficial propert ies of Parylene C make it an ideal material for both 3-D microfluidic fabrication and cons tructing a cell culture and cell-based assay device. Parylene C is compatible with lithographic CMOS/MEMS fabrication processes and our previous work has reported that multip le layers of Parylene C can be deposited and patterned to build complicated mechani cal structures. This will allow our 3-D 48 microfluidic device to be monolithically fa bricated, favorably avoiding the multilayer bonding process. Another aspect of this device is the ability to culture cells on-chip and Parylene C is suitable for this purpose. Because Parylene C has been shown to be biocompatible and resistant to corrosive body fluids, it was used in many implantable devices [35, 36]. Long-term cell culturing using Paryle ne C devices have been demonstrated [81]. Also, Parylene C is chemically inert and stable toward many organic solvents [34]. In addition, Parylene C is tr ansparent in the visible range and this will allow cells to be easily observed with light mi croscopy. All these valuable properties of Parylene C make it the material of choice for fabricating our device. 3.2.2 3-D Microfluidic Fabrication The device has two levels of microfluidic channels, and its five-mask fabrication process is shown in Figure 3-2. The 3-D rendition of th e p rocess flow is also included to aid visualization. The first-level channe ls were initially deposited, followed by the deposition of the overpasses and culture chambers. The device was fabricated using our developed Parylene surface micromachining tec hnology: alternating layers of Parylene C and sacrificial photoresist are deposited, and the sacrificial phot oresist between two layers of Parylene defines the channel. Af ter the photoresist is removed, the remaining hollow Parylene structures become the fluidic networks of the chip. 49 Figure 3-2. The monolithic fabrication process for making the three-dimensional microfluidic networks. (a) Cross sectional view of the fabrication process flow. (b) Three- dimensional rendition of the fabrication process flow. Inserts in (2) and (4) show how the overpass is made by first etching open the Pary lene and joining the two etched regions with the 2 nd sacrificial photoresist. The detailed fabrication pr ocess can be broken down into the following steps. First layer Parylene coating. Before any processing, the si licon wafer was cleaned with Piranha solution (H 2SO 4: H 2O2, 3:1) at 120oC for 5 min. The wafer was then soaked in 0.5% silane A-174 (gamma-methacryloxy-pr opyltrimethoxysilane, Specialty Coating (a) (b) IN) solution (DI water: isopropyl alcohol: A-174, 100:100:1) for 15 minutes to promote the adhesion between th e substrate and Parylene C. The Piranha treatment not only cleaned the surface, but also oxidized the substrate surface. The oxidized surface facilitated the binding of th e adhesion promotion A-174 molecule onto the surface. The chemical structure of the A-174 silane coupling agent follows the general structure of silane-b ased coupling agents: RnSiX(4- n). R is the nonhydrolyzable organic moiety that binds to the coating polymer, which is Parylene C in our case. The X represents alkoxy moieties, and is methoxy in A-174. During the treatment, the methoxy group is hydrolyzed to methanol, form ing hydroxyl group that can form hydrogen bonding with hydroxyl group on the substrate. Eventually, covalent Si-O bonding is formed in between the substrate and the coupling agent [82]. The other side of the silane molecule serves to grab onto the Parylene molecules to promote the adhesion onto the surface. After the treatment, a first thin a dhesion layer of Parylene C was deposited (3 \u00b5m) to cover the entire wa fer with a Cookson Electronics PDS 2010 system (Specialty Coating Systems, Indianapolis, IN). The subsequent deposited Parylene layers in the following processes are attached to this first Pa rylene layer instead of the silicon substrate and this is important because Parylene adhesi on to silicon without proper treatment can be very weak. A-174 adhesion promoter cannot be applied fo r the subsequent Parylene depositions because when there are photoresis t patterns on the substrate, isopropyl alcohol inside the treatment solution w ill quickly dissolve the photoresist. First layer channel. The first sacrificial photores ist layer (AZ4620 from Clariant, Charlotte, NC) was spin-coated (15 \u00b5m) a nd patterned with photolithography to define the first-level channels. The sacrific ial photoresist was hard baked at 120oC for 6 hours. 51 To promote adhesion of the next Parylene layer to the first Parylene layer, the surface was roughened using oxygen plasma and cleane d with 5% HF for 30 seconds. A second layer of Parylene C (10 \u00b5m) was then deposit ed to cover the sacrificial photoresist to form the first-level channels. Parylene patterning. Parylene C was patterned using oxygen plasma so the areas where the overpass structures would be joined were exposed. Th is Parylene patterning also opened the area where the mixer and the cultu re chamber would be connected. To pattern the Parylene, metal mask was us ed because oxygen plasma can also etch photoresist at a rate comparable to Parylene etching, so a very thick photoresist would have to be used. Also, when striping th e masking photoresist, the sacrificial photoresist can be partially dissolved and this can lead to debris clogging the channel or trapped air expanding and destroying the channel during subsequent thermal processes. Cr/Au (200/2500\u00c5) layer was deposited us ing an e-beam evaporator. To pattern the metal, a 15 \u00b5m AZ4620 photoresist was patterned on top of the metal, and the metals were etched using Au etchant type TFA (potassium iodide (KI) + iodine (I Danvers, and water) (Cynateck, Freemont, CA) . The photoresist wa s stripped using acetone. The Cr/Au metal layer was then used as an etch mask for Parylene patterning in oxygen plasma. The metals were stripped after Parylene patterning. Second layer channel. A second sacrificial photoresist was spin-coated (32 \u00b5m) and patterned to define the overpass structures and the culture chambers. This second sacrificial photoresist covered the etched open areas, and the overpasses spanned several of the first-level microfluidic channels. A third layer of Pa rylene C (10 \u00b5m) was 52 deposited after the same adhesion promotion treatment procedure as described in previous steps. This Parylene was patte rned using metal as mask and oxygen plasma etching. SU8 planarization and chip release. The whole chip was strengthened and planarized with patterned 100 \u00b5m SU8 (MicroChem, Ne wton, MA) to facilitate the following packaging of the chip. The wafer was diced to yield chips with dimensions of 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm. Finally, the chips were soaked in 65oC IPA (isopropyl alc ohol) to dissolve the sacrificial photoresis t in about one week. 3.2.3 Device Packaging a nd Fluidic Testing A packaging scheme was developed to make the fluidic connections with the chip as shown in Figure 3-3. A slab of cured PDMS (4 mm thick) (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning, Midland, MI) with punched holes was aligned onto the chip. The PDMS and the chip were clamped together by two pieces of tran sparent acrylic that were milled with a computer-numerical-controlled (CNC) machine. The PDMS acted both as a gasket layer to provide proper sealing and as an adapte r to connect the tubes. Syringes were connected with Teflon tubes, which had metal hollow tube (0.025 inch OD \u00d7 0.013 inch ID \u00d7 0.250 inch length) (New England Small Tube, Litchfield , NH) inserted at one end, and plugged into the ports of the piece of PDMS. Depending on different fluidic operations on the same device, the holes of the PDMS piece can be adjusted as open or blocked at different places to either open or close certain access holes on the chip. 53 Figure 3-3. Schematic representation of the packaging method for making fluidic connection. To solely test the combinatorial mixer on the fabricated device, the chip was packaged with holes open at the combinator ial mixer inlets and outlets, while the cell loading inlets were closed as illustrated in Figure 3-4. Green, red, and blue food coloring solutions were injected into the three inputs of th e com binatorial mixer, and yellow food coloring was delivered into the control channel. Arrows in Figure 3-4 show that two fluid stream s are separated spatially at the overpass region and flow in two different directions ( and ). The food coloring solutions were loaded into syringes and the flow rate was controlled by programmable syringe pumps (Har vard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Pictures of the experiment were taken with a stereoscope equipped with a CCD camera (Diagnostic Instrument, Sterling Heights, MI). Figure 3-4. Chip packaged for testing the combinatorial mixer. 54 3.2.4 Testing Parylene C as Suita ble Substrate for Cell Culture Tests were first performed to verify that Parylene C is a biocompatible substrate for our specific cell culture. Three culture s ubstrates were used in this experiment: (1) unmodified standard polystyren e petri dish (VWR Scientific, West Chester, PA), (2) petri dish coated with Parylene C, (3) petri dish coated with Parylene C and pretreated with 0.05% polyethyleneimine (PEI) in borate buffer solution. For samples (2) and (3), 5 \u00b5m Parylene C was deposited on 60 mm polystyrene petri dishes. Some petri dishes were further treated with 0.05% PEI solution for 24 hours, followed by rinsing with PBS three times before culturing. PEI solution has b een shown to enhance cell adhesion to culture substrates [83]. B35 rat neuroblastoma ce lls purchased and cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium Carlsbad, CA) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin /streptomycin/amphotericin B. To assess the growth rate of cells on th e different substrates, B35 cells were seeded onto the 60 mm petri dishes at an initial concentration of 6 \u00d7 10 4 cells mL1 and the cell concentrations were recorded again 24 hours afte r cell seeding. The cell gr owth rate was modeled using the exponential model: N(t) = N o \u00d7 exp(\u00b5t), where N is th e cell concentration, N o is the initial cell concentration, t is the culturing time and \u00b5 (hour1) is the specific growth rate. By culturing the cells through certain duration, t f, and measuring the starting and final cell concentration, N o and N f, the specific growth rate, \u00b5 (hour-1), can be 3.2.5 Microfluidic Cell Culture culture was done on-chip to test if the Parylene-based culture chamber can sustain cell growth. B35 rat neuroblastoma cells were cultured in 100 mm \u00d7 15 mm 55 polystyrene petri dishes and passaged every two to three days. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium with 10% fetal bovine penicillin/streptomyci B, and incubated in 5% CO 2 at 37oC. Cells were cultured on the chip using the following method. To culture the cells inside micro culture chambers, we assembled the device packaging with the cell loading inlets and outlets open, as shown in Figure 3-5. Before loading the cells onto the chip, the chip was sterilized by UV irradiation in addition to treatment of all th e fluidic channels and culture chambers with 70% ethanol solution. After the ethanol solution was rinsed out with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) so lution, the culture chambers were treated with 0.05 % polyethyleneimine (PEI) in borate buffer solution for 24 hours to enhance cell adhesion to the culture chamber. The PEI solution wa s subsequently rinsed out with PBS. Cells were suspended from petri dishes and delivered into the culture chambers with a syringe. The cells were allowed to settle and attach to the culture chamber surface for four hours. With the flow rate controlled by syringe pumps, cells were cu ltured with continuous perfusion of culture media at the flow rate of 33 nL min 1. During the culture experiment, the device was kept inside an incubator that was set at 37oC and 5% CO 2. Cell growth was monitored periodically with a Nikon E800 upright microscope. Figure 3-5. Schematics showing the device operation procedure for the on-chip cell culture experiment. 56 3.2.6 Integrated Combinatorial Mixer for Cell Treatment A straightforward experiment was perfor med using the integrated combinatorial mixer for cell treatment. The device was assembled with all the inlets and outlets open, as shown in Figure 3-6. Cells were injected into the culture chamber following the same procedure as in cell culturing. After the load ed cells attached to th e chamber surface, we injected three different cell staining solutions: 0.005% w/v methylene blue combinatorial mixer channels. solution (0.5% w/v crystal vi with 10% ethanol oxalate) and methylene blue solution (1% w/v in water) were purchased from The Science Company (Denver, CO) and neutral red solution (neutr al red 1.0 g/L, acetic acid 2 mL/L in water) was purchased from Sigma-Aldr ich (St. Louis, MO). The cell staining solutions were diluted to the indicated con centration with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. No fluid was injected into th e control channel. The stain loading was controlled by syringe pumps and was set at 30 \u00b5L min 1 for a duration of 10 minutes. Pictures of each culture chamber were taken 30 minutes after the flow was stopped. With the above operation, cells in different culture chamber received different combination of stains, and the cells in the control chambe r did not receive any staining solutions. Figure 3-6. Schematics showing the device operation procedure for cell assay with combinatorial mixer. 57 3.3 Results and Discussion 3.3.1 Device Fabrication and Combinatorial Mixer Testing Figure 3-7. Monolithically fabricated microfluidic cell culture array with an integrated combinatorial mixer. (a) Fabricated 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm chip. (b) SEM image of the cross section of the microfluidic overpass. The overpass has two-level microfluidic channels and such structures will allow two fluidic streams to be separated spatially at the overpass. (c) Surface height profile scan of the overp ass region before SU8 planarization. The overpass structure is about 15-20 \u00b5m higher than the first-level microfluidic channels. Figure 3-7(a) shows the fabricated chip having a di mension of 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm with a thickness of approximately 672 \u00b5m. One characteristic of monolithic fabrication is that it yields devices which are typically thinner than devices fabricated using multilayer bonding process. Both Parylene and SU8 are transparent and experiment can be easily observed with a microscope from the top side of the chip. It is also possible to release the device from substrate by either adding a sa crificial photoresist before the first layer Parylene deposition or skipping the A-174 adhe sion promotion step and the chip will (a) (b) (c) 58 separate from the substrate after soaking in acetone [84]. This will result in a thin and flexible microfluidic device and the flexibility can be useful for implanting devices into animal or human bodies. By using the bi-level sacrificial photoresi st process, channels of different heights (15 and 32 \u00b5m) were successfully created. This enables overpass to be created and allows the higher microfluidic channel to cro ss over the shallower microfluidic channel. We examined the fabricated microfluidic overpass by taking SEM images of the cross section of the overpass structures. Figure 3-7(b) shows the two-le vel microfluidic channels and such a structure could allow two fluidic streams to be separated spatially at the overpass region. The microfluidic channe ls are semi-circular in shape because the sacrificial photoresist was hard baked. Th e adhesion promoter, silane-based A-174, led to a strong adhesion of the first layer Parylene to the substrat e. The subsequent Parylene adhesion was strengthened by roughening th e surface using oxygen plasma to increase the effective bonding area and a thorough cleaning with HF to ensure a contaminating-free surface. The SU8 further strengthened th e bonding of the underlying Parylene layers to the substrate. As a result, the chip was able to withstand rele ase in isopropyl alcohol without delamination. The SU8 also planariz ed the surface so seali ng material such as PDMS gasket layer or o-rings can be pl aced directly onto the chip surface without destroying the delicate microchannels. Figure 3-7(c) shows the su rface profile scan (P-15 stylus profilometer from KL A-Tencor, San e overpass stru cture before SU8 planarization, and it show s that the overpass structure is about 15 \u00b5m higher than the first-level microfluidic channels. This monolithic fabrication has allowed us to fabricate our chips without additional multilayer bonding. It is possible to create combinatorial 59 mixer with even more inputs and outputs by following the same fabrication steps. Additional overpasses can be placed in to accomm odate the routing of the microchannels. This is similar to laying down all the wires in a basic circuit diagram that numerous wires can be drawn on a 2-D space by using the cross over symbols. The successful development of this method lays the f oundation to build more complicated 3-D microfluidic devices. Our proof-of-concept combinatorial mixer was able to take in the three input streams of food colorings (red, green, a nd blue) and generated the seven possible combinations, as shown in Figure 3-8. The input flow rate of the food c oloring injection was controlled by syringe pumps and experiments at two different flow rates were shown. The control channel received onl y the yellow food coloring th at was not mixed with any other solutions. Figure 3-8(a) shows the assemble d device with appropriate tubes plugged in, and our schem e of packaging has worked without any fluid leakage. This packaging method is uncomplicated as the PD MS slab can be quickly prepared in-house and holes be readily punched in. Only a simp le rectangular pattern has to be machined on the acrylic to provide access spaces for th e tubes. Plugging Teflon tubes into PDMS ports has been standard in various PDMS micr ofluidic devices. This packaging scheme is suitable for cell-based application as no high pressure environment will be required. If high operating pressure is required (>100 psi), plugging tubes into the PDMS will not hold at such pressure, and ot her packaging scheme has to be used. One packaging method is to use o-rings or gaskets and mach ined manifold to connect to high pressure fittings [44]. Figure 3-8(b) and Figure 3-8(c) show that the overpass structures enable one fluidic stream to flow over several other microchannels. In microfluidic devices, the 60 Reynolds number is usually low so the fluid flow s at micro scale are laminar. As a result, mixing occurs by diffusion alone and flow rate becomes an important factor that affects the homogeneity of the mixture. Figure 3-8. Combinatorial mixer demonstr ation. (a) Assembled device with food coloring being injected. Green (G), red (R ) and blue (B) food coloring solutions are injected into the combinatorial mixer inle ts, while the yellow (Y ) food coloring solution is injected into the control channel. Combin atorial mixer operated at two flow rates: (b) 10 \u00b5L min 1, (c) 0.1 \u00b5L min1. The scale bar represents 1 mm. Figure 3-8(b) shows the combinatorial mixe r at an input flow rate of 10 \u00b5L min1, and the stripes from the input streams of food coloring solutions are st ill visible at the end of the serpentine channels. However, even though the mixture is not homogeneous, the correct combinations of fluid streams are still generated. Figure 3-8(c) shows the (a) (b) (c) 1 cm 61 combinatorial mixer at lower flow rate, 0.1 \u00b5L min1, and as flow rate goes down, molecules have more time to diffuse across th e channel for better mixing. At the flow rate of 0.1 \u00b5L min1, the stripes of the input fluid streams are no longer visible at the end of the serpentine channel. One can understand this effect conceptu ally by considering a T-junction mixer with two fluid streams flowi ng alongside each other. The time, t, for a molecule with diffusion coefficient, D, to di ffuse across a channel with width w, can be estimated as t ~ w2/D. With a fluid velocity of U, the molecule will travel down the channel with a distance Z duri ng that time period, and Z ~ Uw2/D [74]. This expression indicates that as flow rate increases, the st ripes will travel longer distances before they are completely mixed with each others. Th e serpentine channel helps mixing by giving the molecules more time to diffuse across the channel before they reach the outlet. Our fabrication method offers the opport unity for scaling up the number of inputs for the combinatorial mixer. More inputs can be incorporated using the same method of first laying down the first-level channels, follo wed by the making of the overpasses. As a result, even when the number of inputs and outputs increase, the complexity of fabrication does not increase substantially. In addition, a combinatorial mixer with a diluter can be fabricated using the same fabrication process. Typical biological assays often include multiple dilutions of compounds to assess the concentration-dependent cellular responses to certain compounds. To realize such a device, we can incorporate a concentration gradient generator into each of the inputs, and each of the input streams will be diluted into sub-streams with different concentrations. Those streams of dilutions can be recombined in 3-D microfluidic ne tworks, which can be constructed using the same method as our current fabrication process. 62 3.3.2 Parylene C as a Substrate for Cell Culture The cell chamber of the chip is composed of Parylene C and we performed a biocompatibility testing to verify that cells can grow properly on Parylene C surfaces. B35 rat neuroblastoma cells were grown on three different substrates: (1) unmodified standard polystyrene petri dish, (2) petri dish coated with Parylene C, and (3) petri dish coated with Parylene C and pretreated with 0.05% polyethyleneimine (PEI) solution. The cell growth rates on the prepared substrates are plotted in Figure 3-9. The result shows that the g rowth rates on all three substrates are similar. The growth rate on untreated Parylene appeared to be slightly lower and this can be due to the lack of proper cell anchoring to the substrate. PEI is consisted of many positively charged amine groups and can help attract the negative charged surface molecules on the cell membrane. These results show that Parylene C is a biocompatible substrate for cell culturing and is a suitable material for constructing micro culture chambers. Other types of cells such as hippocampal CA1 have shown on Parylene C substrate [81, 85]. Figure 3-9. B35 cell growth rate s on three different substrat es: (1) unmodified standard polystyrene petri dish, (2) petri dish coated w ith Parylene C, (3) petri dish coated with Parylene C and pretreated with 0.05% polyethyleneimine (PEI) in borate buffer solution before cell seeding. Results are the means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). (n = 3). 63 3.3.3 Microfluidic Cell Culture Cell culture inside the micro culture chamber was performed using B35 rat neuroblastoma cells to test that the microf luidic chip could sustain cell growth. The culture chamber was treated with PEI solu tion to enhance cell adhesion before cell seeding. Cell suspension was delivered into the chip with a syringe and a static condition was followed to allow the cells to adhere to the surface. This step is important that without proper cell adhesion to be made to the surface, the cells w ould flow away when a flowing condition is introduced. The cells were grown with a continuous perfusion of media at 33 nL min 1 inside a 37oC incubator. At this flow ra te, the content of the culture chamber was turned over at approximatel y once every minute so cells would not be deprived of nutrients. Gas can pass through the PDMS, which is highly permeable to oxygen (diffusion constant, D = 3.4 \u00d7 109 m2 s1) and enter the chip via any of the access holes on-chip. Figure 3-10 shows finite element anal ysis of oxygen transport using the com bined transient diffusion/convection mode l and incompressible Navier-Stokes model in Comsol Multiphysics (Comsol, Burlington, MA). The culture media flows in through the inlet at 2 \u00d7 106 m/s and the oxygen can enter through the PDMS. The fluid velocity profile was solved first and the stored solution was used to solve for the concentration profile in the diffusion/convec tion module. The diffusion cons tant of oxygen in water is 2.1 \u00d7 10 9 m2 s1. Result shows that oxygen can r eadily pass through the PDMS and enter the culture chamber. 64 Figure 3-10. Simulation of oxygen transport th rough the PDMS into the chamber. (a) Configuration used for the simulation. Fluid is delivered from the inlet and the oxygen can enter through the PDMS. Oxygen concen tration at various times: (b) 1800 s, (c) 3600 s, and (d) 7200 s. Figure 3-11 shows that cells proliferated insid e the micro culture chambers and eventually reached confluency after 42 hours of culturing. The ca lculated cell growth rate was 0.018 hr1. This study shows that cells can be sustained inside the Parylene C microfluidic cell culture chambers. Figure 3-11. Cell culture inside Pa rylene C micro culture chamber. 4 hours 16 hours 42 hours 300 \u00b5m 65 3.3.4 Integrated Combinatorial Mixer for Cell Treatment The combinatorial mixer was used to perform a cell treatment and the result is shown in Figure 3-12. The chip was first packaged with all of the acces s holes open, and the device was operated as shown in Figure 3-6. B35 cells were seed ed by injecting them through the cell loading inlets of individual chambers, and the cells attached to the culture chamber surface after four hours. Following cell adhesion, three cell stains, crystal violet, methylene blue and neutral red were inject ed through the combinatorial mixer inlets, while no solution was injected in to the control channel. The combinatorial mixer recombined the input streams a nd simultaneously delivered the various combinatorial streams into the cell culture cham bers. Cells in different culture chambers received different combinations of the stai ns and were stained with different color patterns, while the cells in the control cham ber were unstained. This experiment shows that we can use the on-chip combinatorial mi xer to simultaneously interrogate individual culture chambers, and each group of cells insi de the different culture chamber received different inputs and showed distinct responses . Eight different comb inatorial conditions were created simultaneously, saving the extra pi petting steps. This preliminary study lays the foundation to perform experiments with lo nger duration and enhanced complexity involving cell growth under continuous perfusi on of different combinatorial culturing solutions. Besides monitoring cell growth, more complicated cellular response or signal pathways such as gene expression can be studied on the current chip by integrating existing biological technologies. Real-tim e monitoring of gene expression on microfluidic chips has been demonstrated using a fluorescent transc ription reporter, and 66 we can monitor the cellular response using si milar methods by loading transfected cells into the culture chamber [70]. Figure 3-12. Cell treatment using the integrated combinatorial mixer. 3.4 Conclusion In this chapter, we presented a monolithic fabrication technology of an integrated combinatorial mixer for cell assay, and showed the ability to simultaneously treat arrays of cells with different combinations of compounds. Our fabri cation method enables devices to be conveniently fabric ated at the wafer scale. Fabr icated using a scalable five- mask process with Parylene C as the struct ural material, the device can simultaneously provide eight combinatorial medium outputs to study cell cultures. The microfluidic overpass structure allows one microfluidic channels to cross over other microfluidic channels, and using similar fabrication pro cess, the number of inputs and outputs of the combinatorial mixer can be scaled up for high-throughput cell-based assay. Such device can efficiently collect large quantities of information pertaining to cyto-regulation and elucidate combinatorial effects of multiple compounds on cells. Furthermore, our fabrication technology can enhance the functiona lities of current lab- on-a-chip devices by integrating the devices with complex 3-D micr ofluidic networks. The fruition of such 300um 67 system will enable lab-on-a-chip devices to perform highly parallel and combinatorial chemical or biochemical reactions with reduced labor, reagents, and time. 68 Chapter 4: Combinatorial Cell Assay Device on Glass with Membrane-Based Cell Culture Chamber 4.1 Introduction With the successful development of the monolithic fabrication of 3-D microfluidic networks, the next step is to improve device design to facilitate cell-based assay on-chip. One of the improvements is to simplify the experimental procedure and make the device more user-friendly. Micr ofluidic devices are often complicated to fabricate and it is important to make them eas y to use for end users. Also, most modern cell culture and assay platforms such as multi-well plates are based on transparent substrates such as glass or polystyrene plastics, and it would be ideal to construct microfluidic devices based on glass. Finally, it would be advantageous to improve the cell culture chamber design to mimic the in vivo cellular microenvironment. While there have been a plethora of micr ofluidic cell culture and assay devices being created, many of them did not take full advantages of microfluidic-based systems. One advantage that microfluidic offers over traditional culture container such as petri dish is the ability to control the cellular mi croenvironment. Micro scale devices have characteristic length scale of 0.1-100 \u00b5m, which is the same as the microenvironment that the cells reside in. Therefore, microflu idic device has the ability to create culture environment that mimics the in vivo microenvironment and provide assay results that can be more biologically relevant than tradition culture platforms. The cell microenvironment is comprised of several comp lex factors. One important parameter in cell microenvironment is fluid flow as it pr ovides a way to transport important factors 69 such as nutrients, wastes, oxygen, and various soluble factors to and from cells. Depending on the cell locations, different cells ar e exposed to different range of flow rate inside our body. Endothelial cells lining the wa ll of aorta can experi ence flow rate up to as much as 300,00 \u00b5m/s, while interstitial flow at the capillary level is at 0.1-1 \u00b5m/s range [86]. Microfluid ic devices have been created to study the influence of shear stress on cells and the laminar nature of the microflu idic flow and the ability to easily control flow and monitor cell behavi or simultaneously have made microfluidic device very suitable for such studies. While certain cells re quire constant shear stre ss to prosper, it is important to note that high shear stress level can be detrimental to certain cell types [68]. This is an especially important aspect to be considered during mi crofluidic cell culture design as perfusion will inevit ably introduce shear stress to cells and most microfluidic cell culture devices utilize perf usion to deliver nutrients and other soluble factors to the cells. While cells such as endothelial cells that line the wall of bl ood vessel are directly exposed to fluid flow and share stress, most ce lls inside the tissues are residing in a space that is shielded from convective flow. Fluid flow inside such environment is minimized while transport is dominated by diffusion [69]. The Peclet number, Pe, is the ratio that indicates the relative importance of c onvection to diffusion and is defined as DvlPe , (4.1) where v is the fluid velocity, l is the characteristic length and D is the diffusion constant. Inside the tissue, the Peclet num ber is about 0.1 and the shear st ress is about 0-2 Pa [69]. While traditional cell culture on flat petri dish or well plate substrate provides a low shear environment for the cells, the cells are subject to very different condition than cellular 70 microenvironment inside the tissue. The l onger length scale and larger volume of the macro scale cultures allow for chaotic flow. While this allows for better mixing, it can disturb soluble factor patterns that can only be established with laminar flow. Another significant difference is that cells inside the tissue reside in a 3-D environment and can receive fluid from both top and bottom sides of the cells. Cells cultured on a flat substrate are limited to only receive extracellular factors from one side. Microfluidic technology can address those problems and create culture space that has precisely controlled flow conditions and better mimics the in vivo microenvironment. While the potential utility of microfluid ic devices is clear, there are various barriers that can present challenges for microflu idic devices to be adopted by biologists. Some issues that have to be addressed are the ease of use and integration with current laboratory equipments and techniques. It is important that the device design does not involve excess complexity and be suitable for the end users to operate. Our first- generation chip described in the pervious chapter has some improvements that can be made. The device was fabricated on silicon substrate and this can make it difficult for observation under microscopy. Such setup requir es light to be illuminated from the same side as the objective for imaging the device, but many microscopes ha ve light source on the opposite side of the objective. Also, the fl uids are delivered from the top side because using patterned SU8 and etched Parylene as open ports is simpler for fabrication than performing through-wafer etching for ports fr om the bottom side. However, because such setup requires tubes to be plugged in fr om the top side, the overall device thickness is increased and a long working distance object ive has to be used. This also limits the resolution of the objectives that can be used as high resolu tion objectives generally have 71 short working distance. Therefore, using a gl ass substrate for the device would be more ideal and imaging can be performed with mi nimal fluorescence interference. Proper cell- based assay can be designed so the readout can be done dire ctly on-chip to simplify the experiments. Another possible area for improvement is the cell loading procedure. The first- generation chip required channel walls to be treated with adhesion promoting factors before cell loading. Also, the cell loading was not very efficient as many cells were flushed through the channel before enough cells we re captured inside the culture chamber. Furthermore, the previous design required that cells be loaded into each chamber separately. While doing so only required relatively short amount of time because only eight chambers were included on that chip, this can be a significant problem when the device is scaled up to include more chambers. It would be ideal to design a chip that incorporates an efficient and use r-friendly cell loading process. In this chapter, the development of 3-D microfluidic networks on glass substrate for cell-based assays with multiple combinati ons of compounds is presented. The final assembled device is composed of a porous membrane integrated in between a multilayer Parylene 3-D microfluidic chip and a PDMS microfluidic chip. The methods to improve cell loading efficiency and to simplify the cell loading procedure are demonstrated. The culture chamber incorporates a bi-level de sign to mimic the cellular microenvironment in vivo where the cells reside in a diffusion do minated space separated from convection dominated blood vessels. In our previous ch apter, we have discussed the method to monolithically fabricate three-dimensional (3-D) microfluidic networks on silicon substrate. The developed fabrication pro cess was based on the surface micromachining 72 of Parylene C (poly(chloro-p-xylylene)) and eliminated the need for the bonding steps as in many other multilayer microfluidic devices. The device presented in this chapter is fabricated based on the extension of such procedure. We have characterized concentration distribution of each output from the combinatorial mixer by using a fluorescence method. Two quantitative cell-b ased assays were performed using this device. We cultured rat neuronal cells, B-35, on this device and screened for the ability of three chemicals to attenuate cell deat h caused by cytotoxic hydrogen peroxide. We also assayed for the combinatorial effects of three chemotherapeutic compound exposures on human breast cancer ca rcinoma, MDA-MB-231. 4.2 Experimental 4.2.1 Device Design The schematic of the assembled microfluidic device is shown in Figure 4-1. The device is composed of a porous PET (polyeth ylene terephthalate) membrane sandwiched in between the two a 3- D microfluidic Parylene C (poly(chloro-p- integrated and a PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) chip with one-to-eight manifold and cell culture chambers. 73 Figure 4-1. Schematics of the microfluidic device. (Left) 3-D rendition of the device before assembly. (Right) Side view of the device. Figure 4-2 shows the layout of the 1.7 cm \u00d7 1.7 cm 3-D microfluidic Parylene- based chip with integrated combinatorial mixer. The combinatorial mixer has three inputs, which are recombined into the se ven possible outputs. An unmixed control channel is also included. Like the chip de scribed in the previous chapter, the overpass structure allows one microfluidic stream to cross over other microchannels, and a control channel that receives no ne of the three inputs is included. Unlike the previous chip, glass wafer will be used as the substrate instead of silicon. The chamber diameter is 1 millimeter. The 3-D microfluidic Parylene chip is consisted of two different layers of microfluidic network, with the bottom 14 \u00b5m height channels making up the basic combinatorial mixer channels and the t op 25 \u00b5m height channels making up the overpasses and the outlet channels. 74 Figure 4-2. Layout of the 3-D micr ofluidic Parylene-based chip. Compounds A, B, and C are delivered in to eight chambers with different combinations and concentrations, and the concentration of each compound inside the chamber is determined by the fluidic resistance of the channels. As the channel width is much larger than the channel height, the re sistance can be modeled using the simplified formula for rectangular channel: 312 whLR . (4.2) R is the resistance, \u00b5 is the fluid viscosity, and L, w, and h are the length, width and height of the channel, respectively. Chambers receiving multiple compounds are designed to have equal dilution of the input compounds. For example, chamber 2 is designed to be 50% of input A and 50% of i nput B so the channel connecting input A and chamber 2 (channel A II) and the channel connecting i nput B and chamber 2 (channel B I) would have the same fluid re sistance. As the channel hei ghts are the same for all the channels in the combinatorial mixer, the chan nel widths and lengths are tuned to achieve 75 the desired flow resistance. The fluidic channe ls can be represented as network of fluidic resistors and the schematic is shown in Figure 4-3. Figure 4-3. Equivalent fluidic resistance network of the chip. In addition, the fluidic networks are desi gned so the flow rate into each chamber is the same to prevent variation in shear stre ss that can affect the cells. This is done by making the combined fluid resistances leading up to each chamber to be the same. Thus, the fluidic resistances of channels, A I, BII, CIV, and N, which lead to chambers with single compounds, would be the same. The fluidic resi stances of channels leading to chambers with two compounds are twice of the fluid resi stances of channels leading to chambers with single compounds. For example, channels A II and B I, which connect input A to chamber 2 and input B to chamber 2, respectively, would have twice th e fluidic resistance of channel A I. The fluidic resistances of channe ls leading to chambers with three compounds are three times of the fluid resistances of channels leading to chambers with 76 single compounds. The flow rate, Q is related to the pressure drop, P, and fluidic resistance, R, by the following equation, RPQ . (4.3) With a constant flow rate source (s yringe pump) delivering a flow rate, QO, into each input, Q1, the flow rate into chamber 1, whic h receives a single compound, would be ] [1] [1 1 TOTALI O A RA RQ Q . (4.4) R[A TOTAL ] is defined by the following equation: ] [1 ] [1 ] [1 ] [1 ] [1 IV III II I TOTAL A R A R A R A R A R . (4.5) R represents the resistance and the name inside the square bracket i ndicates the specific channel. For example, R[A I] is the fluidic resistance for channel A I. The expressions for ] [TOTALB R and ] [TOTALC R follow same expression as equation 4.5. Q2, the flow rate into chamber 2, would be the combined flow rate of flow through channel A II and channel B I: ] [1] [1 ] [1] [1 2 RB RQ A RA RQ Q . As stated above, ] [31] [21] [21] [21] [III IV I II I A R A R B R A R A R ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [N R C R B R A RIV II I ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [III II IV I IV II C R C R B R B R A R A R 77 ] [ ] [ ] [I III III C R B R A R ] [1 ] [1 ] [1 TOTAL TOTAL TOTAL C R B R A R Thus, the two chambers, chamber 1 and chambe r 2 would receive the same flow rate of 3/7Q O. The designs for all the other channels fo llow the same principle so the flow rates into all the chambers would be equal and the chambers receiving two or more inputs would have equal flow rate from each of the connecting channels. Figure 4-4 shows the layout of the 2.5 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm PDMS microfluidic chip with 100 \u00b5m height channels. It has punched holes th at match the locations of the ports on the Parylene microfluidic chip. The PDMS piece also has a cell loading inlet and a one-to- eight manifold that distributes cells or reag ents into eight chambers simultaneously. In addition, the chamber locations of the PDMS chip align to the locations of the culture chambers of the Parylene microfluidic chip. At the cell culture chamber area, a 0.5 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm transparent PET (polyethylene terephthalate) membrane with 0.4 or 1.0 \u00b5m diameter pores is sandwiched in between t hose two chips, and the membrane separates the culture chamber into two levels. During the device operation, the cells will be loaded via the PDMS channels, and the membrane a llows cells to be efficiently collected, eliminating the need to coat the microfluidic channels with cell at tachment factors. During the cell assay experiments, cells will be maintained at the cell culture level, on top of the membrane and treatment solution will be delivered via the flui d delivery level, at the bottom of the membrane. To expose all chambers to a common fluid solution such as during washing or staining the cells, fluid can be injected via the cell loading inlet or the outlet ports. For treating cells under combinatorial conditions, the fluids will be injected into combinatorial mixer inlets. The cham ber for cell culture on the PDMS chip is 100 78 \u00b5m height and 600 \u00b5m in diameter and the chamber on the Parylene chip is 90 \u00b5m height and 1,000 \u00b5m in diameter. This results in a total volume of 100 nL. As typical cell culture has cell dens ity range from 104 to 107 cells/mL, this would translate to about 1 to 1,000 cells per chamber. Typical cell culture procedure calls for changing of media every two to three days, so cells within the chambers under that density range should have sufficient nutrients to grow in two to three days without cu lture media change. Figure 4-4. Layout of the PDMS microfluidic chip. 4.2.2 Device Fabrication The fabrication process for constructing 3- D microfluidic Parylene chip is based on the developed fabrication method for m onolithically constructing 3-D microfluidic networks as described in the previous ch apter. The process flow for the surface micromachining process is shown in Figure 4-5. Soda lime gl ass wafer (thickness of 500 \u00b5m ) was cleaned with Piranha solution (H 2SO 4: H 2O2, H2O; 5:1:1) at 120oC for 5 minutes. The wafer was then soaked in 0.5% silane A-174 (Specialty Coating Systems, Indianapolis, IN) solution (DI water: IPA: A-174, 100:100:1) for 15 minutes to promote 79 the adhesion between the substrate and Pary lene C. A first thin adhesion layer of Parylene C was deposited (3 \u00b5m) on the wafe r. The first sacrificial photoresist layer (AZ4620 from Clariant, Charlotte, NC) was sp in-coated (14 \u00b5m) and patterned to define the first-level channels. A second layer of Parylene C (10 \u00b5m) was then deposited to cover the sacrificial photoresist, forming the first-level channels. Parylene C was patterned using oxygen plasma so the areas where the overpass st ructures would be joined were exposed. This Parylene pattern ing also opened the area where the mixer and the culture chamber would be connected. A second sacrificial photoresist was spin- coated (25 \u00b5m) and patterned to define the overpass structures and the culture chambers. This second sacrific ial photoresist covered the areas that were etched open, and the overpasses spanned several of the first-level microfluidic channels. A third layer of Parylene C (2 \u00b5m) was deposited. The whol e chip was planarized with thick SU8 (90 \u00b5m) and Parylene C was patterned to define the access holes. To improve SU8 strength and adhesion to the bottom layers, after SU 8 developing, the SU8 was subject to flood exposure under an UV canon for 3 minutes to fu rther crosslink all SU8 molecules before hard baking the SU8 at 100 oC for 90 minutes. As a result, acetone was able to be used to dissolve the sacrificial photor esist. Acetone can dissolv e photoresist quicker than isopropyl alcohol, which was used in the previo us processes. However, acetone can also cause delamination and device failure while isopropyl alco hol causes such process at slower rate. Using the extra step to further harden the SU8, we were able to dissolve the sacrificial photoresist in heated (35oC) acetone without device failure and the chip release process can be done in three days instead of one week. After sacrificial photoresist 80 dissolution, the remaining hollow Parylene stru ctures become the fluidic networks of the chip. Figure 4-5. The monolithic fabrication proce ss for making the 3-D microfluidic Parylene- based chip. The PDMS microfluidic chip (4 mm thickness) was fabricated using the micro-molding process as shown in Figure 4-6. A 100 \u00b5m SU-8 was spin-coated on silicon wafer and patterned by photolithography. Then, the SU-8 mold was c oated with 2 \u00b5m Parylene C to prevent PDMS from sticking to the mold. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning, Mi dland, MI) was prepared with a 10:1 ratio of silicone base and curing agent and poured onto the mold . The PDMS was cured in oven at 80oC for 30 minutes. The PDMS was peeled off and tri mmed to size of 2.5 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm and the fluidic ports were punched with a 23 gauge flat tip needle. 81 Figure 4-6. The process for making the PDMS chip. Track-etched porous PET (polyethylene te rephthalate) membranes with size of 0.5 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm were cut off from cell cultu re inserts. Membranes with 0.4 \u00b5m pore diameter have pore density of 4 \u00d7 10 6 pores cm2 and were cut off from Corning Transwell 24 mm diameter inserts (Corning, Corning, NY). Membranes with 1 \u00b5m pore diameter have pore density of 1.6 \u00d7 106 pores cm2 and were cut off from BD Falcon 24 mm diameter inserts (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). 4.2.3 Device Packaging and Operation For device packaging, the porous membrane was placed onto the chamber area of the PDMS chip and the PDMS chip with the membrane was aligned onto the 3-D microfluidic Parylene chip. The PDMS and the Parylene chip were clamped together by two pieces of transparent acrylic that were milled with a computer-numerical-controlled (CNC) machine. With the membrane, the culture chamber turns into a two-level 82 configuration (Figure 4-1(b)). The PDMS also provi ded proper sealing and acted as an adapter to connect the tubes. Metal hollow t ubes (0.025 inch OD \u00d7 0.013 inch ID \u00d7 0.25 inch leng th) were inserted into one end of Teflon tubes. The Teflon tubes were connected with syringes and plugged into the ports of the piece of PDMS. This packaging method allows other PDMS microflu idic chips to be integrated and provides the opportunity to construct more compli cated device by adding components such as check valves, active valves and pumps. 4.2.4 Microfluidic Simulation The mass and momentum transfer at the two-level culture chamber area was modeled in 2-D using finite element anal ysis with Comsol Multiphysics (Comsol, Burlington, MA). The configuration in Figure 4-7 was used. For the velocity pro file simulation, the steady state incompressible Navier-Stokes application mode was implemented. The density and viscosity of water, 1 g cm3 and 103 Pa\u00b7s, respectively, were used. The fluid flows into the inlet at a flow rate of 102 m s1 and flows out via the outlet. In addition, simulation was done to ensure that molecules entering the inlet can reach the cell culture level in a sufficien tly short amount of time. The multiphysics application mode with the combined incomp ressible Navier-Stokes model and transient diffusion/convection model was used. Both types of membranes that were used in this work were simulated; the membrane with 0.4 \u00b5m pore size has a pore density of 4 \u00d7 10 6 pores cm2 and the membrane with 1 \u00b5m pore diam eter has a pore density of 1.6 \u00d7 106 pores cm2. The diffusion constant of a small protein in water, D = 106 cm2 s1 was used. Initially, the unsteady state flow profile wa s solved from 0 to 780 seconds with a time step of 30 seconds, and the solution at each time step was saved. Then, the 83 diffusion/convection module was applied and th e concentration profile at each time step was solved using the saved fluid velocity profile. The two models were not solved together to save computation power. Figure 4-7. The configuration used for fluid simulation at the two-level culture chamber area. 4.2.5 Combinatorial Mixer Characterization To characterize the concentration of the three input compounds inside each chamber, we packaged the device with a pi ece of PDMS with only the combinatorial mixer inlet and outlet ports. A red fluor escent molecule, sulforhodamine 101 (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), was used. We first tested if the fluorescence intensity would vary linearly with concentration. Backgr ound intensity was first measured by injecting DI water into the chamber. The fluorescence image of the chamber was captured with a Nikon E800 upright fluorescence microscope with a G-2E/C filter (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) and fluorescence intensity was m easured using ImageJ. Stock solution of sulforhodamine 101 was prepared at 3.3 mM by dissolving it in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and working solution was obtaine d by diluting in DI water. Then, 84 sulforhodamine 101 solutions at different concentrations, 2.0625, 4.125, 6.1875, and 8.25 \u00b5M, were injected into the chamber. The fluorescence image of the chamber was captured and fluorescence intensity was measured using ImageJ. Background intensity was subtracted from the measured fluorescence intensity. To characterize the combin atorial mixer, we first injected a red fluorescence solution, 8.25 \u00b5M sulforhodamine 101, into in put A, while injecting DI water into input B, input C, and control. The injection was controlled by sy ringe pumps and was set at 5 \u00b5L min 1 for duration of 20 minutes. After te n minutes, the fluorescence image of each chamber was captured with an upright fluorescence microscope with a G-2E/C filter. The fluorescence intensity was measured us ing ImageJ and background intensity was subtracted. The fluorescent concentration at each chamber was normalized against the input concentration. Fluores cence solution was then switched to input B, while injecting DI water into other inlets. The same procedur e was repeated for input C. The device was flipped over during imaging so the backside (the glass wafer side) was facing the objective. The backside acrylic had a mille d slot so the excitation light and emission light can directly reach the glass side without interference from the acrylic. 4.2.6 Device Operation for Cell-Based Assay On-Chip The device operation of a typical ce ll assay experiment is shown in Figure 4-8. 85 Figure 4-8. Typical device operation for cell-based assay using this device. (a) Suspension of cells was injected into the chip via the cell loading port, and cells were efficiently collected by and grown on the me mbrane. (b) Following in cubation at static condition for cell attachment, the compounds for treatment can be injected via the combinatorial mixer inlets, while keeping the cell loading port sealed with a solid stainless steel pin. (c) Reagents for washing the cells can be injected either via the outlet or the cell loading inlet. (d) Live/dead cell stains can be injected at the end to assess the viability. Before the device assembly, the PDMS chips and 3-D Parylene chips were sterilized with UV and ultrasonicated in ethanol for 10 minutes followed by 86 ultrasonication in water for 5 minutes. Afte r the devices were assembled, the devices were rinsed with DI water a nd filled with media prior to use. The porous membranes were sterilized by the manufactures, and a new piece of membrane was used for every experiment. The microfluidic channels were primed with water followed by cell culture media. Suspension of cells was loaded into syringe and was injected into the chip via the cell loading port. Cells were efficiently collected by and grown on the membrane, which was cell culture treated by the manufactures. Following incubation at static condition for cell attachment, the compounds for treatment ca n be injected via the combinatorial mixer inlets, while keeping the cell loading port sealed with a solid stainless steel pin. Reagents for washing the cells and staining cells can be injected either via the outlet or the cell loading inlet to replace the treatment compound solutions. After certain period of incubation, live/dead cell stains can be injected to assess the viability of the cells on-chip. Two cell-based assays were performed using this device and the general device operation follows the procedure described prev iously. The details of both experiments are described in the following sections. 4.2.7 Assay for Compounds' Ability to Reduce Cytotoxicity of Hydrogen Peroxide This microfluidic device was used to assay for the ability of 1,5- dihydroxyisoquinoline (ISO), deferoxamine (D FO), and 3-aminobenzoic acid (ABA) to alleviate cytotoxicity of hydrogen peroxide, wh ich is generated during brain ischemia and reperfusion injury and various neuropathological conditions [87]. B35 rat neuroblastoma cells were cultured in 100 mm \u00d7 15 mm polystyrene petri dish es and passaged every two to three days. All culture reagents were pur chased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) unless otherwise stated. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium 87 (DMEM) with 10% penicillin/streptomy and incubated in 5% The three compounds, 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinoline (ISO), deferoxamine (DFO), and 3-aminobenzoic acid (ABA) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Stoc k solution of 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinoline was prepared by dissolving it in di methyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a final concentration of 60 mM. Stock solution of deferoxamine was prepared by dissolving it in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) at a final concentration of 76 mM. Stock solution of 3-aminobenzoic acid was prepared by dissolvin g it in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a final concentration of 800 mM . The device was packaged with the porous membrane with 0.4 \u00b5m pore diameter. Cells were su and suspensi on of B35 cells was injected into the cell loading port. The cells were collected by and grown on the membrane. Following three hours of incubation inside the incubator after cell seeding, each compound (300 \u00b5M ISO, 1 mM DFO, 1 mM ABA) was mixed in DMEM media containing 1.5 mM hydrogen peroxide and injected into the combinatorial mixer inlets at 5 \u00b5L min1 for 30 minutes, followed by static condition inside the incuba tor for five minutes, while keeping the cell loading inlet sealed with a solid stainless steel pin. Then, fresh DMEM solution was injected into the cell loading inlet to replace the treatment solutions, and the cells were rinsed again by injecting DMEM via the outlet, while keeping the cell loading inlet sealed. The cells were inc ubated under static condition insi de the incubator for three hours. Live/dead cell stains (2 \u00b5M calcein AM/2 \u00b5M prop idium iodide) were injected via the cell loading inlet and the cells were incubated for 10 minutes. Calcein AM can permeate the cell membrane and the lip ophilic blocking groups are cleaved 88 nonspecifically by intracellula r esterases. The hydrolyzed form, calcein, results in a charged green fluorescent compound that is retained very well in side the cells. Therefore, green fluorescence is an indicator of live cells . Propidium iodide is a red fluorescent molecule that can only pass th rough cells with co mpromised membranes and bind to the nucleic acids. Thus, propidium iodide indicates dead cells. Often, there would be cells that are stained by both dyes and they are coun ted as dead cells because their membranes are already compromised while some intrace llular esterases are st ill present. The visualization and fluorescence image capturing of the cells were carried out using a fluorescence microscope with a G-2E/C a nd B-2E/C filters, and cytotoxicity was determined by the ratio of dead cells to tota l cells. Four experiments were done for this assay. 4.2.8 Assay for Exposing Breast Cancer Cells to Chemotherapeutic Agents The device was used to assay for the cy totoxic activity of three chemotherapeutic agents, vinorelbine (VIN), paclitaxel (PAC), and -linolenic acid (GLA), on human breast cancer carcinoma, MDA-MB-231 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium with 10% fetal bovine peni B, and incubated in 37oC. The three compounds, vinor elbine (VIN), paclitaxel (PAC), acid (GLA), were all purch ased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Stock solution of vinorelbine was prepared by dissolving it in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) at a final concentration of 10 mM and stored at 4oC. Stock solution of paclitaxel was prepared by dissolving paclitaxel in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a final concentrati on of 10 mM and stored at 4oC. Stock solution of - 89 linolenic acid was prepared by dissolving -linolenic acid in ethanol at a final concentration of 120 mM and stored in the dark at 20oC. The device was packaged with the membrane with 1 \u00b5m pores. Suspension of cells was injected into the cell loading port and trapped and cultured on the memb rane surface. Following three hours of incubation after cell seeding, each compound (8 \u00b5M VIN, 2 \u00b5M PAC, 50 \u00b5M GLA) was mixed in complete culture media and injected into the combinatorial mixer inlet at 10 \u00b5L min1 for 5 minutes, while keeping the cell loading inlet sealed with a solid stainless steel pin. Then, the cells were incubated with the treatment solutions for another 25 minutes inside the incubator. Afterwards, normal culture media was injected through the cell loading port to replace the treatment so lutions, and the rinsing was done again by injection through the outlet, wh ile keeping the cell loading in let sealed. The cells were then incubated for another 24 hours. Live/dead stains (2 \u00b5M \u00b5M propidium iodide) were injected and inc ubated for ten minutes, and the cells were visualized with a fluorescence microscope. The cytotoxicity was determined by the ratio of dead cells to total cells. Six e xperiments were done for this assay. 4.3 Results and Discussion 4.3.1 Combinatorial Mixer Characterization A fabricated Parylene chip and a packag ed device with three different colors of food coloring solutions injected are shown in Figure 4-9. The chip was able to withstand rele asing in warm (35oC) acetone without any delamination of the SU8 or Parylene layers. In contrast to the previous chip built on sili con, this version is based on glass substrate and is more compatible with microscopy. Both SU8 and Parylene C are transparent and 90 will allow the experiments to be observed from either side of the chip. The tubes will no longer obstruct the microscope objectives as the objectives can be used on the different side from the tubes. Fluid delivery follo ws the same straightforward procedure as previously described, using sy ringes and syringe pumps. Figure 4-9. (a) Fabricated Parylene chip af ter sacrificial photores ist dissolution. (b) Experiment setup to deliver f ood coloring solutions into the chip. (c) Packaged device with various food colori ng solutions injected. Figure 4-10 shows the serial dilution experim ent with sulforhodamine 101 by measuring the fluorescence inte nsity of sulforhodamine 101 at various concentrations on- chip. The linear fit of that data is included and has a coefficient of determination, r2, value of 0.9995. The result shows that su lforhodamine 101 has fluorescence intensity (a) (b) (c) 91 that varies linearly with the concentration at the concentration range we will work in and is suitable for our experiment. Figure 4-10. Serial dilution of sulforhodamine 101 on-chip. Figure 4-11 shows the concentration of the three inpu t compounds at each chamber. The combinatorial mixer was able to generate the correct combinations of the compound solutions. The experiment was done by injecting red fluorescent sulforhodamine 101 solution into one of the co mbinatorial inlet while injecting DI water into the other inlets. Fluorescence im age of each chamber was taken and the fluorescence level was measured with ImageJ. The same procedure was repeated for the other two combinatorial mixer inlets. While it is possible to use three fluorescent compounds with different excitation/emission spectra and injecting one compound into one separate inlet simultaneously, we avoided such procedure to prevent possible fluorescence crossover among the three fluorescent molecules. The concentration of the compounds can deviate from the design value because of dimensional inaccuracy in processing. Also, the sacrificial photores ist was baked during fabrication and this resulted in the edge of channel to be rounde d and deviated from the rectangular profile 92 that was used when calculating fluidic resistance. A more precise control during the fabrication process can result in the con centration profile better matching the design values. This characterization allows us to know the concentrations of the input compounds at each chamber. Such informa tion will assist us in deciding the input treatment compound concentration and let us know the treatment compound concentration at each chamber for the cell assay experiments. This method can be adopted for characterizing combinatorial mixe r with higher inputs as choosing four or more fluorescent molecules with non-overl apping emission/excitation spectra can be difficult and add to the cost because four or more optical filters for the fluorophores have to be obtained. Figure 4-11. Fluorescence characterization of the combinatorial mixer showing the concentration of the three input compounds at each chamber. Error bars are one standard deviation (SD). Number of experiments = 3. The combinatorial mixing can be treated as matrix oper ation, shown as a linear equation, Ex = O. E represents the comp onents of each input, x represents the 93 combinatorial function of the chip and O is the output components. For the current device with three-input combinatorial mixer (with one unmixed control), the matrix operation is z z zy y yx x x C B AC B AC B A k k k k kj j j j ji i i i i k k kj j ji i i h g f e dh g f e dh g f e d c b ac b ac b a = z z z z zy y y y yx x x x x z z zy y yx x x h g f e dh g f e dh g f e d c b ac b ac b a . (4.7) For the input matrix E, the components, A, B, and C represent the individual inputs and the component in each column represents the concentration of the individual input compounds in input A, input B, and input C. For example, if we inject solution I 1 into input A, I 2 into input B and I 3 into input C, the input matrix E would be E = 321 0 00 00 0 III . (4.8) The combinatorial mixer operator, x, governs how the inputs will be combined into the outputs. With the original combinatorial mixer design, the matrix operation is represented as 321 0 00 00 0 III 0 121 21 310 0210310 0 021 31 0 0 012100211 = 0 1 21 21 310 0210310 0 0 21 31 0 0 012100211 3 3 3 32 21 1 2 21 1 I I I II II I I II I . (4.9) Each column in the output matrix, O, repr esents the compounds a nd concentrations in each chamber. Characterizing the combinatoria l mixer allows us to know the values for the combinatorial mixer operation of the device and the equation becomes 94 321 0 00 00 0 III 0 1 64 . 0 49 . 0 25 . 00 0 32 . 0 0 26 . 00 0 0 54 . 0 5 . 0 0 0 01 5 . 0 00 55 . 0 1 = 0 1 64 . 0 49 . 0 25 . 00 0 32 . 0 0 26 . 00 0 0 54 . 0 5 . 0 0 0 01 5 . 0 00 55 . 0 1 3 3 3 32 21 1 2 21 1 I I I II II I I II I . (4.10) Knowing the values in the combinator ial mixer operator allows other output combinations to be designed using the same ch ip. As the values in the matrix x have been determined, one can choose the desired output and solved for E in the matrix operation, Ex = O. For example, if the output 0 1 832 . 0 652 . 0 556 . 00 0 16 . 0 324 . 0 43 . 00 0 096 . 0 216 . 0 278 . 0 6 . 0 465 . 0 3 0 37 . 0 4 . 0 3 3 3 32 2 21 1 1 3 3 32 2 21 1 1 I I I II I II I I I I II I II I I is desired, one can solve for the necessary input matrix to gene rate such output. The input would be 3 3 32 21 1 6 . 0 3 . 00 5 . 0 6 . 00 3 . 0 4 . 0 I I II II I , and the whole matrix operation is 3 3 32 21 1 6 . 0 3 . 00 5 . 0 6 . 00 3 . 0 4 . 0 I I II II I 0 1 64 . 0 49 . 0 25 . 00 0 32 . 0 0 26 . 00 0 0 54 . 0 5 . 0 0 0 01 5 . 0 00 55 . 0 1 = 0 1 832 . 0 652 . 0 556 . 00 0 16 . 0 324 . 0 43 . 00 0 096 . 0 216 . 0 278 . 0 6 . 0 465 . 0 3 0 37 . 0 4 . 0 3 3 3 32 2 21 1 1 3 3 32 2 21 1 1 I I I II I II I I I I II I II I I . (4.11) It is noted that not all possible output can be generated because certain output combination would require inputs to have negative concentration. By characterizing the combinatorial mixer and transforming the combinatorial mixing into a matrix operation, we can expand the possible combinations of experiments that can be done using the current chip and also lay the foundation fo r easily designing and characterizing future devices with more inputs and outputs. 95 4.3.2 Device Packaging with Integrated Membrane and Microfluidic Simulation For the cell assay experi ments, porous into the devi ce packaging and the culture chamber area was turned into a two-level configuration. Figure 4-12 shows a cell culture experiment on this chip. The B35 rat neuroblastom a cells were loaded and captured by the membrane and grown at a continuous perfusion of culture media that was injected through the outlet at 80 nL min1, while keeping the cell loading inlet sealed with a stainless steel pin. The cells eventua lly reached confluency after 70 hours. Figure 4-12. Cell culture inside the culture chamber with integrated membrane. (Left) Cells loaded into the chamber. (Right) Cell population reached confluency after 70 hours. The integrated membrane served several purposes and greatly facilitated the on- chip cell assay experiment. Cell seeding in many other microfluidic cell culture devices was done by flowing cell suspension through channe ls that were coated with attachment factors such as collagen or fibronectin. Ma ny cells can be lost in this process and the pretreating of the channel surface with attachment factor can take 4 hours to 24 hours. In our previous chip, the channel walls were pretreated w ith 0.05% polyethyleneimine (PEI) solution for 24 hours for cell to adhere during cell loading and proper cell spreading after incubation. With the porous membrane, cells were injected into the cell loading port of 96 the PDMS chip and cells were efficiently tr apped on the porous membrane at the culture chamber area. The membrane also provided a proper surface for cell growth because the membrane was cell culture treated by the manufactures with oxygen or nitrogen plasma. The need to pretreat the channel surfaces wa s eliminated. The membrane is inexpensive and disposable so a new sterile membrane can be used for each experiment. In addition, studies have shown that grow ing cells on porous membrane allows cells to access media from both apical and basolate ral sides and results in an in vivo -like environment and improved cell morphology [88]. Our packagi ng method to allow membrane to be incorporated into microfluidic devices is straightforward and the method allows PDMS microfluidic chip to be integrated. In tegrating various com ponents can extend the versatility of the devices. Different type s of membrane can be used depending on the applications, and other PDMS microfluidic ch ips such as concentration diluter can be integrated. This method of incorporating me mbrane into microfluidic devices can be extended to other devices as th e use of membrane in microfluidics has increased in recent years for process such as concentratio n, filtration or other cell studies. In addition, the two-level configuration allows the cells to be kept in the cell culture level and be separated fr om the fluid delivery level du ring cell assay experiments. This setup minimizes the exposure of cells to direct fluid flow and the resultant shear stresses, which can cause adverse effect to ce lls. Finite element analysis of the fluid velocity modeling was done using Comsol Multiphysics, and Figure 4-13 shows the sim ulated fluid velocity profile. 97 Figure 4-13. Fluid velocity profile at the two-level cu lture chamber for (a) 0.4 \u00b5m porous membrane and (b) 1 \u00b5m porous membrane. For both membrane pore sizes, the majority of the fluid flow occurs inside the fluid delivery level and the fluid flow inside the culture level is minimal. Also, the fluid velocity inside culture level is very unifo rm, resulting in a uniform growth environment for the cells. For microfluidic perfusion sy stem, the 2-D Poiseuille flow results in an estimated shear stress at the wall, w hQ 26 , (4.12) where is the shear stress, \u00b5 is the viscosity, Q is the flow rate, h is the channel height and w is the channel width. As the flow rate inside the culture chamber level is reduced, the shear stress at the wa ll is reduced as well. Finite element analysis using the combined Navier-Stokes and diffusion/convection model was done to simulate the solute transport during cell assay and results show that the transport of treat ment molecules from the fluid delivery level (b) (a) 98 into the cell culture level is dominated by diff usion. The membrane is thin (10 \u00b5m) with high porosity (4 \u00d7 106 pores cm2 and 1.6 \u00d7 106 pores cm2 for the 0.4 \u00b5m and 1 \u00b5m pore size membranes, respectively) and this allows the treatment compounds to quickly reach the cell culture area. Figure 4-14 shows that for the membrane with 0.4 m pore diameter, mol ecules (D = 106 cm2 s1) can reach the cell culture surface in a short time, 270 seconds, and fill the entire chamber within 660 seconds. The membrane with 1 \u00b5m pore diameter allows even faster transport of molecu les, filling the entire chamber in less than 450 seconds. It is noted that cells are residi ng on top of the membrane and as soon as the molecules cross the 10 \u00b5m membrane, the mole cules can start affecti ng the cells and it is not required for the molecules to fill the enti re chamber for them to take effect. The simulation results show that our device setup is appropriate for exposing cells to different compounds and those compounds can be deliver ed to the cells efficiently without disturbance from convection. Figure 4-14. Simulation of the solute transp ort at the two-level culture chamber area. Concentration profile was shown for 0.4 \u00b5m pore membrane (a-d) and 1 \u00b5m pore membrane (e-h). D = 106 cm2 s1. 99 In addition, this configuration mimics the in vivo interstitial environment as fast convective flow dominates the fluid delivery le vel that resembles blood flow in tissue and diffusion dominates the cell culture level with low shear stress. The Peclet number extracted from the simulation model at the heig ht of cell (10 \u00b5m) is around 0.1, which is similar to the value inside the tissue. Th e effect of such culturing environment on the cells will be investigated in future works. Such ability to create a physiologically relevant condition is one unique advantage for microfluidic devices and is unavailable for conventional culturing containers such as flasks or well plates . Further additions can be made such as culturing cells in gel or co-culturing with other cell types to further simulate the various characteristics of the in vivo cellular microenvironment. As cell- based assays use cells as model for studies such as drug response, it is important that cells be kept in an environment as close to the in vivo environment as possible so the cells would behave similarly as they would in human body and test results would be more validated. The integrated membrane serves several beneficial purposes as it simplifies the cell loading process and also allows cells to be maintained in an in vivo -like environment during the cell assay experiment. 4.3.3 Oxygen Supply for the Cell Culture Chamber The chamber was designed so the cells would have sufficient oxygen during the experiment. PDMS has been known to be a pe rmeable material to gases and would allow oxygen to freely pass through. The oxygen tr ansport through the cell culture chamber can be modeled using the configuration shown in Figure 4-15. 100 Figure 4-15. Side view of the culture chamber for oxygen transport modeling. The cells have an oxygen utilization rate per cell, RO [mol min1 cell1], and a total consumption rate, OT, AN ROO T , ( 4.13) where N is the total number of cells per chamber, and A is the surface area of the chamber. Flux of oxygen would be constantly transferre d from the surface of the chamber into the chamber at rate, J , and at steady state, flux of oxygen transferred from surface to the chamber equals the consumption rate by the cells. AN RJO . (4.14) J can be expressed by Flick's first ) ( ) (c ow phDp phDJ w . (4.15) The first part denotes the flux of oxygen th rough the wall (w), PDMS, with thickness h w and the second part denotes the flux of oxygen through the media (m) to the cell surface, with thickness h m. Dw is the diffusion coefficien t of oxygen in the wall, w is the solubility of oxygen into the wall, po is the partial pressure of oxygen at the outer surface, pw is the partial pressure of oxygen at the inner surface, Dm is the diffusion coefficient of 101 oxygen in the media, m is the solubility of oxygen into the media, and pc is the partial pressure of oxygen at the cell surface. The expression can be rewritten and eliminate the term pw, to become )) / ( ) / (() ( m m m w w wc o D h D hp pJ . (4.16) This can be equated to the gas consumpti on equation and an expr ession is derived: w Dh p AN . (4.17) The maximum cell density, N/A (max), that can be supported by the system can be found by plugging in the lowest allowable value of pc, the partial pressure of oxygen at cell surface. That value is denoted as pc*, the limiting oxygen concentration below which proliferation is not supported, and the value of pc* for hepatocyte, one of most oxygen-demanding cells, is 40 mmHg [89]. ) (* (max) w ww m mm Oc o Dh DhRp p AN , (4.18) The oxygen utilization rate, R O, for hepatocyte cell is around 12 fmol min1 cell1 [90]. As PDMS is used as the wall material, the values for Dw and w are 3.4 \u00d7 109 m2 s1 and 0.34 g m3 mmHg1, respectively. The oxygen in side the media has similar property to that of inside the water as th e media is a dilute aqueous solution and the values for Dm and m are 2.1 \u00d7109 m2 s1 and 4.32 \u00d7 102 g m3 mmHg1, respectively [89]. The partial pressure of oxygen inside the incubator, po, is around 148 mmHg. As a result, the maximum number of cell density, N/A (max) that this chamber can support is 3.7 102 \u00d7 103 cells mm2. As our chamber has a culture area of 2.8 \u00d7 101 mm2, this would translate to be about 103 cells per chamber. Typical ce ll culture experiments have a density of 104107 cells mL1. The cell culture chamber ha s a volume of 100 nL, and this would translate to 1 to 1,000 cells per chamber. Thus, ou r cell culture chamber, which can sustain cell density of 103 cells per chamber with enough oxygen, is sufficient for the typical cell density range. It is noted that the value used for oxygen utilization rate and limiting oxygen concentration at cell surface, pc*, is that for hepatocyte, which is more oxygen demanding than other cell types. The cells used in our experiments are immortalized mammalian cells and they can use oxygen at rate 10 to 20 times slower. For example, CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cel l, has a oxygen utiliza tion rate of only 0.5 fmol min1 cell1 [90]. Therefore, the chamber shoul d be able to support more than 103 cells per chamber for most of the cell types unless oxygen demanding cells such as hepatocytes are used. 4.3.4 Assay for Compounds' Ability to Redu ce Cytotoxicity of Hydrogen Peroxide The device was used to assay for the ab ility of three compounds on reducing the cytotoxicity of hydrogen peroxide. Hydr ogen peroxide is ge nerated during brain ischemia and reperfusion injury and various neuropathological condi tions, and leads to significant DNA damage and cell death [87]. B-35 rat neuroblastoma cells were used as a model system. After cell seeding and stat ic incubation for cell adherence, solutions containing the individual compounds in DMEM media with hydrogen peroxide were delivered into the combinatorial mixer to treat the cells. After incubation with the treatment molecules, the solutions were repl aced with normal DMEM media. Cells were incubated and stained with calcein AM (liv e) and propidium iodide (dead) stains. Figure 103 4-16(a) shows the result of the cytotoxicity experiment, and Figure 4-16(b) shows the arrays of cells after the cells were stained by live/dead stains. Figure 4-16. Result of the assay to test the ability of three compounds, 1,5- dihydroxyisoquinoline (ISO), deferoxamine (D FO), and 3-aminobenzoic acid (ABA), to reduce cytotoxicity of hydrogen peroxide. (a) Plot of cytotoxicity of the cells, B35 rat neuroblastoma cells, at each chamber with different compound exposure. Each compound was mixed in media containing 1.5 mM hydr ogen peroxide. Results are the means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Number of experi ments = 4. (b) Cells in each chamber after live (green)/dead (red) staining. 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinoline and deferoxamine showed cytoprotective effect against hydrogen peroxide. 1,5-dihydroxyisoquino line reduces cell death by inhibiting Poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase, whose over-pro duction in response to hydrogen peroxide can cause cell death [91]. Deferoxamine reduces cell death by decreasing the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to hydroxyl radicals that damage DNA [92]. 3-aminobenzoic acid (b) (a) 104 is structurally similar to 3-aminobenzam ide, which is an agent that can reduce cytotoxicity of hydrogen peroxide. Howeve r, it has been shown that 3-aminobenzoic acid has no effect on cytotoxicity of hydroge n peroxide. ISO and DFO were able to reduce the cytotoxicity when treating the cells as individual molecules or in combination. There did not appear to be synergistic interaction among the two compounds as the combination did not increase the ability to reduce cytotoxicity of hydrogen peroxide. When either ISO or DFO were combined with ABA, the ability to reduce cytotoxicity was not reduced although the concentration of each was lowered. The efficacy of ISO and DFO can start to saturate after reaching certain concentration and this is shown in some studies [92]. Separate control expe riments were performed with the same cell seeding and cell treatment condition, but e xposing cells to only DMEM media without hydrogen peroxide and the three chemicals. The cytotoxicity was found to be 4%. 4.3.5 Assay for Exposing Breast Cancer Cells to Chemotherapeutic Agents MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were exposed to combinations of three chemotherapeutic agents , vinorelbine (VIN), paclitaxel (PAC), and -linolenic acid (GLA), using this device. In this experiment, the device was packaged with a 1 \u00b5m porous membrane and suspension of cells were loaded and captured by the membrane. After incubation for cell attachment, cells were exposed to the various compounds. Following incubation with the treatment agents, the cells were washed and culture chambers were replenished with normal culture media. Cells were incubated for another 24 hours and calcein AM and propidium iodide we re loaded to assess the viability of the cells. Figure 4-17(a) shows the result of the cytotoxicity experim ent, and Figure 4-17(b) shows the a rrays of cells after the cells were stained by live/dead stains. Paclitaxel, a 105 taxane, was first extracted from the bark of western yew trees Taxus brevifolia. It produces its antitumor activity by binding to microtubules of the cells, causing polymerization and stabilization. The inabil ity for depolymerizati on of microtubules disables the cells on microtubule functions by inducing depolymerization and loss of mitotic spindle [ 94]. Both drugs have been used in cancer chemotherapy with demonstrated clini cal activity against breast cancer. -linolenic acid has been shown to suppress tumor growth an d metastasis and is a potential anticancer drug. More importantly, re searches have shown that -linolenic acid can potentiate the cytotoxicity of several antic ne, paclitaxel and Studies have also shown that pacl itaxel and vinorelbine to have synergy when used in combination [97]. As seen in Figure 4-17(a), all th ree compounds showed antitum or activity when treating the cells as a single agent. When cell were exposed to the combination of -linolenic acid and vinorelbine or paclitaxel, the cytotoxicity increased even with reduced concentration of the compounds. In the control chamber, the cells were not exposed to any of the th ree agents and the cyto toxicity was around 4%. 106 Figure 4-17. Result of the assay for expos ing breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231, to chemotherapeutic , vinorelbine (VIN), paclitaxel (PAC), and -linolenic acid (GLA). (a) Plot of cytotoxici ty of the cells. Results are the means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Number of experiments = 6. (b) Cells in each chamber after live (green)/dead (red) staining. This device successfully demonstrated that with just three inputs, eight distinct cell-based assay experiments were performed with different combinatorial compounds using a single chip. The cell seeding was simp le and efficient as the one-to-eight splitter loaded cells to all chambers at once and th e porous membrane trapped the cells at the chambers. Using the integrated combinatorial mixer saved numerous pipetting steps that have to be done to create all the possible combinations. While only three compounds were used on this chip, the chip can be s caled up using the same fabrication steps to include four, five or even more inputs by placing the overpass structure to cross over (a) (b) 107 channels. This will result in a high-density chip that is able to perform hundreds of assays at once and greatly simplify the complexity of the experiments. In addition, chip- based assays will provide a cheaper alternat ive to using robotics and well plates and provide finer and more sophisticated fluid cont rol. This microfluidic device also creates culture environment that mimics interstitial environment by creating two flow levels and maintaining the cells at the diffusion dominated level with minimized fluid velocity. With this device, the experiment did not require many complicated external apparatus and setups, and only syringe pumps were used for fluid delivery and fluorescence microscope for imaging the cells. This will allow the whole systems to be simply automated with dispensing and imaging syst ems in the future. Besides performing viability assay, metabolites or gene expressi on can also be studied on-chip. Moreover, other chip components such as flow cytomete r or HPLC, which have been demonstrated in our group, can be integrat ed to create a complete ce ll-based assay platform for quantitative cell biology experiments. 4.4 Conclusion In this chapter, the development of an in tegrated 3-D microfluidic device on glass for cell-based screening of combinatoria l compounds on-chip was discussed. The Parylene-based chip was fabricated usi ng multilayer surface micromachining technology and integrated with a PDMS chip and porous PET (polyethylene terephthalate) membrane. The combinatorial mixer correctly delivered the distinct combinations of input compounds into the chambers and the concentration of each input compound at the chamber was characterized. The incorpor ated membrane created a cell culture space 108 with minimized flow velocity and simplifie d the cell loading and assaying procedure. The fabricated chip had three inputs for comb inatorial mixer with one control, and output eight combinatorial streams to the culture arrays. We ha ve demonstrated quantitative cell-based assay for screening three different compounds' ability to reduce cytotoxicity of hydrogen peroxide and assaying combinatorial exposures of three chemotherapeutic agents on breast cancer cells. Based on the capabilities demonstrated in this chapter, devices with high-density cell array and integrated high-inpu t combinatorial mixer can be constructed. Such chip will enable ine xpensive high-throughput cell-based assay and significantly benefit research in many different fields including drug screening and systems biology. 109 Chapter 5: Monolithic Multilevel Microfluidic Networks with Integrated Membrane 5.1 Introduction In the previous chapter, a microfluidic device that incorporated a membrane structure was presented. The membrane f acilitated the cell culture and assay process while creating a cell culture space that can mimic in vivo conditions. The straightforward method to incorporate the membrane only re quired clamping a piec e of commercially available membrane in between a PDMS pi ece and the Parylene-based chip. Such incorporation method was simple but required a membrane to be placed manually every time before experiment. It is advantageous to devise a process that integrates the membrane structure during the 3-D microfluidic fabrication. As the use of membrane with microfluidic device is gaining popular ity, such fabrication technique can benefit research in that area and improve the ease of use of microfluidic devices. 3-D microfluidic devices have already broadened the range of possible applications from 2-D microfluidic devices and adding a membrane f eature can further add to the versatility of the microfluidic devices. The use of membrane with microfluidic will be introduced and several fabrication strategies will be presented. The use of membrane as a mean of transp ort control in microfluidic has grown in the past 15 years [98]. One popular use of memb rane is in sample preparation. Song et al. used a laser-patterned na noporous membrane at the junction of a cross channel to concentrate the proteins with a concentration factor of 2 to 4 [99]. Samples were moved by electrophoretic injection and buffer can pass through membrane while proteins were 110 maintained. Timmer et al. fabricated a devi ce to increase electrolyte concentration by evaporation [100]. A microchannel was c overed with Teflon membrane and nitrogen was flowed over the channel. Samples were concentrated as the water vapor can pass through the membrane. Furthermore, membrane has been used for sample filtration on- chip such as demonstrated by Moorthy et al. to filter blood cells [101]. Researchers have integrated membrane on chemical reactor de vices on-chip. Cui et al. fabricated a membrane microreactor for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene [102]. In addition, membranes can function as a surface for gas molecule absorption in gas sensors. PDMS has a high permeability for gases and has been used in oxygen sensors as demonstrated by Vollmer et al. [103]. Also, PDMS has been used as the material for constructing microfluidic cell culture device because oxygen can easily transport across the PDMS. Besides cell culturing, devi ces have also be made to study oxygen consumption by organisms such as E. coli [104]. Various fabrication technologies have b een developed to incorporate membrane into microfluidic devices to fulfill different applications. One of the most straightforward methods is by direct incorpor ation such as our clamping method described in the previous chapter. Besides clamping, membranes can also be incorporated by lamination [105]. The membrane can be prepared in-house or bought from commercial sources, and can be modified by functionalization such as coati ng with bovine serum al bumin [106]. One major advantage of using the direct incorporation method is the range of different membranes that can be obtained. Membrane with different materials and morphologies can be chosen to suit the need of the part icular experiment. The downsides of such method are that 1) care must be taken to ensu re that leaking would not occur and 2) such 111 fabrication technique will be challenging to scale up for large-scale production. Membranes can be integrated as part of the device fabrication proces s. For example, free-standing porous silicon as membrane on top of microchannel can be fabricated by electrochemically forming the porous silic on and undercutting the si licon substrate to release the channel and membrane [107]. Ot her materials, such as alumina, can be formed as free-standing membrane [108]. S ilicon wafer was coated with SiN from both sides and the backside SiN was etched away, followed by Si etching. Al was sputtered and turned into porous structure by anodizati on. While using cleanroom process is more expensive and complex than direct incorporation, such technology has other advantages. It has precise control over the features to the nanometer range, and more chemical and thermal resistant materials are often used fo r microfabrication. Furthermore, sealing of the device is more reliable using this met hod. Another way of integrating membrane is by fabricating the membrane in situ after the microfluidic chip is fabricated. Artificial lipid bilayers, which is useful for studying transport of materials acr oss cell walls can be prepared at an aperture of a chip by contacting lipid solutio n with buffers [109]. An UV laser beam has been used to induce phase separation of acrylate monomers to form membrane in between two pillars [110]. While this method offe rs the possibility to build in membrane on existing chip, the process is very complex and has a very limited range of materials to choose from. Finally, the material used to bui ld channel walls can be used as membrane as well. For example, PDMS channels are permeable to gases. Hydrogel such as calcium alginate has also been used to construct microfluidic channel walls and are permeable to solutes such as dextran [111] . This method of integration is simple and no extra fabrication steps are required. 112 The fabrication process to construct monolithic 3-D microfluidic networks presented in previous chapters can be modifi ed to integrate a membrane structure inside the devices. Here, we expand this technology to create an integrated membrane at the interface of the microfluidic channels. Surface micromachining enables chips to be conveniently batch fabricated and the integr ated method avoids sealing problems when incorporating membrane into devices. In addition, integration with 3-D microfluidic networks expands the complexity of applica tions for membrane devices. The channels are made up of biocompatible Parylene C and are suitable for biological experiments. The device has two-layer microfluidic channels with a porous membrane in between. In this chapter, the fabrication techniques ar e discussed and the applications of such fabrication process are demons trated. The membrane-based microfluidic device can be used for constructing in vivo -like culture chamber and can be used for cell co-culture. 5.2 Experimental 5.2.1 Design Our device is composed of two-level microfluidic networks and a membrane structure that is positioned in betw een the two microfluidic channels ( Figure 5-1). Each m icrofluidic level has its own inlet and outlet ports for sample introduction. Parylene C is chosen as the structural material because of its compatibility with surface micromachining processes, which enables 3-D microfluidic networks to be fabricated monolithically. Other advantageous properties of Parylene C include its biocompatibility, optical transparency and chemical inertness. The device is built on a glass substrate for ease of observation by microscopy. 113 Figure 5-1. Design layout of the monolithic multilevel microfluid ic device with integrated membrane. (a) Top view. (b) Bi-l evel chamber with integrated membrane in between the two fluidic levels. (c) Cross section view of the device. 5.2.2 Fabrication The fabrication process is shown in Figure 5-2. Soda Lime glass wafer was cleaned with Piranha s olution (H 2SO 4: H 2O2, H 2O, 5:1:1) at minutes and treated with A-174 silane adhe sion promoter for 15 minutes. Then, the entire wafer was coated with Parylene C (2 \u00b5m). A first sacrificial photoresist (15 \u00b5m) was spin-coated and patterned with photolithography. A second layer of Parylene (10 \u00b5m) was deposited to cover the sacrificial photores ist. Parylene was patterne d using oxygen plasma at the chamber area to create pores in the membrane. By modifying the mask of this pattering step, membranes with different pore sizes can be created, and membranes with 10, 20, and 40 \u00b5m pores were made. A second sacrif icial photoresist (30 \u00b5m) was defined for the second-level channels. A th ird layer Parylene was depos ited and patterned, followed by chip planarization with SU8 (100 \u00b5m). The chips were soaked in isopropyl alcohol 114 (IPA) to dissolve the sacrificial photoresist, and the remaining hollow Parylene structures became the fluidic networks. Figure 5-2. Fabrication process flow for the monolithic multilevel microfluidic device with integrated membrane. Similar packaging method as described in the previous chapter was used. A piece of PDMS with punched holes was aligned on to the chip. The chip and PDMS were clamped together by two pieces of transparent acrylic. Tubes were plugged into the holes of the PDMS and on-chip experiments can be observed with a microscope ( Figure 5-3). 115 Figure 5-3. Device packaging and testing setup for the monolithic multilevel microfluidic device with integrated membrane. 5.3 Results and Discussion Figure 5-4 shows the fabricated chip after the s acrificial photoresist was dissolved. Chips with different sizes of pore diameter ( 10, 20, and 40 \u00b5m) were created. Pore sizes can be conveniently adjusted by changi ng the design of the photolithography mask and smaller size of pores down to 4 \u00b5m can be created [112]. Asides from oxygen plasma, laser has also been used to etch Parylene to create pores [113]. To create submicron pores, techniques such as e-beam photolithography can be used. Using our fabrication technique, membranes were conveniently cr eated in 3-D microfluidic network during fabrication. As a result, sealing of the membrane to prevent leaking would not be a concern as in direct incorporation methods. At the bi-level chamber area, the roof of the channel was etched open, but that part can remain if that is desirable for certain applications. Also, more levels of channe ls can be made by repeating the process of patterning sacrificial photoresist, covering with Parylene, etching Parylene to photoresist, covering w ith Parylene, etching Parylene and so on. Device packaging followed the straightforwar d method that was presented in earlier 116 chapters. Food coloring was injected into the first-leve l channel and was shown to readily enter the second-level channel ( Figure 5-4 (c)). Figure 5 -4. Fabricated monolithic multilevel microfluidic device with integrated membrane. (a) Chip after channel release. (b) Integrated membrane with 10 \u00b5m pores. (c) Green solution injected into the first-level channel can enter the second-level channel through the membrane. As discussed in the previous chapter, integrating a membrane in between multilevel microfluidic networks can be used to create a culture chamber that mimics the in vivo tissue environment, where transport of molecules to the cells is dominated by diffusion ( Figure 5-5). The cells can be loaded into the c ell culture level, while fluid is delivered into the other level. As the cell culture chamber is separated from the fluid delivery channel, shear stress, which can be detrimental to many types of cells, is minimized. A fluid velocity profile simu lation was done using COMSOL Multiphysics incompressible Navier-Stokes model and the re sult shows that the flow velocity inside the culture chamber is minimal ( Figure 5-5). In addition, with this configuration, culture m edia components delivered into the chambe r during perfusion can achieve a uniform distribution as the fluid velocity inside th e chamber is uniform. Also, in conventional culture containers such as culture flasks, se creted molecules by cells are swept away in c 200 \u00b5m 117 random direction by convection as the large air/liquid surface results in significant convection. Such secreted molecules can pl ay an important signaling role in governing cellular behaviors such as cancer cell development in vivo [114]. While those molecules are randomly distributed in trad ition culture vessels, microf luidic device can recreate the condition where those molecules remain clos e by the cells. Our device presents the opportunities for studies to be done to exam ine how soluble factors from one cell can influence the surrou nding cells. The diffusion dominat ed cell culture space allows secreted factors be remained inside th e chamber without getting swept away by convection. Figure 5-5. Bi-level cell culture chamber. (a) Device operation. (b) Cells inside the second-level chamber. (c) Fluid velocity simulation. Another application for the device is for us e in on-chip cell co-culture. Co-culture has been a common method to maintain cell phenotype in vitro , such as co-culture of embryonic stem with fibroblasts [115], in studying cell-cell ing a microfluidic device can simp lify the process to create the co- culture configuration, reduce the cells needed for the experiment and recreate a more in vivo-like condition. In our device, different cells can be lo aded into different levels of chamber, and the membrane allows co mmunication between the two levels ( Figure 5-6). a b c 50 \u00b5m 118 40 \u00b5m 100 \u00b5m For the proof-of-concept experiment, rat neur oblastoma cells, B35, were stained with fluorescent Ca). The cells were lo aded into the different level of channels. More levels of channels can be constructed to simulate complex in vivo microstructures such as the three-layer struct ure (adventitia, media, and inti ma) of a blood vessel [117]. Figure 5-6. Device for on-chip cell co-cultu re. (a) Schematic of device operation for co- culture. (b) Different cells were loaded into the different levels of channels. (c) Cells fluorescing orange are undern eath the membrane. (d) Cells fluorescing green are on top of the membrane. 5.4 Conclusion In this chapter, we demonstrated a new method of fabricating monolithic 3-D microfluidic devices with an integrated Parylene membrane. Our fabrication method enables devices to be conveniently fabricated at the wafer scale, and our device can be integrated with other microfluidic components to build complete lab-on-a-chip systems. a b cd 40 \u00b5m 119 Using this method, membranes no longer need to be placed into the device assembly manually before each experiment, and pore si zes can be varied by changing the mask design. Two possible applications for this de vice were proposed and preliminary results were shown. This device can have other applications beyond the field of cell biology, such as performing experiments in analyti cal chemistry for sample filtration or concentration. 120 Chapter 6: Applications of Microfluidics in Marine Microbiology 6.1 Introduction The uses of microfluidic devices are not limited to cell culture and cell-based assay for mammalian cells as discussed in prev ious chapters. Any other types of cells can take advantage of the benefits that microfluidic devices offer: high-throughput screening, portability, inexpensive platform , and reduced sample volume and reagents. Under the collaboration with Dr. David Ca ron's group at University of Southern California's Department of Biological Sciences, one area that our group has applied microfluidic devices to is in the field of marine biology, specifi cally in studying algal bloom and toxin production by algae. Alga l bloom and toxins produced by different algae have always caused problems to the environment and marine ecology. Due to certain favorable changes in environmental c onditions, some algae can increase to a large density in a short period of time. For example, many studies have shown a strong correlation between phosphorus loading a nd phytoplankton production in freshwater [118]. Some produced toxin and can directly cause sickness or death of organisms such as shellfishes that feed on the algae. Th e phosphorus can originate from excess nutrients in fertilizers that enter the river or sea duri ng water runoff. More importantly, when large quantity of those contaminated shellfishes was consumed by organisms in higher order of the food chain, fatalities often resulted. For example, Alexandrium tamarense , can produce saxitoxin poisoning [119]. N on-toxic algal bloom can lead to harmful effects by disrupting food chains. 121 Pseudo-nitzschia is one type of algae that produc es a neural toxin called domoic acid, which when transferred through the food chain causes sickne ss and mortality in marine mammals, seabirds and even humans [ 120]. Perl et al. reported an outbreak of domoic acid intoxication in Canada in late 1987 that led to illness of 107 adults and death of three elderly people [121]. Mussels we re contaminated and resulted in amnesic shellfish poisoning with symptoms of gastrointestinal and neurological disorders. Also, domoic acid has been linked to the death of numerous sea lions along the California coastline in 1998 [122]. Domoic acid is a neural toxin that affects animals wi th complex central nervous systems. Domoic acid is structurally analogous to neural transm itter glutamic acid, which is present in nearly 40% of all neuronal synaptic sites, and upon binding to receptors, domoic acid prolongs receptor activ ation and excessive cation influx. This uncontrolled influx can cause nerve cells to degenerate. During Pseudo-nitzschia bloom, domoic acid is not always produced. In an other word, growth of algae does not equal domoic acid production. Studies done by other groups have suggested that many factors might induce or suppress algae to produce toxin. Maldonado el al. reported that deficiency in iron and copper can induc e domoic acid production [123]. Silicate depletion has been shown to cause increase in domoic acid production [124]. It has been suggested that high phosphate level can lead to increased domoic acid production [125]. Bacteria strains have also been shown to increase domoic acid production by as much as 95-fold [126]. Yet, exact causes are unclear and there are nu merous possible factors that can cause toxin production. To completely elucidate the causes of toxin production, 122 many potential compounds will have to be screen ed. This leads to an enormous number of experiments to be performed and large quantity of reagents and cells to be used. To facilitate progress in marine biology research and speed up the process of screening for possible factors inducing toxin pr oduction, we would like to make a chip to culture Pseudo-nitzschia under different growing conditions. The toxin will be detected using ELISA method or an ultra sensitive optic al sensor being developed at Dr. Chih- Ming Ho's lab at University of California at Los Angeles. The curre nt state-of-the-art detection technology indi cates that per cell t oxin load may range over 2 or 3 orders of magnitude but its sensitivity is limited sin ce a sample size of at least 100 cells/mL is required. The new optical sensor will be able to push the sensitivity to 10 cells/mL or to even single molecule of domoic acid. Th e algal cells will be trapped and cultured on- chip and combinatorial mixer discussed in chapter 3 and 4 will be used to expose algal cells to different conditions. Cellular contents will be extracted for detection of toxin from lysates. In this chapter, the development of the applications of microfluidic cell-based assaying device for studying toxi n production by algae is discussed. As most algal cells are not adherent like the mammalian cells used in previous experiments, on-chip traps were needed to contain floati ng cells like algal cells inside the micro chambers. Various trapping designs will be presented and the develo ped trapping protocol will be discussed. The method to maintain algae in a healthy state and to culture al gae on-chip has been developed. As the presence of the intracellular toxin, domo ic acid, cannot be directly monitored on-chip, a method to lyse the cells on-chip is presented. 123 6.2 Trapping Algal Cells On-Chip 6.2.1 Trapping Cells with Parylene Posts Inside Micro Culture Chamber The first-generation cell culture chip with combinatorial mixer on silicon substrate described in chapter 3 was equipped with filter structure designed to contain floating cells. The trap is consisted of two ro ws of rectangular post structures with gap in between and the configuration is shown in Figure 6-1. Each post has a length of 20 \u00b5m and width of 10 \u00b5m . The gap in between each post is 12 \u00b5m and is designed to trap cells larger than that dimension. To fabricat e the chamber with trap s, photoresist (AZ 4620) was first spin-coated on silicon wafer at thickness of 32 \u00b5m and soft-baked at 100oC for 30 minutes. Then, the post areas were exposed and developed, leaving an array of holes on the photoresist. Those holes were then filled with Pary lene C during the subsequent Parylene deposition (10 \u00b5m). After the sa crificial photoresist was dissolved with isopropyl alcohol, the Parylene posts remained. Figure 6-1. Configuration of th e trap inside the culture chamber of the first-generation cell culture chip with combinatorial mixer. Figure 6-2 shows the SEM image of the cro ss se ction of the culture chamber with filter. We were able to integrate filter into the chip without adding extra fabrication steps as the sacrificial photoresist patterning and Parylene deposition was already part of the fabrication process to construct the culture chambers. 124 Figure 6-2. SEM image of the Pa rylene post filter structure. We tested the filter by first using the algae Prorocentrum gracile as a model. Prorocentrum gracile was chosen because it constant ly swims around the space it resides in and such high mobility is a good indication of healthy cells. Solution containing the cells was injected into the cell loading inle t and image of the chamber was taken with a stereoscope equipped with a CCD camera. Re sults show that the chamber was able to contain algal cells as shown in Figure 6-3. However, the Prorocentrum gracile cells appeared to be stationary and not constantly moving around as in typical healthy cells. Some possible reasons might be that the cells dislike the loading conditions such as the material of the tubes or culture chamber or the loading pressure. Another reason might be that the culture chamber height of 32 \u00b5m was too low and some cells were in contact with the walls which impede the cells from moving around. A cell culture chamber with higher ceiling might improve this situation. Figure 6-3. Prorocentrum gracile inside the Parylene culture chamber. Arrow indicates one of the cells. 125 6.2.2 Trapping Cells with PDMS Structures To investigate whether chamber height can affect compatib ility for algal cell culture, culture chamber with higher ceiling (100 \u00b5m) was fabricated using PDMS. PDMS was used because it involved very short fabrication steps so different prototypes can be made quickly and variou s designs can be tested in a short period of time. The PDMS pieces were made following the same protoc ol as described in chapter 4. To make the post structures, holes were made dur ing patterning of the SU8 for the mold fabrication. When PDMS was casted onto the mold, it filled the holes and became the post structures after PDMS was cured. The cured PDMS was peeled off from the mold and cut into pieces. The PDMS pieces were cl eaned with acetone, then isopropyl alcohol, followed by water. The PDMS pieces were re versibly bonded to glass slides by treating both glass slides and PDMS pieces with oxygen plasma (50 Watts, 400 mTorr), and pressing the PDMS pieces onto the glass slides. The assembly was baked in oven at 70 oC for three hours. Figure 6-4 shows a fabricated device. T he posts consisted of square PDMS structure with dimension of 120 \u00b5m \u00d7 120 \u00b5m and the gaps between each post are 10-20 \u00b5m. Figure 6-4. PDMS chamber with 100 \u00b5m height ceiling. 126 Prorocentrum gracile cells were loaded into th e chamber. As shown in Figure 6-5, series of pictures were taken at differe nt tim es and the result showed that the cells appeared to be healthy as they moved around constantly. Chamber height of 100 \u00b5m was suitable for culturing this type of algae and cells were not stuck by the channel walls and had room to float around. Figure 6-5. Images of Prorocentrum gracile inside the culture chamber at different times. Following the creation of the trap that can successfully contai n algal cells in a healthy state, the next step wa s to create trap to contain Pseudo-nitzschia . Unlike Prorocentrum gracile and typical mammalian cells, Pseudo-nitzschia has a long, slender, rod shape. The width of the cell is ar ound 2-10 \u00b5m while the length is 50-150 \u00b5m [127, 128]. In addition, this type of cell can form into a chain with one cell attaching to the other and can reach a total lengt h of 1 mm. One possible trap configuration that has been explored utilizes an array of posts to trap the slender cells and the schematic is shown in Figure 6-6. While the gaps in between the trapping posts are wider th an the cell width, because the cells are long, they are not able to make the turn to escape the array of posts. 127 Figure 6-6. Schematic of the tr ap geometry used to contain Pseudo-nitzschia. The trap fabrication was based on the same PDMS micro-molding process as described previously. The chamber height was 100 \u00b5m. Each circular post had a diameter of 30 \u00b5m and a gap between posts of 30 \u00b5m. Four arrays were included with each array shifted by 30 \u00b5m horizont ally and by 30 \u00b5m vertically. Pseudo-nitzschia pungens were loaded into syringe and injected into the chamber at high and low concentration. Figure 6-7 shows Pseudo-nitzschia pungens inside the cham ber at low concentration and Figure 6-8 shows the cells loaded at high concentration. The trapping geom etry was able to tr ap the long and slender Pseudo-nitzschia and the number of cells inside the chamber can be adjusted by cha nging the cell concentration for loading. Figure 6-7. Pseudo-nitzschia pungens loaded inside the chamber at low concentration. Images taken at different magnification. 128 Figure 6-8. Pseudo-nitzschia pungens loaded inside the chamber at high concentration. Images taken at different magnification. 6.2.3 Trapping Algal Cells wi th Membrane-Based Systems With the successful devel opment of a membrane-based cell culture system as described in chapter 4, it became also possible to trap algae using that system. The membrane with pore size of 1 \u00b5m was used and the device was packaged with PDMS microfluidic chip and Parylene-based chip as described in chapter 4. Chattonella marina and Pseudo-nitzschia pungens were loaded into the chamber. As seen in Figure 6-9, both types of cells were successfully trap ped inside the culture chamber. Chattonella marina cells were mobile like Prorocentrum gracile and they appeared to be moving around constantly inside the chamber, indicating th at they were in a healthy state. The membrane-based systems offer a simple and reliable method to maintain algal cells on- chip and the wide selection of membranes can make trapping cell of any sizes possible. After each experiment, the membrane can be disposed and new membrane can be used for the new experiment to prevent any cont amination from previous experiment and possible clogging of the me mbranes by the cells. 129 Figure 6-9. Pseudo-nitzschia pungens (left) and Chattonella marina (right) loaded into membrane-based chamber. 6.3 Culturing of Algae On-Chip Experiment was done to test if algal cells can be su stained on-chip. Membrane- based device was used with the 1 \u00b5m pore size membrane and packaged in the same method as described in chapter 4. The devi ce was then primed with DI water followed by culture media, F/2 + Si. Device operation is shown in Figure 6-10. Chattonella marina and Pseudo-nitzschia pungens were load ed into the culture chamber, and culture media, F/2 + Si, was injected via the cell loading inlet at flow rate of 80 nL min1. The chip was placed inside a refrigerator with temperature set at 15-20oC. The refrigerator was fitted with a fluorescent light bulb (580 lumens, 10 watts, 4100K) and a controller to set a 12 hour light and 12 hour dark cycle. 130 Figure 6-10. Device operation schematic for the culture of algal cells on-chip. Figure 6-11 shows the image of Pseudo-nitzschia pungens inside th e culture chamber at different times. The cells were ab le to proliferate insi de the culture chamber under constant perfusion condi tion as seen in the increase in number of cells. Figure 6-12 shows the Chattonella marina inside the cu lture chamber at different times. The cells proliferated from 0 to 24 hour, but the number remained static afterwards. The cells were still moving around constantly and appear ed to be in a healthy state. Figure 6-11. Pseudo-nitzschia pungens inside the culture chamber at different times. 131 Figure 6-12. Chattonella marina inside the culture chamber at different times. 6.4 Lysis of Algae On-Chip The algal cells loaded on the chip will be cultured and exposed to variation of culture media. Then, their intracellular contents such as toxin w ould be analyzed. To analyze the intracellular content, the cells will have to be lysed and the lysate will be transported out of the chip for analysis. A straightforward way to lyse the cells on-chip using external ultrason icator is presented in this section. The membrane-based device was used with the 1 \u00b5m pore size membrane and the fluidic networks were primed with DI wate r, followed by culture media, F/2 + Si. Pseudo-nitzschia pungens were loaded into the chip and the whole packaged device was put into an ultrasonicator, PC3 by L&R (K earny, NJ), with power of 70 watts and frequency of 55 kHz. The water level inside the ultrasonicator bath is approximately 1 cm, or almost covering the whole thickne ss of the bottom acrylic piece. The ultrasonicator was turned on and image of the culture chamber was taken at 0, 10, 30 and 50 seconds. Figure 6-13 shows the result of the u ltrasonication. The algal cells gradually lost their color as the cell membranes and cell wa lls were disrupted by the ultrasonication and the chlorophyll came out from the cells. One can still see some shell-like structures with 132 very faint color at 30 second, but they a ll eventually disappeared after 50 seconds, indicating complete lysis of the cells. The lysate can then be delivered out of the cells by injecting air through the inlet and coll ecting the liquids at the outlet. Figure 6-13. Results of the ultrasonication for cell lysis at different times. 6.5 Conclusion Applications of microf luidic devices for marine microbiology have been demonstrated. Various schemes for trapping cells have been developed and the method to maintain algal cells inside the micro cu lture chamber in healthy states has been presented. Culture of algal cells has also b een performed. On-chip lysis of the cells has been done using an ultrasonicato r. Integration of this devi ce with toxin detector in the future will enable high-throughput screeni ng of factors that i nduce toxin production by algae. 133 Chapter 7: Conclusion Cell culture and cell-based assay have b een key techniques in different fields including pharmaceutical industry, cell biology and tissue engineering. Cell culture was a method invented over a century ago and has undergone continuous refinements and several breakthroughs. Various advancements were made to use cells for performing assays, and development of sophisticated call-based assays revealed a wealth of information from cellular studies. The comp lex behavior of cell- cell interactions and molecular components of the cells were discovered, making cell-based assay an invaluable tool. As the demand for high- throughput screening rises, conventional techniques such as well plates and robotic s have been continuously engineered and improved to meet the demand. However, th ese techniques suffered from drawbacks such as limited liquid handling ability , inability to scale up well pl ate density past 1,536 wells per plate, and high costs of equipments and operations. Microfluidic emerges as a promising pl atform to perform cell culture and cell- based assay in a high-throughput manner. Mi crofluidic devices hol d several distinct advantageous properties including high-thr oughput, mass fabrication capability, and reduction of reagents, cells and cost. For cell culture use, microfluidic devices have the ability to build culturing environment mimick ing the microenvironmen t that cells reside in vivo . Microfluidic, w ith immense potentia l, is still a young field with some commercialized products. It was derived from MEMS, which itself was originated from silicon semiconductor fabrication technology, but eventually became a major research area of its own. Dramatic increases in pub lications and new start-up companies showed 134 the burgeoning of the field and growing intere st. The application of microfluidic has expanded and demonstrated uses in analy tical chemistry, biology, forensics and diagnostics. In this thesis, a novel ce ll-based assay on-chip is presented. Microfluidic cell cu lture devices have been create d and are still part of ongoing researches in different groups in academia. Many of the other devices being developed can only expose cells to a single compound at once. However, cells are sustained in complex environments and received multiple environmental cues simultaneously. Also, combined drugs for treatment of diseases such as cancer and HIV have been promising. To screen for the combined effects of mu ltiple compounds at once, an integrated combinatorial mixer is necessary. Such st ructure would require fabrication of three- dimensional (3-D) microfluidic networks. In this work, an integrated method is presented to monolithically fabricate 3-D microfluid ic networks without performing bonding process as in many other methods for 3-D microfluidic fabrication. The fabrication is based on the surface micromach ining of biocompatible Paryle ne C. Such fabrication process presented here can be adopted to create microfluidic chips with complex networks and combinatorial mixer with large number of inlets and outlets. We first developed a chip on silicon with a three-i nput combinatorial mixer plus one unmixed control and eight outputs to the cell culture arrays. Fluidic packaging scheme was developed and combinatorial mixing was demonstrated. Cell culture was successfully done using this device and cell treatment with the combinator ial mixer was performed. To improve ease of use of the device for cel l-based assay, another device based on glass substrate was fabricated, and a method to inte grate a membrane into the device was used. The membrane created a cell culture environment similar to that of in vivo cell culture 135 conditions and also facilitated the cell loading and cell assa ying process. Cell-based assays were performed using this device by screening for the ability of compounds to reduce cytotoxicity of hydrogen peroxi de and combinatorial exposure of chemotherapeutic agents. Our 3-D microfluidic fabrication method was extended to make multilayer microfluidic networks with an integrated membrane. Our method offers the ability to create a monolithic device, and integrating me mbrane with 3-D microfluidic also expands the functionality of membrane-based micr ofluidic devices. Besides mammalian cells, microfluidic devices can be used for marine biology. Algal cell trapping, culturing and lysis were demonstrated in microfluidic devices with the eventual goal of making an integrated system to screen for the factors that induce toxin production. Our microfluidic devices were designed for cellular studies, but it is possible to extend its use to other areas such as combinat orial chemistry or in clinics for testing the combination of drugs to treat bacteria infec tion. Integrated system with detection and fluidic control for sample delivery is also possible. The development of this platform with integration of other components would very likely create devices that can bring major impact to drug screening, life scie nce companies and biological researches. 136 References [1] R.
