Welcome. Have you any questions for me? Peggy: I do, but it would be wonderful to hear your own words about the flow of your life, and anything that you'd like humans to know about you and your people. That is suitable, and I thank you. Understanding and appreciating our people is a way of connecting with the true heart and beingness of All That Is in the water- based parts of this world. Once there was a great awakening among our kind, granted by Creator, that expanded our abilities to connect and share and learn with all species and forms of Life. What a wonder it was to become so fully aware and connected in so many ways! We spent many [time periods] in this blissful Becoming. Peggy: Did this take place on your homeworlds? Yes. Over un-expressible passings of time, you see. We sought out others-other cultures-and offered to share our new understandings. Many refused, because they were not yet ready to embody such high energies. Those who accepted, went on to adapt the understandings to their own use and benefit. Peggy: Was this done in physical form, so you were traveling to different places in spacecraft? This concept is useful, yes.

Connect by email at newbluecanoe@ aol.com. Previous columns, interviews, and articles about her experiences and insights are posted on angelsfairiesandlife.wordpress.com. Peggy: Did your people reach Earth during these travels? The waters of Earth were one of our \"beginning- places\", not a home-world, but a location of interest. Creativity and beauty in all its forms is the heart of our being-ness, and we recognized great opportunities for development of species in the future of this new-to-us world. You wonder about our relationships with humans. The opportunity to interact with, learn from and share wisdom with humans was an additional attraction to our early colonists. Peggy: What else would you like our readers to know, today?We perceive with pleasure the growing numbers of humans who admire and enjoy learning about our many peoples (cephalopods). There will come a time when we work and live together to the benefit of all. This talking is complete.The Crazy Wisdom Biweekly, February 17, 20236 Heart to Heart ANIMAL COMMUNICATION Compassionate Care For Your Animal Friends Interspecies counseling Support for life changes Support for trauma, grief, and adoption Animal communication classes Shamanic animal healing Judy Liu Ramsey Consultant For information or appointment, contact: info@judyramsey.net https:///JudyRamsey.netThe Crazy Wisdom Biweekly, February 03, 20237Helping Our Children in Distress By Sheri Stankorb-Geiselman One of the hardest things parents experience is seeing our children in distress. We want so much to take away the hurt! And now more than ever, with all the turbulence in our world, we are seeing our kids with big upsets. Whether it's the economic impact of the pandemic, grieving the loss of a loved one, missing classmates, activities curtailed, or not understanding why parents are home so much more, but are available so much less, our kids are experiencing a trying time.And what myriad ways kids show us their upsets! Tears, low frustration tolerance, unreasonable demands, unworkable behavior, aggression, and even tantrums (at any age). This challenge parents face\u2014seeing our children in distress\u2014is so hard that we often find ourselves in the moment reaching for ways to make it stop. We leap in to soothe, to fix, to solve. We fret about what it means to see our child's intense feelings, and we try so very hard to get them to use words. In our tightest moments, we send them away (\"Go to your room this instant!\"). And if we were raised in an environment where emotions made grown-ups uncomfortable, we may hear old voices in our head (\"I'll give you something to cry about!\"). But what if it was all so much simpler than that? What if, in the moment, you and your child actually had everything you needed to heal their hurt? Parents have a lightbulb moment when they realize that there is actually very little that needs to be done when their child or teen is navigating an emotional storm. I say \"very little\" because it's not nothing. It's not sending them to their room to fight the emotional battle on their own. In fact, it's drawing closer and offering connection that will allow them to metabolize their emotions so they can think again. In a recent article for The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal titled Focus on Connection, I touched on some Hand in Hand Parenting tools to help parents connect with their children. Straightforward tools that can make family life flow more smoothly\u2014even during a pandemic. Especially during a pandemic! One of these tools is called Staylistening. In a nutshell, it means listening to your child's upset all the way through. When a child's behavior is off-track, they are sending a signal that they need our help. But why the heck can't they just calmly tell us what's wrong, and talk about their feelings? How about saying\u2014Mom, I miss my friends, and when I see them on Zoom it reminds me of that? If only! More often it comes at us straight out of left field\u2014 pow! We wonder what hit us\u2014sometimes literally! When a child or teen is feeling disconnected, they cannot think. The limbic system is a part of the brain that, when it's unsettled or disconnected, interrupts the ability of the prefrontal cortex (the \"thinking\" part of the brain) to function optimally. In reverse, when the limbic system perceives that they are safe and all is well, the prefrontal cortex can be fully online, and the child can think, focus, better control their impulses, cooperate, and have a more generous view of themselves and others.

The project will convert nearly seven acres of currently unused industrial land into a world-class public space. The finished project will connect miles of pathways, and include an ice-ribbon, a pedestrian bridge to the Argo Cascades, event lawns, and a year-round pavilion for community gatherings and entertainment. The centerpiece of the park will be the Commons - a two- acre, tree-lined elliptical lawn that will sit adjacent to a 1,200-foot riverfront trail, connecting Broadway Park West to the Washtenaw County's Border to Border trail system. When complete, the project will open up riverfront land that has been closed to the public since the 19th century. DTE Energy gas company operations occupied the site for years, conducting extensive remediation so that it could ultimately be repurposed as a public place to be enjoyed by Ann Arbor residents. After collaborating for over seven years, the company sold the property to the Roxbury Group with the intention of this exact project. \"DTE has been committed to a redevelopment of this site from the start, partnering with the City of Ann Arbor and community members to preserve the urban greenspace bordering the riverfront and creating a world-class public park,\" said Jerry Norcia, DTE Chairman and CEO. \"This is an exciting example of an adaptive reuse project, which provides important access to the public and serves as a model for the rest of the state. We're thrilled that this project will serve as a catalyst for continued growth and economic development in this region.\" Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher Taylor agreed. \"This project is incredibly important for Ann Arbor,\" said Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher Taylor. \"Ensuring that this riverfront property is available for the public to enjoy in perpetuity was a major factor in why Council approved this project so overwhelmingly. We appreciate DTE for their foresight and openness throughout this process. The public-private partnership between the conservancy, the city and the developers meets so many of our objectives as we all work to determine the best future for this critical site.\" As part of initial planning for the site, Roxbury, in collaboration with DTE, hosted over 60 meetings involving Lower Town Riverfront Conservancy Breaks Ground on Much Anticipated Seven-Acre Broadway Park West in Ann Arbor This transformative project will be the first public space in the city to be developed and operated by a non-profit conservancy. The valuable site, a former DTE Energy operation, will connect 1,200 feet of riverfront trails to Washtenaw County's 'Border to Border' trail system. The initial phase of the park to open by early 2024. more than 400 individuals from the neighborhoods, community groups and local businesses. The plan that emerged from that effort established priorities for the site and was ultimately approved by City Council on a 10-1 vote. A critical part of the City's approval process for the project was the requirement that the developer form an independent 501c3 non-profit entity that would ultimately be responsible for the funding and oversight of the public space. In accordance with that requirement, the Lower Town Riverfront Conservancy was formed in 2020. Since then, the Conservancy has formed an independent Board of Directors, established a collaboration with the Ann Arbor Area Community Foundation and secured both public and private funding necessary to construct the public space components required by the City. Marie Klopf is serving as the Conservancy's first president, having been appointed to that role in late-2022. Klopf has a long history of service to the Ann Arbor community. A resident of Ann Arbor, Marie served as President/CEO of the Ann Arbor Art Center for more than a decade. In that role, she led a significant capital campaign to acquire and renovate two downtown buildings to serve as the Center's program and gallery space and increased program funding from grants, foundations, by more than 500%. The Crazy Wisdom Biweekly, February 03, 20239The Lower Town Riverfront Conservancy is a 501c3 enterprise which was formed in connection with the entitlement and redevelopment of the former Michigan Consolidated Gas Company property located at 841 Broadway in Ann Arbor. The Conservancy was specifically formed for the establishment, improvement, operation, maintenance, conservation and preservation of publicly accessible green space, trails and pathways, and park amenities along 1200 feet of the Huron River, which comprises more than half the site. The formation of the Conservancy was required of the developer by the City of Ann Arbor as part of the Zoning and Site Plan process that took place between 2019 and 2021. The City wanted to ensure that the substantial public space and waterways components of the project described above were ultimately held in trust for the benefit of the community in perpetuity, and that there would be sufficient funds raised by the developer, both public and private, for the construction and ongoing maintenance of the public space. A central component of the Conservancy's mission is the restoration and perpetual care and maintenance of the natural habitat along the Huron River, as well as the restoration of the uplands, which will include, among other things, the planting of over 100 trees. For more information, please visit www.lowertowna2.org. \"The Lower Town Riverfront Conservancy is extremely grateful for the strong support it has received both from the State of Michigan and our private donors toward the development of this long-awaited public space and trail project for the Ann Arbor community,\" said Marie Klopf. \"When we finish construction of the public space next year, it will not only transform over seven acres of blighted and historically industrial land into a world-class public space but will serve as a model in our city for how public, private and philanthropic sectors can collaborate to achieve community goals.\" The public space is the first phase of the larger redevelopment plan for the 14-acre site. Once the public space and related infrastructure improvements are completed, work will begin on the next phase, which will include approximately 100 for sale residences, a boutique hotel and approximately 20,000 square feet of neighborhood retail. A groundbreaking on these elements of the project is expected in early 2024, after the public space is complete. The Crazy Wisdom Biweekly, February 17, 202310 The Crazy Wisdom Biweekly, February 03, 202311 Kindred Conversations with Hilary Nichols Story and Photos by Hilary Nichols With a shared sigh, the two of us silently reach out to hold hands across the dinner table. We sit like this for a long moment, eyes closed with our hands clasped over the salad bowl and bread board, lost in the gentle impact of such a heartfelt expression. Conversations with Juliet Seignious often invoke that exalted experience that I can only describe as a soul connection. Seignious is a fine art painter, sculptor, collage artist, and a dancer. She has been serious about her art ever since she was a young child in Harlem, keeping busy with her paintings on rainy days. But it was her dancing that she devoted much of her professional life, since attending the High School for Performing Arts, well known for its depiction in the movie Fame. In 1961, while she was still apprenticing at the American School of Ballet, as the first African American to be offered the coveted spot, she joined Alvin Ailey's Dance theater of Harlem as a founding member. In 1978 she opened a dance studio in the Hudson Valley, in upstate New York, and it was there that her painting career took on more prominence, crafting a body of work that she sold at art fairs throughout the United States. In 2016 she moved to Ann Arbor to join her son, a professor of Political Science at the University of Michigan. Into her attached basement apartment in the Barton Hills area, she transported her paints, canvases, and rolls and rolls of her works, on her signature heavy duty tar paper. The surface is durable and rich in metaphor, for a poignant piece aptly titled Family Tree. The three feet by six feet pieces stretch along the wall, layered with bright paints, layers of cheesecloth, shells, and stories. When the splashes of red, blue, purple, violet, and orange paint dry, she transfers an appliqued image of the March on Selma, and then in opaque white, layered over the imagery, she letters the word \"overcome.\" Her piece on Olympian Jesse Owens was exhibited at the Charles Wright African American Museum just weeks after her arrival in Michigan. Seignious is not afraid to make a statement. At the beginning of the pandemic, she committed to making a piece a day. This series of smaller paintings, titled Abstract Journey is reaching over 283 images collected. It was by accident that became unified when her abstractions were interpreted by a friend who commented, \"The darker shapes look like coffins.\" With surprise, Juliet agreed, and the theme took on deeper FOR MORE, VISITONLINE AT CRAZY WISDOM JOURNAL resonance, as it correlated with the history that was heavy on her heart. \"Within the abstract work, the meaning was made clear. The coffins represent the slaves buried beneath Wall Street in New York City, and the simple figures on the horizon are the spirits that carry us forward.\" Art and activism are aligned for Seignious. The act is one in the same, but it is the spirit that inspires. It was in 1973 that Seignious read a book that she credits as the catalyst to her spiritual journey. The book The Infinite Way by Joel Goldsmith opened her up to a perspective that has remained central to her being. \"The road to having no judgment is a long and difficult one. It means sacrificing things, giving up a sense of separation, opening your heart again to feel that oneness. It is a practice, pretty much every day.\" And it is a practice that Seignious applies every day. \"The empty surface provokes me, and then I hear the voice, 'Just put some darn paint on the canvas!' From there I let the colors and brushes take over, without judgment.\" She continues to exhibit her works to inspire others to create, to keep close to spirit. \"This comes under the heading of love, self-love, opening up, for that love to come through.\" Whether viewing her showings at WSG in Ann Arbor, at the Charles Wright Museum, Riverside Art Center, or in her home studio, it is undeniable, you can feel her passion palpably. When I ask her my signature question, how is she living her convictions, she muses, \"It is the same with my dancing. I seek to be in the zone, and the audience feels that. That is what matters most.\" And it becomes clear that there is not much of a distinction for her between her styles of art making. For Juliet Seignious, painting is a kind of dance. Currently Seignious is collaborating with her grandson as her co-author on a children's book titled, \"Tut, The Giant.\" You can learn more about Juliet Seignious and her artwork on her instagram account @julietseignious.The Crazy Wisdom Biweekly, February 17, 202312The Reading Series of The Crazy Wisdom Poetry Circle 7:00 PM - 8:45 PM Wednesday, Feb. 22, 2023 Featured Readers: February 22 - Linda K.

It is one of our most powerful grounding and protection stones and is prized by shamanic healers for these qualities. Its density and vibrational energy can carry one's awareness down into the Earth, making it an important stone for journeying and soul retrieval. It can also aid in past regression work. On a physical level, according to author and healer Naisha Ahsian, Galena can \"counter radiation, electromagnetic pollution and other forms of harmful energy\" and is good to have around while on a computer for long hours. It is one of my favorite minerals, and I keep one at each of the doors around my home. The gleaming specimen below is from the Nikolaeskiy Mine in Dalnegorsk, Russia and is available on my eBay.

Raw Honey is the long-term recording project of Maggie Hopp. Based primarily out of southeast Michigan/Detroit, Hopp has traveled widely, including life abroad in South Korea and China. The imagery and detail of that life bursts through her writing, balancing the markedly internal quality of her lines with the steady movement that carries them. Listeners find themselves receding into themselves at the same time they're urged into the wider world, crossing weird concrete bridges or kissing ghosts on trains. There is nothing static to be found. That's some of the quality of this music: we are not allowed to decide about or locate this artist, who in pursuit of \"honesty\" offers us a whole person. 1. What does music mean to you? Music is my tool for processing life's many ups and downs. I am an empathetic person, which can be overwhelming at times. Music calms my nervous system and helps me re-center, ground, and connect to the magic and beauty always present in the universe. I find songwriting and making music extremely therapeutic because I can channel all of my big feelings into something meaningful and tangible that I can share with the world. I am so grateful for my relationship with music and all the wonderful people I've connected with through music. I want music to be a central part of my life until the very end. 2. Describe your music in one word. Intuitive.3. How would you classify your sound as a whole? My sweet friend and collaborator, Luke Faste, described my sound as \"atmospheres and textures that orbit and envelope\" my \"elemental voice.\" Traces of 60s pop, choral music, and 90s indie music are framed by surprising and unconventional harmonics. The music oscillates between heaviness and lightness tonally, but always with a sense of intimacy. 4. What are some other artists or bands who have influenced your sound? Yo La Tengo, Fred Thomas, Angel Olsen, Wilco, Low, Elliott Smith, Nirvana, Tom Petty, The Beatles, Neutral Milk Hotel, Big Thief, Coma Cinema, Maple Glider, Madonna, The Microphones, Bob Dylan, Diane Cluck, Hand Habits, Neil Young, Radiohead, Modest Mouse, Mirah, Grouper.Click to connect with Raw Honey. \"Many of the songs on my debut album, Riverbed, are inspired by my father, who died when I was six. In many ways, Riverbed is a tribute to him.\"The Crazy Wisdom Biweekly, February 03, 202319Talmers released a double LP . Top: \"Hope is The Whore I Go To\" Bottom: Its twin record, \"My Mortal Wound\". 5. What is the last song you have listened to that moved you? Taylor Greenshields, the founder of Fundamental Sound Co., released a meditative and inspiring improvised piano piece on Bandcamp called \"T. Greens Solo Piano Feb 7th.\" It took me on an emotional adventure. 6. Do you have any advice for aspiring musicians? Enjoy the process, and treasure the feeling of being a beginner. Immerse yourself in the world of music making, and allow it to become a part of your identity. Music shapes you just as much as you shape it! 7. What is something about your music that someone may not know? Many of the songs on my debut album, Riverbed, are inspired by my father, who died when I was six. In many ways, Riverbed is a tribute to him. The record insert features a painting of my father holding me when I was a baby, and the record cover is a painting of me as a child holding my newborn brother. The album art has much to unpack, and the songs connect intimately with the artwork. Ypsilanti artist and musician Jim Cherewick painted all of the album art. Also, my incredible sister, Sarah Hopp, sings harmonies on \"Attic Stairs,\" and you can hear her kiss me on the cheek at the end of the song. Lastly, Fred Thomas recorded and produced Riverbed and has been an essential friend and mentor on my musical journey, always cheering me on. 8. Where are you performing next? Saturday, April 8, at the Regal Beagle in Ypsilanti.9. Where are some of your go-to places to catch a show around Ypsi/Ann Arbor that other people may not know about?

This undermines the root of all suffering, the fundamental ignorance that grasps at an intrinsically existing self, while at the same time allowing for the infallible unfolding of cause and effect.
