Why You Should Get Acupuncture Sickness, injury, poor lifestyle habits, and the stresses of everyday life are things we all experience that disrupt the delicate balance that is so important to wellness and vitality. Acupuncture is a time-tested method for encouraging the body's natural healing processes and bringing it back into balance. It has been used in many parts of the world for thousands of years and has helped a countless number of people. In the few decades since its introduction to the West, acupuncture has become one of the most proven and well-known forms of holistic medicine that exists in the United States today. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institute of Health (NIH) recognize that acupuncture is safe and effective for treating a wide range of health concerns. At Acupuncture for Balanced Wellness, we are excited to bring you the benefits of this safe, effective, and drug-free form of therapy at our Loop location in the heart of downtown Chicago, where we offer the wisdom of both Eastern and Western therapeutics for an integrative approach to health. We have been practicing since 2008, and our licensed and board certified acupuncturists focus on providing our patients with thorough, individualized, and comprehensive care.
