Goenka in the tradition of Sayagyi U Ba Khin Welcome [Vipassana](vipassana), which means to see things as they really are, is one of India's most ancient techniques of meditation. It was taught in India more than 2500 years ago as a universal remedy for universal ills, i.e., an [Art of Living](art). For those who are not familiar with Vipassana Meditation, an Introduction to Vipassana by Mr. Goenka & related videos and [Questions & Answers](qanda) about Vipassana are available. Courses The technique of Vipassana Meditation is taught at ten-day residential courses during which participants learn the basics of the method, and practice sufficiently to experience its beneficial results. There are no charges for the courses - not even to cover the cost of food and accommodation. All expenses are met by donations from people who, having completed a course and experienced the benefits of Vipassana, wish to give others the opportunity to also benefit. Locations Courses are given in numerous Meditation Centers and at Non-Center course locations at rented sites. Each location has its own schedule of courses. In most cases, an application for admission to these courses can be completed online at this website. There are many Vipassana Centers throughout the world in [India](locations/directory#IN) and elsewhere in [Asia/Pacific](locations/directory#142), in and in [Africa](locations/directory#002). Ten day non-center courses are frequently held at many locations outside of Centers as they are arranged by local students of Vipassana in those areas. An [alphabetical list](locations/directory) of worldwide course locations is available as well as a graphical interface of course locations [worldwide](maps/world) and in [India and Nepal](maps/IN). Special Courses and Resources Vipassana Meditation courses are also being taught in [prisons](http://www.prison.dhamma.org/).
