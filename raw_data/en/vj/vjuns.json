Tasty and easy to make, Ayurveda Beet Soup cools off Pitta dosha, cleanses the liver and blood, supports healthy female system, supports healthy elimination and relieves hemorrhoids. In small amounts beets are grounding for Vata. Pitta and Kapha can enjoy beets in moderate amounts. \"....beets were so well regarded in Ancient Rome and Greece that methods were developed for producing them during the hot summer months.\" Visit [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/food/the-history-kitchen/history-beets/) for more. I always wonder where vegetables were rooted. Beetroot originated on the Mediterranean coast and were grown for the beet leaves (these are great sauteed or in kitchari), but the root was also consumed--and a good thing too. Mother Nature provided two gifts in one with beetroot--the cooling darky leafy green and the bile flowing supportive root that is also grounding. As though cooling off excess Pitta and moving stagnant bile wasn't enough, this eager beaver of the vegetable kingdom is high in iron and helps build new blood. Ayurveda Beet Soup for Vata, Pitta and Kapha Ingredients: 2 tablespoons olive oil or your best oil from your Saumya Food Program 1 diced onion (purple) 1 cup diced celery (the darker green the celery the better) 2 diced leeks Salt and pepper (use the good stuff) 4 garlic cloves (finely minced) 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1 teaspoon paprika \u00bd teaspoon caraway seeds, lightly roasted 1-3 bay leaf, depending on size A sprig of thyme (if you got the time) 1 pound potatoes (peeled and cut into \u00bd inch peices) 1 pound medium beets (peeled and cut into 1inch pieces) \u00bd pound medium carrots, (peeled and cut into \u00bd pieces)- I prefer Purple Dragon carrots when available \u00bd tablespoon apple-cider vinegar, or a splash of real sauerkraut juice, to taste Instructions: 1. Put olive oil in a heavy-bottomed soup pot on medium-ish heat. 2. Heat the oil and add onion, celery and leek coating it well with the salt and pepper. Saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes, or until the onion has a little brown on the edge. Add garlic, tomato paste, paprika, caraway, bay leaf and thyme Mix it all together and cook for about a minute. 3. Now the fun really starts. Add potatoes, beets and carrots, 6 cups water and salt amount correct for your your dosha and situation. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer. Simmer with lid ever so slightly off the edge of the pot for 20 minutes, or until everything is tender. 4. Stir in the vinegar or sauerkraut juice to your liking. Taste it and adjust spicing if needed. Cook for about 5-10 minutes. 5. Garnish with chopped dill, or even a lil dollop of sour cream especially for Vata. 5. Take a grounding breath. 6. Enjoy.

The Wellness Consultation with individual attention and focus has been wonderful. I have transitioned from pharmaceuticals to herbal and dietary approaches to manage my high cholesterol and calcium deficiencies. Digestive issues that have plagued me my entire life have disappeared. I am a dedicated user of the oils to ease arthritis pain. I was so pleased with my results that I recommended Saumya Ayurveda to my daughters and my mother. My mother enjoys the tea, and the oil is working so well for the arthritis in her hands and shoulders that she has been able to stop using harsh pain medications. Ayurveda is helping me to take care of myself and I can enjoy each day.\" --Rachelle Chase, retired Director Business Process, Target Corporation, Minnesota \"Saumya Ayurveda has helped me to become reborn. With Veena's help, I have become more than ADHD. What I experienced with Veena allowed me, not only a general understanding of health, but sparked a lifelong journey to use my knowledge to advance the acceptance of Ayurveda as a needed modality of health. This is a feat, considering I had difficulty focusing and digestive issues only four short years ago. Veena is a skilled healer with a solution to fit all.\" --Jessica B.

She remains passionate for over 30 years, helping clients feel their best physically, emotionally, and spiritually with Ayurveda. Veena individualizes treatment plans to each person, rather than offering a one-size-fits-all approach, so it fits your life and becomes woven into your daily life, naturally. Vata joined the Saumya Ayurveda pack about a year ago. At first, his Vata was quite imbalanced. He was fearful, underweight, skittish, hand shy and anxious. I worked with him slowly to gain his trust. Letting him come to me. Once vata dosha was grounded with the help of warm, moist food with ghee on it, Vata experienced trust and fear reduced, the door was wide open. Now Vata is thriving. He has gained weight, he is trusting of (some) people and I am honored to be one of them. He loves to be pet--and he especially loves to have his big ears massaged. Vata is an absolute joy to have on the team. "}
