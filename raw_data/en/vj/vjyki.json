To ensure we prevent the spread of Covid-19 we are implementing the following interventions: Revive practitioner will wear a mask; patients are asked to wear a mask. Medical-grade HEPA filters are used in the treatment rooms and common area. These proven units will filter 100% of the air in each treatment room every 30 minutes. All surfaces are wiped down with disinfectant in between each patient. Only one patient is allowed in the waiting room at a time. Patients with a cough, sore throat, or fever cannot attend Revive until 5 days after their symptoms have cleared and they have received a negative Covid test.
