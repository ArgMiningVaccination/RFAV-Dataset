With over 7,000 species, all edible, the mint family is known to be aromatic (think rosemary, thyme, apple mint), calming, soothing and stimulating. Mints calm our nervous system, relieve anxiety, tone the female reproductive system, soothe PMS, build emotional resiliency, and help us turn anger into positive action. These herbs have a rich history and lore, having been by our side for centuries, often guiding us during difficult and stressful times. They are powerful allies and additions to your medicine cabinet. In this class we will take a plant walk, learn how to identify plants and explore making remedies with motherwort, catnip, monardas, self-heal and many more! This class is taught by our program partner Alexandra Radoaca, founder and owner of Mindful Wilderness. Alexandra offers retreats and workshops weaving together herbalism, nature connection, earth living skills, sound healing and mind body practices, with an intention to create relationships with the Earth and to ourselves. - Ages 18 and up - Involves a walk over uneven terrain for about an hour. - Tickets are final and non-refundable.
