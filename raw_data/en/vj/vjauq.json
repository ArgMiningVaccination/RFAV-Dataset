In order to maintain our center of gravity, our central nervous system must receive all three of these signals and then correctly transmit them to the cerebellum. When signals from our senses fail to reach the cerebellum, or reach it with the wrong message, we experience that miscommunication as a loss of balance, a dizzy spell, or \u2014 if we're exceptionally unlucky \u2014 a stumble or fall. A balance disorder can sometimes be a symptom of other medical conditions. Proper medical attention, including a thorough medical history and assessment of the balance system is important to identify the cause and ensure proper treatment options. Dizziness can be caused by: [Infections of the middle ear](/services-2/ears/earaches/) [Allergies](/services-2/allergy/) [Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)](/services-2/ears/bppv/)- dizziness or imbalance brought about by head movements - Vestibular neuronitis - inflammation of the vestibular nerve - Labyrinthitis - virus of the inner ear [Meniere's disease](/services-2/ears/menieres-disease/)- fluid buildup in the inner ear - Neck problems - Central problem - And more ... Balance Assessment If you experience balance problems or dizziness, we will complete a thorough evaluation. Our providers will perform a series of tests to assist in diagnosis and treatment of your problem. Balance Treatments If your assessment shows that you do have a balance problem, your doctor may recommend one of several treatments or balance therapies to help you get back on your feet. Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy \"Vestibular rehabilitation\" is the medical term for balance retraining. It is performed by a physical therapist, and each retraining program is tailored specifically to a patient's balance needs. Canalith Repositioning Some cases of vertigo can be resolved with a simple in-office positioning procedure. A Canalith Repositioning Maneuver is a treatment that takes the patient through a series of head and body positions designed to put loosened otoconia debris (crystals) back onto the balance organ. Diet and Lifestyle Changes Caffeine, salt, alcohol, nicotine, and dehydration can all have a considerable impact on your sense of balance. When you visit us at Mountain Home ENT & Allergy, we will conduct a full review of your prescription medications, diet, and daily habits to determine whether your balance issues can be controlled at home.
