Source: Thinkstock - California Governor Gavin Newsom recently [launched](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/12/14/governor-newsom-launches-vaccinate-all-58-campaign-based-on-safety-and-equity-as-first-vaccines-arrive-to-california/) a campaign for safe, fair, and equitable distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine in all 58 counties of the state. The \"Vaccinate All 58\" campaign will allow for vaccines to be administered in phases by prioritizing groups according to risk and level of exposure. Initial doses will go to essential healthcare workers and individuals in long-term care facilities. The additional doses are expected to be allocated to essential workers and others at highest risk of becoming infected or severely ill with COVID-19. Newsom joined local healthcare leaders at Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center to launch the initiative. The Medical Center is one of the first locations in California to receive the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, which was recently [approved](https://pharmanewsintel.com/news/fda-issues-eua-for-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine) for emergency use by the FDA. \"As our first doses of vaccine arrive, the promise of ending the pandemic is on the horizon. By taking collective, inclusive action across all 58 counties to get people vaccinated, we can get through to a healthier future for all,\" Newsom said in the announcement. \"This is a moment for hope, and it is also a time to remain vigilant as we face the most intense surge yet. While we have prepared for this surge with beds and equipment, staffing shortages are real and impact our medical system. There's light at the end of the tunnel and I am calling on all Californians to do our part to get us through this,\" he continued. A Scientific Safety Review Workgroup, which included Washington, Oregon, Nevada, and public health experts helped to form the safety and equity principles of campaign. Newsom's main goal is to focus on communities that may have been neglected for several different reasons, including race, language, or ethnicity. So far, the Workgroup reviewed FDA's actions related to [COVID-19 vaccinations](https://pharmanewsintel.com/news/comparing-covid-19-vaccine-candidates-from-pfizer-moderna) and confirmed that the Pfizer vaccine is safe for public use. But they will continue to evaluate other promising vaccines currently in development in the coming weeks. \"In distributing this life-changing vaccine, safety and equity are paramount. It is critical that we provide all Californians with the tools they need to get through this health crisis, from information to the vaccine, and the 'Vaccinate All 58' campaign does just that,\" said Senate President pro Tempore Toni G. Atkins. \"That is how we get to the other side of this pandemic, and to healthier outcomes for us all.\" Many factors go into a successful vaccination distribution plan, so healthcare industry and federal agencies must work together to develop a strategic and equitable plan to do so. In mid-September, healthcare improvement company Premier Inc. [released](https://pharmanewsintel.com/news/steps-to-implement-a-successful-covid-19-vaccination-program) four recommendations on how the US can implement a successful program once a vaccine becomes available to the public. The first recommendation was to prioritize who gets vaccinated first. Although a formal segmentation has yet to be approved, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a discussion draft that talked about who may be included in the first few phases. The first two phases would focus on frontline workers, first responders, critical risk workers, teachers, and others with underlying health conditions, while the last two phases would include young adults, children, workers in essential industries, and those who had not already received a vaccine. The second recommendation was dynamic allocation based on hotspots and priority populations, like Newsom's \"Vaccinate All 58\" approach. Premier's third recommendation was that the US needs a distribution plan that ensures the vaccine is safely and efficiently transported to communities across the country. Therefore, distribution partners and administration sites must come together to ensure they are prepared for both the vaccine and the freezing capabilities. And the last suggestion was to display accurate and methodical patient tracking, which will ensure that all patients received the vaccine dosage needed at the correct time. "}
