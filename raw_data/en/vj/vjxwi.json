Nowhere is this myth of separation more visible and more tenacious than in the city of Jerusalem. Thomas Abowd's Colonial Jerusalem is a rich and engaging ethnographic explo- ration of Jerusalem, its world of separation, of the homes, lives, memories, and histories of the Palestinian Arabs that have been shattered and the anguish and anger it has created and fomented for 68 years. Throughout the book, Abowd seeks to challenge the settler colonial myth of separation and its naturalization by uncovering the ambivalences and contradictions underlying the spatial dividing of the city. He highlights, in turn, a past in which Jews and Arabs mixed and their relations were less hierarchical while at the same time pointing to more recent efforts among Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs to thwart the racial politics of colonial governance. Abowd's ethnography consists of seven chapters, each of which takes up a different focal point in the spatial making of Jerusalem. The rst chapter, also the introduction to the book, sets up the context of the study with a discussion of the modern history of Jerusalem as a colonial city and the demographic politics that have shaped it since 1948. In the second chapter, \"Diverse Absences: Reading Colonial Landscapes Old and New,\" he takes up the makeup of the city under the British colonial Palestine (1917-1948), followed by the spatial politics that rst governed the city with its colonization in 1948. The second part of this chapter is an engaging account of the shifting spatial congurations of the city through former Palestinian homes in Talbieh area of the city. The third chapter, \"Myths, Memorials, and Monuments in the Jerusalem of Israel's Imagination,\" AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST, Vol. 118, online ISSN 1548-1433. Association. All rights reserved. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12649looks at the contested histories of symbolic places in the city and how they are shaped and contested through a struggle between colonizer and colonized. \"Arabs Out of Place: Colonizing the Old City,\" the fourth chapter, examines the Western Wall area of the old city and how the residents Palestinian Moroccan Quarter have found themselves \"out of place\" (p. 119) as Israel has respatialized the Western Wall and its environs. The fth chapter, \"National Boundaries, Colonized Spaces: The Gendered Politics of Residential Life,\" is a fascinating exploration of the everyday lives of Palestinians, especially young women, who have chosen to live in Jewish areas of the city and the difculties they have from both Jewish Israelis and Palestinian Arabs. In his sixth chapter, \"Appropriate Places: Terrorism, Fear, and the Policing of Palestinian Men,\" Abowd turns to the bodies of Palestinian men under the colonial gaze, a body to be feared not for reasons of security but to maintain separation. In the nal chapter, \"Up from the Ruins: Demolishing Homes and Building Solidarity in a Colonial City,\" the discussion turns to ubiquitous Israeli practice of home demolition and the Jewish Israelis and Palestinian Arabs that have come together in a common struggle against it. Setting out to explore the spatial construction of identity in Jerusalem, Abowd opens and frames his book with two interrelated premise. The rst is the seemingly innocuous observation that \"it should be recalled that a city's or country's contours, its demographic makeup and those whom it includes and excludes, depend of where and how its boundaries are drawn and\u2014just as importantly\u2014who is empowered to draw them\" (p. 18). His second premise is the myth of the inevitable necessity of separation: \"It declares that Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs must be kept apart because these two people's real or supposed cultural and religious differences preclude peaceful interactions and make impossible any vision antithetical to one based on sepa- ration\" (p. 23; see also pp. 41-42). Reading these two points together, it would appear that the rst is dependent on the second as its justication and legitimization. Yet, is AbowdBook Reviews 647 not in fact asking us to consider instead the rst as the con- dition for the second? What is a myth without its enactment and enforcement by the rules and power of governance? In- deed, rather than attacking the myth of separation directly, it is in the attention to the spatial construction of difference in all its ambivalences and contradictions in which his ethnog-raphy makes an invaluable contribution to the literature on Palestinians/Israelis. It is here that his ethnography also becomes an ideal introduction to the Palestinian/Israeli con- flict for both scholars and students, as well as those working more broadly on the relationships between spatiality and power. Anders Breivik and the Rise of Islamophobia 2014. 304 pp. DOI: Bergen In Breivik detonated a bomb in a gov- ernment building in Oslo, killing eight persons, and he then proceeded to a Norwegian social democratic youth camp and used guns to kill 67 youngsters. Two more died trying to es- cape. His rationale was soon found on the Internet: his mainly cut-and-paste 1,500-page tract \"Europe1983: A Declaration of Independence\" (Berwick [Breivik] 2011) and a YouTube introduction (Breivik 2013) to the text. He declares his actions to be marketing efforts for the manifesto. His stated aim is to instigate a civil war in Europe resulting in a white, European Christian civilization. All Muslims are to be expelled from Europe. He sees himself as a true Norwegian and an antifeminist. His actions and writings have generated much debate and scholarly treatment. Was Breivik a psychotic and paranoid schizophrenic? Was he a lone wolf or a part of a wide collective of the like-minded, as he claimed? Was he inspired and energized by writings and political positions of many Norwegian politicians and scholars? Did he in fact express, however horribly, a deep-seated strand of racism in parts of Norwegian society? How was he related to the like-minded in other European countries? How does he relate to the extreme right tint discoloring of parts of European political and public life? What is the signicance of Internet-based hate sites? Most importantly, what is the importance of Breivik in understanding our times? Sindre Bangstad's book is a superb treatment of these issues, with an emphasis on the latter of these questions. His text thus covers several elds of inquiry, but these are very skillfully tied together by Bangstad's overarching ambition\u2014to \"shed light on the Norwegian societal discourses regarding Islam and Muslims\" (p. xiii) in the context of the general European situation. However, it must be stressed that discourse here is not at all limited to textual analysis\u2014far from it. One major point in his treatiseis the relationship between word and action and that words matter. Ever since the tragedy, a politically charged issue has been whether Breivik's actions should be understood as those of a crazy person or if they are important as manifestations of trends in society. In the rst forensic psychiatric evaluation, Breivik was found to be a \"paranoid schizophrenic\" loner. The psychiatrists were obviously completely unaware of how Breivik was a part of a Europe-wide assemblage of xenophobes. Protests against this assessment came also from other psychiatrists, who had never experienced schizophrenics plotting a plan for years, which Breivik had done. A second evaluation found Breivik to be legally sane (not a schizophrenic). A massive public debate resulted about to what extent racist and xenophobic tendencies in Norwegian society were important in understanding Breivik's deeds. Some, including academics, argued that Breivik represented no one; others stressed the importance of the social and cultural basis informing Breivik and shaping his actions. Bangstad's discussion of this issue elucidates how the xenophobic and Islamophobic discourse is a truly necessary, if not sufcient, condition to explain Breivik's actions. Indeed, Breivik saw himself as representing a major social movement. Logically, this leads Bangstad to an excellent and theoretically informed discussion of the \"mainstreaming of Islamophobic discourse\" in Norway, and he shows how it was established over time. The role of the Progress Party, now a part of a coalition government, was one important factor in this. In many other European countries, xenophobic-Islamophobic parties have played the same role. He rightly claims that a Foucauldian \"knowledge regime,\" with frequent Islamophobic sentiments, has been established about Muslims in Norway and Europe. Media and academia have played major roles in its naturalizing and legitimation, and it now informs, to varying degrees, politicians both to the right and left. We are given a masterly depiction of how xenophobic- Islamophobic discourses over some years have converged into \"Eurabia,\" a conspiratorial and apocalyptic vision where648 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 Europe is seen as being invaded and taken over by \"Muslims.\" Norway and Scandinavia seem to be important loci for contributions to this genre. In it, Europeans are seen as the victims, and Eurabia ideologues see themselves expressing the true sentiment of the people, as opposed to the \"political correctness\" infesting much of the public sphere. Eurabia is a major Internet presence. However, Breivik, a Eurabia fan, declared himself a man of action not a blog writer. Bangstad appropriately ends with an important and extensive discussion of \"the weight of words\" and how the mainstreaming of racist and exclusionary discourses is presently perhaps the major danger to European society. The reactions to the present European refugee crisis testify to the veracity of Bangstad's analysis.Anders Breivik and the Rise of Islamophobia is an important book. Its theoretical and analytical approaches elegantly combine with a rich data presentation to elucidate a horrible trend in Europe.

Navigating Austerity: Currents of Debt along a South Asian River by Laura Bear Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2015. 264 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12635 Sarasij Majumder Kennesaw State University The Hooghly River has been a crucial conduit for trade, life, and livelihood in western Bengal and eastern India long before Job Charnock, the British East India Company trader, established a trading post at Calcutta in 1690. The river splits from the Ganga and flows southward to Bay of Bengal, connecting factory towns with the port in Calcutta, the capital of India's West Bengal province. Much roman- ticized and eulogized in Bengali popular and high culture, the river and its resources prompt different kinds of politics: class, identity, subnationalist, and electoral. Two subter- ranean crises underlie this agonistic space of claim making. The rst is silting, which makes the river less navigable. Sec- ond, a regime of global governance, or austerity capitalism, guides state policies of managing public goods by abdicat- ing responsibilities and long-term commitments to people and the environment. The political ecology of the river and a port that supports millions therefore constitutes of silencing, denials, and erasures. A leftist Bengali singer once lamented in his song that the sweat and toil of the poor, who bear the brunt of global trade on the river Hooghly, are forever lost in the waves splashing against its ghats (a flight of steps leading down to a river) Laura Bear's ethnography of this vital and busy water- way and its social and political life tells stories hidden in ofcial narratives and unacknowledged in popular represen- tations and discourses. Navigating Austerity vividly depictsthe afflictions produced at the human-environment inter- face. It unearths the politics of policy-making affecting the river's upkeep, which remained submerged in the deluge of policy documents and minutes in the government archives. The book demonstrates how the global dominance of auster- ity capitalism plays itself out through policies and politics. Servicing of sovereign debt, tied to the global nancial mar- kets, wrings resources of the port\u2014natural, human, and nonhuman\u2014dry, pushing them to ever-perilous existence devoid of security, maintenance, and sustainability. Policies of privatization extract as much value as it can from the river and its associated infrastructure to feed the proteer- ing machine of global nancial capitalism. Capitalism, in its current guise, does not regenerate; it ruins processes of life, livelihood, and nature, Bear argues. Navigating Austerity introduces an anthropology of \"aus- terity capitalism,\" which has recongured public policy across continents for nearly three decades. Financialization of sovereign debts since the 1980s moved public nance from the domain of political decision making to the realm of un- certain and volatile internationalized nancial markets. The entangling of ethical, political, and scal questions and im- peratives was set aside in favor of technical issues of servicing debts, interest payments, minimizing costs, and maximizing productivity. To comprehend the governance regime that emerges in the context of such radical reordering of public nance priorities, Bear studies the interactions between the formal practices and popular ethics of productivity. Drawing on the work of Michael Herzfeld, Bear looks at the intricacies of relationships within the river bureaucracy and its connections with the entrepreneurs, boatmen, andBook Reviews 649 workers. She navigates the layers of intimacies and distancing that characterize such complex webs of relationship, mud- dying the boundaries of formal and informal with a rare eye for linguistic and gestural details. Bear looks at the pragmatic use of formal devices, such as debt, future projections, or models of markets by differently positioned groups involved in maintaining the river and earning a livelihood from it, to pursue multiple and dispersed ethical goals. \"Capitalist social action can only be understood,\" Bear contends, \"if we trace the pursuits of class status, of the public good, and selfhood that are both troubled by, and orient the uses of, these formal devices\" (p. 18). This approach of tracing and tracking the everyday or the social life of austerity capitalism aptly captures the grad- ual degeneration of Calcutta port. \"The chronic situation in Calcutta port is unlike the spectacular events of sovereign default or nancial market collapse that have been widely discussed\" (p. 28). Bear broadens the analytical framework by studying ethnographically meanings of work and labor among the actors whose actions produce the river and its ecology as a public good. Bear nds that these local ac- tors use and adapt notions of efciency, workmanship, and labor within a gendered, religious, cultural-historical tem-plate of marginalizing weaker and vulnerable groups, who are deemed antiproductive. Such schisms subtly abet and entrench the austerity measures. \"This is a development,\" Bear claims, \"that is unanticipated by Foucauldian or Marxist theoretical approaches\" (p. 97). Bear's meticulous dissection of the austerity policy and its implications raises important questions for anthropolo- gists in general and South Asianists in particular. Does chal- lenging or contesting austerity capitalism also mean address- ing popular ethics and identities formed at the conjunction of global, national, and local politics that set groups and people apart? How does one generate such a Janus-faced critique of the global and local in an intellectual climate that celebrates divergences, differences, and dispersals as counterpoints to the global dominance of corporate capitalism? What does this stranglehold of austerity capitalism in the everyday life of the river say about the oft-repeated formulation in South Asian studies: domination without hegemony? Navigating Austerity is a must-read for policy makers and anthropologists alike. One caveat, though: throughout and quite egregiously, Bear mistakenly identies the Marxist party in India and West Bengal\u2014CPI (M)\u2014as Maoists. This needs immediate correction. Mobile Selves: Race, Migration, and Belonging in Peru and the U.S. by Ulla D. Berg New York: New York University Press, 2015. 336 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12612 M. Cristina Alcalde University of Kentucky Focusing on Peruvian migrants from the central high- lands and their movements inside Peru and between Peru and the United States, Mobile Selves is a richly textured ethnography of global processes of mobility, or, as Ulla Berg describes it, an \"ambulant ethnography.\" Combining participant-observation, interviews, photo and video elici- tation, and narrative analysis, the book examines the reasons why Peruvians from the Mantaro Valley left the country be- tween the late 1980s and 2005, as well as their experiences as migrants. Berg provides a clear yet multidimensional image of the experiences of migrants and, in particular, contributes to our understanding of the experiences of working-class Andean Latin Americans in the global labor market as they renegotiate long-standing Peruvian social, economic, and racial hierarchies. Migration, more than primarily an eco- nomic aspiration, is more carefully and subtly approached as a cultural and class aspirational project about belonging within the nation and globally.Whereas for a large part of the 20th century in- digenous, working-class Peruvians migrated predominantly within Peru, since the 1980s a growing number of non- elite Peruvians have become transnational migrants. Unlike middle- and upper-class, typically white and mestizo, urban Peruvians, the Peruvians that Berg writes about continue to face multiple obstacles in their demands for full citizenship in Peru and access to international migration. In a particularly vivid chapter, Berg examines the complicated and racialized class processes migrants must navigate when and because they cannot obtain a foreign visa via formal avenues. To increase the probability of obtaining a visa, tramitadores, or brokers, in Lima may recommend to prospective migrants altering a \"rural and indigenous-sounding name\" on a pass- port to a more modern-sounding name that is more common in cities (p. 75) or changing the applicant's nationality, or they might suggest that migrants apply for a different cate- gory of visa. The processes that Andean working-class Peruvians go through to migrate, and the migration process itself, underscore that in the context of persistent class and race hierarchies migrants may have only limited control over how they are viewed, even as they reimagine themselves650 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 transnationally. In this sense, the focus on how racialization affects the practice of citizenship in Peru as well as in the United States is a particularly welcome element in this study. When Peruvians from the provinces return to Peru, it is not uncommon for them to be made fun of as pretending to be \"Americanized\" in exchanges that, as Berg rightly em- phasizes, are racially charged and point to deeper, historical tensions in claims to belonging and citizenship. In examining everyday life in New Jersey, Berg proposes the term \"folk- loric citizenship\" as a way of understanding how indigenous Peruvians both strategically claim national belonging and un- derscore their differences in nonthreatening ways (p. 179). Engaging with the role of new media technologies in mi- grants' lives, connections, and claims to belonging, Berg also contributes to nuanced approaches that recognize both the positive and more unintended and negative consequences of some forms of communication in the context of migration. Although new technologies help maintain communication within families, the physical separation continues to be a painful and ever-present aspect of migration. She nds that migrants prefer visual technologies, such as family videos and Skype, because they believe it is more difcult to hide information this way. Yet visual forms of communication may also inadvertently produce anger, concern, or anxietyby providing evidence of possible relationships unknown to migrants, showing challenging living environments, or re- minding migrants of individuals or places they would rather not see. In cases of celebrations to which migrants had con- tributed economically, migrants preferred visual technolo- gies because they provided a unique way of seeing how their remittances had been used, to take part in these events from a distance, and to express their approval or disapproval of what they viewed and how their money had been spent. Mobile Selves clearly shows that transnational migration is an important site for critically approaching belonging, inclusiveness, and citizenship within countries of origin as well as globally. In examining in particular race and class in her analysis of Peruvian migration, this important book also brought to my mind questions about how other factors that intersect with race and class, such as gender and sexual identity, also inform and have repercussions for how Peru- vian migrants experience citizenship and belonging. Berg has produced a sophisticated and accessible multisited ethnogra- phy that contributes to Latin American and Latino Studies, migration studies and studies of race and racialization, and that reminds us of multiple and profound divisions, exclu- sions, and everyday forms of agency within transnational migration. Behold the Black Caiman: A Chronicle of Ayoreo Life by Lucas Bessire Chicago: University of Lucas Bessire's Behold the Black Caiman: Chronicle of Ayoreo Life guides us through an unsettling ethnographic journey that intends to question and alter anthropological and common knowledge about the previously \"isolated\" and contemporary life conditions of the Ayoreo of the Chaco of Bolivia and Paraguay. We learn that Erami (past life in the forest) was not like living in paradise for the Areguede'urusade band of the Totobiegosode Ayoreo that was rst contacted in 2004. Terrorized by the Cojnone' (Strangers) bulldozers, running for survival, hiding, and eating scarcely, the few isolated families wondered whether they would be killed by their enemies like the Guidaigosode Ayoreo, the colonizers, or by nonhuman forces offended by violations of puyaque (taboo). Thus, these families in Erami were neither really isolated nor happy but watching out for the overwhelming invasion and deforestation of their land.Likewise, as occurred to other Ayoreo groups since the 1940s, when the Areguede'urusade joined the colonized world of Cojnone-Gari (time belonging to the Strangers), they had to face more challenges: racial discrimination, la- bor exploitation, famine, and ecological destruction. Fur- thermore, the author argues that current projects that seek to preserve or erase the image of the bon sauvage only serve to worsen the Ayoreo's predicaments. These projects, whether they long for souls, tradition, pure blood, or pro- tecting indigenous isolation, are all offspring of a neolib- eral colonialism aimed to govern, sometimes unwittingly by its promoters but nonetheless with violence, the possi- ble ways the Ayoreo should be indigenous or just human beings. However, it is impossible for the Ayoreo to con- form to any assigned identity\u2014whether it be traditional culture, isolated indigeneity, or Christianity\u2014as these are contested moral economies that respond to a \"biolegiti- macy\" (p. 177) by which their new identities (e.g., ex- primitive, acculturated, etc.) are excluded. They, for the achieving of any sort of \"ontological self-determination\" (p. 44), have to break from Erami and embrace Cojnone-Gari.Book Reviews 651 Hence, the Ayoreo engage in chinoningase (transforma- tion process) of the ayipie (soul matter) (p. 15). Such trans- formations are rooted in the adode (creation myths) of the Ancestor Beings who were protohuman and later becamefully moral human by learning the \"capacity to continually manage, contest, and redene\" humanity itself (p. 37). How- ever, to harness such capacity, transform their ayipie, andremain human with the impending physical and hermeneu-tic violence, contemporary Ayoreo have no choice but toresort to contradictory ontological responses, always on themaking and close to evanescence or destruction. For in-stance, they remembered Echoi\u2014a past pan-Ayorean saltlake meeting site (p. 45)\u2014both as a peaceful and violentplace. Over time, as they ineffectively tried to access theCojnone's power (e.g., to make metal) through \"mimetic magic\" (pp. they massively \"apocalyptical futurism\" (p. 145) thatreworked their traditions as sinful to Dupade (Christian god) and could bring about the ayipie transformations re-quired for the present times. They used ajengome (shame), an embodied sentiment, to relationally dene the moralself before others such as Dupade or Coj none. Some of the youngest embraced self-carved destructive practices, thoseafflicted by urusori (madness) and the Puyedie (drug addicts). Hence, Bessire argues that dwelling on a pervasive and shat-tered \"negative immanence\" (p. 189) and \"epistemic murk\"(p. 185) authorized indigeneity or humanity iswhere the Ayoreo nd possible their \"becoming\" (p. 228). Nonetheless, in spite of the unique Ayoreo's \"al- lopoiesis\" (p. 224) and the niceties of theoretical debate andlabels, other ethnographies from the Chaco have traced sim-ilar transformations of indigenous ontologies and practices.Examples abound; to cite but a few: of the use of sympatheticmagic of nonindigenous (e.g., Kidd 1999), of millenarianismand apocalyptic upheavals (e.g., Regehr 1981), of relationalmoral agencies (e.g., Grant 2006), and of ethnohistoricalgenealogies of places and memories (e.g., Richard 2008).In this sense, Bessire does not show much effort to di-alogue with such ethnographies, and, where he does, hemostly concentrates to prove wrong the other \"Ayoreolo-gists.\" This strategy is consistent with all the authors' argu-ments and is perhaps indicative of the political economy of academia. The result is a kind of ethnography noir wherein the so- phisticated conceptual points and the Ayoreo testimonies ofpainful and violent episodes intersperses with some now and then places of solace and beauty of ethnographic encounter (e.g., children playing quietly in a circle, [p. 162]). Fromthis, the troubled ethnographer emerges maybe as an anti-hero or the sole hero. Overall, this book raises a sustainedcritique of some anthropological assumptions and proindige-nous advocacy but does not leave much room or necessarycare to contextualize positive, historical, and existing po-litical alternatives (e.g., national indigenous movement byfar predated the 2000s, as wrongly indicated by the author[p. 208]). Bessire could achieve this by including more of thepresent efforts of Ayoreo people and organizations to takeon their political representation and land struggle as part oftheir \"becoming.\" REFERENCES CITED Grant, Suzanne 2006 Becoming Similar: Knowledge, Sociality and the Aesthetic of Relatedness amongst the Nivacle of the Paraguayan Chaco.

It is also a window into the rich and dynamic culture of India, perhaps replicated in varying scales in its other urban centers. In its theoretical and methodological approach, the book is a multidisciplinary work, written from the holistic perspective of anthropology. It is an argument for the role of ethnography to do more than simply show why policies, physical structures, or institutions fail or succeed due to the technical structures and policies driving them. In this case, water infrastructures are embedded in the sociopolitical and material landscape and provide new insights into the influence of culture on the nature and functioning of markets. Bjorkman shows with unrelenting detail how urban development in Mumbai is about making the city, as the author repeatedly points out, a \"world-class city\" (a common parlance in Mumbai) like Shanghai or Singapore by adopting a free market approach of a unique kind. The immediate goal is urban development and how to incentivize the private sector to undertake this. In return, instead of monetary compensation for acquired land and for undertaking construction, landowners and builders are compensated in kind, giving them rights to build above and beyond heights and densities allowed by the city develop- ment plan. Markets are traditionally attached to things that have value; water, for example, is everywhere attached to land. However, in Mumbai, the process of \"marketization of development rights\" disconnects this traditional linkage; to \"release\" water to move to higher value areas of the city, the market unbundled the land-bound water structure of the city from its regulations, diverting it to high-value producer services such as banking and high tech, transforming the city into a global landscape and delinking water from people and places. This leaves existing communities in some locations (as well as new communities in other locations) without access to water or with an inadequate or untimely supply. This market paradigm is countervailed by the richly detailed culture and community interventions at variouslevels analyzed theoretically in a well-researched chapter, in particular by using Karl Polanyi's theory of embeddedness of economic structure in socials systems. At the heart of this ethnography is the cultural and po- litical dynamics of access to urban water. Water everywhere is highly contested, and often the reason for this is attributed to its scarcity. Here, it is not scarce; it is about use\u2014not through some long- or short-term strategy but in a uniquely Mumbai way. Water supplied from a reservoir, delivered un- equally, establishes a disparity in upstream and downstream access; the physical structure of \"pipes\" that are costly, bulky, labor intensive, and time consuming to construct sink into swamps while buoyantly flowing through bedrock neigh- borhoods; and, nally, pipes buried underground are full of possibility for the dark side. Water is a resource in a neigh- borhood that is simultaneously a hydraulic, administrative, and political unit; and Lisa Bj \u00a8orkman documents the progress of interventions by communities and NGOs, administrators, and formally elected politicians to get water; the micropolit- ical motivations to give water; and how the physical system is \"thrown into shambles\" according to the irrigation bureau- cracy in its attempt to send water by breaking standard sched- ules and even structural capacities to keep up with ordinary demand (as well as to maintain the \"world-class\" functions of Mumbai). The anthropological approach to micropolitics as- sumes that all actors in a community are competing for scarce resources (water) are politicians and that culture shapes their style through norms and their manipulation through ac- ceptable and meaningful pragmatism. In this approach, the community of participants, including formal ofce-holding politicians, are shaped by the culture, with of course differ- ent motivations. An interesting but unanswered question is, what is unique and acceptable to Indian politicians and what is circumscribed by the rules and procedures of organiza- tions (in this case the water department)? This book touches on multiple dimensions of water and micropolitics to give a window into the diversity, complexity, and dynamic nature of water and pipes in Mumbai on its road to becoming a \"world-class\" city just as India itself struggles with this com- plexity as a national democracy. As part of more centralized and controlled political systems, Shanghai and Singapore are not really in competition with Mumbai, but it is possible that they will have their own paradigms of pipe politics. The subject of water is multidisciplinary in approach and is best viewed through the holistic lens of anthropology. This work is a rare addition to the literature.Book Reviews 653 A Prophetic Trajectory: Ideologies of Place, Time and Belonging in an Angolan Religious Movement by Ruy (CEBRAP) A Prophetic Trajectory is about power and belief among people who endeavor to live what for them are exemplary Christian lives. It tells the story of the transformation of a small group of Christian believers in the Portuguese colony of Angola in the 1950s and 1960s into a transcontinental corporation by the early 2000s.Through the lens of the ethnography and history of this unique Angolan Christian church\u2014the Tokoist Church\u2014it shows that since the end of WWII new institutions and ideologies have changed perceptions and understandings of the self in relation to territoriality and temporality that challenge existing conceptualizations of \"modernity\" in anthropology. For instance, membership in religious organizations has become an alternative framework of identity and belonging to citizenship in the nation-state. One is not born a Tokoist. One learns to inhabit the world as a Tokoist. It is a religious experience that is a formidable challenge on both ethnographic and theoretical grounds. At its core is the relationship of each individual believer with the \"prophetic biography\" of the founder of the church: Sim ao Toko (1918-1984). This relationship is mediated by an ideological apparatus made of moral pre- cepts, prescriptive norms for proper behavior and appear- ance, a strict schedule of social and spiritual activities, and an institutional mechanism of \"remembrance.\" \"Prophetic biography\" refers to the narrative of the life of Sim ao Toko as a charismatic leader and public gure, as opposed to his life as a man, a husband, and a father. After Sim ao Toko's death, this narrative created a posthumous continuity in the Tokoist religious experience. Through the reading of his letters, the singing of hymns composed in his lifetime, and the transcription of his ongoing revelations through spirit mediums ( vates), Sim ao Toko's charisma has been made into a real \"spiritual presence,\" a memory that is also a potential generative of hope. This continuity notwithstanding, being a Tokoist during Simao Toko's lifetime versus afterward is not quite the same thing. It is a difference that matters to some more than to others, causing a rift in the church leadership. Sim ao Toko, for instance, was very concerned with Satan (p. 39). What has happened to Satan in the Tokoist belief and eschatologicalnarrative after his death? A Prophetic Trajectory says little about Satan in the Tokoist moral imagination or about the ways in which Sim ao Toko's spirit coexists with other agencies on the fringes of the Tokoist world. Questions such as these were perhaps beyond the scope of the book. \"Trajectory\" is a textual strategy for answering a question: How does the history of the Tokoist church illustrate the way in which charismatic leadership outlives its individual bearers through a process of routinization, bureaucratization, and institutionalization? It is therefore a selective reading of the history of Tokoism and of the Tokoist history. Its focus is on issues of authority and leadership, normative aspects of church life, and a corporate identity and memory from a perspective that is almost exclusively that of the male leadership of the church. Photographs are an eloquent example of the relevance of what has been neglected as ethnographic evidence. Used as mere illustrations of what the verbal narrative already says, they show a women's history that otherwise remains \"hidden\" between the lines of the printed text. The verbal narrative tells the story of the Tokoist church as if it were the exclusive ownership of its male leadership. Photographs show women singing and praying (pp. 121, 129). They reveal the Tokoist church as a church that is also theirs. The photograph on page 56 is the most arresting. It shows a young Simao Toko with Rosa Maria, his wife. Their marriage almost coincided with the ofcial founding of the Tokoist church in 1949. The two histories can hardly be separated. But Rosa Maria is an insignicant other in the book on grounds that most of her life she was \"bedridden with mental illness\" (pp. 86, 90, 100, n. 7). This arbitrary exclusion is contrary not only to the photographic evidence of her signicance but also to a Tokoist understanding of \"charisma\" and \"illness\" as mutually constitutive (pp. 47-48). Insignicant the of their younger daughter: Esperanc \u00b8a (which means \"hope\" in Portuguese) on page 68 but Esmeralda on page 196. Also there is Ilda, their elder daughter. She is allowed to speak in the conclusion but only in order to be silenced again (pp. 197-199). Born in the 1950s, while her parents lived in exile in remote corners of the Portuguese colonial empire, she is a witness to late colonial violence as experienced by a child. In sum, A Prophetic Trajectory adds to existing anthropo- logical understandings of the formation of group identities around shared beliefs that are an alternative to ethnicity654 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 and nationality. But just as the wooden frame around Sim ao Toko's portrait on the cover conceals as much as it reveals the \"bigger picture\" of which it is part, the choice of theanthropology of Christianity as an overarching theoretical framework limits an understanding of Tokoist identity in a context of haunting histories of violence. On the Doorstep of Europe: Asylum and Citizenship in Greece by Heath Cabot Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2014. 272 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12628 Elisabeth Kirtsoglou Durham University On the Doorstep of Europe is a compelling ethnographic analysis of the asylum system in Greece based on extensive anthropological research carried out in Athens. The locus of the ethnography is an asylum advocacy NGO, but the book manages to accomplish much more than an accurate documentation of the asylum-seeking process. Heavily in- fluenced by the archetypical structure, form, and analytical potential of the ancient Greek tragedy, the author engages in a perpetual search for catharsis, an almost Deleuzian ethic of transformation of the negative into positive. The protagonists of her ethnography, like tragic heroes, are forced to ght with structures of power and violence well beyond their control. They sometimes crumble under the weight of these structures but often also manage to outwit them. In seven carefully crafted chapters, we learn about the struggles of the NGO lawyers who know only too well that for every single person they manage to help, there are nu- merous others whom they have failed. We also learn about the struggles of the asylum seekers who have to tell com- pelling stories and sometimes become \"good actors\" in order to t legal patterns of victimhood or to satisfy the \"social aesthetics of eligibility\" and to come across as \"real\" refugees. Underpinning these dramatic experiences is the struggle of the anthropologist to reclaim the agency of her informants. The transformative potential of tragedy is a faithful theoret- ical ally in Heath Cabot's effort to nd the possibilities of resistance within indeterminacy. The book is critical of the ways in which humanitarian practice incorporates systems of governance and supports the production of a problematic hierarchy of migrant subjectivities. However, as the author states, this work is not intended as a critique of aid workers but as an attempt to understand both their powerfulness and their powerlessness vis- `a-vis national and supranational regimes of rights-based protection. The relation between those \"local\" struggles and the international forces at play is an emphasis that we miss. Athens, a geopolitically and economically peripheral capital, is not a self-containedentity, and the power asymmetries Cabot's informants are forced to negotiate daily are not engineered locally. The author remains aware of this, and she eclectically weaves into her narrative the role and importance of supranational entities\u2014like the EU\u2014in the production of marginality. The international and historical dimensions of displacement and its management, however, do not systematically inform her argument. The emphasis of the book is rmly placed on \"the citizens of Athens\" and their efforts to subvert and to undermine multiple systems of exclusion and limitation. The bittersweet ethnographic narrative never loses site of the tragic experiences of asylum seekers. At the same time, the author carefully mines her eld notes for those important, performatively powerful moments, such as when Sarah from Ghana, Mahmud from Sudan, and Azar from Afghanistan refuse and resist the structures of power and vio- lence or the stereotypes of victimhood immanent in the very systems supposedly designed to protect them from becoming victims. Cabot's careful analysis of the constraints imposed by exacerbating bureaucracies, the tenuous borders between legality and illegality, and the multiple audiences that the asylum seekers must satisfy transforms those constraints into possibilities. In a rather Butlerian fashion\u2014although the book does not rely heavily on Butler\u2014indeterminacy becomes the very eld where subjects resist (and reify) violence in its manifold forms and faces. The \"doorstep of Europe\"\u2014or the \"prison of Europe,\" as Bashir from Afghanistan calls it\u2014is a world where both persons and things have the capacity to govern. Ofcial documents acquire a life of their own and become material technologies of governance that t the \"legal\" into the \"illegal,\" rendering their boundaries porous and especially difcult to determine. At the same time, the ambiguity of such documents\u2014like the ambiguity of all bureaucracy that surrounds asylum seeking in Greece\u2014allows individuals to navigate through the cracks and the back alleys of the system and to nd spaces and ways to pursue their life projects in an episodic and yet rewarding fashion. The eloquent ethnogra- phy allows us to join them in this journey. We celebrate with them as they decide to marry and make a family. We smile in ethnographic complicity as they recount their canny stories of successful asylum applications on the basis of \"cooked\" evidence. We worry when as minors they investigateBook Reviews 655 the possibility of applying for asylum and then suddenly disappear, only to be reminded by the author that this is a legitimate\u2014though perhaps not intentional\u2014choice. We stand in unison when they are transformed from \"victims\" to activists who represent others or go on hunger strikeand win small but important political battles. Ultimately, we get to know them not as strangers, aliens, victims, or deportables but as citizens of Athens\u2014a city that struggles to reconcile violence with the possibility of producing new and excitingly less essentialist forms of belonging. A Landscape of Travel: The Work of Tourism in Rural Ethnic China by Jenny Chio Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2014. 304 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12660 Yujie Zhu Australian National University Studies in the anthropology of tourism focus on tourism communication in form of hosts and guests (Smith 1977). Such division often oversimplies the multiplicity of ethnicity and the complexity of how rural tourism in China is created, shaped, and negotiated. In the ethnographic monograph A Landscape of Travel , Chio successfully looks beyond the classication into hosts and guests and presents fascinating insights into a more fluid situation. Through rich engagement with two villages in China\u2014Upper Jidao in Guizhou and Ping'an in Guangxi\u2014and beyond, the study takes a fresh look at the impact of tourism on the ethnicity and identity of villagers and interrelation between leisure and labor of rural tourism in China. Rural and ethnic family life is transformed into a tourism product to satisfy Chinese urban tourists' imagination. Such a form of tourism echoes the emerging divisions between rural and urban ethnic minorities and Han people, as well as between the poor and the rich, that are embedded in the wider context of national tourism and the ethnic classication project in China. A Landscape of Travel offers two analytical tools to un- derstand how individuals negotiate their everyday lives in a tourism context. First, Chio encourages readers to view people as being on the move instead of being disconnected from the world outside their isolated village. By tracing vil- lagers who work in the cities as migrants and later return to their home as current tourism providers, Chio explores their dynamic interactions with the outside world and their ev- eryday confrontations within the community. The former's experiences, knowledge, and skills allow them to understand the motivations and expectations of urban tourists. Second, Chio's engagement with the notion of landscape motivates the readers' senses, in particular through visuality as an ana- lytic. Through offering a wide range of examples, from the construction of traditional wood architecture and terraced elds to the sweet talk between tourists-photographers and ethnic female \"models,\" Chio invites the readers tounderstand how the tourism stage is formulated and negoti- ated through the details of visual investigation. The integration of mobility and visuality adds texture and complexity to the question of how ethnic tourism becomes commonplace in the daily lives of Chinese ethnic minority villagers. Although ethnic tourism creates similar images national wide, local villagers still endeavor to develop their own specialties ( tese) when accommodating urban demands. Chio very well illustrates the process of \"authentication\" of tourism products as a consistent negotiation between villagers and the external world. Through introducing three forms of distances (time, space, and culture), Chio illustrates how tourism imaginaries were shaped and negotiated within and between different groups. The tourist image of \"differences\" is not solely created by the hosts but, rather, is constituted by all involved people. More importantly, tourism not only affects villagers as an impetus of economic development but also becomes a new form of culture that influences the local value system, expectations, and visions of life. Through recording an anthropological experiment in which tourism stakeholders were invited from one village to another, Chio concludes the study by highlighting the complex nature of tourism. This experi- mental trip delivers the message that tourism is far from a simple form of consumption and economic exchange\u2014it is a more sophisticated way of searching for a better life. On the whole, Chio's work is theoretically dense and empirically rich. Chio successfully demonstrates the com- plex layers and interrelations between different actors in rural tourism in China. While the power of ethnography has been well utilized to show the depths of the story, the study could have been enriched and expanded even more in two dimensions. First, it would have been useful to have had more discussion on the fluidity of identity and ethnicity of individual actors. Such fluidity is not only based on their mobility and interrelation with others but is also reflected in the habitus, the affects of memory, and their vision of the world. Second, it would have been interesting to add another layer of complexity by involving the international policies and norms. For instance, how the global concepts such as656 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 \"heritage,\" \"sustainable development,\" and \"ecomuseums\" influence the value system of the local rural development during their encounter with outsider NGOs and within their own community. In conclusion, A Landscape of Travel makes a ne addition to the existing anthropological literature on tourism. The book moves beyond theoretical abstractions to the com- plexity and richness of reality. The monograph is a valuable resource for a range of educational purposes, including in undergraduate classes on the anthropology of tourism and for perusal by postgraduates who are researching tourismin China. It is highly recommended that readers also watch Chio's documentary lm, /ZdZ1736/ZdZ4322/ZdZ892Peasant Family Happi- ness (Chio 2013), as a vivid complement to the book.

Christensen Lanham: Lexington, 2015. 182 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12623 Tom Gill Meiji Gakuin University This readable and thought-provoking study of alcoholism in Japan revolves around a fundamental dilemma confronting Japanese alcoholics in their attempts to achieve sobriety. They live in a society that celebrates drinking (p. 42). Their alcoholism is not a violation of social norms but a taking of that norm to \"an unsustainable extreme\" (p. 98). When they pledge abstinence, they are not just ghting their own dis- ease but also the heavily enforced expectations of their own society. For men particularly, their identity is challenged by their inability to control their drinking and even more so by their refusal to drink after going into treatment. That cultural confrontation is further dramatized by the character of the available support systems. Most alcoholics turn either to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or to the home- grown variant, Dansh \u00afukai (Abstinence Association). The AA in Japan makes no concessions to local cultural differences. The central text is a direct translation of \"the Big Book,\" and the program is based on the famous 12 steps to recovery. This program is imbued with the spirit of Protestant Christianity, and four of the steps specically reference God, albeit with the rider \"as we understood him.\" The insistence on admit- ting one's own inability to recover and relying instead on a \"higher power\" is a deeply unfamiliar concept in a country where most people describe themselves as nonreligious and where the principal religions of Buddhism and Shinto lack the personalized God of Christianity. Christensen observes that the unfamiliar spiritual territory of an AA meeting occasionally can cause tensions, as in one case when an elderly man got up and condemnedt h em e e t i n ga saw a s t eo ft i m eb e c a u s e\" i ts t i n k so f Christianity\" (p. 57). While that is an extreme example, Christensen emphasizes that people who attend these groups are called upon not just to renounce drinking but also to adopt an alien way of thinking about their lives. The ideology of Dansh \u00afukai is somewhat different. For example, the Dansh \u00afukai sobriety oath (pp. 150-151) makes no divine reference. However, it does share with AA the stress on the surrender of the self, with its rst line reading: \"We admit that alone we do not have the strength and are powerless over alcohol\" (p. 151). The Dansh \u00afukai focuses a quasi-religious reverence on its founder, Harushige Matsumura (1905-1970), whose portrait is often displayed at meetings (p. 138) and whose 50 selected quotations are treated as a key text (p. 22). Christensen observes that many of Matsumura's dicta are similar to AA maxims, and he consistently stresses the similarities between the two groups rather than their differences\u2014 similarities grounded in their spiritual approach to self-improvement. That said, several other signicant differences emerge in the text: the Dansh \u00afukai meetings, unlike AA ones, are often attended by family members as well as the alcoholics themselves, for example, and Christensen notes that doctors tend to encourage married men to try Dansh \u00afukai but send women and unmarried men to AA (p. 53). Christensen only fleetingly references the work of Richard Chenhall and Tomofumi Oka, who specically describe Dansh \u00afukai's approach as being imbued with Zen Buddhism (e.g., Oka and Chenhall 2014), and I question his reluctance to distinguish between the two groups. This, and the lack of references to the extensive Japanese-language literature on alcoholism, would be my two main reservations about the book.Book Reviews 657 The ideal outcome of participation in these self-help groups would be a new enlightenment, leading to a sober and happy life. Christensen nds such cases rare, though he does cite one at length (pp. 107-108). The majority of par- ticipants relapse into alcoholism\u2014Christensen twice quotes healthcare practitioners as putting the gure at 80 percent (pp. 59, 110)\u2014and even for those who do manage to main- tain sobriety, happiness may be more elusive. Christensen cites numerous cases of reformed alcoholics who feel unable to tell their friends and workmates about their situation and engage in desperate subterfuges to conceal the truth (e.g., p. 90). Stressing the deeply rooted \"sanctity\" of drinking in Japanese culture, Christensen remarks that the \"refusal to drink . . . becomes an affront to this sanctity\" (p. 28). State- ments by men at sobriety meetings often express a nostalgic yearning for the days when they could still have a drink and the grimness of having to endure without it (p. 74). Hence the book's subtitle\u2014Christensen's subjects are \"suffering sobriety,\" not enjoying it.As that statement suggests, Christensen's main focus is on the problematic nature of the self-help groups discussed: trapped in a society that does not acknowledge alcoholism as a medical condition, their clients are asked to take on a new spiritual view of their lives that leaves them even more at odds with that society. Despite numerous genuflections to the excellent work done by AA and Dansh \u00afukai, Chris- tensen's main message, based on attending over 200 AA and Dansh \u00afukai meetings (p. 16), is that their institutional cul- ture is incompatible with mainstream Japanese society and that this incompatibility causes even more suffering for their already troubled clients.

Becoming Inummarik: Men's Lives in an Inuit Community by Peter Collings Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2014. 424 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12627 Robert Jarvenpa University at Albany, SUNY Peter Collings's highly informative book is based on four years of ethnographic eld research spread across two decades (1992-2012) in the Inuit community of Ulukhak- tok on Victoria Island in the western Canadian arctic. His goal is to understand the lives of Inuit men, particularly how younger men \"get through\" or negotiate the life course from their adolescent teen years into adulthood and middle age. As the book's apt title implies, this involves becoming inum- marik , a real or genuine person in proper balance with his or her surroundings and fellow humans. Coupled with this notion is ihuma , meaning knowledge, reason, or wisdom. Much of Collings's penetrating analysis explores how these two fundamental Inuit concepts interconnect and inform men's life experiences in the contemporary era. Collings is tracking the rst generation of men who were born in the context of permanent village life in the late 1950s and 1960s. Over ensuing years and decades, an increase in access to Canadian government services, social assistance, public housing, and wage labor in the growing center of Ulukhaktok created new challenges for these younger men in terms of balancing settled village life with expectationsfor maintaining at least some traditional livelihood strategies on the land. Because Collings is approximately the same age as the 22 men he befriended and followed as a study sample for nearly 20 years, he is in a unique position to document and to reflect upon the dynamics involved. The book opens with a lengthy account of the author's return to Ulukhaktok in 2007 after a brief period \"outside.\" In making his way from the airport to his lodging, Collings repeatedly encounters friends and acquaintances who stop to chat and reconnect. He also picks up supplies at the Co-op and Northern stores, visits the hamlet government building to check on housing arrangements, talks with a friend repairing an ATV, and is invited inside a family's home for a meal of duck and into another for tea and a game of cribbage. In narrating his walk through the village, Collings reveals his gift for capturing the ne-grained realities of life as lived and distilling ethos from a myriad of mundane occurrences unfolding around him. What might have been a brief, uneventful stroll through the village becomes eight hours of densely packed, meaning-laden social interaction. In lieu of conventional pseudonyms, key characters in this study are composites constructed from the lives of many individuals. Rather than a chronological or linear presen- tation of information, discussion proceeds episodically or thematically. Included are vivid accounts of the late-night ritual of driving ATVs and snowmobiles around the village;658 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 musk ox hunts; watching televised hockey games; making repairs to houses, camps, and vehicles; and playing bingo, among many other scenarios. As a highly active participant (and observer), Collings clearly situates himself in the flow of these events and, thereby, candidly charts his own pitfalls, ethical dilemmas, enlightenment, and progress as an anthro- pologist. In the process, he crafts a compelling blend of ethnography and reflexive eldwork primer. Evocative and informative thick description is interwoven with insightful theorizing about aging, maleness, and the life course pro- cess. His writing is exemplary in its clarity, unencumbered by obscure jargon or convoluted word games. In one scenario, Collings accompanies Simon Iqaluk on a fall trip to hunt seals and close up his father's summer camp. While the author learns important lessons about hunting and traveling on the land and sea, he is also exposed to the complexities of Ulukhaktok's' settlement history, the self- consciousness and reluctance of younger people to speak Innuinnaqtun , the local Inuit dialect, and the limited abilities of and opportunities for younger men in hunting and living on the land. At the same time, the local culture idealizes older people as truly knowledgeable hunters and the lastgeneration of \"traditional\" Inuit. The profound tension be- tween younger men's upbringing and ties to village life and their efforts, however attenuated, to prove their worthiness and provide for their families by sporadic hunting and shing forays emerges repeatedly and poignantly throughout the book. Despite what appear to be overwhelming social and eco- nomic transformations, including mining exploration and development, guided tourist hunting, and a wage-labor gov- ernment and service sector that employs many more Inuit women than men, Collings argues convincingly that these new surroundings have not signicantly altered the process of becoming inummariit or maturing into genuine persons. That is because the achievement of wisdom and maturity remain largely a cognitive matter rather than a product of static physical, social, or economic markers. Would a for- mal life course analysis of Inuit men and women support or modify this interpretation? Perhaps future research will tell. In the meantime, anyone interested in men and maleness, coming of age, ethnographic methods and ethics, hunting societies, Inuit culture, and the contemporary Arctic will be richly rewarded by reading Becoming Inummarik . Twins Talk: What Twins Tell Us about Person, Self, and Society by Dona Lee Davis Athens: Ohio University Press, 2014. 312 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12657 William Viney Durham University Herself a Dona Lee Davis has interviewed iden- tical (monozygotic) twin pairs to demonstrate the performed and negotiated quality of twin identities in a society largely organized by, and structured for, singleton expressions of self and sibling experience. With chapters organized \"Bond,\" \"Culture,\" and \"Twindividuals\"\u2014Davis weaves her own experience of being a twin and of attending conferences such as the International Congress of Twin Studies into material gathered through her interviews with 23 twin pairs at the annual Twins Festival at Twinsburg, Ohio. She is open about the pleasurable complications of describing herself a \"native\" (p. 33) alongside her twin informants, claiming a level of access to her subject that those born without a direct experience of the lifelong condition of being a twin would struggle to fabricate. Davis's affective, autoethnographic proximity to her interviewees is at once an engaging and revealing feature of this book. Consequently, her presentation of twinship isentangled in the desire to validate an outsider's perspective with an insider's\u2014to provide a record of twin personhood that has been collaboratively \"voiced\" into anthropological signicance, alongside the analytic desire to bring coherence to and amplify those voices beyond the economically and politically specic time and space of their festival origins. Despite aiming to \"normalize twinship\" (p. 7), the gestationally and experientially exclusive position adopted by Davis is one that serves to extend the long and complex history of phenomenological mystery, exoticism, and categorical indistinction attributed to twinship Peek 2011; Rivers 1906; Turner 1997[1969]) and in broader works of sociology and cultural theory (Bacon 2010; Schwartz 1996; Stewart 2003; Viney 2014). The difference is that while these works are largely concerned with how singletons have dened twins, Twins Talk focuses on how twins co-produce \"self\" and \"identity\" within and without the twin dyad. Perhaps it is necessary that Davis locates twins at numerous cultural and psychological \"fault- lines,\" with the inside-outsider structure of the author's analytic position made symmetrical with the ambivalently distributed identities that it brings to light. Davis concludesBook Reviews 659 that she and twins are counterhegemonic subjects, able to refuse dominant notions of body or selfhood determined byWestern individualism. Twins Talk seeks to listen to how pairs talk their way through interpersonal relationships, performing the complex \"self work\" (pp. 8-9) of narrativized becoming that are structurally occluded by biomedical research projects.This contrast nds traction through the selective ways thatDavis approaches biomedical twin research as a eld repletewith what she calls \"blindspots\" (p. 101, 170): the failureto speak about twins in terms that recognize an expandedand expansive sense of autonomy and personhood. She isparticularly critical of researchers who use the language ofthe instrumentation or thingliness of twins\u2014to stress theprimacy of genes and genetics to twin identities, for exam-ple. By raising the controversial and idiosyncratic work ofThomas J. Bouchard and David Teplica as exemplary, Davissuggests a view of contemporary twin research dominatedby a crude scientism that \"exists above and beyond culture\"(p. 173). This largely ignores the rich culture of dissent thathas left a 140-year-old tradition of using twins in medicalresearch no more internally consistent or univocal in contentthan \"anthropology.\" Though Davis makes passing referenceto the novel and postgenomic epistemologies, technologies,and methods that have revolutionized twin research in thelast ten years (Bell and Spector 2011; van onehand, and Davis's benevolently sophisticated conception ofculture, on the other hand. We are not told why approx-imately 1.5 million twins should volunteer to be treated as\"zombies or performing monkeys\" (p. 37) or the reasonsbehind the alienation, misrepresentation, and reductivenessthat Davis complains are endemic to twin research in thelife sciences. It might be telling that these feelings arescarcely registered among her interviewees. More needsto be understood about why twins volunteer for healthresearch, how molecular and molar relations can or cannotcome into the public domain, and why twins continue to beused to explore an incredible range of traits, behaviors, anddiseases. There is no doubt that Twins Talk is an invaluable record of a particularly voluble minority of festival-going twins who are willing, eager, and capable of presenting themselves as talking twins, sympathetic to their biographies being raisedto anthropological signicance. Davis has worked hard to translate the specicity of her talking partners so that theirexperience may resonate among those voices that have notbeen recorded in this study. \"There is one thing twins knowhow to do,\" she says, developing a metaphor introduced by one set of her talking partners, \"it is to interchangeably lead and lean while sharing the stage\" (p. 27). Yet thepresumed heroism of transforming silence into speechought not be at the cost of understanding why some twinsprefer not to talk\u2014neither leading nor leaning nor evenidentifying themselves as \"twins\" above all else and before allothers.

The book is a veritable cornucopia of delights for ethnographers and guitar buffs alike, which in the case of Dudley and this reviewer are one and the same. We are treated to a forensic analysis of the very many interviews conducted by Dudley with some of the leading guitars makers in North America today. The roller-coaster aspect of the ride through acoustic guitar country comes in the form of the rapidity with which new interview material is injected into the text, moving quickly between informants. The ups and downs, and twists and turns of careers conducted on a knife's edge, amply convey guitar making (or lutherie) in North America as a risky business. It is also a practice fuelled by obsession, whose anecdotes and stories are of mythological proportions containing scenes of death and rebirth, heroic wrestling matches in the workshop, hauntings by ghosts of empire, and the fear of obsolescence, plus the newly emerging threat of dwindling material resources. In this epic tale, \"builders' sense of freedom and national exceptionalism glosses over their complicated relationship to history and the political and economic shifts under way at the time they entered lutherie. As a countercultural project, the lutherie movement sought to revive a craft tradition that was both 'preindustrial' and 'industrial' at the very moment that North America was careering toward a postindustrial future.\" [p. 21] In a series of riveting interviews linked throughout six main chapters, a generation of guitar makers (mostly from the late 1960s onward) tell of their plight to es- tablish themselves in a changing market place that con- tinues to present enormous challenges to all of them, whether they work alone, work as part of a large corporation, or are positioned somewhere in between these two poles. Artisanal values are contested, and makers ne- gotiate their place and price within a complex and tense value system. Here artisanship and artisanal knowledge ght for their place in a world of high-tech commerciality where some of the larger corporations use computerized machinery in the production of their guitars. A generation of, ostensi- bly, countercultural makers reveal the details of their social,moral, aesthetic, and sensual worlds from the inside out. Yet Dudley constantly reminds us of the greater world they inhabit. For instance, artisanal guitar making is increasingly at risk as the traditional tonewoods from which guitars are made come under strict scrutiny, control, and legislation. Not only is this book a remarkably well crafted and erudite account of a signicant and important era within the history guitar making, it is also to be celebrated that a scholar of Dudley's background and expertise has decided to put a critical plow into the eld of guitar studies and musical instrument studies. Dudley provides us with the \"broad picture\" called for in Margaret Kartomi's seminal publication On Concepts and Classications of Musical Instruments (1990) while also furthering the project set out in Arjun Appadurai's (1986) The Social Life of Things . Material culture studies remain rmly anchored in socioeconomic anthropology, providing a vantage point from which Dudley is able to offer an interpretation of the effect of a wide range of values and beliefs that endure within the artisanal cultural worldview, including notions of \"the gift\" and \"gift exchange,\" as well as to provide welcome solid purchase on the everyday and domestic issues at hand at the points where other studies of musical instruments and crafts traditions tend to fall short. As noted in her online faculty biography, Dudley's ethnographic research \"focuses on cultures of work that are, by default or design, at odds with contemporary capitalism.\" To this end, she has explored deindustrialization in the U.S. Rustbelt, the farm crisis in the Midwest, African American land loss in the rural South, and now, in this book, artisanal craft production in North America, where guitar makers navigate the wider world of neoliberalist politics and economics\u2014a global cultural economy\u2014as it surrounds and nds its way into the workshop. Artisans might therefore dream of becoming a well-known guitar maker of independent means. While we nd out what happened to those whose dreams came true, one wonders what happened to those whose dreams did not come to fruition. This book is timely. In-depth ethnographic studies of the guitar and its makers (see, e.g., Kies 2013; Pace 2015) are beginning to appear. But Dudley's study of North American guitar makers is likely to set the benchmark for anthropolog- ical scholarship in this area for some time to come. Through this immensely important contribution to the literature, Dudley provides us with a nely honed set of tools to take into the eld as we begin to study in more detail the role, affect, and meaning of the cultures of the guitar around the world.Book Reviews 661 REFERENCES CITED Appadurai, Arjun, ed. 1986 The Social Life of Things: Commodities in Cul- tural Perspective.

The Anthropology of Intentions: Language in a World of Others by Alessandro Duranti Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015. 237 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12617 Vincent Crapanzano CUNY Graduate Center During his rst eldwork in Western Samoa in the early 1980s, Alessandro Duranti observed that Samoans are con- cerned not with actors' intentions but with the consequences of their acts. His observation became a dominant leitmotif in his research and writings\u2014including his latest book, a collec- tion of essays, chronologically arranged, which extend, elab- orate, and rene his initial insight. His goal \"is to support an ethnographic and interactional perspective on intentions as cognitive, emotional, and embodied dispositions always em- bedded in an intersubjective world of experience\" and to cor- rect the ethnocentric assumptions that have characterized, among others, such analytic philosophers as Paul Grice, John Austin, and especially John Searle (p. 1). Although Duranti's critique of Searle's understanding of intention and the prior- ity he gives it is well taken, at least from an anthropological perspective, it limits, at least initially, the range of Duranti's own position on intention. Duranti's recent assumption of what he takes to be a Husserlian perspective has, however, broadened his views considerably. Unlike Searle's continued focus on the individual, even in his discussion of group intentions, Duranti focuses on intersubjectivity. He stresses the intersubjective dimension in Edmund Husserl's (later) phe- nomenology without adequately addressing the role\u2014the inevitable role\u2014of the individual's intentionally structured consciousness, which remains at the core of Husserl's phenomenology. It is nally an individual's consciousness that grasps\u2014responds to\u2014the subjectivity of the intended other. Part of the problem of attending to Husserl's thought is that his position continually, if subtly, changed over the course of his numerous, often unnished, publications. Still, it would seem that Husserl's initial understandingof intention differs signicantly from that of Searle and his school; indeed, from Duranti's research on Samoa, political oratory, and jazz improvisation (all three treated with considerable insight in this monograph); and, of course, from popular understanding in Euro-American culture. Intention was, for Husserl, the essential directionality of consciousness (toward an object), a directionality that could be turned on itself\u2014on how it intended its object, as a percept, for example, or an image, in a loving or impatient manner, as endowed with intention. With time, Husserl came to appreciate that the intended object of consciousness was not necessarily without a countereffect on the intending consciousness; hence there was a possibility of its affecting that consciousness and of integrating, however tangentially, intersubjectivity into the phenomenological project. But lurking behind this intersubjectivity, as I have argued, is the terror of solipsism (at least in modernity and postmodernity), despite Husserl's attempt, and Martin Heidegger's too, to sidestep it. Whether or not my reading of Duranti and Husserl is correct, one wishes that he devoted as much critical attention to Husserl as he did to Searle. Any study that abstracts a single \"mentalist\" concept (Note my ethnocentrism here) from its theoretical and ex- periential surround draws in other concepts and approaches. Duranti's ethnography is rich, particularly the Samoan. He comes to appreciate the role of social (political) \"etiquette\" (my word) in the Samoans' avoidance of considering the other's intention, but he does not consider the evocative and rhetorical role of silence (taken qualitatively) in this etiquette. Silence can have enormous pragmatic effect. It can, for example, indicate the unsaid, the unsayable, discretion, and indeterminacy and serve as an (effective) background to the consequential judgments Samoans are wont to make. I am not questioning Duranti's perception but suggesting another dimension to the \"anthropology662 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 of intention\" he puts forward. Indeed, the rhetoric of intention, including even \"unconscious intentions,\" has slipped from psychoanalysis into everyday discourse. One of Duranti's most interesting essays looks at how the missionaries' translation of \"promise\" was integrated (if but askew) into contemporary Samoan and its possible effect on their articulation of intention and the possible com- mitment it presages. One would like to know more about how the Samoans understand the word\u2014its force, not just illocutionary but moral. Duranti does not discuss linguistic ideology and axiology and the way it influences attitudes toward intention and \"intention.\" There is so much more that could be addressed in Duranti's work\u2014his empiricism, his conversational analy- sis, his emphasis on timing, coordination, and improvisation, and his advocacy of a contextually sensitive continuum approach to intention. Perhaps the most important is the power presupposed in attributions of intention, how they are perceived in ethnopsychological, ethnomoral, or other ethnotheorizations.But, I would like to conclude with a discussion of the structure of The Anthropology of Intention \u2014the chronological concatenation of articles devoted to roughly the same con- cerns with which Duranti has struggled over nearly 40 years. His book demonstrates how conceptually difcult anthropol- ogy is, especially when it attempts to address the prevailing philosophical assumptions that have been largely\u2014how to put it?\u2014 naturalized in even the most self-reflective of dis- courses. Yes, at times, Duranti surrenders to some of the clich \u00b4es of one thought fashion or another, but he struggles with them in his reformulations of his previous work. With- out doubt, the most interesting chapter in his book is an exchange of e-mails, often politely critical of his work, with the cognitive scientist Teun van Dijk and the phenomenolog- ical anthropologist Jason Throop, in which the differences between the focus on the individual characteristic of most cognitive science and on intersubjective engagement over time that Duranti advocates are made manifest. It demon- strates the open endedness of research in the human sciences, which can so easily succumb to ideological rigidity. Give a Man a Fish: Reflections on the New Politics of Distribution by James Ferguson Durham: Duke University Press, 2015. 280 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12655 Ilana van Wyk University of Cape Town Like the best kind of anthropology, James Ferguson's latest book, Give a Man a Fish, invites readers to see the world dif- ferently, questions taken-for-granted truisms, and reasserts the signicance of lives considered peripheral to the con- cerns of powerful elites. Thus, while many theorists work- ing on southern Africa seem to agree that unfettered cap- italism and market-based, neoliberal systems of economy and governance have sent the welfare state into retreat, Ferguson claims that concrete developments in the region question such certainties. Indeed, across southern Africa, relatively poor governments have instituted a range of non- contributory social protection schemes that transfer small amounts of cash to the disabled, the elderly, and women caring for children. The scale of these schemes is astounding. In South Africa, where such schemes are arguably most elaborated, more than 30 percent of the population and 44 percent of all households receive some form of direct cash assistance from the state (pp. 5-6). Neighboring countries such as Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, Mozambique have instituted similar cash-transfer programs for pensionersand child-carers while pilot programs have been launched in Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi. Unlike older welfare schemes in the North, these schemes do not police the struc- ture of domestic life and are noncontributory. They also do not rely on large bureaucracies because eligibility is de- termined by minimal conditions such as absolute age, while payouts are often processed through biometric technologies. Cash-transfer schemes are not unique to southern Africa. Ferguson notes that conventional development agencies, such as the World Bank and governments across the globe, are increasingly turning to cash-transfer programs as inexpensive and efcient means to reduce poverty. Apparently, almost a billion people today benet from direct cash transfers. In development practice, this represents a \"quiet revolution\" (p. 13). Whereas older education and skills-training programs were undergirded by a development ethos that, in the hackneyed phrase, \"taught men to sh\" or, more precisely, brought poor people into productive labor, direct cash-transfer schemes \"'give' a man a sh.\" Ferguson suggests that this does not simply mark a change in the pragmatic ways in which development agencies deal with poverty; it could potentially destabilize the development industry's \"politics of production\" (p. 48), radically alter the gendered ways in which dependency is imagined, and mark new ways in which poor people could make claims and mobilize politically.Book Reviews 663 In exploring this \"emergent politics\" (p. 24), which has only the barest of empirical existence at present, the book veers toward a political pamphlet. Ferguson repeatedly asks the reader to be open minded and to cultivate an experi- mental sensibility because a \"politics adequate to the times must be more than a set of normative certainties that one brings to bear on an issue\" (p. 33). He is especially en- thusiastic about the potential progressive politics of Basic Income Grant (BIG) campaigns in Namibia\u2014and, to a lesser extent, in South Africa. While most other cash grants are ostensibly still modelled on the European social state\u2014\"as if that old imagined world of breadwinners and their de- pendents could meaningfully be mapped onto social settings more often characterized by mass structural unemployment, 'informal' livelihoods, and highly fluid domestic groups\" (pp. 17-18)\u2014BIGs promise something different. In a con- text of chronic global labor surpluses, BIGs are not nec- essarily premised on the labor-based (or market) claims of an ascendant proletariat or on the moral claims of needy recipients. Instead, citizens in these campaigns make aggres- sive distributive claims to rightful shares in their country's wealth. Following Peter Kropotkin, Ferguson argues thatthere is no reason why such claims should not be extended to all socially produced wealth. But, unlike the anarchist's hostility to the state, Ferguson argues that the state, despite its exclusionary functions and unequal scal and institutional capacities, is the only realistic mechanism through which genuine distributive outcomes can be achieved. By divining the signs of possible future alternative politics in the flotsam of southern African public life, Ferguson abandons ethnography in favor of anecdotes. In these, he hints that even those at the \"top of the heap\" (p. 114) in southern Africa, the so-called \"tenderpreneurs\" (p. 115) and regular salary earners, depend on distribu- tive handouts. Similarly evocative are short references to the people working in social grant bureaucracies in the re- gion and those who championed (failed) BIG campaigns. There is a traditional ethnography lurking in this mate- rial, but I wonder if it would have the same reach as Give a Man a Fish . In a world of radical inequality and chronic unemployment, few development agents are will- ing to spend time \"translating\" anthropology into action. Ferguson has done this work with the sensibility of an anthropologist. Variations on Uzbek Identity: Strategic Choices, Cognitive Schemas and Political Constraints in Identication Processes by Peter DOI: Institute for Social Anthropology \"Who are the Uzbeks?\" is the question Peter Finke addresses historically, theoretically, and empirically in his book, Variations on Uzbek Identity . The argument of the book is that Uzbek identity is flexible and based on territorial belonging. To explain this, the author takes both diachronic and syn- chronic approaches to study variations and locality of what is now known to be as Uzbek identity. Methodologically, this book is innovative because the author experiments with cognitive tests in addition to presenting rich ethnographic accounts. The shortcomings of limited cognitive tests and their experimental character are well balanced with classical anthropological methods of longitude. Furthermore, the author collected life histories and genealogies in addition to some archival material, local statistical information, and household surveys. The book consists of ve chapters alongside with an introduction and conclusion. The research for the book wasconducted in four regions in Uzbekistan, and each region is introduced separately in one chapter. The introduction of the book deals with the questions of Soviet nation building in the past and post-Soviet nation formation in Uzbekistan. The literature is well balanced through consideration of local scientic debate on Soviet nationalities and Uzbek nation of both Soviet and post-Soviet periods. The rst chapter provides a very detailed and accurate account of the historical past of the region, particularly focusing on the developments that played a decisive role for the formation of nations and nationalism in Central Asia. The following chapters (I, II, III, and IV) cover the following four regions of Uzbekistan \"oasis of Bukhara,\" \"oasis of Khorezm\" (including Karakalpakstan where Karakalpaks live, and this is an autonomous republic within Uzbekistan), Ferghana Valley, and Shahrisabz. Various ethnic groups are carefully examined within each region, and interactions between Uzbeks and other ethnic minorities such as Tadjiks, Kyrgyzs, Russians, and Turkmens are analyzed. All of the four regions are linguistically, politically, economically, and socially important regions to consider. Bukhara \"represents the close intermingling of Uzbeks and Tadjiks\u2014i.e., Turkic664 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 and Iranian speakers\" (p. 65). People who come from this region are depicted as Tadjiks. Khorezm is dominated by Oguz dialect speakers of Uzbek\u2014the most distinct dialect of Uzbek, which is rather closer to Turkmen language than Uzbek. Ferghana Valley is locally notorious for its most reli- gious and activist character compared to other regions, and therefore the title runs as \"conflict inevitable?\" Shahrisabz is the most understudied region in Uzbekistan. The Uzbeks in Shahrisabz \"differentiate themselves in a very peculiar way through both linguistic and cultural markers\" (p. 194). All of the chapters follow the same structure and the same subtitles in order to ease comparison among four regions. The author argues that \"two types of Uzbeks,\" \" yo'kchi and joqchi ,\" are locally \"conceptualized in terms of\" physical features. \"Joqchilar are said to exhibit distinctive Mongolian features\" and are described by non-joqchi as \"less civilised, lazy and simple minded, as having 'more muscles than brains'\" (p. 216). Yokchi then eventually is the contrary of joqchi\u2014non-Mongoloid and civilized, although the denition of yokchi is unclear. This linguistic and physical distinction of Uzbeks into yokchi and joqchi is empirically grounded, and my own research supports this nding. However, it is important to note here that these distinctions are mainly ascribed than self-identied. For instance, majority of yokchi s such as Tashkentis, Ferghana Valley, and other Uzbeks are depicted, for instance, by Khorezmians as those having Mongoloid features and stemming from nomadic tribes, and these views are not necessarily shared by above mentioned yokchi Uzbeks themselves. The author describes four regional variations of Uzbeks in the book. Uzbekistan is administratively divided into 12 regions. Donald Carlisle (1986) differentiated ve elite groups of Uzbeks stemming from ve regions in Uzbekistan\u2014namely, the Northeastern region, the Eastern region (mainly Fergana Valley), Central (Samarqand and Bukhara), the Southern region (Surkhandaryaand Kashqadarya), and Northwestern region (Khorezm and Karakalpakstan)\u2014on the basis of cultural, geographical, and economic differences. The theoretical model offered by the author is partly innovative insofar as it makes an effort to open the black box of the cognitive aspect of strategic action through us- ing the model of cognitive schemas. This is an experimental trial to return to the initial denition of identity by psy- chologists (Erikson 1959) and at the same time keep the strategic character of such flexible process as identication (Brubaker and Cooper 2000). Economic theories of rational choice and strategic action have been harshly criticized for failure to account for the emotional part of the process, and the latter is considered in the book. The author takes Barth's theory of identity formation a step further and highlights both instrumental and primordial character of identities that are flexible but to a certain degree. The major contribution of the book is rich ethnography of four important regions in Uzbekistan because the country still remains understudied. I recommend the book to both academic and nonacademic readers who want to know more about Uzbekistan and who are particularly interested in the regions covered by the book. Another major contribution of this book is to the debate of Soviet nation engineering and post-Soviet nation-building processes with focus on Uzbekistan and Uzbek nationality.

Reclaiming the Faravahar: Zoroastrian Survival in Contemporary Tehran by Navid Fozi Mahnaz Moazami Columbia University Zoroastrian religion is one of the oldest in the world. In its long history, it has influenced many other religions (Buddhism, Manichaeism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam). It was the dominant or ofcial religion of three successiveIranian empires, the Achaemenid, Parthian, and Sasanian, stretching at times from the Indus Valley to Asia Minor. After the Arab Muslim conquest of Iran in the seventh century and the gradual conversion of the populace to Islam, the status of those still adhering to Zoroastrian beliefs was reduced to that of a minority community. Many migrated to India and, later on, to other countries. For those left behind and as in the case of other minorities, Zoroastrians have often found themselves under intense pressure fromBook Reviews 665 the dominant surrounding religion and its claim to cultural hegemony and have fought hard to hold on to their identity and maintain its validity through the preservation of their own distinct sacred rituals and narratives. The contemporary history of the Zoroastrian commu- nity within Iran has been the subject of several ethnographical studies in the past decades (Boyce 1977; Fischer 1973; Kestenberg Amighi 1990). Navid Fozi's contribution, a revised version of his Boston University dissertation, is the latest attempt to explore the survival of Zoroastrians as a minority community in contemporary Iran. The book consists of six chapters: chapter 1 describes the author's theoretical approach, methodology, and the background to the social history of the community in Iran. Chapter 2 is an account of his own travelogue and describes the difculties, challenges, and obstacles that he encoun- tered from different quarters, from the Iranian government as well as the Zoroastrian community. Chapter 3 describes the eldwork that the author had managed to carry out in spite of these hurdles. It provides a valuable insight into the contemporary situation, describing a number of Zoroastrian calendric and occasional ritual ceremonies and cultural acts as performed today. The author discusses the awareness of the community of its minority status and the way that it tries to foster historical consciousness among its members in order to formulate a modern sociocultural imaginary of its own within the Islamic Republic of Iran through the creation of an alter- native religious atmosphere distinct from the dominant one. Its direct observations provide the most informative part of the book. Chapter 4 explores the way Zoroastrians have con- structed their discourse of cultural and historical precedence vis-`a-vis Muslim Shi'i-dominated Iranian culture by tracing the components of Iranian culture to its pre-Islamic origins in the moral universe outlined by Zoroaster's teachings in the Gathas (ve poems in Old Avestan that Ahura Mazda taught Zoroaster) and thereby presenting themselves as thetrue heirs and representatives of an ancient heritage that still informs the existing cultural ideals, if not practices, of the Iranian society today. Chapter 5 is devoted to the author's attempt to demonstrate and document the reevaluation and rear- rangement of present-day religious rituals and beliefs by contemporary Zoroastrians in order to stress principles of universality, modernity, and equality, especially in terms of the scientic achievements of their religion, their exact calendric calculations, and their emphasis on gender equality, choice, and tolerance. As in the case of other faiths in the contemporary world, ancient images and symbols are interpreted in a way that shows their relevance as well as afrmation of democratic and humanistic ideals. The nal chapter analyzes the main challenge facing the Zoroastrian community in Iran: that of declining numbers. Conversions to other religions, marriage outside the faith, and emigration cannot, given the tenets of the faith, be compensated by recruiting new members because the tenets of the faith do not allow conversions from the outside. Although the book suffers in places from its uncritical acceptance of secondary sources, its rsthand observations, expressed in a clear account, should prove helpful to students of anthropology of religion.

Language and Muslim Immigrant Childhoods: The Politics of Belonging by Inmaculada Ma Maisa C. Taha Montclair State University As the sixth volume in Wiley Blackwell's Studies in Discourse and Culture series, Language and Muslim Immigrant Childhoods showcases some of the strongest, most systematicwork in contemporary linguistic anthropology. Document- ing links between microinteractions and larger political narratives, Inmaculada MaGarc \u00b4a-S\u00b4anchez's immigrant children's \"belonging and not belong- ing\" addresses their everyday lives in Spain as unavoidably political. In the traditions of social justice-oriented educational anthropology and language socialization studies, she shows how children actively shape and are666 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 shaped by host and heritage communities in a post-9/11, security-obsessed era. Close interactional analysis\u2014facilitated by still shots from \u00b4a-S\u00b4anchez's video data\u2014presents evidence of the children's emerging hybridsensibilities as they negotiate their standing within both communities. Primarily, Garc \u00b4a-S\u00b4anchez is concerned with how Moroccan children and those with whom they interactuse language to delineate belonging. She asks in addition:How do Spanish attitudes toward Muslims shape dominantracialist discourses and Moroccan children's responses tothem? By tracing shifting attitudes toward Moroccans in arural town once lauded for welcoming newcomers, Garc \u00b4a- S\u00b4anchez has also chosen a eld site that represents new destinations in global migration, away from metropolitancenters. Sixteen months of participant-observation and,notably, video data collection support her analysis of how agroup of rst-generation Moroccan immigrants, ages 9-12,navigate the \"landscapes\" of their everyday lives, specicallyat school, Arabic lessons, appointments at the medicalclinic, and during play with friends. Roughly the rst half of the book's nine chapters is devoted to theoretical framing, historic and ethnographiccontext, methods, and descriptions of key participants.Here, Garc \u00b4a-S\u00b4anchez suggests that Spanish suspicion toward Moroccans represents a \"new\" Orientalism dened bysecurity concerns but rooted in national history. AlthoughOrientalism has always been about the allure and threatof the East, this contextualization helps explain Spain'sdeeply conflicted connection to North Africa. Among theopening chapters, chapter 3, \"Learning about Children'sLives: A Note on Methodology,\" stands out as a singularcontribution. Garc \u00b4a-S\u00b4anchez's thorough accounting of her methods provides welcome transparency into the planningand execution of this research, a veritable how-to foranyone interested in mixed methods, especially includingvideo, or curious to know how ethnography actually getsdone. The second half of the book focuses on linguistic and in- teractional analysis. Chapter 5 details Moroccan kids' experi-ences at school, showing how Spanish peers marginalize themthrough physical exclusion and particular forms of talk\u2014\"regimes of linguistically-mediated surveillance\" (p. 291)\u2014 such as tattling, directives, \"fueling re.\" Spanish scrutiny upon racialist attributions of misbehavior, uncleanli-ness, and difference. Chapter 6 explores how two sets of Ara- bic lessons, one at school and the other at the mosque, involveMoroccan children in crisscrossing ideologies of authenticityregarding different varieties of Arabic and who teaches them.While this chapter highlights Moroccan linguistic and nation- alist discourses, chapter 7 makes evident immigrant chil- drens' skill at navigating the claims upon their loyalties. Astranslators for family and neighbors at the health clinic, theyperform a crucial intergenerational and intercultural role.They not only relay information between patients and med-ical professionals but also mediate the exchanges so as notto reproduce negative perceptions of Moroccans, all whileexpressing respect toward their elders. Chapter 8 focuses onpretend play among Moroccan girls. Out of sight of others,they use their dolls to enact imagined Spanish personae, com-plete with Spanish names and scenarios of shopping or tryingon bikinis (activities that are limited or foreclosed to them inreality). The book's holistic and humanizing approach is its core strength. The children appear neither as victims ofcircumstance nor as implacable redeemers of culturalhybridity across a variety of daily contexts. Nonetheless,greater attention to the structure and editing of the bookmight have woven the focal \"landscapes\" together moreseamlessly, tying them to the theoretical insights containedin the opening and concluding chapters. Unfortunately,overuse of italics early on and proofreading errorsthroughout create distractions for the attentive reader aswell. Given its scope and timeliness, this book will be ofinterest to scholars of multicultural education, transnationalmigration, language contact and change, and researchmethods; educators and policymakers will also benet fromreading it. In the end, one is struck by the tremendous work that Moroccan immigrant children do to manage the balancingact required of them. If mostly too young to articulate theirdouble-consciousness as such, Garc \u00b4a-S\u00b4anchez's analysis makes clear that this, too, is central to their socialization.By documenting the rst stages of linguistic and culturalhybridization in progress, she shows how individual iden-tities become elds of struggle amid mundane but insistentclaims upon belonging. Her ndings offer crucial insightsinto the lives of European Muslim youth at a time when insight is rare\u2014increasingly replaced by fear at the prospect of their radicalization but paralysis before evidence of theirdisaffection.Book Reviews 667 The Eagle and the Dragon: Globalization and European Dreams of Conquest in China and America in the Sixteenth Century by Serge Gruzinski. Jean Birrell, trans. Cambridge: Polity, 2014. 312 Byron Ellsworth Hamann Ohio State Spanish adventurer named Hern \u00b4an Cort \u00b4es, at the head of a small troop of soldiers and cavalry- men, made his entry into Mexico. In May 1520, a Portuguese ambassador, with even fewer men, entered Nanking\" (p. 5). Four years later, the Spaniard had orchestrated a takeover of the Aztec empire, whereas the Portuguese embassy\u2014which also harbored dreams of conquest\u2014came to nothing, and most of its personnel had been executed. Thus, \"in the same century, the Iberians failed in China and succeeded in America\" (p. 4). These global parallels are the starting premise of Serge Gruzinski's dense, provocative new book, rst published in France in 2012. Structurally, the volume moves back and forth, along a parallel timeline, between Mexico and China, with frequent stops in Europe. Chapters 1 and 2 compare and contrast what we now know about 15th- and early-16th-century Central Mexico and China, in terms of their political and social infrastructures, their technologies, and their inter- regional relationships. Chapters 3 and 4 turn to Europe's explorations of the early modern world and the history of its fascination with Asia\u2014a fascination that, in 1492, acciden- tally led to the Americas. Themes of fascination continue in chapter 5, which begins with the parallel ways in which Eu- ropeans described the Chinese and Mesoamerican books that arrived in Iberia in the early 16th century; it then continues the theme of writing by introducing the letters (by Cort \u00b4es, by Portuguese emissaries) that are our primary sources for reconstructing the events that unfolded in Mexico and China circa 1519. These letters and the stories they tell form the basis for chapters 6 and 7, which move back and forth from Mexico and China to narrate how one expedition ended in European victory and settlement and the other in European failure and banishment. As a complement to these histoires \u00b4ev\u00b4enementielles (event-centered narratives), the next three chapters center on imaginaire (mental landscape) and worldview: How did Iberians, Mexicans, and Chinese alike struggle to name and understand one another? Chapters 11 and 12 turn to European techniques for describing the world and their connection to plans and practices of conquest in Mexico and China; chapter 13offers the counterpoint of Mexican and Chinese theories and practices for dealing with outsiders. Chapter 14 then juxtaposes the chaos of 1520s Mexico (where the Spaniards struggled to consolidate their conquests) with the continuity of 1520s Asia (where the Portuguese worked to integrate themselves in long-established trade networks)\u2014 yet concludes by suggesting parallels of \"Americanization\" and \"Asianization\" in both situations. Chapters 15, 16, and 17 center on the Spanish Americas and Philippines and the numerous efforts\u2014including several by Cort \u00b4es\u2014to use those territories for launching new Asian conquests. The book's conclusion, subtitled \"Towards a Global History of the Renaissance,\" provides a manifesto on theory, method, and \"the Birth of the West.\" As I was reading, I found it useful to imagine The Eagle and the Dragon as the third permutation of a trilogy in translation, and to contrast the specic geographies brought together in each component book. The rst volume in this trilogy, The Mestizo Mind (published in 1999 in French and in 2002 in English), brings the reader to Europe for relatively few pages (forays described at one point as \"a little detour\"): that volume was, above all, a story of how European ideas and images\u2014especially those inherited from the classical, pagan past\u2014traveled to Mesoamerica to be taken up and transformed by native peoples. In the second volume, What Time Is It There? (2008/2010), Gruzinski created a \"disconnected history\" split fairly equally between events in the Old World versus the New: he used books and manuscripts to reconstruct how the Americas looked from Istanbul, on the one hand, and how the Islamic world looked from Mexico City, on the other. T h eE a g l ea n d the Dragon , like its immediate predecessor, also works to divide its attentions equally between two different sites in the early modern world: China and Central Mexico. Yet Gruzinski's exploration of Amerasian themes is distinct in its structure from his previous exploration of Islamoamerican ones. In What Time Is It There? , Gruzinski stressed the disconnection of Islam and America: \"a history of worlds that encounter each other without ever meeting\" (2010:1); \"there is no link, therefore, between the two texts\" (2010:17). In contrast, The Eagle and the Dragon articulates a far more connected vision of parallel developments in distant locales: \"The Iberian expeditions to the coasts of Mexico and China may not have been part of a concerted operation, but neither was their temporal coincidence pure668 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 chance. The two events derived from a common dynamic\" (p. 31). The Eagle and the Dragon often stresses the need to avoid teleologies in how we imagine the globalized past and its relationship to the entanglements of our present world (pp. 2, 3, 58), and so I do not mean for this trilological comparison to represent a simple story of progress or devel- opment (wherein each new volume is \"better\" or \"improved\" from its predecessor). Instead, read together, they appear as a series of experiments: methodic and methodically instructive variations on the theme of imagining a past outside \"the tired old frameworks of a national, colonial andimperial history, which are an obstacle to a global approach\" (p. 239).

Youth Politics in Putin's Russia: Producing Patriots and Entrepreneurs by Julie Hemment Bloomington: University Press, 2015. 276 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12650 Dilyara Suleymanova University of Zurich In this important contribution to the anthropology of postso- cialist state, Julie Hemment explores the terrain of state-run youth projects in Vladimir Putin's Russia, providing a so- phisticated, elaborated, and differentiated account of highly controversial projects initiated by the Kremlin in the 2000s analyzed in the context of global neoliberal forces and trends. Mobilizing post-Soviet youth for new Russian modern- ization projects, designed by Putin and his administration, is vital for their viability. Projects, initiated and sponsored by the Kremlin, such as the youth movement Nashi, Seliger camps, and youth-oriented pronatalist campaigns, as well as the sexualization of politics around the persona of Putin are the various facets of this youth mobilization that Hem- ment addresses in her book. Against the backdrop of Rus- sian state's infringement on democratic rights and liberties, Putin's regime offers to its young constituencies a new real- ity, in which Russia emerges as a superpower, as an attractive entity with which youth can identify. Abundantly fuelled with petrodollars and the \"oil-and-gas glamour,\" this \"new Russian patriotism\" responds to various aspirations of youth. Different from the dominant Western accounts that see these projects as direct outcomes of rising authoritarianism in Russia, she highlights the complex, multifaceted, and contradictory nature of these projects, which cannot be located within the state power alone. By situating them within the context of broader global forces of neoliberal governmentality, Western democratic interventions, and commodication of politics, she argues that such projects are products of multiple authors. Appropriating diverse, seemingly contradictory resources and symbols\u2014fromglobal youth culture to Soviet forms\u2014they emerge as highly eclectic projects with unexpected turns and outcomes. Hemment starts with a critical discussion of Western democracy and civil society promotion in Russia in the 1990s, highlighting their detachment from the immediate needs and concerns of Russians during that time. Disparaging these NGOs as \"foreign interventions,\" the current Russian regime and its political technologists ( polittechnologi ) have embarked on creating their own civil society projects that skillfully use many of the techniques and resources of Western democracy promotion. One of the most famous and controversial efforts at mo- bilization of youth in Putin's Russia is the Nashi movement, which Hemment analyzes in detail in the second chapter. Apart from some of its dubious actions, she identies it as a \"post-modern mixture of old school methods and new political technologies,\" whereby Soviet-era legacies, ele- ments of global youth culture, and techniques of neoliberal governmentality are fused in an eclectic mix (p. 103). Exploiting Soviet-era achievements to bolster national pride and patriotic sentiments in youth, Nashi simultaneously promises young people individual gains in terms of improve- ment of career chances and social mobility. In the further analysis of the \"innovation forum\" Seliger, she demonstrates how youths are socialized into the neoliberal techniques of self-empowerment, self-marketization, and through \"technologies of kindness\" or \"commodify your talent\" workshops and master classes. Soviet heritage gures here prominently as the sources of Russian moral power, but, as Hemment asserts, these are \"signicantly neoliberal imagining, where Soviet heroes were spun as innovators and entrepreneurs\" (p. 14). Further on, she analyzes state-backed promotion of voluntarism among young people (helping the elderly and orphans) as a manifestation of Russian state's withdrawal from the social welfare.Book Reviews 669 Hemment at the same time attends to the perspectives of young people participating in these projects. Through portraits of young people active in these various venues, she reveals the meaning that they have for individual actors and tropes that they open for them. Rather than docile subjects that follow the state line, young people emerge as active agents that adapt participation in these projects to their own ends, showing a range of various motivations to participate and engage with them. Hemment's analysis, as she acknowledges herself, has proted a lot from the method of ethnographic collab- oration. Many of her ethnographic and analytic insights emerged from the collaboration with the scholars of the Tver' State University and from critical engagement with their views, in some ways representative of the attitudes of critical post-Soviet intelligentsia. We also hear the voices of young people who express alternative discourses about these state-run projects, disparaging them as PR campaigns, as \"showing off\" (pokazukha ), or as venues for self-interested careerist.This made me wish for more counter-discourses revealing the diverse and contradictory responses and attitudes that such technologies actually receive from the wider Russian society. At the same time, these state-run youth projects seem to draw on the widely shared perceptions of moral superiority of Russia over the \"morally corrupted\" West\u2014sentiments that feed on the gloried Soviet past. I would have appreciated more discussion of these post-Soviet constructions of morality and their use for political purposes. Youth Politics in Putin's Russia contributes to the debates on the nature of social movements, particularly pro-regime ones demonstrating that the \"same techniques and strategies which entered the repertoire of celebrated democratic oppositional waves . . . can be effectively deployed for pro-regime purposes\" (p. 13). It convincingly presents how global neoliberal forces play into the techniques of incorporating youth subjects into state power structures by offering young people opportunities to explore paths of self-empowerment and entrepreneurship, albeit within a given ideological framework. Fields of Desire: Poverty and Policy in Laos by Holly High Singapore: National University of Singapore Press, 2014. 232 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12645 Aranya Siriphon Chiang Mai University Fields of Desire is a fascinating book on anthropology of Southeast Asia and of post-peasants studies addressing the issues of domination-resistance approach. The author raises certain critical issues in development projects, state policy, and people's livelihood in Southeast Asia. It is informative and descriptive, accounting the politics of poverty looking at implementation on the ground. Based on long-term eldwork in Don Khiaw, a village located in the southwest of Laos, the author has selected a good eldwork site, historically illustrating a marginaliza- tion process in a rural area, where Laotian peasant cultures confront entrenched poverty, discrimination, and increas- ing regulation ordered by the state. \"Don Khiaw,\" among other rural villages in Laos, could be seen as a so-called \"post-peasants\" society, witnessing the way that changing peasant cultures have been encountered within a situation of exploitation. According to the book, while the state implements poverty-reduction policies and development programs, local people perceive those attempts merely as state projects and engage them with doubts. This is because, as the author accounts, the state has never been trusted, and local people have rarely been successful in participating in mostof the state's development projects\u2014for example, road construction or irrigation building. In spite of the failure of state's prior projects, policy makers and planners keep on renewing poverty reduction policies, some of which are even desired locally. This circumstance brings in the force of aspirations and desirable responses among rural Laos and ambivalent understandings of power and \"post-rebellious\" formation among contemporary Laos. Hence, it is a well-thought-out book attempting to place the concept of \"desire\"\u2014particularly as understood in Western knowledge\u2014under reflexive questions. Draw- ing on the subject of desire in Foucault 1984 (see, esp., Foucault 1984:5) and psychoanalytic understandings of desire in Deleuze and Guattari 1983, the author asks whether desire is a Western fantasy understood in term of universal and eternal view. She challenges the Western theory, proposing that desire could be seen as an indigenous, live concept demonstrating a way of seeing life, of investigat- ing and debating about it, in which one can be encountered in particular context. Framing desire in this way, desire for economic and political engagement in Southeast Asia is an alternative sense rooted in the specicity of particular symbolic cosmologies, allowing scholars to make desire a question rather than a prior commitment in cross-cultural analysis. More interestingly, the author furthers a debate on the notion of desire in \"post-rebellious\" society within Southeast Asian scholarship. Similar to James C. Scott, a670 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 well-known political scientist and anthropologist in agrarian studies and Southeast Asian studies, the author does not reduce the observation of resistance to ignorance or false consciousness. Instead, she points out a rich culture of resistance under conformity surface, cosmologies under dominant and exploited economies, and delirium implied by the use of cultural-symbolic schemes illustrating the holes, gaps, and contradiction. She suggests that the desire in a post-rebellious peasant culture produces the delirious ratio- nalities for opposed evaluation, condemnation, and action, written in chapter 3 in particular, expressing the multiple embryonic forms (i.e., revolutionary action, aspirations for conformity, mutation, and replication) of a dissident culture. It reveals an account for Southeast Asian change in terms that can explain everyday nonresistance and daily aspiration in ways that allow for reason and fantasy, for repetition and creativity, and for the respect implied by cultural relativism. The book structure comprises nine chapters in rich ethnographic style and anthropological analysis. Chapter 1 introduces desire theories and how to relate rebellion and desire in a particular context of contemporary Laos. Chapter 2 brings to the fore the Laotian phrase \"eat with you,\" referring to power in dual implication of nurture and of destruction in the Lao political eld, and analyzes the delirium in everyday encounters with the state. Chapter 3 gives a historical background, narrating Don Khiaw village and the region where it has been marginalized politically and economically. Chapter 4 focuses on Don Khiaw women andwhat the poverty means for them. The author also presents the character of these women in attempting to break away from poverty. Chapter 5 introduces \"stories of state,\" inves- tigating dual images of ofcial stories told in the public realm and private sphere. The stories unveil a shared delirium that underlines and links on-stage and off-stage depictions of what the state is. For chapter 6, the author uses the case of the state's irrigation project resurrected by local people themselves in order to understand the intimacy of a politics of survival and the will and desire of the people. Chapter 7 provides a narrative of event series surrounding the World Bank Poverty Reduction Fund to demonstrate how the delirium of desire is operated as an open-ended process and how the political eld is negotiated with varying interpretations held by different actors over time. Chapter 8 points out that mutual aid running from period of high socialism to contemporary participatory development can be seen as a delirium, one of a powerful image for constructing dual images of political virtue and disgrace.

Hurd Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2014. 288 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12641 Mica Pollock University of California, San Diego Clayton Hurd seeks importantly to demonstrate how \"in- creasing White/Latino public school segregation, while na- tional in scope, is locally produced,\" by exploring a largely white, middle-class enclave attempting to \"'secede' from what has become an increasingly Latino school district\" on California's central coast (p. 3). Hurd names suburbs as increasing hotbeds for resegregation: local residents nation- wide call for \"reorganizing\" districts when too many chil- dren of color enter them. Rarely do such parents frame their requests in explicitly racial terms, Hurd argues. In- stead, they lean on logics of local control and parent choice, and on legal opinions that increasingly favor passivity on desegregation.Tapping ve years of eldwork and many historical records, Hurd documents local battles over both deseg- regation (students attending the same school) and true in- tegration (students enjoying equal status relationships and learning opportunities once together). Decades of redlining, employment policies, and realtors' steering had created one community housing Mexican farm laborers and descendants and another housing white middle-class families. Despite years of white resistance to desegregation orders, the com- munities nally came to share a school district for nancial reasons and to handle overcrowding. Yet as Hurd docu- ments, Latino students experienced daily exclusion within the desegregated high school. As Latino activists called for full integration, white families once again demanded a sepa- rate school district that they could control. Educators had long passively just put students into the same building and let the social and opportunity chips fall, essentially greenlighting white social ownership of the schoolBook Reviews 671 and Latino exclusion. \"Allenstown High\" was a classic case of two racialized schools within one school, with white and \"Mexican\" students segregated socially, spatially, and academically. Having clubs or activities \"available\" in a school does not mean students comfortably join them; exclusion can occur through stares as students enter rooms or speak. To those unfamiliar with everyday versions of racism in school, Hurd's detail on interactions in school ofces, board meetings, assemblies, or student government might seem like overattention, but Hurd's point is that it is in these very social interactions over control, respect, and status that \"integration\" or \"inclusion\" are built or not. In long dips into local politics and history, Hurd usefully demonstrates how school dynamics reflect any community's power relations. Chapter 2, for example, documents how a history of underpaying Mexican labor built both the town's wealth and the status dynamics reinforced in its schools. Ironically, white families continued to frame Latino fami- lies as somehow freeloading off economic and educational resources. Anti-immigrant propositions in California, plus leader- ship by local organizers, nally sparked Mexican American student activism for true integration. Latino students ran for school ofces, organized walkouts and public speeches, designed murals, and called for curricular change. Each call for representation in school activities, clubs, and staff heightened anxiety among some white students, parents, and faculty, who experienced each effort for equal status as excluding \"white\" people in turn. Enter the secession move- ment. Hurd seeks both to understand the white commu- nity's press for resegregation (what Hurd and to narrate the Mexican-heritage community's battle for integration. Hurd admits he focuses more on the Latino organizers, in part to rectify desegrega- tion narratives that focus too exclusively on white partici- pants (p. 40).The theme of \"secession\" at rst seems lost in chap- ters delving into tensions inside the school, but Hurd then argues provocatively that these very school-level tensions helped catalyze the \"secession\" movement. In this argument particularly, Hurd offers an important window onto anx- ious efforts by class- and race-privileged subcommunities to withdraw both physically and bureaucratically from shared public spaces. The consequences are dire: Hurd notes that, nationally, segregation leaves Latino students with fewer material re- sources in their schools (including trained teachers, courses, facilities, and connections to colleges and careers), exac- erbates linguistic segregation, and concentrates the needs associated with poverty. He refers less to how academic seg- regation (tracks, course selection and placement, instruc- tional rigor) occurs nationally between schools and within \"desegregated\" schools, as well. While he offers a poignant rendering of social segregation in the high school studied, for example, in only hinting at its academic segregation, he misses some chance to help readers fully understand what segregation destroys and integration entails. Hurd's ethnography also usefully explores debate over tactics among Mexican American student and adult organizers, avoiding oversimplication (or hypercele- bration) of local integration strategies. Local ofcials or teachers also voice somewhat complex views. White parents appear more of an undifferentiated block\u2014either because their public speeches conveyed actual unity or because we just hear fewer of them talk through their convolutedly racialized arguments about home values, school control, property taxes, and \"challenging\" curriculum. We nish the book agreeing with Hurd that true integration will in large part require convincing white parents of their collective in- terest in a truly integrated school system and of opportunity as possible for all. Yet we close deeply skeptical about that prospect. Yearnings in the Meantime: \"Normal Lives\" and the State in a Sarajevo Apartment Complex by Stef Jansen New York: Berghahn, Leutloff-Grandits University of Graz It is really relieving and thought provoking to read a book about people's relations to the state in Bosnia and Herze- govina (BiH) and, more specically, in Sarajevo after the Dayton Peace Agreement without focusing on ethnicity andnationalism\u2014a view that has been dominant in scientic and public attention on BiH ever since the violent dissolu- tion of socialist Yugoslavia. Since the Dayton Agreement in 1995, BiH is ofcially divided into two and, on a practical level, even three territorial and political entities according to national lines, and its political system is based on ethnona- tional quota, blocking the functioning of the state. Now, there is this intriguingly written and analytically original book that looks at the main concerns of the citizens of BiH672 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 and their yearnings for \"normal lives\" (p. 43) and that relates them to their demands for a \"normal\"\u2014a functioning\u2014state(pp. 2-9). By taking the views of people living in one of the typ- ical Sarajevo apartment blocks that were built in socialism, author Stef Jansen investigates a \"regime of temporal reason- ing\" (p. 47) that focuses on Sarajevo as a place of a specichistorical geopolitical conjuncture where people link theirprojections about \"normal lives\" in the socialist past (the\"was\") with their aspirations about a \"normal life\" in thefuture (the \"ought\") (p. 43). This historically informed andfuture-oriented view is something that is still rather unique inanthropology and that makes this book so valuable and origi-nal. Beyond this, Jansen's analysis densely links his insightfulempirical descriptions to major theoretical discussions on thestate (e.g., Foucault, Scott) in relation to theories on hope(e.g., Bloch, Miyazaki, Hage), temporality (e.g., Appadurai,Bourdieu), conviviality (e.g., Mbembe), and, not least, state\"gridding\" (p. 70), a term coined by Jansen that refers tothe ordering frameworks that (ought to) exist within a so-ciety and that are linked to statecraft. This combination ofpartly humorous and intimate empirical details and innova-tive theoretical insights makes the book highly readable for alarger audience\u2014far beyond the circle of post-Yugoslav orpostsocialist regional experts. Jansen structures his book in three parts, which are the yearning for \"normal lives\"; the analysis of the pathologies ofthe state in Dayton BiH, which he calls \"Daytonitis\" (p. 18);and the ways of everyday living within this disfunctioningstate. As Jansen shows, the aspirations for a \"normal life\" arerather moderate: they include social coordinates like health-care and education, job provision and pensions\u2014things mostpeople remember to have had in socialist BiH\u2014as well asthe ability to move forward (pp. 40-43), which they lackin the \"Dayton meantime,\" at least at a speed they want(p. 52). In fact, even during war, people had partly success-fully fought against such an abnormality with the creationof \"grids\" (p. 70), structures that enable people to believein some kind of trajectory. In postwar Sarajevo, people stillevaluate their life along a linear temporality associated withmodernism\u2014which may be a pessimist message for all thosewho look for alternative temporal trajectories \"in the face of disillusions with modernist utopias\" (p. 44). At the sametime, and this is the good note, this yearning for a normallife leads inevitably to a \"grid-desire\" (p. 71), a wish for a\"normalized and normalising order\" (p. 71) provided by the state. Different from the notions of a modernist, technocrat state, which controls its citizens (e.g., Foucault's theory ongovernmentality) and against an authoritarian, discipliningstate that imposes \"grids\" on its citizens, who then revoltor at least silently disagree to it (as shown in studies ofJames Scott), Jansen features the opposite: in Dayton BiH,the citizens live in this disfunctional state, but they wantto be seen by the state (p. 9). They aspire state grids thatenable them to create normal lives\u2014even if these hopeswill not be fullled in the immediate future (pp. 136,154). In the last part of the book, Jansen describes what peo- ple do in the Dayton meantime: barking over coffee (insteadof protesting and revolting); waiting\u2014for a better time tocome; and, last but not least, chasing (opportunities and con-nections). The latter leads to a kind of conviviality betweenthe citizens and (the politicians of) this ill state, which is, inthis context, therefore less an innovative project but one ofcompliance (pp. 189-219). Some hope, however, is given inthe beautifully written epilogue; in it, Jansen describes howin 2013, 18 years after Dayton, seemingly suddenly somejoint protests for basic citizens' rights evolved across ethnicboundaries. Of course, one can question if young people who do not know any other state but the one of Dayton BiH andwhether those people who were forced to leave their homesdue to ethnic cleansings are also engaged in such protestsand have the same desires for a functioning state, beyondethnonational cleavages. At the same time, it is no questionthat such yearnings for normal lives and for a functioningstatecraft are not restricted to citizens of Sarajevo or BiH butcan also be found in other states around the globe. As thisbook gives intimate and at the same time highly theoreticaland innovative insights into this eld, it deserves to be widelyread.Book Reviews 673 The Lama Question: Violence, Sovereignty, and Exception in Early Socialist Mongolia by Christopher Kaplonski Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2014. 280 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12632 Nancy E. Levine University of California, Los Angeles Christopher Kaplonski's The Lama Question is a work of ex- traordinary scholarship on a rarely studied region. The book offers the denitive political history of Mongolia's early so- cialist period, from 1924 to 1940, focusing on the policies that culminated in mass executions and the wholesale de- struction of Buddhist monasteries. The argument is orga- nized around Giorgio Agamben's concept of the \"state of exception,\" together with Michel Foucault's insights about governmentality. Because, as Kaplonski notes (p. 86), Agam- ben's concept does not entirely t the Mongolian case, he developed the more encompassing \"technologies of excep- tion\" to frame the \"policies, propaganda, and a range of forms of violence\u2014structural, symbolic, and physical\u2014that were enacted at various times\" (pp. 28-30). The term appears an awkward hybrid initially, describing unprecedented, some- times violent, actions brought against individuals and institu- tions through ostensibly legitimate means. Over the course of the book, it gains clarity, however, and Kaplonski uses it to contextualize shifts in policies and the contingent nature of political legitimacy and political sovereignty in Mongolia. The book begins with a brief history of Mongolia through the early 20th century. At the time that the socialists took power, the nation was a theocracy headed by a reincar- nate lama who was born in Tibet, approximately one-third of the adult men were Tibetan Buddhist monks, and the monasteries and high-ranking clergy held great wealth and great authority. The second chapter describes the geopo- litical dilemmas that the nation faced at that time; in this chapter, Kaplonski introduces persisting questions about the role of Soviet influence on Mongolia. The book is based on materials accessed in archives in Mongolia, supplemented by oral historical accounts. Kaplon- ski describes the archive as a eld site and an object of research in its own right (p. 10). He divides the account into three time periods, each with its own special tech- nologies of exception. Chapters 3-6 describe the rst time period, beginning in the 1920s and ending in 1932. This is when modernist reforms were introduced, including the promotion of secular education and women's rights, the abolishment of the privileges of high-ranking lamas, the ex- propriation of property from people deemed \"feudals\" (how this status was assigned remains unclear), the collectiviza- tion of livestock, and an early set of arrests and trials ofindividuals suspected of \"counterrevolutionary\" activity. Reaction against these policies led to civil war in 1932. Chapters 7 and 8 describe the subsequent rollback of some the harshest policies of the previous period, together with new, subtler technologies of exception, which involved surveillance of the lamas and the monasteries and greater attention to class-based inequities. Chapters 9 and 10 form the third and nal part of the book, covering the period of 1937 to 1940, when the most draconian measures were in- troduced. These technologies of exception involved the clo- sure of the monasteries, the expulsion of the monks, mass arrests, show trials, and executions. Predominant among those executed were lamas, Buriad Mongols who had fled the Russian Revolution, government ofcials, and intellec- tuals. The major charges involved alleged conspiracies to overthrow the revolutionary government. While the stan- dard view of these events is that they were imposed by Stalin and came about almost without warning (p. 9), Kaplonski suggests that although the Mongolian government had re- ceived guidance from Stalin and others in the Soviet Union, the Mongolians were active agents in these events. The concluding chapter undoubtedly will be of greatest interest to anthropologists concerned with issues of political violence and sovereignty and with what can be learned from the Mongolian case. In it, Kaplonski reiterates the view that the socialist government had a concern with legality and a need to assert the legitimacy of its measures in order to effectively counteract the authority of the Buddhist clergy. That is, to suspend the rule of law and declare a state of exception in the full sense would have been counterpro- ductive, undermining the efforts of reformers to build a modern state. He also argues that the recourse to violence was deferred because the new Mongolian government was weak and that the reason it was weak was the power of the Buddhist establishment. Thus, for years the government continued to address its adversaries though accommodation and less confrontational approaches, such as surveillance of high-ranking clerics, which later on facilitated the targeting of such individuals. For those interested in the region, the book offers an extraordinarily rich and theoretically sophisticated account of a momentous time in Mongolian history. Still, the wealth of detail on events and individuals who were the focus of repression is so weighty as to be a mixed blessing. At the same time, the argument would have benetted from greater use of the oral historical materials that Kaplonski describes having collected and from a fuller accounting of the lives and sources of motivation of political leaders at that time.674 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 Figurations of the Future: Forms and Temporalities of Left Radical Politics in Northern Europe by Stine Kr\u00f8ijer New York: Berghahn, 2015. 256 Snajdr John College, CUNY \"This is not just a demonstration\" claries a protestor at a planning meeting for the 2008 NATO summit in Strasbourg, France, \"the idea is to take action\" (p. 114). Action, not words, and the present, not the future, occupy and maybe undermine the culture and politics of the northern European radical Left in Stine Kr\u00f8ijer's nicely written ethnography. Kr\u00f8ijer deftly investigates the relationship between form and time among activists, delineating the logic of their direct- action maneuvers, their dynamic networks of planning and paranoia, and their sometimes-inconsistent commitments to alternative lifeways in a neoliberalizing Europe in the era of global capitalism. Her research settings range from local protests over a youth center in Copenhagen to several larger demonstrations at major international policy events including NATO and climate-change summits. In these contexts, Kr\u00f8ijer presents the fast-paced world of activists, many of whom are barely into adulthood and who work at a frenzied rate to ght the state, the system, and, most importantly, the police. Her ethnography probes this velocity of political action, revealing both the strengths and the vulnerabilities of the \"alter-globalization\" movement. Left radicals are a counterpublic that explodes, demonstrates, and then disappears into diverse and dispersed daily lifestyles such as veganism, punk-rock music, squatting, and self-actualization. If the theory here seems blurry, that is also Kr\u00f8ijer's point: such activism manifests as intense temporal and bodily experiences and not steady, static structures of social organization with predictable bureaucratic formulations. It is in the state of action that this political force seeks to articulate its voice. Following a vivid introduction that brings us into the experience of protest in Copenhagen, chapter 1 offers an astute account of how Left radicals ignore the nuances and varieties of late capitalism, seeing it as simply monolithic, oppressive, and morally wrong. Chapter 2 then explains the cultivation of a disaffected generation of youth in northern Europe, who grapple with the demands of autonomy, individual purpose, and particularly Scandinavian notions of spaciousness and equality. The result is an idealistic yet anarchistic approach to social activism that incorporates an urgent need to \"be there\" when local battles against gen- trication arise or when gureheads of state power gatherfor international meetings\u2014what Kr\u00f8ijer calls \"active\" time. But such a culture also involves the anxieties of liminality and youth, and such frustrations play out in chapter 3 as we wit- ness the detailed and complicated planning of major actions. The process reveals how consensus is difcult and inefcient to achieve, and the absence of an ideological center allows for substantial individual variation. At the end of the day, a mea- sure of noncommittalness and uncertainty emerges among her informants. It is in describing this \"dead\" time\u2014a period when actions are not happening and the road to the next one can be distant, difcult, even boring\u2014that Kr\u00f8ijer begins to pull together an analysis of time and form that may at rst not appear to be much of a departure from the work of other anthropologists writing on activism or temporality but which becomes distinct in chapters 4 and 5. Here she pro- vides an enlightening discussion of police perspectives and their systemic securitization of public spaces. Both police and activists re-create each other in a relational dance of risk, fear, and counter-offensives, revealing their mutually con- stitutive, yet starkly divergent, worldviews of the present and the future. The result is a claustrophobic arena of tactical actions seeking some sort of disruption (which may be one of the most overused terms these days). Kr\u00f8ijer's analogies from Amazonian ethnology and anthropological theories on the body throw this intimacy and relationality into sharp re- lief. Along the way, she includes ethnographic vignettes that personalize activists' lifeways, such as an account of dump- ster diving or that of the naming of a child, and explains the apparent contradictions of Left radicals' acceptance of un- employment benets or study grants as gaming the excesses of a corrupt system they outright reject as long as it keeps them on their mission of changing the world. In the wake of Occupy Wall Street, Kr\u00f8ijer's study recongures Left radicalism as a sort of \"preoccupied\" movement\u2014too concerned with form of protest and immediate action at the cost of both structure and devel- oped theory. Her data suggest a distinct lack of endgame or of achievable compromises that might make real differences. This is why labor-, race-, and gender-equity movements, as well as ethnonationalist movements, can be potentially so transformational and, of course, so dangerous in the eyes of the powers that be. Such ideology-based movements know their endgames. Neoliberal states, along with the systems of global capitalism that foster them, are perhaps quite content to keep the public preoccupied with Left radicalism (along with terrorism) as the visible, \"real\" enemy of the present and, as Kr\u00f8ijer shows us, one guration of the future.Book Reviews 675 Loneliness and Its Opposite: Sex, Disability, and the Ethics of Engagement by Don Kulick and Jens Rydstr \u00a8om Durham: Bjarke Oxlund University of Copenhagen Loneliness and Its Opposite is a truly novel book in several ways. Not only does it address a topic that is typically steeped in silence in public and scholarly discourse alike, it also takes the liberty to do so by applying a comparative examination of the ways in which sex and disability are facilitated or not facilitated in the two Scandinavian welfare states of Denmark and Sweden. Casting the question of sexuality and disability as a matter of social justice, the book elegantly circumvents the emblematic notion of sexual rights understood solely as sexual entitlements that legitimize prostitution. This is paramount because the Swedish context is one in which the purchase of sexual services is criminalized and where questions pertaining to sex and disability are easily overshadowed by inculcated values of gender equality and antiprostitution. Inspired by the capabilities approach to social justice, Don Kulick and Jens Rydstr \u00a8om instead argue that justice is a matter of fostering the circumstances that allow individuals to realize a life with human dignity. In adopting this recipe for social justice, they therefore set out from the understanding that Danish policies designed to facilitate and enable the sexuality of people with disabil- ities are more just than their Swedish equivalents, which by and large manage the sexuality of disabled people with disregard and avoidance. Albeit unusual, this stated view is refreshing in that it allows for a structured comparative approach to the social policies of two neighboring welfare states. Furthermore, the modality is transparent and estab- lishes a clear sense of purpose throughout the text. Still, the decision made to only carry out ethnographic eldwork in Danish care facilities, because no Swedish facilities are known to actively facilitate sexual experiences, is question- able. How can the authors be so sure that there is noth- ing to be found beyond the level of ofcial discourse in Swedish facilities? Even if that is the case, do practices of avoidance not merit their own ethnographic description and analysis? The benets of the welfare state comparison is most clearly demonstrated by the historical readings of how foun- dational conferences held in both countries in the mid-1960s destined Denmark and Sweden to take each their route on the question of sex and disability. Tuning in on key actors in the form of state ofcials, civil society representatives, and public media, this part of the book reads almost like adetective novel and thus delivers a vivid contextual analysis. Where the adoption of the so-called normalization principle to disability in Denmark came to encompass the practical facilitation of the sexuality of disabled people (and the pro- fessional training of 400 sexual advisors), the Swedish model focused solely on the provision of information about sexual- ity and left disabled people to gure out how to accomplish any of this largely on their own. For someone with mobil- ity or the intellectual capacity to manage a relation on their own, this could turn out to be enough. But for those without these abilities or capacities, the accomplishment of a sexual life necessitates the involvement of someone else. The book does a marvelous job of carefully analyzing the intricate negotiations that take place as part of this involve- ment and how these tie in with differing notions of the public and the private in the two countries. From a formal perspec- tive, the Danish \"Guidelines about Sexuality\u2014Regardless of Handicap\" (1989) actively mandates the development of policies and practices that recognize and assist the sexual entitlements of disabled people. In everyday life, this means that there is a clear demarcation between what is possible and what is not. Disabled people have the right to be consulted by a sexual advisor and to have plans and agreements be implemented to facilitate their sex lives. In no way does this amount to a simple right to sex, although in a minority of cases it may involve the requisition of services provided by a sex worker. Care workers have the responsibility to respond to the wishes of the disabled person. If nothing more, they have to at least refer the question to a sexual advisor, whereas on all accounts they are strictly prohibited from engaging in sex. The rich descriptions of how care workers facilitate the encounters between a couple where both have Down syn- drome, how they prepare a homosexual man with cerebral palsy for an encounter with a sex worker, or how they set up a paralyzed woman for masturbation using sex toys turn the relation of the public and the private on its head. By doing so, the book simultaneously unsettles a number of taken-for-granted notions about what it means to care or what it means to fulll a right. As such, this intriguing book deserves a readership outside the realm of sexuality or disability studies.

This has led to a sustained reflection on the complicated relationship anthro- pology has had with Christianity and to questions about the foundations of the discipline, its concepts, and method. For this reason, Timothy Larsen's The Slain God does not fall on deaf ears but joins ranks with anthropologists' own attempts to understand this history. Larsen, a scholar of Christian thought, explores the role Christianity played in the lives of six prominent gures of British anthropology: E. B. Tylor, James Frazer, E. E. Evans-Pritchard, Mary Douglas, Victor Turner, and Edith Turner. His choice is transparent: not only are they great scholars of reli- gion but their intellectual quest is deeply marked by per- sonal faith or loss of faith. His selection also attempts to cover the modern history of the discipline evolving be- tween opposite poles: from early evolutionism to radical empiricism, from loss of faith due to anthropology (Ty- lor) to gaining faith through anthropology (Victor Turner and Edith Turner). In this conguration, Evans-Pritchard and Mary Douglas represent the turning points: the former for his rebuttal of previous theories of \"primitive\" religion, the latter for bringing faith to the core of anthropological theory. If the rst two portraits of Tylor and Frazer are some- what predictable, their role is to illustrate the emergence of a secular ethos in anthropology so well grasped by a quote from Jean La Fontaine: \"Once you stop religious thought, you start thinking anthropologically\" (p. 167). This helps us better understand the peculiar position the other four an- thropologists have in the discipline, due to their systematic engagement with Christian theology, Biblical study, and a deep personal devotion. The book dwells into these aspects providing an original contribution to existing histories of anthropology. Larsen's close reading of these anthropolo- gists' works in light of their practicing faith and mystical or theological influences shows how their theoretical insights evolved through a sustained engagement with Christianity. As Larsen argues, each anthropologist offered a concept that was to be central to the study of Christianity and religion more broadly: animism for Tylor, human sacrice for Frazer,mysticism for Evans-Pritchard, hierarchy for Douglas, and communitas for the Turners (p. 225). Though probably familiar with these biographies, readers will still experience some surprises. Larsen tends to conform to the canonical proles, but he also reveals \"unorthodox\" materials that may seem disconcerting: for example, Evans-Pritchard's birthday poem, anticipating his conversion (p. 118); or Victor Turner's letter to Max Gluck- man, justifying his own conversion to Catholicism (pp. 185- 186). Even the news about Tylor's \"spectacularly Anglican funeral\" does not t the consecrated portrait of the founding father and marks a surprising last turn in his biography. Turning points seem to be central to Larsen's biograph- ical sketches, for their dramatic effect or the born-again feature that signals \"true faith.\" This reveals a certain pre- disposition to evaluate or prove their Christian faith but also some inconsistency in the biographical approach, which alternates between observations on church attendance and devotion, irreverent behavior, interiority, and intellectual engagement with Christian thought. In this sense, the por- traits constitute spiritual rather than intellectual biographies, and the Christian faith portrayed is quite Protestant in form. This is quite strange because these Christian anthropolo- gists were fairly conservative Catholics who made a point of defending the ritualism of their tradition against the aggion- armento (renewal) of Catholic faith. The Bible looms large in most chapters, as part of devo- tional practice or critical study, most notably with Douglas's contribution to Bible studies in her 1989 Gifford lectures on the Book of Numbers. Larsen seems to be at his best when discussing Douglas's work, which comes closest to his own expertise. More than anyone else, she represents for him the ideal Christian anthropologist whose profound understand- ing of Christian mysteries reveals the projection of God onto human society\u2014the reverse image of Durkheimian thought. The book paints a fairly rich portrait of individual char- acters based on a close reading of their work and related studies. However, it only partially grasps the embeddedness of these British anthropologists in the contemporary intel- lectual eld, mostly through anecdotal evidence and a few references to their closest circles. The reader has to take for granted some of the assumptions and deduce the broader context in which their ideas emerge, their lasting influ- ence in anthropology, and the relevance of their theoretical questions today. It sufces to look at the recent naturalistBook Reviews 677 approaches to religion to nd more continuities with the likes of Tylor rather than Douglas. For this reason, the book might appeal rst of all to anthropologists of Christianity, buteven in this eld people have built less on these Christian an- thropologists' insights, drawing instead on more culturalist approaches. Mayan Tales from Chiapas, Mexico by Robert M. Laughlin. Socorro G \u00b4omez Hern \u00b4andez and Juan Benito de la Torre, trans. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2014. 288 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12640 Joel W. Palka University of Illinois, Chicago Mayan Tales contains 42 short stories published in the original Tzotzil Mayan (Spanish orthography) and translated into Spanish and English. The English versions of the tales appear in the rst 92 pages, and the rest of the manuscript contains the narratives in the other two languages. The book also provides a foreword by Gary Gossen and an author's preface outlining the cultural background and academic importance of the work, in addition to a working bibliography. Laughlin publishes these tales to provide a window into Tzotzil Mayan oral literature and society while at the same time making them available to a wider audience. With their appearance in print, the author ensures that the tales told to him mainly by a single Maya collaborator (an elderly woman), which are known by many others in Maya communities, will survive in published form. The permanence of the texts is especially important because the spoken tales are disappearing in Maya culture. The versions in English and Spanish are similar in structure, content, and page length, but I cannot comment on the Tzotzil Mayan text. I could not match the Tzotzil Mayan words with the English or Spanish text because there are no numbered sentences or paragraphs for me to follow. Additionally, I noticed that the reader needs to understand Tzotzil Maya culture and local Spanish to make some connections between words and meaning among the different versions of the texts, such as the Spanish rayo and \u00b4angel meaning lightning in the English tales. For this review, I focus on the tales in English. This book is like others in the Maya tales genre: it presents stories acquired in conversations during eld re- search, but, in this case, the author does not include much commentary on the texts themselves. In fact, very few short footnotes accompany the tales to explain some passages or put them in a cultural context. The book does not contain as many tales as the more lengthy volumes that have come out over the years. However, the tales are important on theirown, for they provide an opportunity to read signicant in- digenous myths, histories, and stories rooted in the Maya tradition. When added to the large corpus, the collection of published Mayan tales join the Greek Iliad, K'iche' Maya Popol Wuj, the Norse sagas, and other world literary and oral works in their importance for human history. Interestingly, some tales in this volume are similar to K'iche' and Tzeltal Maya versions, hinting to their antiquity or the frequency of interaction across different Maya communities over time. The tales give information and insights into Tzotzil Maya culture, such as the importance of corn in daily domestic and religious life. The role of men and women as a complementary core for Maya subsistence, family life, and religious duties is also evident. Particularly fascinating are the Tzotzil discussions of historic events and the effects on their lives, like the Mexican revolution in Chiapas and epidemics in the early 20th century, which still resonate in Maya stories. Other things the reader can pick up on regarding Tzotzil culture include the importance of salt, water, and tobacco for healing and how animals often sym- bolize good versus bad human behavior. Obvious too is how Catholicism has recombined with native beliefs for Tzotzil Maya people to understand their world and their place in it. Native beliefs reign in the Tzotzil world view, however, as seen in the tales that describe the earth lords residing in mountains who dispense everything the Maya need. Humor is prominent in the way the tales are told. I particularly enjoyed the play on words for the description of Chamula as the \"place where the mule died\" ( cham is \"death/dead\" in Tzotzil Mayan, and mula is Spanish for \"mule\"), but no notes help the reader navigate through these puns and metaphors that Laughlin knows so well. As a whole, this book is easier to follow if the reader knows something about Maya culture and language. Moreover, the other works by Laughlin and the different authors on Tzoztil Maya culture and language can be consulted to better understand the tales in this book. The reader should start in the beginning of the book to help make sense of the later tales rather than peruse the tales in random order. The bibliography is a very good list of books and monographs, in addition to some articles by Laughlin and others over678 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 the last century, on the Tzotzil Mayas and other native people of Chiapas. Laughlin has lived with Tzotzil Mayas for 50 years, and his publications on their culture, history, andlanguage are high-quality contributions to anthropology. Like his other works, this book was an interesting, fun read that is a signicant addition to the Maya tale literature. Essential Trade: Vietnamese Women in a Changing Marketplace by Ann Marie Leshkowich Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2014. 272 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12652 Hsunhui Tseng Chinese University of Hong Kong Essential Trade: Vietnamese Women in a Changing Marketplace explores the lives and struggles of the women who worked in small-scale trades in the most famous market in southern Vietnam, the Ben Thanh market. By studying the develop- ment of this marketplace from the colonial era to the contem- porary era of market socialism, Ann Leshkowich provides a vivid account of how these women traders' lives have been tightly connected to Vietnam during a period of often-radical political, economic, cultural, and social change. During the jarring political transition from French (and, later, U.S.) dominance to its present communist structure, these southern Vietnamese traders faced equally important economic changes, from a market economy influenced by U.S. capitalism to a collective socialist economy after the unication of North and South Vietnam, to the contempo- rary economy of market socialism with the endorsement of the top-down economic renovation, Doi Moi . Political and economic turbulence has driven petty traders from capitalist to socialist modes of production and back again and has forced them to develop strategies to cope with the uncertainty of current market socialism, such as engaging in what Leshkowich calls \"a political economy of appearances\" (p. 19). Participating in a political economy of appearance is a way in which individuals develop subjectivity and exercise agency. For example, these women traders avoided potential criticism of their businesses as bourgeois economic activities by posing themselves as backward, weak, and marginal subjects that conform to the ofcial stereotype of petty traders and by hiring kin helpers to maintain their petty trade as family business. They also tried to avoid accusations of greed in the market by playing up to the image of virtuous mothers who sacrice themselves for their families. According to Leshkowich, this gender essentialism and strategic familism allows them to be portrayed as moral subjects in a burgeoning capitalist market. Leshkowich's nuanced analysis of how gender essen- tialism and strategic familism have shaped women traders'subjectivities while providing resources for their agency to draw on is very interesting and powerful. Instead of readily criticizing gender essentialism in the patriarchal society of Vietnam, she explores the meanings of its practice in the daily lives of these women traders. This observation of everyday life in the market enables Leshkowich to show how gender and factors such as social networks and religious practice together play out in every aspect of their life. Besides discussing gender, family, and kinship rela- tionships among women traders, Leshkowich also makes some sharp observations on gender and classmaking under (market) socialism. She notices that the new congurations of political economy and class status after renovation were no longer simply top down as the state-sponsored classcation based on the means of production before. Instead, they re- quire more reproduction through daily performance, such as displaying a kind of lifestyle through consumption. Al- though she concedes that consumption plays an increasingly important role in classmaking nowadays, she also insists that we should not ignore production, as it still provides a crucial political-economic context for understanding the diversity of middle-class subjectivities (e.g., the difference between white-collar wage laborers as the new middle class and petty traders as the old one). Even today, when opposition to a market economy is waning, petty traders still carefully avoid excessive consumption for fear of being labeled as petty bourgeois, because excessive consumption was considered inequality in production in the old days. Keeping a low pro- le through feminization of their business became a strategy to avoid moral accusation by socialist ofcers and others. This book provides a careful analysis of almost every aspect of the lives of women traders in Ben Thanh market. It focuses on women, but its analyses are not limited to them. Husbands serving as business helpers and male management ofcers in the market also feature in a discussion of gender and power dynamics in the family and the marketplace. Leshkowich also draws parallels with the development of postsocialist China, reminding readers how modern economic activities have recongured class identities in another socialist society. This book will be very helpful for students and scholars of anthropology and for several other academic disciplines, including gender studies, family studies, urban studies, cultural studies, and religious studies.Book Reviews 679 Return to Casablanca: Jews, Muslims, and an Israeli Anthropologist by Andr \u00b4eL e v y Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2015. 240 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12647 Emilio Spadola Colgate University In this work, Andr \u00b4e Levy, the titular Israeli anthropologist, returns to his birthplace to study the few thousand Jews who chose not to emigrate after Morocco gained independence in 1956. Levy seeks to understand nostalgia among Jews who left and among Jews who stayed: the latter seek home in a Morocco that was; Levy and fellow \u00b4emigr \u00b4es seek a home in a Morocco that may yet be. The resulting ethnography tells us much about the Morocco that is. Although Levy's book is set in the early 1990s, Return to Casablanca feels timely. His project was impractical, even unthinkable, until Morocco's then-ruler Hassan II appeared on Israeli television to welcome all Moroccan Jews\u2014\"his children\" (p. 188)\u2014to return. The royal gesture touched and inspired Moroccan Israeli listeners and also reinforced Morocco's geopolitical position as Arab-Israeli and Western-Muslim mediator. This strategic rhetoric of religious \"tolerance\" remains in force today, as the Moroccan state proclaims its historical \"openness to the other.\" Levy's book details more complicated political and personal dynamics of Jewish-Muslim and Morocco-Israeli intimacy and contempt. Indeed, readers will nd here no simple conrmation of Morocco's inclusivity. Yet Levy interprets Moroccan Jewish-Muslim connections with such honesty, humor, and nuance that one nds encouragement in the ethnographic encounter itself. Levy began eldwork during the 1991 Gulf War, feeling \"vulnerable and exposed\" (p. 23) and hiding his Israeli citi- zenship (he surrendered his passport to Moroccan ofcials in exchange for a \"transit visa\"). But Levy openly identied as Jewish and put his anxiety to ethnographic use. His \"feelings of threat . . . fact matched local Jews' \"egocentric perception that they were relevant, even central to public life in Morocco\" (p. 19). That apparently contradictory perception denes what Levy calls Moroccan Jewish community's \"contraction,\" a key concept describing his subjects' \"introvert inclination\" in a Muslim-majority land (p. 19). Contraction is specically postcolonial. If Jews in the past, 300 thousand strong, had \"dare[d] not lift their heads\" (p. 65), they nonetheless belonged to a broader religious and cultural weave. Under French rule, some Jewish merchants and intellectuals iden- tied closely with European modernity and experiencedrelative liberation from these local strictures. Levy notes his discomfort with positing \"European colonialism as a liberating and civilizing force\" (p. 60), but he acknowledges Moroccan Jew's nostalgia for French occupation and, more pointedly, their dispiriting sense of renewed submission in the postcolonial era of mass emigration. Now, Moroccan Jews who remained \"have become foreigners in their own country\" (p. 153). They too seek to return \"home\" to Casablanca. Three subsequent ethnographic chapters illustrate contraction as both an inter- and intracommunal dynamic of spatial control. Social clubs provide spaces of Jewish control, wherein Muslims may be present but ignorable, and \"Community Committee\" serves Jews so they need not serve themselves (and thus make contact with Muslims). A fascinating chapter examines the apparently exceptional case of intercommunal friendship in public card games (\"Rummy Couples\") that pair a Muslim and Jew per team. But Levy discerns in mixed teams and \"play\" a calculated suppression of fear: pairing a Muslim and a Jew on a team and adhering to the \"strict and universal\" (and, crucially, French ) game rules provides Jews \"security net\" of a \"higher authority\" (p. 141). Levy notes, however, that tolerance does not mean equality. Muslims and Jews accuse Jews of cheating, but \"in the hundreds of games that I watched,\" Levy writes, \"never did a situation occur, not even once, where a Jew publicly accused a Muslim of cheating\" p. 138). Two nal chapters focus on Jewish intracommunal and international tensions regarding Moroccans' refusal to accept Israel as Judaism's singular center. If Jewish \u00b4emigr \u00b4es feel and heed the call of Moroccan origins so strongly, can Israel claim to be the Jews' homeland? Are homeland and diaspora not reversed? Here Levy's thoughtful examination of intracommunal disunity points again to postcolonial history. For Levy, what bars Israeli Jews from ever fully returning to Casablanca and \"reuniting the family\" (p. 193)\u2014what supersedes religious community\u2014is the implacable fact of nation-states. Yet, he makes clear, these same boundaries produce the very desire they inhibit. Levy's fearless prose is often a pleasure to read and, indeed, would make good reading for introductory and ad- vanced students of North African studies, multiethnic Israel, Jewish studies, and migration. Nevertheless, he might have drawn more general conclusions regarding religious plu- ralism from his excellent ethnographic observations. Most ripe for further interpretation is his repeated invocation of680 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 Moroccan Jews', including \u00b4emigr \u00b4es', \"unconditional loyalty\" to Morocco's powerful royal family (p. 189). This is not sim- ply a question of national-state loyalty but of power as a guar- antor of pluralist \"tolerance.\" One thinks of the French rulesguiding \"Rummy Couples\" as well as Jews' nostalgia for the relative security of colonial protection. Tolerance requires coexistence, but it is antidemocratic, being conditioned by submission to an absolute, and absolutely foreign, sovereign. Becoming Salmon: Aquaculture and the Domestication of a Fish by Marianne Elisabeth Lien Oakland: University of California Press, 2015. 232 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12648 Glenn Davis Stone Washington University in St. Louis The 20th century brought us factoried production of cattle, pigs, and chickens. Each industry has its own distinct history, technologies, political economy, and problems, and each brings humans into a new set of relations with the farmed creatures. But all of those the creatures were \"domesticated\" long before industrial production was even a concept. Not so with salmon. This sh has a remarkable life cycle that involves spawning and early growth in freshwater streams, followed by a changeover in body chemistry and migration to the distant feeding grounds in the open sea, and nally navi- gating back to the same stretch of the same stream to spawn and die. Although humans have been manipulating salmon populations for centuries, it was not until the 1950s that Norwegians managed to keep the sh conned throughout its life cycle. By the 1960s, they had developed the system of freshwater hatcheries, smolt factories, and saltwater grow- out pens that form the basis of modern salmon farming. Industrializing this life form is quite a feat, and Marienne Lien offers a multilayered investigation of, and meditation on, how the process works in several facilities in Norway. Lien's frame of reference is material semiotics, her main touchstones being John Law, Annemarie Mol, and Donna Haraway. Her particular focus is on the boundaries\u2014 physical and conceptual, xed and transgressed\u2014that struc- ture what salmon and humans are up to in this fascinating set of interactions. Humans are apart from sh in their underwater grow- out pens but not from eggs in the hatchery (p. 110). The underwater netting is like, but also unlike, a farm fence (p. 59). The sh are mostly unseen, yet the farm is held together by information that makes the assemblage legible and visible as a manageable entity (p. 79). As escapees from their \"natural\" lifecycle, the farmed sh are alien to the rivers from which they evolved, although opinions differ on whether they are actually a different species from their nonfarmed kin. The form of the narrative itself transgresses boundaries. Lien terms the study a \"more than human ethnography\"(p. 15), and it is only partly ethnographic; only a handful of humans drift into the narrative, and we learn about the culture of salmon farmers only in passing. It is partly what some would call a technography, although her term is \"pro- ductive entanglements.\" It is also a rst-person account of an inquisitive outsider, a trope common in science journalism today, with Lien detailing her experiences and reactions to participant-observing at salmon facilities, learning to throw feed pellets, count sea lice, operate a siphon tube in the hatchery, and getting her daughter off to school. The productive entanglements described here are not between sh and humans in general or industrial capitalism at large but, rather, a distinctive encounter between salmon and Norwegians. Norway is notable for its policies aimed at long-term salmon management; this is unlike management in many other places\u2014Chile, for instance, went for the quick unsustainable buck and ended up dumping in tons of antibi- otics to ght off diseases. Quite unlike the United States, and even going beyond EU policies, Norway has an animal welfare law that recognizes salmon sentience; so the electric stunner Lien inspects at the slaughterhouse is mandated as a humane measure. Norwegian shfarm workers are even re- quired to attend regular sh welfare courses. (But Lien also recounts a half-tankful of undersized juveniles, selected out by the vaccination machine, being asphyxiated and ground up to feed mink.) When asked why farmed salmon are now deemed sen- tient, Lien enigmatically refers to the fact that they are being domesticated. But this would have been an opportunity to \"mobilize comparisons\" as the book promises early on. After all, highly domesticated and clearly sentient land animals are raised in torturous concentrated feeding operations in the United States, but that country provides fewer protections for the animals than for the owners who are accused of cru- elty. As well as this book conveys what Norwegian salmon farming is like, it does not explain why Norwegians conceive of salmon as they do. The other lacuna in this superb book is the lack of seri- ous discussion of the impact of farming on salmon genetics, which is central to the ongoing discussions of salmon do- mestication. Lien notes that salmon wildness is reckoned on the genetic level but says little about how farming changes salmon genetically. But some now claim that salmon areBook Reviews 681 \"domesticated\" in a single generation; that farmed salmon have 700 genetic differences from wild; that stress in crowded pens induces important epigenetic changes; that Salmo domesticus should be recognized as a distinctspecies. How the sh is being changed genetically and epigenetically\u2014especially given the ongoing change in feeding practices, monitoring technologies, and welfare policies\u2014are key parts of the story. Religious Difference in a Secular Age: A Minority Report by Saba Mahmood Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2016. 248 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12610 Akbar Ahmed American University Responding to her introduction at a Cornell University lecture as a \"Pakistani anthropologist,\" Saba Mahmood said that she did not know \"how many Pakistani anthropologists arethere in the world, I'd like to know myself\" (Mahmood 2010). I would like to address and inform her that a De- partment of Anthropology at the Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad was established decades ago. There are many \"Pakistani anthropologists\" out there, including myself (PhD, University of London, 1978) and Dr. Amineh Hoti (PhD, University of Cambridge, 2004). Mahmood's book Religious Difference in a Secular Age: A Minority Report is a complex and ambitious intellectual tour de force. She is examining issues of minorities living in our \"secular\" age both in Europe and Muslim nations. As if this was not ambitious enough, she is also interested in issues of the Sharia, gender, and piety. Her ethnographic focus is on the Copt and Bahai minorities in Egypt. For Mahmood, secularism promised neutrality and the equality of all citizens by forcing the expressions of religious difference into the private realm. Yet Mahmood makes a convincing case that secularism has not only failed minorities both in the West and in Muslim societies but also has ex- acerbated problems for them. Mahmood's entire fth chap- ter, for example, is about the Coptic backlash to Azazeel , a novel by a secular Egyptian Muslim scholar. The novel, dealing with the early Christian theological and eschatologi- cal debates about the nature of Jesus, insulted and infuriated the Coptic community to such an extent that Mahmood compared the controversy to that of Salman Rushdie, the Danish Cartoons, Charlie Hebdo , and others. Such contro- versies conrm that there are increasing numbers of people prepared to act outside the connes of the rational, legal, and secular framework of the modern state and not in the reasoned intellectual manner that Mahmood may want or envision. There is ample evidence that minorities in the Muslim world are having a tough time of it. Even before thepsychopathic and violent obsession of ISIS against minorities, other militant groups like the Taliban, Al-Shabab, and Boko Haram were targeting minorities. In secular Europe, we have seen the recent dramatic backlash against religious minorities as a result of the massive refugee influx and the involvement of immigrants in the massacres in Paris and Brussels and the sexual assaults on New Year's Eve in Cologne and else- where. Mosques, women in hijab, and \"Middle East-looking men\" have been attacked with alarming frequency across the continent. We have seen a similar trend in the United States with the Muslim minority as the target. Presidential candi- dates have declared that if they came to power they would close mosques, register Muslims, contemplate internment, and ban all Muslims from entering the United States. The problem I have is with Mahmood's use of the noto- riously slippery concept of secular . How do we dene it? Is it a rejection of religion altogether `al aK a r lM a r x ?O ri si t the usage in the United States, where commentators often describe the country as \"secular\" and yet the president and other leading gures openly express that their favorite book is the Bible and are able to cite verses from it and the coun- try's ofcially accepted motto remains \"In God We Trust.\" Or perhaps it is the ideal that will resolve the problems around minorities, as Mahmood hopes for and speculates (p. 212). Mahmood is perceptive enough to be aware of the con- tradictions in the Muslim world. Because the concept of the \"secular\" is such an ambiguous one, we nd its appli- cation to Muslim societies problematic. While Egypt itself has been ruled after the Second World War by military of- cers declaring themselves as \"secular\" and targeting Muslim political parties, the presidents have not been shy of having themselves photographed in pious postures in the mosque. What do we make of the brutal, sadistic, genocidal despot Saddam Hussein of Iraq who prided himself on being secular in the Soviet mold but ended up by projecting himself as a Muslim leader and had the Islamic cry \" Allah-o-Akbar \"[ G o d is great] sewn on the ofcial flag. Then there are the other important Muslim nations like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, and the largest of them all, Indonesia, who consider their societies primarily as Muslim. The treatment of minorities in these Muslim societies is often contrary to their own682 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 traditions of tolerance. Under the Ottoman Empire, for ex- ample, minorities were given the right to live by their own laws and traditions, as Mahmood notes. Notwithstanding the theoretical entanglements of ap- plying a conceptual frame to two different societies on two different continents, Mahmood's central thesis is strong and backed by ethnography. She has successfully pointed to the failure of societies, both in the West and the East, to accom- modate minorities. I can conrm her thesis on the basis of my own current study of minorities in Europe based on ex- tensive eldwork, Journey into Europe: Islam, Immigration and Identity (Ahmed in press). The plight of minorities, whether in European or Muslim societies, should be a matter ofuniversal concern. The fact that we are living in a so-called \"secular age\" makes the predicament of the minorities even more ironic.

Shells on a Desert Shore: Mollusks in the Seri World by Cathy Moser Marlett. Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 2014. 304 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12616 Cheryl P. Claassen Appalachian State University Thousands of the world's people collect mollusks for food or commerce where once millions of people did. Hundreds of thousands of shell-bearing ancient camps, ceremonial grounds, and industrial piles of shells still dot the coastlines of every continent and some of the rivers. While archaeol- ogists have written much about ancient diet and molluscan biology, ethnographic accounts of shellshing are very rare and are regarded as something like comets in a star-dotted night sky. Cathy Marlett's text on Seri ethnomalacology is such a comet. The author grew up in a traditional Seri village col- lecting sea shells with other children. In preparing this book, however, Marlett also visited numerous museums and libraries to view artifacts, photographs, and movies pertaining to the Seri, much of which is incorporated as illustrations and commentary in this work. In the rst sec- tion of the book, we meet the Seri, the places, and the author. The ethnological section, the second of three subdi- visions in the book, covers taxonomy, mythology, trade, food, utensils, adornment, medicinal use, recreation, bait, and place names. Marlett has placed the greatest empha- sis on taxonomy (Seri and Linnean), dividing the book into classes of invertebrates. She worked with a collection of mollusks made by herself and associates, a small proportion of which were unrecognized by any Seri informant. At least 80 percent of the different mollusks and other invertebratesdid have Seri names and uses. This Seri account is studded with mythological references to shellsh and offers unique medicinal information. Some of the Seri mollusks produced pearls; some of the shells and their fleshy inhabitants were used medicinally; many of the gastropods were used in chil- dren's games, as dolls or mother's fetishes, or in jewelry sold to non-Seri. Marlett can claim the most detailed and lengthy New World ethnomalacology. Other ethnographies on shellshing and shell use exist. In terms of detail and length, Marlett's book is on par with that of Betty Meehan's (1982) observations on women's shellshing and dietary use of shellsh in northern Australia. But with far fewer species to talk about and the essential role for shellsh flesh in the Australian (Arnheim aborigines) diet, Meehan's book stands out for its emphasis on women's labor, harvesting deci- sions, and caloric contribution. A study by Douglas Bird and Rebecca Bird (2000) records children's labor in shellshing for the Torres Strait area, and the long-term study of do- mestic shellshing along the coast of the Transkei (Bigalke 1973 and others) and in Tanzania (Msemwa 1994) also fo- cus on labor. Labor related to shellshing or a discussion about the social changes that have led to a decline in shell- shing by the Seri such as offered in a Bahamian case study (Claassen 2013) are the only elements of shellshing missing from Marlett's book. That short Bahamian ethnomalacology provides more detail on bait use for line, trap, and chum, but Marlett does provide some complementary information for gastropods, specically mentioning lobsters as a target. Naming of mollusks and molluscan place names is a central feature for the Seri presentation and is similar to that treat- ment by David Ellis and Luke Swan (1981) for the shorterBook Reviews 683 expose of the Manhousat people of the Northwest American coast. Marlett's study excels in its discussion of folk taxonomy\u2014for taxa, for body and shell parts\u2014and for nam- ing. The reviewer's interest was most piqued by a tendency for the Seri to classify shells as male like or female like. Male criteria were elongated shell shape or a \"whiskered\" shell, one with spiny projections. Female criteria were bulbous shape or smooth shells. It was also fascinating to learn that the Seri make no categorical distinction between bivalves and univalves. Naming also relied on criteria of unusual- ness, the work of Coyote who owned or endowed those taxa. Marlett found several cases when the Seri changed a taxon's name because a human who carried that name died. The third section of this ethnomalacology consists of an- notations for Linnean species. Marlett gives the Latin name, the Seri name or names, brief habitat information, and then whatever information about the creature or its shell she gathered from Seri informants. Marlett's observations also reference the shells seen in abandoned camps (although no effort is made to quantify relatively or absolutely the species makeup in these archaeological sites). The reader will also nd ethnobotanical notes and descriptions of shell tool use in pottery production. This book should have much appeal for shell col- lectors, malacologists, and archaeologists working in the region of the southwestern U.S. and Pacic Mexico. Itis beautifully illustrated with color photographs and the author's pen and ink sketches of species and is richly annotated.

The Meaning of Money in China and the United States by Emily Martin Chicago: HAU, 2015. 178 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12638 Beth E. Notar Trinity College In collaboration with the Department of Anthropology at the University of Rochester, HAU Books has started publishing the Lewis Henry Morgan lectures, including past lectures, in this case those given by Emily Martin in 1986. The four lec- tures, on money in China and the United States, are framed by a new introduction by Martin as well as an Afterword by Jane Guyer and Sidney Mintz. In the rst two chapters, Martin draws on eldwork in Taiwan in the mid-1970s and a trip to Fujian province in 1984, as well as historical accounts of money. In the second two chapters, Martin draws on U.S. news reports as well as eldwork at a church in Baltimore.In \"Money and Value in China,\" Martin provides an overview of the work of Karl Marx and Georg Simmel, em- phasizing both money's integrating and disintegrating func- tions. She then examines three arenas of exchange in rural Taiwan: wages, bride price, and rotating credit associations. She observes that rural laborers gave their wages to the patriarch of the family, who then distributed allowances; and that families would openly display the bride price\u2014 including money and gold but that, unlike buying a con- cubine or slave (pre-1949), no one would ever talk about \"buying\" a wife, except if there were some problem with the groom. Martin observes that although rotating credit associations were \"strongly disapproved by the National- ist state\" (p. 49)\u2014because they were outside the formal, state-controlled banking sector\u2014they functioned to create a network of future nancial obligation. She concludes that \"money circulates in Chinese communities in ways premised684 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 on an entirely different logic than that of capitalism\" (p. 32). In \"Spirits and Currency in China,\" Martin looks at a hierarchy of three types of paper spirit money: \"gold\"for the most powerful gods, \"silver\" for less powerful gods, and \"copper coins\" for ancestors and ghosts. She suggests that this hierarchy mirrored real currency before1949, where gold was reserved for special events, silverused to pay taxes, and copper used daily. She wonderswhether the production of spirit currency allowed people toappropriate a power of the state for themselves and if spiritand real currencies operated like Tiv spheres of exchange,which helped to mitigate against the \"abstract, timelessdisembodied value measured by our [U.S.] money\" (p. 82). In \"Money and Value in the United States,\" Martin examines money's function as the \"general illumination ofeverything,\" its role as \"frightful leveler,\" and an insti-gator of \"boundless greed,\" through metaphors of capitalistproduction applied to human reproduction (developed inher later work), the commodication of body parts, a runon Cabbage Patch dolls, banks foreclosing on farmers' land,and corporations selling defective products. This chapterwould be an excellent one for undergraduate courses. In \"Spirit and Prosperity in the United States,\" Martin investigates the \"New Life Clinic\" at a church in Baltimore.The minister there preaches to the white-collar participantsabout prosperity thinking\u2014that is, that they should prayto grow rich. Martin argues that in the United States \"lawsof economic process have become an all-embracing religionthat dictates relations among persons\" (p. 109). This chapteris extremely prescient and presages much of the work onreligion and the new right. It is unfortunate that it is onlynow being published. The book's marketing blurb claims that \"a new introduc- tion by Martin herself brings her analysis wholly up to date.\"However, this is not the case. Although Martin mentionssome of the recent research on money in the United States,she does not engage fully with it. I am thinking in particularof Viviana Zelizer's (1997) work on the ways that people inthe United States categorize and earmark money. Nor doesMartin engage with the research on money in China and thediaspora over the past three decades of reform. There arebeautiful and powerful ethnographies by Julie Chu (2010) regarding remittances sent home by Fujianese migrants; Erik Mueggler (1998) on hemp, markets, and ritual; Ellen Oxfeld(1993) on gambling; and John Osburg (2013) on extravagantconsumption by nouveaux riches; as well as Helen Wang's(2004, 2013) historical analyses of textiles, coins, andcurrency. Inspired by Benedict Anderson's \"print capi- talism,\" I have also written about currency, counterfeit,nationalism in China (Notar 2006)\u2014for example, about theironies that the Chinese Communists printed \"Mao money\"as a way to garner resources from the peasants (Notar 2004). Engaging with this literature would complicate Martin's 1986 argument about \"our\" (U.S.) money versusmoney in China. It would have been better for HAU topresent the book as the historical document that it is thanto claim that the analysis is up to date. An interesting bonus of the book is that in Martin's intro- duction as well as in Guyer's and Mintz's Afterword, we geta glimpse of the Anthropology Department at Johns Hopkinsin the 1980s and the struggles to nd a bridge between mate-rialist and symbolic approaches. We also see the intellectualferment there, with luminaries such as Claude L \u00b4evi-Strauss, Edmund Leach, and Fredrik Barth passing through. In sum, by publishing these historic lectures and re- flections, HAU, Martin, Guyer, and Mintz have provided avaluable service to the profession.

Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney investigates the use of flowers, and other living things, in the schemes to bolster and enforce certain forms of polit- ical power, especially authoritarian politics. Such schemes are not immediately obvious, and their purpose may re- main hidden, \"opaque,\" because they seem innocent, self- evident. In the book, the most shocking example of this key argument is that many Japanese kamizake pilots in WWII were themselves unaware, even as they boarded their sui- cidal flight, that the cherry blossoms painted on their fly- ing torpedoes helped orchestrate a symbolic spectacle of death\u2014their own suicide\u2014to sustain the life of the fascist regime. This cherry flower spectacle, in which the life-afrming potential of the blossoming cherries is repurposed by the regime so as to have the soldiers' death serve their power, forms the object of a sustained and richly illustrated compar- ison with Nazi and Soviet Communist Leader cults, in which Hitler and Stalin were bolstered by roses presented to them by little children at propaganda parades. The comparison of such pregnant symbolisms in the service of authority is what drives the book's formulation of a new theory about the fertility of a certain \"communicative opacity,\" which Ohnuki-Tierney says she was rst inspired to by the late Edmund Leach, by Pierre Bourdieu's notion of \"symbolic violence,\" and others. The author extends the fundamental anthropological insight that the social-cultural signicance of things is never predetermined (cf. Goody 1993) to the realization that it is not just about how people give different meanings to the same symbols but also that the intentionally unspecied opacity of certain life-and-death symbols renders them ever more useful to authoritarian propagandist manipulation while remaining imperceptible to target populations. The marvelous coercion of so many kamikaze pilots is a supreme example of this. This is a profound point that merits wide attention, es- pecially in our own time of resurgent populist-fascist dema- goguery playing on sentiments over arguments, again to dupe people for authoritarian purposes\u2014such as in the tightly ma- nipulated political spaces of Russia and China, as well as alsoin the United States, as in Donald Trump's skillfully un- derstated or hinted \"menstrual misogynism,\" which seems similarly effective as a species of the same family of mass- hypnosis propaganda tricks. This book will help us discern the workings of such \"things left unsaid\" and how this tactic thrives on the recipients' willingness to be swept away by the potency of intentionally orchestrated opacity. So, this is nothing less than an anthropological book for our times and certainly for wide audiences, worldwide. Writing this review in the United States, I miss a ref- erence to the eccentric yet insightful Blood Sacrice and the Nation: Totem Rituals and the American Flag (1999) by Carolyn Marvin and David Ingle. However, even though the book al- ready does range far and wide, it focuses on Japan\u2014Ohnuki- Tierney's special expertise. Even her masterful chapter on the meanings and uses of roses in Europe and Russia (in ch. 2, including the White Rose underground opposition to Hitler's blood-red ones) serves above all as a foil that en- hances the analysis of the subtle but deadly repurposing, in Japan, of the cherry blossoms as a life-and-death story and the general theory it engenders there. Indeed, while Flowers That Killcan also be read as a continuation of Ohnuki-Tierney's recent book Kamikaze Diaries: Reflections of Japanese Student Soldiers (2006), this is a more decisively theoretically ambi- tious book that restates major insights from her earlier fa- mous writings on Japanese monkey symbolism (in ch. 3) and on Japanese rice as an example of building a puried primor- dialist identity (in ch. 4), integrating them into the main argu- ment about the use of symbols that can better overwhelm tar- get audiences, who are left unaware of their subtle workings. A chapter follows on the crafting and propagation of Japanese and Nazi identities; the book then comes to a crescendo in the last chapters and the Afterword. Chapter 6 builds on the theorization of collective identity to offer an unparalleled investigation of the fashioning of the imposing yet still deci- sively absent god-like emperor in modern Japan as a \"visually and auditory zero-signier\" that helped seal (paralyze) the nation in its fateful quest for empire. Then, building from this, the nal chapter asks broad and hard general questions about the place of \"externalization\" (the rendering concrete of power's symbols in visual or auditory representations or their intentional absence) in the duality of political-religious power. This is an audacious intervention into the political an- thropology of propaganda and of the political gods and godfa- ther politicians that devise and deploy it. The book is certain to provoke much thought and debate.686 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 REFERENCES CITED Goody, Jack 1993 The Culture of Flowers.

Iraqi Women in Denmark: Ritual Performance and Belonging in Everyday Life by Marianne Holm Pedersen Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2014. 208 Zainab Saleh Haverford College Marianne Holm Pedersen's Iraqi Women in Denmark makes an important contribution to studies of Muslims and Islam in Europe. She focuses on the performance of religious rituals among Iraqi Shi'ite women in Copenhagen, who arrived as refugees in Denmark between the end of the 1980s and the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003. The author critiques much of existing scholarship on Islam in Europe, which she claims mainly looks at Muslims through the lens of 9/11 or focuses on political and public issues related to religious involvement. Pedersen's aim, instead, is to show how rituals are embedded in actual social relations and notions of belong- ing to the place where Iraqi Shi'ite women currently live and not necessarily to an abstract notion of belonging to one's place of origin. By prioritizing a local approach to transna- tional migration, she shows that the performance of rituals \"allows women to form different kinds of communities\" (p. 13). Given the challenges of forging ties with ethnic Danes, religious rituals and places (such as mosques and husayniyyas ) become social sites for building local ties and networks with other Iraqi women. In this scenario, rituals and religious sites do not indicate the perpetuation of tradition but speak to the efforts to construct new ties and social relations in a different place. The book provides a nuanced study of the notion of belonging and the politics of inclusion and exclusion in Denmark. The author argues that the organization of Danish society and the association of membership in the nation and ethnic Danes prevent Iraqi women from forging ties with broader society. On the one hand, she argues that the Danish state's discourse on integration emphasizes language acquisition and the ability to nd employment. This denition becomes a powerful instrument to exclude Iraqi women from the nation in that it champions a very narrow understanding of Danishness \"that to a great extent builds on descent\"(p. 167). On the other hand, Pedersen gives the example of the citizenship test to show that belonging in the Danish state is not culturally neutral. Rather, it is embedded in a Danish national culture, which immigrants are not perceived as shar- ing (p. 152). Nevertheless, the exclusion from the Danish nation did not preclude Iraqi Shi'ite women from developing a sense of attachment to Denmark. Indeed, the author em- phasizes that there are different levels of belonging and that researchers should focus not on abstract and national forms but on kinds of belonging that are situated in concrete social practices and relations. Religious rituals became closely tied to the question of belonging in that they enabled participants to negotiate their notions of belonging and build local relations. The book has some flaws, however. Pedersen mentions that most of her interaction with her Iraqi interlocutors took place in English and Danish, because it was hard for her to reach Arabic prociency in a non-Arabic country like Denmark. This assertion is troubling in that it disregards the unequal power relations at play here and the fact that it is the responsibility of the anthropologist to learn, and converse in, the informants' language. The author could have spent some time in Syria and Jordan (where she did some eldwork with Iraqis) to learn Arabic and acquire prociency in the Iraqi dialect. The relationship is reversed here, and it was Iraqi women who had to express themselves in a foreign language to talk about intimate issues, including belonging as well as social and family relations. A great deal of nuanced expressions and feelings could have been lost here. In addition, the book is ethnographically thin, and the author spends a great deal of efforts citing other scholarly studies on migrants and immigration when she discusses her Iraqi Shi'ite women's comments. More detailed ethnographic accounts as well as closer analyses of these accounts would have made this study stronger. The author also tends to make sweeping generalizations. For instance, she cites a study that dates back to 1985 to argue that due to the weakness of state structures, kinship in Middle Eastern societies \"traditionally played a large role in securingBook Reviews 687 livelihoods\" (p. 68). This is a problematic statement that does not take into account historical change over the decades and regional variations. Finally, the author mentions that she interviewed secular Iraqi women, but we barely hear their voices in this ethnography. The marginalization of secular accounts runs the risk of giving the assumption thatthe majority of Iraqi women are observant Muslims and suppresses the heterogeneity of Iraqi communities. Despite these shortcomings, the book makes valuable contributions. I recommend it for scholars interested in migration, belonging, and the politics of inclusion and exclusion in Europe. Citizen, Student, Soldier: Latina/o Youth, JROTC, and the American Dream by Gina M. P \u00b4erez New York: New York University Press, 2015. 272 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12629 Maria Kromidas William Paterson University Early in her eldwork on the experiences of Latina/o youth in a JROTC program in a large high school in postindustrial Lorain, Ohio, a parent pulled Gina P \u00b4erez aside to ask, \"Are you here to prove what you think you already know about this program? Or are you really here to learn?\" (p. 14). The parent gestured to the highly polarized debate about JROTC programs in U.S. schools and to the presumption (more accurate than not) that most anthropologists' politics fall on the other side of the spectrum. I had similar questions. What can a book about Latina/o youth in JROTC reveal if we already know the basic contours of the story? Would this ethnography try to make readers sympathetic to the military for providing youth much-needed opportunities? Citizen, Student, Soldier not only shows us the value of en- gaged and humanistic ethnography on an issue about which we think we \"know,\" it also navigates the difcult waters of writing critique while respecting and honoring partici- pants' perspectives. P \u00b4erez demonstrates that these remark- able youth are not joining JROTC because of the \"leftist as- sumption of the military preying on the false-consciousness of the young\" (p. 199). Rather, she grounds youth choices, experiences, and affects in JROTC within current local, national, and global dynamics of exacerbating inequalities, revanchist nativism restricting national belonging, and dis- courses of dangerous or apathetic youth. The teens are not passive victims of these circumstances; they struggle against and creatively negotiate them. In P \u00b4erez's deft hands, youth experiences and motivations for joining JROTC become a lens through which to view the lived meanings of race, class, gender, and citizenship in neoliberal America, as well as how the youth transform them on the ground. The young people's quest for dignity and respect is the unifying theme throughout the chapters, revealed through the youth voices that predominate the narrative. From a chapter that focuses on students' embodied experienceswearing the uniform and learning and performing drills (ch. 2) to a chapter on the leadership skills that students gain (ch. 3), to a chapter on students' engagement in community service (ch. 4), P \u00b4erez focuses on the embodied meanings, the symbolic, cultural, and social capital, and the habitus that makes JROTC such a formative, even \"redemptive,\" experience. The youths' sincere desires to belong, to serve, and to orient their energies toward a meaningful social pur- pose seem almost spiritual. P \u00b4erez's empathetic writing is such that we feel the young people's excitement and passion when traveling to new places, taking charge, overcoming shyness, actively learning, serving their communities, help- ing their families, and bringing pride to themselves, their families, their community, and their city. P \u00b4erez employs citizenship as the main analytic rubric of the book to vividly represent how the youths' resistance to current discourses that position them as \"undeserving citizens\" in fact produces a construct of citizenship that is \"more inclusive, embracing and valuing people for their humanity\" (p. 188). Furthermore, the in-depth ethnographic material and careful contextualization allow P \u00b4erez to grasp that most elu- sive of ethnographic objects\u2014the nation-state, the way it operates (here, more coherent and effective than current theorizations suggest, if still unpredictable), and the mak- ing of U.S. citizen-subjects. For instance, P \u00b4erez describes a Veterans Day ceremony at the high school. Amid the gossip- ing and giggling students, JROTC students solemnly march down with flags and a hush falls over the crowd. We sense the faith and reverence that is otherwise reserved for the sacred. It is through such rituals that the nation begs, re- quires, and obtains allegiance. In this way this is no ordinary ethnography of the experiences of marginalized youth in the United States but one that inspires us to formulate and de- bate alternative conceptions of citizenship\u2014conversations that must include young people. In the absence of efforts to reimagine the good citizen and create opportunities for youth desires to enact it, P \u00b4erez shows us how the state, via the military, will ll the gaps in these young Latina/o lives. This book will not change anthropological preconcep- tions about JROTC. It offers something more compelling688 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 by answering the how questions that ethnography does best. How is it that largely working-class and minoritized youth have \"skin in the game\"? Answering the how questions sets the stage for and inspires the imagining of alternatives\u2014 in this case, creating meaningful opportunities for young people outside this militarized structure. P \u00b4erez asks: What if those federal funds, and the awe-inspiring organizationand dedication of the military and its committed staff, were brought to bear for different purposes? Citizen, Student, Soldier is an important book for schol- ars and students of U.S. anthropology. It could form the backbone for a course on an increasingly militarized home- land that stubbornly remains invisible. By making \"America\" visible, P \u00b4erez also makes it available for critique. Nowa Huta: Generations of Change in a Model Socialist Town by Kinga Pozniak Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Huta (lit., \"New Steelworks\") has become one of the most popular research sites for social scientists and histo- rians. A huge plant and town located near, and now in- tegrated into, the historic city of Krak \u00b4ow, in its heyday employed forty thousand workers. It was a showcase of communist industrialization in Poland, a perfect place for the creation of the exemplary new man in a new soci- ety and the foundry of socialist values. As it turned out, the city and people became instead a stronghold of anti- communist opposition. Workers of peasant roots demanded churches, and the Solidarity movement became extremely powerful there. This meandering history attracts scholars' attention. In fact, Kinga Pozniak does not focus on the past. She carried out an anthropological study on the memory of Nowa Huta shared by generations of those remembering commu- nist times and witnessing postsocialist changes. \"This work is about how people experience historical change and invest the past with meaning that reflect present conditions, needs, and concerns\" (p. 12). In the introduction, main theoret- ical assumptions underlying the study are outlined. Major inspirations are found in anthropological studies on similar issues both worldwide (Jennifer Cole, Luisa Passerini) and in Central-Eastern Europe Haldis Deema Kaneff). In the vein of Maurice Halbwasch and Pierre Nora, memory is seen as a dynamic process in which group cohesion is forged. Simultaneously, it is a battleeld of competing representa- tions of the past, which reflects the power relations between influential social forces and actors. Consecutive chapters scrutinize issues of memory and cultural hegemony. As a \"hale,\" a person born in Krak \u00b4ow and knowing Polish but living in North America, theauthor had privileged access to the locals of Nowa Huta, enabling her to build a network of knowledgeable in- formants. This intimacy is visible throughout the whole book. In the rst chapter on \"Memory Change in Nowa Huta's Cityspace,\" architectonic ideas lying behind the construction of the city are examined. Carefully planned, Nowa Huta has become a conglomerate of different architectural and at the same time symbolic traditions, from remainders of the rural landscape to communist housing quarters and public spaces, to churches from the late socialist period, to post-1989 buildings. The cityspace reflects the genealogy of the town as well as changes in ofcial ideologies. In structures, streets, apartment blocks, squares, the theater, churches, crosses, and monuments, we can read intricacies of Polish postwar history. We see how the past is reinscribed in the city's topography; ghts over meanings and symbolic hegemony are skillfully rendered. Seemingly contradictory components exist side by side. The similar objective of showing how apparently incon- sistent meanings coexist is presented in all sections of the book. The second chapter is about transformations in work and values. Systemic transition from socialism to capitalism has enormously affected the labor market; this shock therapy caused unemployment. No wonder that despite neoliberal discourses, workers, who fought for civic rights under com- munism, also resisted capitalism. At the same time, the commodication of labor has led to the redenition of peo- ple's value, now measured by market principles. Nowa Huta residents reminisce that work relations and community life under communism were not bad. The third chapter depicts the paradoxical status of the city as a model socialist town and simultaneously the bulwark of forbearance to the very same system. Here the conundrum is tracked in the sphere of museums' representations. The next two chapters are more focused on the people. Based on extensive interviews, Pozniak presents how individuals recall the communist city that made cultural and recreational opportunities available. A shortage economy afflicted everyday life, and this fact isBook Reviews 689 also reflected in contemporary memories. Active resistance is commemorated and remains the source of local pride. All of these crosscutting memories are constantly negoti- ated; they are embedded in individual stories and collective memories but are also conditioned by contemporary dis- courses as well as the social and political situation. The younger generation redenes meanings and is proud of the city they inherited\u2014its infrastructure, history, symbols, and identities. In short, this is a well-written portrait of Nowa Huta seen as a lieu de m \u00b4emoire (site of memorial) for older gener- ations and lieu d'avenir (site of arrival) for younger people. An old socialist city is struggling for the future in a new pre- carious world. Pozniak shows these intricate stories through the prism of memory in a vivid and convincing way.I have one major objection to her work, which relates to the hierarchies of knowledge in academia, unfortunately reflected in her work. Especially as a \"hale,\" she could have integrated more local scholarship to the body of literature. Local theoretical insights are not mentioned; Polish stud- ies on the topic are barely visible; major contributions on the same topic in Nowa Huta written by Monika Golonka- Czajkowska and gathered in her book (2013) are practically absent.

Drawing on data collected from multiple textual sources, interviews with diverse participants in Chinese medicine, and ethnographic observation and interactions in a Southern California school of Chinese medicine, Pritzker explores the numerous ways in which translation, mainly from Chinese to English, is \"enacted in Chinese medicine\" (p. 3). Using \"living translation\" as a unifying concept, she demonstrates that translation in Chinese medicine, far from simply searching for equivalence between Chinese and English, is a complex, ongoing, dialogic process that involves diversely positioned actors and interlocutors, engages with myriad objects, and is heavily mediated by various historical, sociopolitical, and material forces as well as cultural and moral frameworks. Furthermore, she shows this process of translation is deeply embodied and personal. While focusing on the living translation as it unfolds through textual inscription, interaction in translation talk, embodied experience, and clinical practice, Pritzker weaves together a compelling narrative of ongoing authentication and transfor- mation of U.S. Chinese medicine through the enactment oftranslation that is rich in ethnographic details and heuristic in thinking about translation as an anthropological enterprise. Apart from the introduction, which orients read- ers to the book's conceptual and methodological frame- work, and the concluding chapter, Living Translation is di- vided into six chapters. Chapter 1, \"The Real Chinese Medicine,\" traces historical and institutional practices that led to the development of multiple forms of Chinese medicine in China and the United States and also addresses the moral landscapes and material goods that \"participate in mediating the enactment of translation in Chinese medicine\" (p. 54). Chapter 2 focuses on various ideologies of language and translation that participants in Chinese medicine differ- entially subscribe to or draw on for translating and commu- nicating Chinese medical concepts and terms in the English language. The author argues these ideologies \"directly medi- ate, and often enact, translation\" (p. 57). These two chapters cover plenty of background information on histories, insti- tutions, morals, materials, and ideologies that, as shown throughout the entire book, not only constitute the con- texts in which living translation unfolds but also play active roles in shaping every phase of living translation and giving particular forms to U.S Chinese medicine. Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 then take a closer look at different phases of living translation. In chapter 3, \"Living Inscription in Chinese Medicine,\" Pritzker shows that textuality of Chinese medicine is richly interdiscursive and that trans- lation as creating texts is a mode of social action involving ongoing conversations with many actors and voices, ancient and contemporary. Chapter 4 describes the interaction phase of living translation with a focus on classroom \"translation690 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 talk.\" Pritzker demonstrates that such classroom interaction is multifunctional, serving both as an ongoing socioculturally grounded \"hermeneutic endeavor\" in searching for meaning and as a process of socialization in which students learn how to engage with Chinese medical concepts and make clinical decisions based on a certain understanding of language. Chapter 5 examines embodied experience in the translation of Chinese medicine\u2014specically, how students tap into their own felt experience as resources to achieve an embodied understanding of Chinese medical language. Chapter 6 takes translation of Chinese medicine into the realm of clinical practice. Pritzker rst shows how living translation emerges at communicative moments wherein practitioners and interns translate Chinese terms for pa- tients, partly to display expertise and establish legitimacy and partly to socialize patients into Chinese medicine, build rapport, and align them toward healing. She then shows how living translation takes place at the translational moments in which the search for morally grounded authentic under- standing of Chinese medicine as part of classroom learning leads to real clinical diagnosis and treatment choices. The discussion on the case review session is particularly engagingand informative. If there is a weakness, it might be the rela- tive absence of the patients' voices, although Pritzker clearly recognizes that the ongoing conversations with patients \"are a key part of 'living' translation\" (p. 184). It is very likely that this absence may have resulted from the fact that the researcher was not able to carry out clinical observations at the eldwork site due to the ethical restriction. Overall, Living Translation is an excellent and well- researched study of living translation in Chinese medicine in the United States. One of the work's great strengths is the author's own dialogic engagement with a variety of theo- retical perspectives drawn from diverse disciplines and sub- disciplines, illuminating the historical, sociopolitical, moral, and linguistic complexity of living translation in Chinese medicine. Scholars and readers from a wide range of elds will nd the work highly relevant and valuable. I also appre- ciate the way in which the chapters are organized with their own section of discussion and conclusion. Each chapter, al- though capable of standing on its own, was integrated nicely into the overall analytical framework. As such, the book can be easily adopted for classroom use in teaching linguistic and medical anthropology. Refuge in Crestone: A Sanctuary for Interreligious Dialogue by Aaron Aaron Thomas Raverty situates his pioneering work at the fertile intersection of cultural anthropology and systematic theology. A Benedictine monk at Saint John's Abbey who was trained in sociocultural anthropology at the University of Minnesota, Raverty examines this \"creative interface\" through ethnographic eldwork in the multireligious site of Crestone, Colorado, currently home to numerous Tibetan and Zen Buddhist, Bonpo and Baha'i, Christian (Episcopal and Catholic), Su, Hindu, Neo-Shinto, and Native Ameri- can religious organizations. With a nod to New Age thinking and practices within globalized modernity, Raverty explores theoretical and practical contributions of the ethnographic method to interreligious dialogue, the sacred space of this geographical region, and the commodication of rituals and pilgrimage in the operation of a ritual economy. Raverty rst emphasizes that interreligious dialogue is \"praxis and not theology per se. Because dialogue is a socio- cultural event, taking place among human beings in space andtime, it is subject to description and analysis using the meth- ods of cultural anthropology\" (p. 34). Quoting from key Vat- ican documents on dialogue produced by the late Pope John Paul II, Raverty shows an expanding sense of dialogue beyond mere discursive conceptual exchange. He argues that quali- tative research methods could further enhance interreligious dialogue by expanding the range of dialogue topics, consid- ering both emic and etic perspectives, and engaging dialogue as a form of participant-observation. Similarly, Raverty nds innovative applications of many standard practices of cultural anthropology (including informants as partners in dialogue, interviews in eld research, and the recording of life histo- ries) to the context of interreligious dialogue. As well, he argues for the inclusion of gender considerations, cultural artifacts and material culture, and archival sources to enrich the practice of interreligious dialogue. In his eldwork, Raverty's informants designated the region of Crestone a \"sacred\" place. Symbolic images and metaphors for this numinous bio region include a \"vortex of energy,\" a range of \"dragon mountains,\" and an elusive sound known as \"the magical Crestone hum.\" Raverty in- terviews residents who claim prophetic revelations drawing congregants to this place for \"the elevation of conscious- ness and spiritual transformation\" (p. 68). Crestone has alsoBook Reviews 691 become a sacred site of pilgrimage, a \"refuge\" for spiritual practitioners from a variety of religious traditions. \"At least twenty-two spiritual centers and networks inhabit this space\" (p. 81). Raverty's claim is that the commodication of pilgrim- age and ceremony in the local ritual economy also provides particularly rich opportunities for authentic interreligious dialogue, both formal and informal. He writes, The dialogue of religious experience is at its best when pursued with a ritual context. It is here that the various paraphernalia (i.e., materials, objects, vesture, and substances) become most visible as they take front-and-center stage in the unfolding of the ritual procedure. Here, too, the behavioral elements of the rit- ual become uniquely observable. Leaders, celebrants, and those with specialized ceremonial roles emerge in a special way in these settings, foregrounding the sequence and pattern of their contri- butions. Cognitive elements, including dense symbols embodyingcosmological principles, come into clearer relief in such ritual con- texts and can more easily be targeted for later interrogation. The overall mood of the setting also changes, and both those conduct- ing the ritual and those participating in it seem more willing to discuss it. [p. 142] Thus, Raverty raises a range of ethnographic concerns emerging from his eldwork in the sanctuary of Crestone, Colorado, with the aim of moving through enhanced in- terreligious dialogue to an inclusivist comparative theology. Yet these diverse topics read at times like an outline or prospectus for further research. Such research might delve more deeply into the mean- ings and practices at work in this eld site, locating the distinctively late modern play of power and knowledge, material economy, and symbolic production that this ethno- graphic site deserves. Ethnography in Today's World: Color Full before Color Blind by Roger Sanjek Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2014. 312 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12613 Ira Bashkow University of Virginia This volume of essays by Roger Sanjek communicates a vision of anthropology that is inclusive, historically minded, and generous. A political and urban anthropologist, activist, his- torian of anthropology, and methodologist, Sanjek followed his dissertation research in urban Ghana with two remark- able, long-term eldwork projects in the United States: one on the Gray Panthers and the other on neighborhood pol- itics in Queens, New York City. Each spanned more than a decade and involved collaboration and advocacy. In the Queens project, Sanjek brought together a diverse group of anthropologists who studied the different populations\u2014 Chinese, Koreans, Indians, Latin Americans, African Ameri- cans, and whites\u2014that interacted in an intensely multiracial, multiethnic neighborhood. Three major themes thread through the book's 12 chap- ters, which are revisions of essays written over two decades. One theme is the distinctiveness of anthropological ethnog- raphy with its pitfalls and strengths. Chapter 4 on \"Ethnog- raphy,\" a true gem, is the best short description I have read of what anthropologists mean by ethnographic eldwork. Sanjek's explanation is especially regrounding as ethnog- raphy has become trendy in other elds, like product de- sign, where it has different meanings. Anthropologists often stumble when trying to explain our methods to outsiders and neophytes. What exactly is \"participant-observation,\"and why do we so value it? The answer has everything to do with the limitation of eldworker-created situations\u2014 like \"seated-informant questioning\"\u2014where \"normal social activity is suspended\" and the eldworker controls the top- ics of conversation (pp. 61, 67). Of course, interview- ing, too, has its place in social research, but ideally it comes after the researcher has already begun learning \"what questions to ask\" and gained cultural and conversational competence via participant-observation, including \"situated listening\" in settings where \"the actors control topicality\" (pp. 66, 176). One of the consistent emphases of Sanjek's thinking on research methodology is the importance of ob- serving and listening in \"natural settings of social life\" (p. 65). He also elaborates upon the method of close analysis of ac- tors' behavior at naturally occurring gatherings, as modeled by Max Gluckman in his seminal essay on the colonial po- litical relations visible during a bridge-opening ceremony in Zululand. A second important theme is the use of the history of anthropology as a resource not only for theory but also for disciplinary practice. A chapter on research assistants describes the long history of anthropologist-assistant rela- tionships, those often inadequately recognized \"hierarchical multiracial partnerships\" that have produced ethnographic knowledge. There is also a chapter about past anthropol- ogists' attempts to speak \"'truth to power' on behalf of peoples they studied,\" which draws lessons for anthropo- logical advocacy today (p. 191). Sanjek has a good eye for historical incidents that contradict standard narratives, like the story of Lewis Henry Morgan's effective activism to692 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 reverse the alienation of Seneca Indian lands in upstate New York. He critically evaluates Franz Boas's pessimistic sug- gestion that the United States' race problem would not be solved until African Americans were so intermarried with whites as to no longer form a distinguishable population\u2014 \"just as anti-Semitism will not disappear until the last vestige of the Jew as a Jew has disappeared\" (Boas 1921:395, quoted on p. 117). In advocating this kind of practice-focused his- tory of anthropology, Sanjek encourages us to learn from both the bad and the good in how disciplinary ancestors grappled with the challenges posed by structural problems that in many ways still endure; he cautions against making them into \"unblemished . . . paragons,\" because the value of their actions (or inaction) as precedent for our own practice can only be realized if we are awake to \"their complexity\" (p. 192). But the most visionary theme of the book concerns race and its positive value for political change, a rare com- bination in the current scholarly literature on race in the United States. In the diverse Queens neighborhood where Sanjek and his colleagues did eldwork, ordinary residents developed political clout and improved their communities by a strategy of deliberate, representative ethnic and racial inclusiveness. They formed alliances expressly in ethnic and racial terms, striving to get representation from the Puerto Ricans, Vietnamese, African Americans, and so on.(Interestingly, the most effective of these neighborhood ac- tivists have been women.) Sanjek calls this strategy \"color full before color blind,\" the book's subtitle. It expresses principles of racial and ethnic etiquette that are broadly at- tested in the literature on U.S. whiteness where they are often phrased negatively, as critique of whites' race avoid- ance, but that here are put in the afrmative and explored as a matter of political practice, acts with practical conse- quences. It is unrealistic and politically counterproductive, Sanjek writes, to aspire to \"be, or pretend to be,\" color blind; to do so is to drink from the same cup of political anesthetic as trust in \"the market\": \"Our goals, rather, should be to see racial identity as one among the many aspects of every person . . . in what always has been and ingly interconnected, color-full world\" (pp. 21-22). Boas was wrong: racial and ethnic differences are not becoming diluted out of existence but are proliferating, transforming, and growing. Our world, Sanjek shows, is becoming more, not less, \"color full.\" We could do far worse than to be guided by his hopeful and practical vision for living in it responsibly.

Smith Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2015. 264 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12625 Chris Gosden University of Oxford This important book derives from two intellectual endeav- ors: rst, and most prominent, is an argument for the importance of the material world to political theory as applied to past and present cultural formations; and, second, a long-term project on the Bronze Age archaeology of the Tsaghkahovit Plain, central Armenia, through a large team of graduates and postdoctoral researchers both in Armenia and the United States, with author Adam Smith as the prime mover. The book started as the 2013 Rostovtzeff Lecture delivered at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World in New York. The theoretical arguments are exemplied through consideration of the relatively egalitarian early Bronze Age communities of the Kura-Araxes, the middle Bronze Age mobile communities burying their dead inkurgans (mounds), and the late Bronze Age groups centered around defended hilltop settlements (chs. 3-5). Together, this provides a consideration of 2,500 years of changing political and material relations in Armenia and surrounding regions. An Introduction guides us through the intentions of the author and his subject matter. Chapters 1 and 2 examine the role of objects and their combinations into assemblages or machines and the nature of politics and sovereignty respectively; chapter 6 provides a brief conclusion. The theoretical arguments draw on, and aim to speak to, broader discussions in the social sciences on the role of the material world in human life and politics. Archaeologists often consume the theory of others; here the author wants to add to broader discussions. Chapter 1 is important, combining a consideration of the nature of things within the Western intellectual tradition with more archaeological concerns. Little nuggets include Smith's estimate that there might be 8 trillion to 17 trillion objects in contemporary households around the world (with many more in ofces,Book Reviews 693 museums, etc.), highlighting the need to understand through archaeology the relations between human popu- lation dynamics as against populations of objects and their formation, composition, and decay. Big questions concern what things do to people\u2014hence the notion of a machine (rather than assemblage), highlighting the active nature of things in combination. Smith ends the chapter by attending to sense, sensibility, and sentiment to help focus on the sensitivities of the human body in interaction with varying materials. Chapter 2 considers questions of sovereignty, examining how groups with shared subjectivities (publics) are formed, how sovereigns with some authority over these publics come to be, and how the polity as a whole is made an object in which its subjects invest and care. These important questions are provocatively posed. My one problem with the book was in the lack of devel- oped links between the theory and the archaeology. The book lacked a mode of thick description to allow fuller understand- ing of the qualities of sites and assemblages working on the sensitivities of the human organism in an individual and group manner. Many original points are made along the way\u2014the Kura-Araxes phenomenon is not seen, as in most other works, to derive from the influence of the cities of southern Mesopotamia; rather, it is viewed as an egalitarian, village- based cultural form with surprisingly little material exchange with the outside world (in contrast to the earlier Maikop phenomenon). The strict conformity of site structure and material assemblages enjoined a joint response to the world,but I would have liked more about the sorts of practices that together involve the nicely decorated pots, personal or- naments, flint sickles, and the hearth-centered settlements. Mobile groups are tricky to understand, and the sudden shift to mobility in the middle Bronze Age left greater cemetery than settlement evidence. More could have been said on the construction of kurgans, wherein the materials used for the mounds were often carefully chosen and their extravagant sizes indicate large-scale group labor, with a new shaping of time and space, as kurgans and their processional ways came to dot the landscape. The array of nasty weapons in bronze and obsidian indicate new attitudes to life and death, but beyond that the agency of artifacts could have been dealt with more deeply. Quite a different world emerges with de- fended hilltops in the late Bronze Age-connected shrines and forms of domestic production, all linked to kurgans. Here the sensory affects of objects was dealt with well, making this, for me, the most convincing of the archaeological chap- ters. More discussion of the materials certainly exists within the substantive publications of the Tsaghkahovit project. My reservations are minor compared with the book's strengths. Indeed, these reservations derive from the clarity of Smith's ambition to place things at the center of the cultural process. I most strongly recommend this as a book with which to argue, for all interested in the newest forms of theory concerning politics and objects, as well as anyone examining ancient Eurasian cultural forms and connections. Intellectuals and (Counter-)Politics: Essays in Historical Realism by Gavin Smith New York: Berghahn, 2014. 254 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12624 Mark Lausanne In reading Gavin Smith's historically wide-ranging, theoretically forceful, and ethically provocative new book, Intellectuals and (Counter-)Politics , I was reminded of that passage in Rainer Maria Rilke's only novel, The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge , in which the young Danish nobleman reflects on what it takes to be able to write just \"ten good lines\" (1990[1910]:20) of poetry in an entire lifetime. It is only when the experiences of many decades have turned into memories, and then when these memories \"have changed into our very blood, into glance and gesture, and are nameless, no longer to be distinguished from ourselves,\" that we are ready to draw upon them meaningfully in that\"very rare hour\" when the rst lines of a real contribution are able to \"go forth from them\" (1990[1910]:20). Smith's book suggests that a certain kind of anthropo- logical intervention likewise demands that one's personal intellectual history become fused with wider trajectories, a fusion that might have to wait until the politics of daily academic life has loosened its grip. But as Smith's book also suggests, when the reflections of a lifetime of research, teaching, and scholarship have indeed become intellectually embodied, the gap between \"theory as usable commodity\" (p. 214), as Smith puts it, and praxis can collapse so that the work of critical analysis is \"no longer to be distinguished\" from the work of doing what is to be done. Smith describes the conceptual basis for this turning point as \"historical realism,\" which is appropriately less a new term of theoretical art than a depiction of a deeply anthropological mode of evaluation that is highly attuned to694 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 the subversive potential in what Smith calls \"different forms of attention\" (p. 217). By \"counter-intuitively shifting atten- tion back and forth\" (p. 217) between the vivid immediacy of everyday experience and the ways in which experience is mediated through institutions and \"interpretative sensibility\" (p. 217), the ethnographer is well-positioned, Smith argues, to intervene in the ambiguous spaces \"between reflexivity and engagement\" (p. 214) where the seeds of what he calls a \"counter-politics\" might be found. Smith illustrates the value of historical realism across eight diverse chapters. Although the empirical heart of the book is to be found in the internal chapters that revisit and reinterpret different periods of long-term ethnographic research in Peru and Spain, it is in the chapters that are, as he puts it, \"wrapped around\" (p. 21) the middle, where the full implications of Smith's intervention are to be found. Although he graciously counsels readers to pass over the long rst chapter on \"Capital\" if they are already well-acquainted with Karl Marx's analysis of capitalism in Capital ,It h i n kt h i s advice should not be widely heeded for two reasons. First, because the expansive discussion of capitalism, particularly Smith's native anthropological analysis of nance (he worked on Wall Street before studying anthropology), forms the theoretical scaffolding\u2014and a dense one at that\u2014on which everything that comes after hangs. One simply cannot understand later discussions of, for example, the transformation of nance capital as a form of what he calls \"selective hegemony\" (p. 191) without a rm grasp of the structural features of capitalism itself. Second, it is a basic argument of Smith's book that the role of capitalism as a particular mode of production creates certain conditions of possibility\u2014notably those that reproduce the system through exchange and the management of surplus\u2014while excluding others. This is an economic system that dependson quite specic relations of production. As Smith points out, these structural features of capitalism have been all-too- frequently elided in the post-Foucauldian and post-Roseian (what he calls playfully la Vie en Rose ) move to reimagine these structural features as a form of governance. For this reason alone, Smith's recapitulation of capitalism deserves close attention. The nal part of Intellectuals and (Counter-) Politics brings Smith to what he calls \"politics' edge\" (p. 175)\u2014the boundary that separates the need to negotiate with dominant blocs from the uncharted spaces of counterpolitics that deny legitimacy to these blocs and the system of production from which they emerge. Here he makes the case for the enduring role of the intellectual\u2014including, perhaps above all, the anthropologist\u2014as an \"irritant\" (p. 223), one who constantly, fundamentally, refuses to either retreat behind the walls of the \"academic enclosure\" (p. 16) out of sheer frustration or to concede to the ideology of inevitability that cloaks the current conjuncture. He ends with a reference to the collaborations that resulted from the Yorkshire Workers' Educational Association, through which counterpolitical intellectuals like E. P. Thompson and Raymond Williams joined forces with laborers to develop what Smith describes as a \"truly radical intellectual practice\" (p. 224). As this book demonstrates, Smith deserves his place as an exemplar of an intellectual whose originary sense of engaged anthropology pierces much of the surface of the current politics of recognition to go straight to what sustains and justies the structural inequities of the present.

Japanese New York: Migrant Artists and Self-Reinvention on the World Stage by Olga Kanzaki Sooudi Honolulu: Tsuda Arizona State University Olga Kanzaki Sooudi has written a very engaging book about Japanese migrants who eschew conventional corporate jobs and other constraints of Japanese society and temporarily relocate to New York City to pursue artistic careers. The book is a welcome addition to the literature, because it is one of the few ethnographic studies about elite, professional migrants instead of unskilled labor migrants. In addition,most studies about Japanese who live abroad focus on cor- porate workers and their families on overseas assignments. Although Kanzaki Sooudi is interested in the everyday expe- riences and practices of these artistic migrants, the quotidian somehow becomes extraordinary because it is embedded in encounters with racial and cultural others in a foreign context. This is a migrant population about which little is known, and I was quite intrigued by the compelling stories and narra- tives contained in this book. Despite being high-skilled pro- fessionals, artistic migrants have fewer nancial and social resources than Japanese business expatriates and face muchBook Reviews 695 more risk and professional uncertainty, especially given the nature of their careers. In fact, many of them become un- documented migrants who must work illegally in low-end jobs in order to sustain themselves while they continue to pursue their aspirations, and most do not achieve success. However, precisely because of such challenges, Japanese artistic migrants recount triumphalist narratives that empha- size their independence, creativity, and personal strength, and they look down on their more privileged corporate compatriots in the United States, who live conventional lives without freedom and adventure. As a result, their mi- grant experiences are a source of self-making and personal realization that were not possible in Japan, which they view as overly controlled and provincial and lacking in creative opportunities. While they perceive their Japanese cultural background to be an impediment to universal artistic creativ- ity and professional success in New York City, some of them also promote their Japaneseness in their artistic work as a strategic choice for marketing and publicity purposes. In this way, Japanese national identity and culture is constructed in foreign contexts as both constraining and enabling. Despite the book's merits, it is difcult to ignore some of its shortcomings. The ethnography appears to be based on extensive multisited eldwork in both New York City and Japan, and Kanzaki Sooudi is to be commended for conducting extensive participant-observation by working at businesses where Japanese artistic migrants nd informal, low-skilled employment. However, a good amount of the material presented in the book is based on secondary sources, such as literature and ction, lms, websites and blogs, and books and essays written by Japanese migrants. The inclusion of such diverse source material is sometimes justied and enriches the narrative and analysis, but more often they tend to be digressive distractions that are less interesting and relevant. I also wondered whether Kanzaki Sooudi did not have enough primary eldwork material to analyze and therefore inserted discussions of this secondary material.Some of the chapters also seem to lack organizational structure and coherence. This is most evident in chapter 5, which is supposed to be about the ambivalent relation- ships among Japanese migrants and their lack of a sense of community. However, it ends up being a disjointed collec- tion of three accounts, one from the author's participant- observation at a sushi restaurant, another from a lm, and the third from an interview. It is never clear how these ac- counts relate to each other or the purported topic of the chapter. Chapter 6 begins with an intriguing, participant- observation-based discussion of gossip and rumors about failed Japanese migrants, a topic that has been underana- lyzed in immigration studies. However, it then deviates into discourses about Japanese migrant pathology and ends with migrant perceptions about the limitations of Japaneseness, which belongs in an earlier chapter. In fact, some chapters read like a stream of consciousness wherein the topic and source materials shift in a somewhat disjointed manner. The book is also characterized by limited engagement with theory. Kanzaki Sooudi chose to focus on migrant nar- ratives and texts, and these discussions include plenty of insightful interpretive comments with citations to litera- ture. However, the few, short theoretical discussions in the Introduction are never used in subsequent chapters, and the highly relevant theoretical literature about migration and mobility is generally ignored. The issue of authenticity is often invoked in the book, but relevant literature is hardly discussed, and the concept is dened in so many different ways that it loses its utility. The discussion of transnational- ism is also very brief, and the concept is actually misapplied in two chapters to refer to strictly local encounters and lives in New York City. The value of the book therefore mainly lies in the quality of the personal narratives, which are interspersed with often insightful and eloquent discussions. For those interested in the subject of Japanese artistic migrants, this itself makes the book worth reading. The Mixtecs of Oaxaca: Ancient Times to the Present by Ronald Spores and Andrew K. Balkansky Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2013. 328 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12631 Marc N. Levine Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, University of Oklahoma InThe Mixtecs of Oaxaca , Ronald Spores and Andrew Balkansky shine a bright light on the 3,000-year history of the Mixtec people, or Nuu Dzahui \u2014one of the largestindigenous groups in Mexico today. The authors emphasize the northern Mixteca Alta region and focus on benchmarks in Mixtec culture history, including the initial development of pre-Hispanic urban centers, cultural transformations following the Spanish conquest, and developments during the period after independence. In many ways, it reads like the nal installment of a trilogy of works by Spores, following The Mixtecs in Ancient and Colonial Times (1984) and its predecessor, The Mixtec Kings and Their People (1967).696 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 Like those previous efforts, this book is written for a broader-than-academic audience and is neatly packaged intotwo halves covering the pre-Hispanic and postconquest eras.This effort is distinguished by the addition of Balkansky,who adds ballast to the book's rst section on archaeology, while the second section covering ethnohistory remains very much Spores's domain. This review focuses on thebook's rst half, covering Mixtec archaeology. The authors begin by promoting a \"convergent\" method- ology for Mixtec studies, stressing the need to integratemultiple data sets, especially from archaeology and ethno-history. This echoes the anthropological approach pioneeredby Alfonso Caso, whose breadth and quality of scholarshipduring the mid-20th century remains a high watermark forOaxacan studies. In terms of the book's theoretical moor-ings, the authors stress ecological and functional consider-ations, referring, for instance, to Mixtec culture as \"servingfundamentally adaptive functions\" and Mixtec cities as \"'su-perorganic' means of integration\" (p. 33). In keeping withthis somewhat-anachronistic approach, the authors praise the\"empirical utility\" of archaeological results from projects \"inthe 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s,\" while deriding more recent\"empty theoretical approaches that are often employed inMesoamerica\" (p. 6). This critique is at once indiscriminate(whose \"empty\" approaches?) and cynical, given Oaxaca'sprominence as a virtual proving ground for innovativetheoretical archaeological work. Unfortunately, the bookdeemphasizes or ignores many important contributions fromthe past few decades\u2014especially those of junior scholars. The second chapter emphasizes the development of the rst population centers in the Mixteca Alta during the Earlyto Middle Formative Period. This includes a useful summaryof regional surveys led by Stephen Kowalewski and a discus-sion of early capitals such as Yucuita and Tayata. A summaryof excavations at the latter site, carried out by Balkansky,are highlighted to good effect but lack the detail necessary tobe of great use to other specialists. The authors argue com-pellingly that more Mixtec research ought to focus on localdynamics rather than relying solely on external forces toexplain sociocultural change. They reject any \"mother-like\"Olmec influence in the Mixteca Alta, instead arguing thatsites like Tayata made contributions to new and more com-plex social formations through competitive interaction with peers in the Gulf Coast and elsewhere. Yet in supporting this position, they cite population estimates of 40,000 forthe Mixteca Alta during the Middle Formative\u2014a numbersome will nd implausibly high. Even if accurate, skeptics will point out that high population alone does not necessarilylead to complex political formations and will bristle at theirsuggestion that \"one might readily argue that the Mixtecwere the mother culture, rather than the reverse\" (p. 52). The authors suggest that urbanization in the Late Forma- tive Mixteca Alta may have been triggered by imperial incur-sions by Monte Alb \u00b4an\u2014located in the Valley of Oaxaca. This external threat purportedly spurred Mixtec polities to bandtogether as a means of defense, similar to the \"synoikism\"model put forth by Joyce Marcus and Kent Flannery (1996)for the founding of Monte Alb \u00b4an. What about local political and historical considerations within the Mixteca? What isneeded is more comparative data from controlled excava-tions at Mixtec centers to better evaluate how they emergedin tandem and their relationships to extraregional polities. Spores and Balkansky rightly point out that variability in the urban traditions among Classic Mixtec centers resisteasy characterization. This begs the question of how thisvariability may reflect differences in sociopolitical orga-nization, yet the authors fail to explore this possibility.Instead, they present a facile comparison of Classic andPostclassic Mixtec polities that overemphasizes theirsimilarities while downplaying important differences.Later, in sections covering the Postclassic yuhuitayu ,t h e i r discussion would have benetted from a more detailedexamination of the senior author's multiyear excavationproject at Teposcolula-Yucundaa. The second half of the book traces the history and political economy of the Mixteca during the ve centuriesfollowing the Spanish conquest. This builds on Spores'sseminal ethnohistoric work and provides a synthesis writtenwith a great clarity worth emulating. The most compellingsections drill down to share portraits of historical gures,best illustrated in the section describing women rulers orcacicas who ruled Mixtec capitals during the Colonial era.

This contradistinction in the administration of difference between the Ottoman and republican eras gives pluralism added valency in the Turkish context. One would expect the recent turn to history by excluded groups as crucial to an emerging pluralist Polity. Kabir Tambar's book critically examines the limits to minority recognition and inclusion through an analysis of the Alevi community, whose religious difference\u2014although varied and contested\u2014is distinguishable from the majority Sunnis. This religious difference, however, is not registered by the state, for it does not recognize sectarian differences within the Muslim community. Can Alevi religiosity, es- pecially its Shi'i-derived religious practices, be allowed to fully and publically express alterity? Or are there limits to the representation and signication of Alevi difference? Tambar argues that the recognition of Alevi difference is only possible through publically approved forms, such as cultural performances, insofar as these do not disturb the dominant discourses and sensibilities of Turkish national- ism and Sunni majoritarianism. In successive chapters, he delineates the disciplinary knowledges through which Ale- vis were foundationally incorporated as ethnically Turk and their religious difference domesticated (ch. 3); the aesthetic sensibilities that manage, transform, or render illegitimate potentially potent forms of ritual difference (ch. 4); and the inadequacy of history for recognizing and recuperating religious difference. Chapter 3 is particularly compelling as the author pro- vides a fascinating account of how the disciplines of sociology and anthropology, in the late Ottoman and early republican era, classied Alevis as ethnic Turks while simultaneously territorializing Shi'i religious and ritual practices as local Anatolian customs and folk traditions. Explicit Shi'i ritual practices such as the commemoration of Husayn's death at Karbala were downplayed and eventually silenced. Conse- quently, the Alevi were simultaneously inscribed within the nation whilst their religious practices, redesignated as folk- lore, were read as a sign of the nation's historical depth.Political inclusion was premised on the double maneuver of ethnic classication and the temporalization of difference into autochthony. The critical project of The Reckoning of Pluralism ,t h e n , is to interrogate the complex array of governing techniques, disciplinary practices, aesthetic sensibilities, and norms of public sociability by examining them in relation to two kinds of critique. The rst is the critical historical imperative that seeks to disrupt nationalist historiography but within the epistemological conditions of disciplinary history and mod- ern political subjectivity. The second is the delineation of the limits of this historicism through attention to an alterna- tive subjectivity\u2014that is, through ethnographic attention to a small group concerned with reviving devotional mourn- ing practices commemorating Karbala. While numerically limited, Tambar notes that the Alevi have generated dis- proportionate controversy because they unsettle the dense web of discourses, imaginaries, and affect that mark secu- lar sensibilities. Those involved were primarily concerned with reconstituting a religious tradition in order to cultivate appropriate religious dispositions but have been drawn into debates with Alevi advocates of pluralism. The latter re- gard religious devotionalism as anachronistic and incapable of contributing toward a pluralist politics. Tambar acknowl- edges that these religious forms of vocality and visibility are not intelligible to modern politics, for it is the very successes of the secular disciplines, institutions, and practices of the modernizing project and its political forms that have been productive of contemporary political subjectivity. History and historicism are both formative and reflective of this, and thus he questions the political and academic turn to history as a means of writing social histories of difference, of giving \"voice.\" In the Alevi case, where the crucial difference is religious, history, with its epistemological and ontological prerequisites, is a trap. Yet, and herein lies the poignancy of the account, it is almost impossible to escape the iron cage of history. The revival of religious devotionalism in such a con- text can only serve as \"critical provocation\" that illuminates \"the disciplinary assemblage that has framed the problem of Alevi religious identity within the historicist narratives of the nation\" (p. 143). Where does this leave us? Tambar says his goal is to \"open a space for conceptualizing a certain kind of politics that arises in relation to those limits\" (p. 23). As such it is a ground-clearing exercise\u2014one that is theoretically and methodologically indebted to Talal Asad's appropriation and inflection of Michel Foucault in the anthropology of Islam; a project whose critical force partly stems from investigating698 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 religious forms of difference to render the contemporary structures of liberal secular sensibility, its governing tech- nologies and exclusionary practices, as objects of anthro- pological analysis. While this is a compelling and necessary task, it can at times overemphasize the rationality of various discursive formations and, as such, risks overplaying ssureswhile deemphasizing links between discourses and social groups that may harbor new potentialities. The \"limit,\" one senses, is as much a connection as a separation in this subtle, thoughtful, and unsettling account that will force pluralists to think more carefully about their attachments and practices of exclusion. Preserving the Old City of Damascus by Faedah M.Totah Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 2014. 328 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12618 Michael D. Danti American Schools of Oriental Research This urban ethnography seeks to disentangle the mani- fold cultural forces shaping the Old City of Damascus and how human-built environment interactions varyingly affect a wide range of interlinked social actors. Faedah Totah evaluates efforts to safeguard the Old City, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979, and the unin- tended consequences attendant with \"heritagization,\" against the backdrop of Syria's tumultuous internal politics and foreign relations, economic neoliberalization, globalization, and manipulations and reformulations of cultural identity. Like similar works on place making, historic preser- vation, and gentrication, Totah adopts multiscalar anal- ysis, from the much-documented structuring role of the traditional courtyard house (Arabic beit 'arabi ) to considera- tions of the Old City neighborhood within the sociopolitical and economic milieu of Damascus, to the impacts of the progressive policies of Syria's Ba'athist regime since 1963, and back to how such forces continually transform the Old City and its social actors. The analysis is diachronic, cover- ing the period from the late Ottoman period to the early years of the Syrian Civil War, but the author's ethnographic research in the 1990s and early 2000s forms the central focus. Totah embraces a reflexive, phenomenological approach to human-built environment interactions to explore deeper patterns, structures, and meanings through dialectical bi- nary oppositions. Through a historic process of accrued metonyms, the Old City symbolizes the urban, \"civilized\" core; its binary opposite of \"backwardness\"; and nally a gentried UNESCO World Heritage Site, embodying an idealized and nostalgic Shami (Damascene) identity. Totah adeptly interweaves her own experiences living in Damas- cus as well as interviews from current and former Old City residents, heritage experts, and investors. In chapter 1, the author reviews the policies of the Late Ottoman and French Mandate periods and subsequent nationalist governments, especially the foundational workof French architect and urban planner Michel Ecochard and his ardent critics. Totah provides an overview of the Old City through a walking tour relating \"how the history of Damascus is visible in the cityscape\" and how these elements \"index a civilizational component to the intramural neigh- borhoods\" (p. 47). The author continually returns to the binary opposition of civilization ( hadarah ) versus backward- ness explication of this urban palimpsest takes us through the transformation of the Old City from urban center and abode of the merchant classes to what many Shuwam (Damascenes) viewed as a socially and architecturally atavistic enclave subsumed within, and in- creasingly divorced from, a modern, sprawling urbanscape of cement high-rises and townhouses. The vernacular style deed modernity because it \"encouraged extended patriar- chal families, gender segregation, submission of individual will, and religiosity that could border on the extreme and radical\" (p. 53). Chapter 2 expands on an imbricating binary opposition manifested and mediated within the Old City\u2014the urban- rural divide and the clash of identities that occurred as the Shuwam slowly moved out, leaving the Old City to rural migrants. Totah presents a Shami emic perspective in which the newcomers are perceived as oblivious to the Old City's civilization and immune to its civilizing effects. These mi- grant tenants would later be swept aside through real estate speculation and gentrication. Chapter 3 surveys the architecture of the courtyard house. Totah acquaints us with the different experiences of the original Shami occupants and the rural newcomers and how these lifeways lead to varying perceptions of the built en- vironment and engender conflicting social discourses. Totah educes important variations in the occupants' perceptions, such as differing assessments of the beit 'arabi by men and women in daily life. In chapters 4 and 5, Totah examines the cultural agency of historic preservation starting with the gentriers, a hetero- geneous class unied only by a nebulous vision of an imagined Shami past. Their efforts are juxtaposed with the misgivings of many Damascenes with regard to the privatized and often- corrupt process of historic preservation, frequently viewed as a \"deliberate attempt to undermine the Shuwam and toBook Reviews 699 corrupt their culture\" (p. 170). Chapter 5 continues with the renovation and restoration process with a discussion of the investors ( mustathmirin ) who transformed the Old City to provide new venues of consumption, creating an urban hotspot of restaurants, hotels, boutiques, and art galleries with a Shami veneer of authenticity to entice the Damascene elite and cosmopolitan set. Chapter 6 evaluates the outcomes of heritage preserva- tion. Totah returns to the assault from within on the Old City's intangible dimensions and its built environment as well as the consequences of state-sponsored place making and safeguarding of heritage. An epilogue provides Totah's reflections on the impacts of the current civil war.This volume will interest all those engaged in ur- ban ethnography, human-environment interactions, historic preservation, and the current cultural heritage crisis in the Middle East and North Africa. The author's work is no mere \"ethnographic salvage\"\u2014a twilight glimpse of prewar Damascus\u2014but, rather, a highly revealing and engagingly written expos \u00b4e on the powerful role of heritage in the con- struction, negotiation, and manipulation of cultural identity and cultural memory. Ultimately, Totah traverses familiar terrain: how vibrant communities are sacriced on the altar of heritagization. Whether such losses stem from wayward idealism, calculated design, or some combination thereof is left for us to infer. Trojan Horse Aid: Seeds of Resistance and Resilience in the Bolivian Highlands and Beyond by Susan Walsh Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2014. 352 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12615 Kate McGurn Centellas University of Mississippi Trojan Horse Aid is an ethnography of a person\u2014the author\u2014 more than an ethnography of a place or its people. Author Susan Walsh conducted research in the municipality of Rav- elo, Chuquisaca, Bolivia, for her dissertation in the early 2000s while on leave from her professional position as a development ofcer for a large organization. She returned to Bolivia in 2011 for follow-up research, and the book is a product of these two trips. Walsh writes in a rst-person, intimate, stream-of- consciousness conversational style. We learn how happy she was to hike into her research sites, about her daughter's emergency appendectomy, and about how she chipped her elbow and had a difcult time taking eld notes. The fore- grounding of her makes the study readable and relatable, important for an introductory class, but obscures some of the details and nuances of how she came to be working in Bolivia in the rst place (for instance, little discussion is given to her collaborators with the local NGO). Though this style means that the book could be used in an introductory course quite easily, it is also a drawback of the book as a scholarly work. In fact, the book in many ways reads as a somewhat outdated ethnography. Walsh made several stylistic choices that obscure the scholarly impact of the work. For instance, throughout the book, \"indigenous\" is capitalized, without any explanation as to why. Common convention is lowercase to avoid reifying the identity category. It is worth noting that the Spanish term is also not capitalized.Similarly, throughout the book, frequent reference is made to romantic notions of indigenous peoples and prod- ucts as somehow special or pure (\"independent and produc- tive lives on their ancestral lands\" [p. 21]), which sometimes slips into expressions that are reminiscent of salvage ethnog- raphy (\"however threatened and eroded, the ecological com- plementarity system I found in Chayanta was maintaining those fundamentals\" [p. 83]). This orientation is more worrisome than the odd capital- ization choice (though perhaps related). It speaks to a rather simplistic notion of indigenous communities and their rela- tionships with one another and with nonindigenous peoples. the year 2000, Moj \u00b4on residents' interac- tion with external institutions was in fact only four years old. In contrast, Chimpa Rodeo had an approximately twenty- year history of external development assistance\" (p. 35). As a reader and scholar of Bolivia, I am left wondering how \"external\" is dened and which institutions count. It sounds as if only foreign ones do\u2014but then what does that say about Walsh's view of the Bolivian state and local govern- ments? How are these not external to local ayllus? What of older colonial patterns of settlement and interaction with bureaucracy? This is a strange lacuna, considering the em- phasis placed on history and change in contemporary cultural anthropology. Overall, I wanted more details about the various orga- nizations, more Bolivia-scale specicity, and more critical analysis. The chapters themselves are fairly short and not always narratively well connected. In sum, the book reads as a fairly uncritical and un- dertheorized case study focused in large extent on the ethnographer\u2014a critique supported by the thin references in the chapters and the reliance on older sources in the700 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 bibliography. However, it could be useful for new students of anthropology who need an accessible entr \u00b4ee into the discipline, as the story being told\u2014about resilience and change in rural Bolivia from the rst-person perspective ofthe ethnographer\u2014could easily capture their attention and interest. It could also be used to open a discussion of reflex- ivity, subjectivity, and trends in ethnographic theory in an introductory class. Everyday Moral Economies: Food, Politics and Scale in Cuba by Marisa Wilson Adriana Premat The University of Western Ontario At a time when the U.S. government readies to end its over 50-year-old economic embargo against Cuba, which was intended to force political change in the socialist nation by restricting its access to needed goods, the photo on the cover of Everyday Moral Economies (a peasant's empty hand stretched out in a begging gesture) invites multiple readings. Far from being a direct reference to the impacts of the embargo, the image encapsulates two interrelated themes discussed in Marisa Wilson's book: food scarcity and the institutionalized practice of a \"scaled-up\" reciprocity where \"good\" socialist citizens contribute to the common good by giving up the fruits of their labor so that the state, through \"just\" redistribution, can guarantee the population's basic needs (p. 54). In 2005, when Wilson commenced eldwork among the residents of a rural community near the capital city of Havana, this socialist version of reciprocity had already been put into question by the economic reforms that ensued from the breakdown of the Soviet Bloc\u2014reforms that had created a two-tier ofcial economy in which necessities like food no longer appeared to be distributed justly. While poor-quality, subsidized food continued to circulate as social entitlement via the state redistribution networks, higher- quality food became a commodity available for purchase at market prices via new commercial food venues available to those who could afford them. Against this backdrop, and mirroring the trajectory of many other ethnographers conducting research in post-1989 Cuba, Wilson became interested in how average citizens managed the apparent contradictions between the two moral economies associated with these disparate, co-existing food networks. Although Wilson dedicates some time to discussing the existence (and appeal) in the Cuban context of a \"global,\" neoliberal moral economy that promotes individual initiative and legitimizes the selsh search for individual self-provisioning, prot, and pleasure, she spends the bulk of her book tracing the historical evolution (ch. 2) and thecontinued resonance of a socialist \"national\" moral economy that places a high value on self-sacrice, resistance against all odds, and individual contributions to the common good (chs. 3, 4, and 6), ultimately upholding the notion of food as a collective right rather than as a mere commodity. In this context, even the act of stealing from the state, when done to meet the needs of a \"scaled-down\" national community of relatives and acquaintances, is justied as a moral act of \"just\" distribution, \"grabbing\" from the state only what is needed by the collective (p. 136). As a native Spanish speaker who noted multiple Spanish spelling errors in the book, I was disturbed by the extent to which Wilson builds much of her analysis around her own selective exegesis of Spanish words and expressions, such as la lucha (struggle), luchador (ghter), familiar (kin or acquain- tance), and cultura (culture), among many others. While the word luchador/a could be used, as Wilson suggests, to morally link a hardworking, honest person \"heroically\" engaged in \"just\" food provisioning with much-admired national heroes of the past (p. 86), it can also be used, as she reluctantly acknowledges (p. 87), to describe jineteros /as (prostitutes), who are considered selsh, prot-seeking individuals who should be excluded from the national moral community (pp. 145-148). Regrettably, in this and other instances, Wilson does little to iron out the questions that such disparate interpretations raise about the consistency of her lexically inclined argumentation. Another problematic aspect of Wilson's analysis concerns her rather supercial treatment of food production via an ethnographically thin overview of Havana's urban agriculture sector. The latter draws on sparse interview data and a few outdated sources to delineate the experiences and perspectives of those involved in this eld. In her preface, Wilson indirectly acknowledges the serious gaps in this data by explaining that the sphere of production was \"the least penetrable\" to her (p. xix). Yet she chooses to dedicate chapter 6 entirely to this topic, attempting to connect her previous arguments on everyday moral economies to the limited data she collected on the politics of sustainable food production and food sovereignty in Havana. In her concluding remarks, Wilson returns to these subjects in a confusing argument on \"alternative economic geographies,\"Book Reviews 701 wherein she draws a contrived parallel between some aspects of Cuba's \"domestic food economy\" and \"alternative food networks\" like La Via Campesina. The most ethnographically grounded chapters in Everyday Moral Economies (chs. 3, 4, and 5) provide a thought-provoking analysis of the moral underpinnings ofeveryday economic practice in contemporary Cuba that merits reading. Unfortunately, the overall theoretical ar- mature of the book, as well as the data mobilized to support the argument presented, fall short of expectations so that, in the end, the reader is left feeling \"empty handed,\" much like the generic peasant portrayed on the book's cover. Class Work: Vocational Schools and China's Urban Youth by T. E. Woronov Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2016. 200 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12633 Minhua Ling The Chinese University of Hong Kong Class Work examines the political economy of China's often-neglected vocational education system and its implied cultural politics of class formation. Combining subtle ethnography and insightful analysis, it offers an incisive cri- tique of the hegemony of human capital accumulation. Based on eld research in two vocational schools in Nanjing, this book demonstrates that the high-stakes High School Entrance Examination (HSEE) serves as a water- shed mechanism of \"class sorting\" in contemporary China, channeling millions of youth, mostly of working-class back- grounds, to low-end service jobs via urban vocational sec- ondary schools. It points out that half of the Chinese middle- school graduates would fail in the HSEE by state design despite individual efforts. However, Chinese youth who at- tend vocational schools instead of academic high schools are deemed \"both academic and moral failures\" (p. 3) and blamed \"for their own failed future possibilities\" (p. 62) in public discourse. This book reveals in rich ethno- graphic details how such \"individualized and depoliticized notions of social causality\" (p. 63) conceal structural in- equality and (re)produce class division. It coins the notion of \"numeric capital\" to highlight the fetish of numbers in China's exam-oriented education system and criticizes its underlying value system of equating young people's exam scores with their academic achievement and social value at large. In the moral economy of \"numeric capital,\" it is the individuals, not the system that requires almost half of middle school students to fail, who have to shoulder the responsibility for their inferior positions in China's hi- erarchical school system. Hence the ideology of \"numeric capital\" is \"a moral system that supports a structural one\" (p. 63) and plays a crucial role in the state's class-sorting process. The ideology of \"numeric capital\" extends to vocational schools and shapes their curricular designs and teachingpractices (ch. 3). The problem of \"devocationalization\" is found in the two vocational schools, which \"skew their curricula away from practical courses and skills training toward theory and academic content to appease students and parents\" (p. 76) because academic study is held as more desirable in the regime of \"numeric capital.\" Such theoretical orientations, nevertheless, discourage vocational school students from investing time and effort in schoolwork. The incongruence between curriculum and job prospects exasperates the students' rueful yet rational behaviors of \"wasting time\" in the classroom. This reies the stereotype of vocational school students being lazy and stupid and conrms their lack of \"numeric capital\" in the progressive future-oriented framework of human capital accumulation embraced by postreform China. Vocational school students' experiences of internships and job markets (ch. 5) further illuminate how the nor- mative discourse of human capital accumulation renders these students, who have neither training nor awareness to make informed choices and present progressive life sto- ries, as deviant and inferior to middle-class norms. While it is true that employment opportunities in China's grow- ing service economy are good for vocational students, the nature of available jobs is often \"precarious, possibly short- term, likely dead-end\" (pp. 114-115). Frequent \"jumpings\" from one entry-level job to another according to \"short- term, instrumental logics\" (p. 134) results in horizontal rather than vertical mobility, another way of class sorting that locks these youth \"out of middle-class, white-collar jobs\" (p. 135). While Woronov shows clearly that the class position of vocational school graduates lies in the lower echelon of urban China's service economy, it remains unclear whether these students have distinct identity or class consciousness. Chapters 2 and 4 show social diversities among both schools' students in terms of family background, place of origin and native dialect, and their fluid identities that defy singular categorization. These students from \"rural, urban working class, and second-generation migrant families\" (p. 23) interact with each other at school and form702 American Anthropologist Vol. 118, No. 3 September 2016 friendships across the common urban-rural and local- migrant divides. However, lack of close connections among them after graduation suggests the atomization of their adult lives. The regime of \"numeric capital,\" which holds individuals responsible for their futures through studying and producing test scores, also mitigates \"against collective action and identities\" (p. 149). This book hence ends with a mixed, sometimes incoherent tone on the prospects of class formation in urban China. Woronov parallels these Chinese youth with the \"precariat,\" which refers to urban youth in postindustrial economies who are trapped in low-skilled, part-time jobs. However, she puts more optimism in the Chinese case by pointing out how these youth still have moreopportunities than their parents do in China's transitional economy. As discussed in the conclusion, Woronov's frustrating encounter with Chinese graduate students in social science who constantly questioned the signicance of her research in 2013 reveals poignantly the internalization of \"numeric capital\" among China's educated elites and the entrenched depoliticization of social stratication and inequality after economic reforms. Hence, this book is a timely and important addition to the literature on education, youth, class, and value systems in China and comparable societies that embrace progressive ideologies of human capital and economic development. Consumption in China: How China's New Consumer Ideology Is Shaping the Nation by LiAnne Yu Cambridge: Polity, 2014. 176 pp. DOI: 10.1111/aman.12658 Jun Zhang The University of Hong Kong The rising middle class in China's urban centers, with its startling spending power, has attracted global attention, particularly from transnational corporations and con- sultancies. The author LiAnne Yu is well positioned to provide some incisive portraits of this assortment of people through their consumption practices and attitudes. With a doctoral degree in sociocultural anthropology, Yu has been conducting research for global companies mainly in big cities such as Shanghai and Beijing. She visited China for the rst time as a U.S.-China exchange student in 1990, one year after Tiananmen Square Protest in Beijing. Her work has since brought her back to China repeatedly. Yu's long engagement has proved a valuable source of information that helps her contextualize consumption choices and expressions in social transformations. Based on her observation and research for over two decades, Yu asks the question: What does consumption mean to the members of the emerging middle and upper middle class, \"who grew up under the most austere years of socialism,\" and to their children, \"who have only known a prospering, capitalistic China\" (p. 9)? Drawing on Thorstein Veblen's (1899) classic study of conspicuous consumption based on his observations of n de si `ecle America, Yu argues that consumption allows the middle class to surround them- selves with visible symbols as a way to establish their social status (chs. 2 and 3). The old status system was associated with and maintained by a political rhetoric of class and related institutional practices such as rural-urban divide, householdregistration, and the rationing system of daily necessities un- der the planned economy. This system gradually collapsed with the party-state's reform efforts to vitalize its economy since the late 1970s. Facing the volatile social transforma- tions and a drastically different conguration of social hier- archy, the desire to \"be recognised for continuous striving and upward mobility, is at the heart of Chinese consumers' everyday experiences of status making\" (p. 92). Consumer goods are not merely \"good\" to show off one's economic capacity; they are also \"good\" to demonstrate one's achieve- ments as a self-made individual through entrepreneurialism and hard work, a practice Yu terms \"conspicuous accom- plishment.\" This practice distinguishes the Chinese middle class not only from the corrupted ofcials, the offspring of political and economic elites in China, but also from Veblen's leisure class who sought to demonstrate effortless wealth. Yu seeks to present the Chinese middle class as sophisticated consumers that are neither liberated agents nor victims of capitalism. They actively appropriate signs, styles, and practices, made available by the newly obtained consumption space, to refashion the self, to make sense of the past and the present, to engage in an imagined, global community, and to act out their own version of everyday modernity. They feel empowered, as consumers, to articulate concerns with eroding moral standards, food safety, environment, and other issues. Meanwhile, Yu also stresses that a series of structural factors have congured middle-class consumption practices. Both the state's withdrawal from certain aspects of private lives and its continuous control over reproduction has led to the emergence of the notion of family time. The reinstated importance of the family has shaped the prominence of shopping and other consumption practices in people'sBook Reviews 703 everyday life from childbearing and family care to leisure activities (chs. 2 and 5). Transnational companies, in theplace of the party-state in Mao's China or family membersin the Western society context, have become the educatorsfor the young middle class to congure the ideal of the self through consumer goods (ch. 5). Increased access to technologies contributes to the valorization of the selfand socialization of consumers through online shopping,commenting, and instant sharing through smartphones andapps (chs. 2, 4, and 5). However, that socialization has notevolved into a public sphere for rational debates and freeexpression, as nationalism and political censorship continueto act as the constraining forces (ch. 6). Yu provides rich data and nuanced elaboration on the older generation of middle-class consumers mentioned inher main research question of what consumption means, but her analysis is less convincing regarding their children,who are growing up in the new economy. The focus on consumption risks understating the influences of otherstructural and institutional changes, such as family andschooling, on status making and recognition. Nonetheless,Consumption in China is a timely contribution to the growing literature on the emerging Chinese middle class. Its engaging writing style makes it a good read for undergraduates anda general audience who are interested in China's new sociallandscape at large. Its rich ethnographic data will be usefulfor scholars who want to extend current debates on theentanglement of the market and the state, technopolitics,and consumption and the legitimization of social inequality.
