Immunisation is key to prevent the deaths of children.", "sitename": "UNICEF UK", "date": "2011-05-27", "cleaned_text": "Vaccines are the world's safest method to protect children from life-threatening diseases. Deadly diseases like measles, polio, tetanus, tuberculosis, diphtheria and whooping cough are all easily and cheaply preventable by vaccination. Yet every day, 16,000 children under five die, usually because they don't get the health care and life-saving vaccines they need. We provide vaccines to immunise almost half of the world's children against preventable diseases, and with our partners support immunisation programmes in over 100 countries to keep children safe. We work to strengthen health systems and turn vaccines into vaccinations - training health workers, improving supply chains, providing safe storage like solar-powered cold storage equipment, and disease surveillance to track or predict outbreaks Since 1980, we have helped quadruple immunisation rates for children worldwide, saving up to 3 million children's lives a year. Today more children are protected than ever before, but there is still more work to be done. Life-saving vaccines for Anirlan WE'RE SAVING CHILDREN'S LIVES ALL OVER THE WORLD We provide more than 2 billion doses of vaccines each year, reaching 45% of the world's children under five. In an emergency, we don't forget vaccines In the midst of a crisis - whether it's the ongoing brutality of war or the immediate chaos of natural disaster - we deliver vaccination campaigns to help protect vulnerable children when health services are down. In 2021, 22.4 million children were vaccinated against measles in humanitarian emergencies across 48 countries. Hanna fled Kyiv with her family, but was able to get her children vaccinated. Many Ukrainians, like Hanna, have found themselves far from home without a family doctor. We are supporting the Ukrainian Government's immunisation progamme to help protect children from life-threatening diseases. And we protect children from malaria Malaria is one of the greatest dangers for children in sub-Saharan Africa, killing one child every minute. Malaria is spread via mosquitos, so children in malaria countries are in most danger when they're asleep. Malaria symptoms include fever, headache and vomiting. If not treated, malaria can be deadly. We secured supplies of the first ever malaria vaccine in 2022. 18 million doses will be made available over the next three years, potentially saving thousands of lives each year. We are also one of the world's largest distributors of nets to protect children from mosquito bites. In 2021, the Ministry of Health of Public Hygiene in collaboration with UNICEF and USAID distributed a total of 18.5 million mosquito nets, reaching over 6 million households "}
