Since then I have begun using these wonderful remedies in my homeopathic practice with most impressive results. As a classically trained homeopath, I am finding a complementary place in my practice for both homeopathy and gemmotherapy. One of my first experiences with gemmotherapy was with a patient who had been suffering from severe allergies from the Chinese Elm trees that lined his street. I gave him European Hornbeam, and within 2 days, he no longer needed Claritin. He called to tell me, \"This is miraculous, now I don't have to move from my neighborhood.\" As the feedback from patients continued to be favorable, I decided to focus on treatment during the upcoming winter months. For instance, I gave many of my pediatric patients Briar Rose several times a week during the winter for preventive care. Many parents reported less colds and runny nose. When children did become sick, it was less severe. In my own household, my 6 year old kindergartner didn't suffer his yearly cough.
