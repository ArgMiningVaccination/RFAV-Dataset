This can be an exciting yet stressful time for parents and kids alike. Why stressful? Because it is also the time to think about getting prepared for the common cold and flu, as well as the current COVID-19 pandemic. The cold and flu season runs from October until April along with the COVID-19 pandemic, and most cases are seen in the winter months. The peak of influenza (the flu) disease in New England is typically in February. What is Influenza? Influenza is a respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. Influenza is extremely contagious and is easily transmitted through contact with droplets from the nose and throat of an infected person during coughing and sneezing. These viruses may also be spread when a person touches these droplets on another person or an object and then touches their own mouth or nose (or someone else's mouth or nose) before washing their hands. Fatema Meah, MD (Peconic Pediatrics, Riverhead & Southold, NY) \"The flu is not fun. Symptoms may include high fever, body aches, headache, dry cough, sore throat, and extreme fatigue. Stomach symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can occur and are much more common in children than in adults. Although anyone can get the flu, there are some groups that are at high risk for complications.\" The high-risk groups include: - Adults 50 and older, especially those 65 and older - Children 6 months - 18 years - People age 6 months and older with chronic medical conditions, including heart disease, pulmonary disorders (including asthma), diabetes, kidney disease, hemoglobinopathies, and compromised immune systems (HIV or immunosuppressive therapy). - People with certain conditions (such as neuromuscular disorders) that can cause breathing problems. - Pregnant women - Residents of nursing homes and chronic-care facilities Other individuals are at high risk of transmitting the flu. These include: - Health care workers involved in direct patient care - Out-of-home caregivers and household contacts of children aged < 6 months. There are natural ways to survive the cold and flu seasons. The best prevention is avoidance of course but if avoidance is not option because you're a parent or take public transportation, I can help optimize your immune system through an alternative approach. Together we will work on creating a personal immune system support protocol using organic whole food supplements, herbal medicine and/or homeopathy to help combat these viruses. Who may benefit from this: You are healthy and fit and are seeking to optimize your health even further. *The current COVID-19 pandemic makes you want to strengthen your immune system and optimize your health. You prefer not to take pharmaceutical medication to strengthen your immune system or address the root cause of a symptom. You want to try an alternative organic approach to supplement the care you are already receiving from your physician. "}
