Our goal is to be transparent about each of our products and processes while educating our community on natural nourishment. What better place to start than a look into each of our ingredients, the climate they thrive in, what part of the plant we use for our tea blends, what they individually taste like, what role they play in our purposeful blends and what part of the world we source them from! [Click here to skip to list of herbs.](#herbs) [This List of Herbs / Ingredients Guide Includes:] [Inspiration Behind Our Woash Blends](#inspo) Chart](#howto) [Taste Guide](#taste) [List of Herbs](#herbs) Inspiration Behind Our Blends As I, the founder of WOASH stood in the foothills of an Indonesian tea plantation soaking up every last bit of knowledge this 5thgeneration tea maker had to offer me I became curious about this one unique plant and its endless benefits that I was so unfamiliar with, yet I had been sipping tea since I was 10 years old. To read more about 'Our Story' click [here](https://woashwellness.com/pages/about-us). It was from this moment, plus a lot of procrastination, wrong turns, learning lessons and inspiring teachers that I became determined to disrupt the overly industrialized North American tea industry by bringing purpose back into each mug through transparency, education and example. About Our Blends Our blends aim to bridge the gap between traditional herbal medicine and modern wellness where each blend is rooted in ancient tradition consisting of: - Tea with purpose - Globally sourced sustainable ingredients - Organic whole leaf ingredients - Purely herbs (no additives or funny business) Throughout my many travels overseas I witness the importance of indigenous herbs within each culture and the important role they played in their ceremonies, practices and medicine cabinets. This encouraged me to use ingredients from the source ensuring their authenticity and quality. Partnering with only certified organic farms, and processes that favoured whole-leaf rather than the remanence left over, (learn more about quality of tea in our ['Best Loose Leaf Tea Guide', here](https://woashwellness.com/pages/best-loose-leaf-tea)) while refusing to add any flavourings or sweeteners to amplify herbs natural flavour and purposeful benefits. Here's what a customer has to say about our blends! \"I absolutely love all Woash's teas, but if I had to pick a favourite it would be Revive! I love how refreshing, light, and delicious this tea is! I don't drink coffee so this is the perfect drink to sip in the mornings. I also love that all the Woash teas are all-natural and don't have any added flavour or sugar - just the healthy basics!!\" - Danielle [To] discover more about our process and the experts behind them, [click here](https://woashwellness.com/pages/our-holistic-team) How To Best Use Our Ingredient Chart Below is a break down of each category we explain in our Ingredient Chart. Utilize this chart to educate yourself on individual ingredients you may be curious about and discovering which ingredient may be the perfect natural remedy for your unique needs. Ingredient In the first column, we've included every ingredient we've used in all of our purposeful blends to give you an insider look at each individually rather than a generalized over encompassing view of each blend. The first column contains each herbs \"common name\" that is mainly used when we talk about herbs. Quick note: We often get asked which tea's are herbal and which are not, the common answer is non-caffeinated are \"herbal\" and the caffeinated are non-herbal, however technically all plants are herbs ,caffeinated or not. Therefore, we express all of our blends to be herbals. See definitions below Herb Definition: any plant with leaves, seeds, or flowers used for flavoring, food, medicine, or perfume. Herbal Definition: relating to or made from herbs, especially those used in cooking and medicine. Botanical Name Next, we've included each herbs botanical / scientific name as you may come across these at times when exploring herbs and now you can know which is what. Some are quite obvious and others not so much. Often by the botanical name you can tell which family the plant comes from, however we'll keep it more simple here and save that lesson for later. Type Third, we describe the part of the plant we use in our purposeful blends as for many plants, different parts contain unique benefits such as elderberries and elderflowers or dandelion root and dandelion flower. We describe the benefits associated with that specific part of the plant [used.] Taste In the fourth column, we identify each herbs taste, these categories may seem strange to you and not your typical, sweet, sour, spicy. However, this method dates back centuries in Chinese Herbal Medicine and Ayurveda practices where (before we had the technology to identify isolated constituents of each herb) herbalists used their senses to identify and classify them. The five tastes are pungent, salty, sour, bitter and sweet. Let's take a deeper look into each taste profile to get a better understanding of how they are classified and how they could benefit your unique needs. If you are curious to discover what your unique constitution is and how the below categories and each herbs energetics can help balance it, [click here to take our quiz.](https://woashwellness.com/pages/constitutional-quiz) Salty Sour Bitter Sweet Here's what our community has to say about our blends! \"I love all of the Woash Wellness teas...However, Digest is one of my favourites.

As mentioned we designed each blend for a unique purpose, strategically choosing every ingredient for its natural therapeutic benefits and healing properties to create a nourishing and balanced blend. We highlight each ingredients endless benefits and unique properties that enhance our overall inner wellness. Origin Next, is each ingredients place of origin, the place in which we sustainably source each herb from our global farmers. As I mentioned above we source our ingredients from their indigenous region as that is where that specific species originated from and thrives in best. This ensures the most authentic and high quality ingredients we can find. Climate The seventh column is one of my favourites, it expresses what type of climate each herb is grown in. We pride ourselves on sourcing our ingredients from their indigenous regions all over the world as that is originally and naturally where they sprouted to life. Blends with Ingredients Lastly, we've highlighted each of our blends that contain that specific ingredient with clickable links to discover more about that purposeful blend and how it can help nourish your unique needs.
