Advance Directives are instructions you provide ahead of time concerning the medical treatment you wish to receive, should you lose the ability to make your own decisions. At Advocate Christ Medical Center, we can provide you with written forms that meet the requirements of the State of Illinois, which will assist you in documenting your wishes. Documents that allow you to speak for yourself include a Living Will, Power of Attorney for Health Care, Mental Health Treatment Declaration, and the Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR)/Practitioner Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST). Before you can communicate with anyone else about your wishes for health care, you must first clarify what you value and want for yourself. After you reflect upon what you consider priorities for life, you can more effectively make decisions about what type of medical interventions you would or would not want if you become unable to speak for yourself. Some considerations might include whether you wish to be placed on a breathing machine, whether you wish to be fed through a tube, or whether you would want resuscitation attempted if your heart stopped. No one likes to think about a time when they may not be able to make health care decisions. On the other hand, no one wants those decisions made without their wishes being considered. Completing an Advance Directive ensures that your health care wishes are clearly documented in the event that you are unable to make those decisions yourself. Health care is changing each day. There are many new procedures, machines and medications that offer new treatment options. These medical advances help people live longer and healthier lives. Medical advances also present us with more medical decisions to make. Whenever possible, it is you, the patient, who decides what choices are best for you. The law gives you the right to be informed about your medical condition and the treatment that the physician would recommend. You also have the right to be informed about other health care options. Then, when a medical decision needs to be made, you can do so with informed consent. Four kinds of written advance directives recognized in Illinois: Communication is the key. Take your time as you share your feelings and wishes with those people who are significant to you. If you have any questions or for further assistance, contact the Department of Mission and Spiritual Care at 41-PRAY (41-7729). If you have a question regarding an ethical concern, or would like to consult the Ethics Committee, please contact the Department of Mission and Spiritual Care or the on-call chaplain. Do I need more than one Advance Directive? A Living Will and a Power of Attorney for Health Care serve different, though related purposes. The first expresses your wishes and instructions concerning care near the end of life; the second empowers someone else to act for you on a broader range of health care matters, if the need should arise. The POLST form is meant to be discussed with those patients with advanced, serious illness and the frail elderly. We recommend that a patient complete at least the Power of Attorney for Health Care advance directive. How will decisions be made for me if I haven't completed a Living Will or appointed a health care representative? If you become incapacitated and do not have a Living Will or a Power of Attorney for Health Care, your doctor and other health care providers will ask a family member, friend, or guardian to make decisions for you. In Illinois a law directs which of these people will be consulted. In that law each of these people is called a \"surrogate.\" Without an Advance Directive, you face two risks; first, the person/people listed by this law may not be who you would want to make decisions for you; and second, a course of treatment may be selected that you would not personally have approved. If I sign an Advance Directive and later change my mind, can I revoke it? You may revoke an Advance Directive at any time by destroying the document; dating and signing a statement of revocation, or verbally expressing your intent to cancel. What are \"life sustaining measures?\" In your Living Will and/or Power of Attorney for Health Care, you may state whether you wish certain forms of medical intervention to be used to keep you alive. These measures include cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), a ventilator (breathing machine), kidney dialysis, intravenous and tube feeding, and medications. Do I need to see a lawyer to complete an Advance Directive? No. You may be more comfortable consulting a lawyer, or you may have special needs or wishes that can best be handled with the assistance of a lawyer. However, these documents are readily available as pre-printed forms. Will my health care provider honor my preferences as expressed in my Living Will? Generally, the answer is yes. Occasionally, however, a health care provider may be reluctant to comply on moral or ethical grounds. In that case, it is the provider's responsibility to arrange for another provider who is comfortable with your wishes. Does my religious tradition say anything about Living Wills or the kinds of medical traditions approve of individual choice in health care decision-making, especially in the context of artificially prolonging life. If you have religious questions about making an Advance Directive, consult with your spiritual leader. When your doctor feels that you are ready to leave the hospital, he or she will authorize a hospital discharge. Please speak with your nurse about our discharge procedures. Here are a few tips to make your discharge process run smoothly: The Care Management Department consists of social workers, discharge counselors and care managers. This team will assist with discharge planning, lend social and emotional support and provide patients and families with assistance in crisis situations. For information or assistance, call extension 41-5255. Advocate Christ Medical Center's courtesy discharge allows you to leave the medical center after notification from your doctor or nurse without stopping at the cashier for clearance. To qualify for the special program, you must satisfy the out-of-pocket portion of your medical center charges. This means assigning your verified insurance benefits to the medical center and making arrangements prior to discharge for payment of any charges not covered by your insurance. For more information regarding your out-of-pocket expense or to confirm your courtesy discharge, call the cashier's office at extension 41-5068. While you are at Advocate Christ Medical Center, we want you to concentrate on your health. But, we know you also are concerned about the financial aspects of your hospitalization, since the ultimate responsibility for payment of your medical center bill rests with you or your guardian. Please remember that many employers, insurance companies and HMOs now require notification by the patient, family member or doctor prior to or shortly after admission. If you do not comply with this requirement, your medical benefits could be jeopardized or your insurance company could refuse to pay your bill in part or in full. For your own protection, please check with your benefits provider to see if you need to follow any special rules. By providing us with complete insurance information at the time of registration, you will make it possible for us to bill your insurance company and settle your account promptly. Whatever your insurance company does not pay is your responsibility. This amount is payable at the time of discharge.
