The BodyHoliday is aimed at providing a lasting wellness experience in a [spa holiday](/spa-holidays) setting. Our daily activities range from a spiritual and relaxing meditation to a high intensity spin workout or a boot camp, and also providing you the optimum nutrition to supply you the healthy spirit. Our luxury inclusive treatments are also organized to compliment the activities and we also offer wide range of specialised spa therapies to address your individual concerns. Tell us about the Ayurvedic Centre at The BodyHoliday and which Ayurveda spa treatments would you recommend for new clients? The Ayurvedic centre at the BodyHoliday offers healing treatments from the ancient Indian tradition. The treatments are performed in an authentic way using Kama products which are sourced from India. For a beginner in [Ayurveda](/blog/the-principles-of-ayurveda) I strongly recommend the Abhyanga massage followed by Shirodhara third eye treatment to experience a feeling of rejuvenation and relaxation. What are your favourite yoga poses and why? Pawanmukthasan, also known as wind releasing pose - it helps in stretching the entire neck and back, compresses the abdomen causing increased blood flow to internal organs and improves the functionality of the digestive systems and the pelvic organs. Thus it helps the overall body. Sarvangasan also known as the shoulder stand - for the reason that it helps in improving the reverse circulation (emptying the veins) and also improves the activity of the pituitary gland. This practice also helps in thyroid functions and also uses the entire muscles of the body. The award-winning Wellness Centre at The BodyHoliday in St Lucia What is the purpose of pranayama (the art of breathing)? Pranayama comes from the two Prana means or control\". The sage Patanjali, in his Yoga Sutras, defines Pranayama as \"regulation of incoming and outgoing breath coupled with retention. There are numerous health benefits involved in practicing [Pranayama](/blog/pranayama-breathing-an-introductory-guide). The Hatha Yoga Pradipika states that Pranayama is practiced in order to understand and control the pranic process in the body. Breathing is a direct means of absorbing prana and the manner in which we breathe sets off pranic vibrations, which influence our entire being. By becoming aware of the nature of the breath and by restraining it, the whole system becomes controlled. When you retain the breath you are stopping nervous impulses in different parts of the body and harmonising the brain wave patterns. In pranayama, it is the duration of the breath retention, which has to be increased. The longer the breath is held, the greater the gap between nervous impulses and their responses in the brain. What is the difference between naturopathy and homeopathy? Homeopathy and naturopathy are commonly confused, but they are in fact completely different practices. The two alternative medicine systems are similar in that they are generally considered to be holistic; they focus on the treatment of the whole patient rather than a specific disease or ailment. Naturopathy is a broad, eclectic treatment system that includes a wide range of medical practices. Naturopaths may practice techniques that include herbalism, acupuncture, acupressure, counseling, Ayurvedic medicine, exercise, specialised diets, color therapy and other drug-free medical interventions. The goal of naturopathy is to provide complete care for the patient while addressing the spiritual, emotional and metaphysical aspects of health. Homeopathy is a relatively recent medical system devised during the nineteenth century. The fundamental principle behind homeopathy is the \"like treats like\" theory of treatment: homeopaths believe that extremely small amounts of toxins can treat the symptoms that larger doses typically cause. The medicines used in homeopathy are extremely diluted and typically contain no molecules of the original substance. Homepaths believe that these medicines, which are chemically identical to placebos, are effective because they contain the \"fingerprint\" or \"spirit\" of the compound. An indulging spa treatment at The BodyHoliday in St Lucia How does acupuncture promote natural healing? Although often described as a treatment for pain, [acupuncture](/blog/what-are-the-benefits-of-acupuncture) is used to treat a wide variety of illnesses. Acupuncture's focus is on improving overall health rather than isolating specific symptoms. It follows the Chinese philosophy, addressing the body's motivating energy (known as Qi) and seeks to move it in a balanced way through pathways called meridians under the skin. By inserting needles into these channels, an acupuncturist can stimulate the patient's healing response, restoring natural balance. Also there are 5 western medicine theories that Acupuncture works: The Gate Control Theory: Acupuncture generates competing stimulus and effectively interrupts the neurotransmitters of the pain signals from reaching the brain. The Augmentation Theory: Acupuncture raises levels of triglycerides, specific hormones, prostaglandins, white blood cells (WBC's), gamma globulins, opsonins and overall anti-body levels. This is why acupuncture can treat disorders relating to immune deficiencies. The Endorphin Theory: Acupuncture stimulates the secretion of endorphins in the body (specifically Enkephalins). Endorphins are our bodies' natural painkillers. They are 1000 times stronger than morphine. The Neurotransmitter Theory: This states that certain neurotransmitter levels (such as Seratonin and Noradrenaline) are affected by Acupuncture. This is why acupuncture is so successful with depression, mood disorders and weight loss. The Circulatory Theory: Acupuncture releases body's vasodilators thus increasing circulation of fresh red blood cells (RBC's) and WBC's to an injured area helps to create a faster healing process. The Wellness Centre has won many awards including Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller's best overseas spa holiday destination. What makes The BodyHoliday so special?
