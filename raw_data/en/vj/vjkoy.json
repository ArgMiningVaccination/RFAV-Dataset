Every culture is different, and are unique by their beliefs, values, remedies, and many people live by that, many people believe in all these topics, and many people also think that everything is a lie. The most common customs of Zacatecas are the Festivals, Festivals, and Fairs of Zacatecas. The main festivals in Zacatecas are the religious ones that are celebrated in each one of the municipalities in honor to the patron of the place, also the regional celebrations, in the capital of the state the celebrations are celebrated in the month of September, being day 8 when The Virgin of Patronage is also commemorated. There are also various events in the fair 's cultural and artistic facilities, such as bullfights, Palenque, exhibitions, dances, horse races and gastronomic exhibitions. Also, there are Herbal remedies are not as simple as just determining the illness and giving the prescribed medicine, without having knowledge of the body. The fundamental element of medicine in the Medieval time period is the theory of humours. This theory followed through until they reach the 19th century where more modern analysis could conducted. Humours also known as principle fluids are made up of four different fluid found in each individual: black bile, yellow bile, blood and phlegm. Each of the fluids are found in different organ of the body, black bile resides in the spleen and is the cause for melancholy, yellow bile is secreted by the liver and can cause irascibility, phlegm comes from the lungs and can be denounced to sluggishness, and the final This relevant data about Native American substance abuse is just a remark that these communities still have a long way to go in terms of health and healing treatment, but it shows that even though they have communities ravaged by alcohol, drugs and diseases like smallpox they are still here and will make their voices heard. When thinking about religions, you may not realize that many of them played a huge role in history. They helped unite people, set social standards, and create features of different cultures. Two examples of this is Hinduism and Buddhism. They helped shape each other and are similar in many ways, though they still have differences. The popularized concept that Native American people have a \"mystical\" spirituality and live in harmony with nature is yet another taboo myth. Native Americans do believe in living in harmony with all elements as well as balance and harmony of spirit, mind, body and the environment. This belief also provides the Native American culture with a holistic approach to medicine. Health issues and solutions are typically seen as spiritually based and cared for without western medical interventions. This cultural custom directly affects treatment and how long an individual goes before being treated by a speech pathologist or audiologist. Knowing that health issues are usually cared for spiritually first it would be appropriate for the clinician to Complementary therapies are treatments that make up a range of services provided by the NHS. Treatments that are available are acupuncture, aromatherapy, art therapy, chiropractic, herbal medicine and homeopathy. These treatments are offered to patients who may have cancer or other illnesses. These treatments are also used to help maintain one's health, improving the immune system, sleeping patterns, increasing energy levels and help to depose of toxins. Complementary therapies are not clinically tested but have been used for many years and also most therapists are self employed. There is no doubt in my mind that to define and measure health in today's society is a challenge. Over the past number of centuries, or even decades, the idea of what health is has developed, and still to this day, varies across the many socio-economic levels within a country, varying on an even broader spectrum globally. In 2013 the World Health Organisation defined health as \"A state of physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\". This aspect of wellness regarding ones mental health is a relatively new concept to be introduced, further showing that how we perceive health is an ever changing continuum, as opposed to an unvarying definition. In contrast to health, Baldwin, J et al. (2015) put Locura is a culture bound syndrome that affects Latin Americans and Hispanics, regardless of where they are born, in the United States or South America (Jilek 2001:5,9). Locura has also been documented in immigrants from the Caribbean Islands (Razzouk 2011:517). In Columbia, Locura is also known as \"ataques de locura\" madness attacks, it is attributed to a spell known as \"maleficio\". Locura is commonly associated with other culture bound syndromes thru out Central and South America, such as ataques de nervious (nervios) and possession syndromes (Pi\u00f1eros 1998:1425). I had the privilege to talk to Lia Lee. Lee is a 67 years olds Hmong woman. She is a mother to 5 children, 31 grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren. Lee and husband Va Toua Xiong with her 4 children were sponsored by a church in St. Paul. They arrived in St. Paul, Minnesota in November 1980. Lia Lee and her husband did not have any close relatives in St. Paul during their arrival. Their sponsor found them an apartment in St. Paul. Lee and husband Xiong attended adult school to learn English and learn how to adjust to living in America. After one year of learning English, Lia Lee found a job in a company. She worked there for 5 years and quit the job to take care of her children. Lee and her husband Xiong got help from the church to sponsor Western medicine is increasing the lives of many in different ways using advances in the medical field. Western medicine is the process of looking at the body like a machine it finds a problem and fixes that problem. Today Western medicine is superior and eastern medicine is considered taboo. Eastern medicine looks at the body as a garden and instead of giving you medication they try to start at the root of the problem by talking about what's going on in your life. From the beginning, the therapist had to deal with own doubts and anxiety. The therapist had heard a lot about the psychodynamic psychotherapy but this was the first time he conduct the sessions by himself. Unlike pharmacotherapy, there is no standard clinical practice guideline or recommendation for the therapist to refer to or follow. The therapist was worried that he was unable to conduct the therapy effectively and his patient would not benefit from the therapy. Fortunately, the therapist received a lot of encouragement and support from his supervisor, which enabled him to complete the therapy sessions with his patient. The history of medicine goes back over thousands of years and is still developing today. Medicine was used to diminish illness and heal injury since the beginning of humanity. In ancient times, if one was to become sick or injured, Egypt would have been the best place to do so. Egyptians chances of survival would have been remarkably better than those of one's foreign peer, but one had the opportunity of being treated by a physician whose work was displayed all over the ancient world and has made a huge impact and change in the modern world that we know today. In a cold winter day, have you ever observed white smoke come out from your mouth when you exhale? Have you ever thoroughly felt the force pressing on your skin when wind blows? These are some of the states that \"qi\" appears in our daily lives. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TMC), qi plays as a fundamental component from time to time explaining its ideas. Theories of both Chinese and Western medicine exist for helping people maintain good health and away from deceases. Western medicine relies more on scientific proof \"Western medicine places strong emphasis on the physical structures of the body, which are made up of different organic and inorganic substances, proteins, tissues and cells.\" (Shen Lung Ltd, 2002) Unlike western medicine, TMC originates and relies very much on Chinese philosophical theories. And the theory of qi is one of them. This essay will be explaining what qi is in Chinese medicine, including its general concept, movement and flow in human body, functions, what would be The University of Maryland Medical Center states that Herbal Therapy also called botanical medicine or phytomedicine, refers to using plant's, seeds, berries, leaves, barks, or flowers for medicinal purposes. Herbalism has a long tradition of use outside conventional medicine. It is becoming more mainstream as improvements in analysis and quality control, along with advances in clinical research, show the value of herbal medicine in treating and preventing diseases. Herbal medicine is a natural, non-toxic way to treat many conditions of ill-health. It is holistic, meaning it treats the whole person, embracing all levels of an individual: physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Herbal medicines are widely preferred by some individuals all "}
