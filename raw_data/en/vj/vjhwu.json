Each product is sent to a certified lab for quality-control testing, because our goal is to make our products as natural as possible, while delivering powerful results. We care about what goes into our products so much that we recommend them to our friends and family. If you are not satisfied with your order, reach out to us and we will make it right! The word \"natural\" gets thrown around a lot, which can make it confusing when you are looking for a truly natural brand. We believe that natural ingredients should be the heart and soul of our products. Some products simply need anti-clumping agents or synthetic boosters, and that's okay. Our primary ingredients (the building blocks of our products) will always be made of herbals, botanicals, vitamins and minerals. Tired of running out of your favorite stuff? When you subscribe and save, you'll get 20% off every subscription purchase and we will ship your favorite products directly to your home on a flexible, monthly schedule. Many cultures across the world have used herbal remedies that blend traditional ingredients like turmeric, ashwagandha & elderberry for centuries. Our products use those same time-tested remedies in modern ways that fit into your healthy, natural lifestyle. "}
