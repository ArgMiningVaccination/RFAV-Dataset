India observes National Vaccination Day every year on 16th March, also known as National Immunization Day. However, in 2021 we can't wait till 16th March. The new world order has wished and wanted death to 2020 urgently and started 2021 with another sense of urgency !! As an Indian, 16th January will be a memorable day as the nation has launched the world's biggest and largest Vaccination rollout program. To add to this feat, the two vaccines are 'Made In India' and don't require storage at lower temperatures unlike many other vaccines currently being rolled out in EEU and US. Those who risk catching the disease will get the first jab. As a brother of a third-generation health care professional, I can now have a sigh of relief that my father, mother, and sister will get vaccinated in the coming quarter, and eventually, I can see them face to face. It is going to take some time for the vaccine to reach everyone, but there is no doubt that India has a lot of experience with big events from elections every five years to mass vaccinations. Each year tens of millions of children are treated for other diseases through a nationwide immunization program, and the government and nation hope that it is this established mechanical system that will help fight one of the biggest crises the country has ever faced. For many front-line workers, the journey has been the most difficult, putting his/her life on the line to save others and usher hope. In these critical early weeks, a big clap for them again as they have really earned them. "}
