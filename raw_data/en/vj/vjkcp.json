This strategy continues the focus upon FMD risk reduction and extends the scope of preparedness and risk reduction activities to similar transboundary animal diseases which pose an immediate threat to the EuFMD Member Nations . T he program focuses on the control of foot-and-mouth and similar transboundary animal diseases (FAST) in the neighboring regions through the improvement of prevention, surveillance , and control. In this context, the FAST quarterly report of significant events provides relevant and regular risk information to risk managers operating in EuFMD Member Nations and neighboring countries. T he constant monitoring of the epidemiological situation together with information on the implementation of control and surveillance strategies increase s awareness of major transboundary animal disease threats for Europe and the regions of North Africa, the Middle East, and South East European Neighborhood. The European neighborhood The neighborhood of the current 39 EuFMD Member Nations is made up by non-EuFMD Members that either have land borders with EuFMD Members , are members of the Mediterranean animal health network (REMESA), or whose animal health status provides an early warning for FAST disease spread to the neighborhood of Europe. The activity of Pillar II includes EuFMD Member Nations in the European neighboring region (Turkey, Georgia) (Figure 1) . Figure 1. Countries included in the activities of the EuFMD Pillar II EuFMD Member Nations in European neighboring region: Turkey, Georgia. Having land borders with EuFMD Member Nations: Armenia, Azerbaijan, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, the Syrian Arab Republic, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, and Egypt. Non-EU Members of REMESA: Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania. Countries significant for epidemic spread of FAST diseases to the above countries: Sudan, Mali, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Source: Adapted from United Nations World map, May 2019.

V accination is also perfor med in Azerbaijan , Lebanon and Tur key. Rift Valley Fever There were no outbreaks or significant events reported in this quarter regarding Rift Valley fever. Sheep and goat pox A small number of outbreaks were recorded this quarter in Turkey and the Islamic Republic of Iran, although these countries report vaccination against sheep and goat pox to high animal numbers , with outbreaks more likely in unvaccinated animals .
