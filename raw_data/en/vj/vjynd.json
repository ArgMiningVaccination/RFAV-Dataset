She loves that it gives her \"an opportunity to slow down and allow her body ad mind to reset, \" and says that \"sometimes our energetic flow needs support to get going back in its natural direction. I believe there are many ways to heal and sometimes I need help getting out of my own way. Because of the trust I have in Emily Siy, I'm able to quiet my mind and let the needles do their work.\" To reciprocate the positive energy she brings to my practice every time I see her I wanted to highlight her work as well as open my community to her offerings.

Daring Way Workshops With Kathryn Grooms The Daring Way is a highly experiential methodology based on the research of Dr. Bren\u00e9 Brown. The method was designed for work with individuals, couples, families, work teams, and organizational leaders. It can be facilitated in clinical, educational, and professional settings. During the process facilitators explore topics such as vulnerability, courage, shame, and worthiness. Participants are invited to examine the thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that are holding them back and identify the new choices and practices that will move them toward more authentic and wholehearted living. The primary focus is on developing shame resilience skills and developing daily practices that transform the way we live, love, parent, and lead. During the Rising Strong process, we come to a deep understanding of the physics of vulnerability, which is, if we are brave enough, often we will fall. We will learn what it takes to get back up and how owning our stories of struggle gives us the power to write a daring new ending. We will become aware that struggle can be our greatest call to courage and the clearest path to a wholehearted life. Our objectives for this workshop include: Engage in conversation about vulnerability, courage, shame, and worthiness. Provide access to information on emotion and how emotion is connected to behavior and thought. Awaken your curiosity about emotions - awareness and the ability to articulate - and build our understanding of emotions. Use the rising strong process at both the micro and macro levels to increase wholeheartedness in living, loving, and leading. 5 Reasons You Should Take The Daring Way Workshop To Be Brave we must learn to be vulnerable. We aren't meant to go it alone. In order to be brave with our lives, we must be aware of what are the values we hold most dear. We Practice. We Make Mistakes. We Circle Back. We Try again. We move our learning from our heads to our hearts through our hands. Kathryn's Upcoming Workshop is on Jan 24-26.
