While it's imperative for every person to be aware and well-educated about the vaccines, there are also certain precautions, dos and don'ts to follow for the vaccine to do its job well- one of the prime ones being safeguarding your immune system. [readmore](javascript://) 02/7How do you ensure the COVID-19 vaccine works well? While vaccines work by driving our immune response against the pathogen, a lot of its prevention strategy also depends on our own natural immunity. The efficiency of our immune system also determines how fast or good a vaccine works on us. Hence, just like we have been doing during the course of the pandemic, we should also take earnest steps to keep our immunity up. We tell you 5 such measures to take so as to ensure your COVID vaccine works efficiently: [readmore](javascript://) 03/7Avoid and curb alcohol intake for weeks after vaccination The one precaution people have been asked to follow after, and preferably before vaccination is to curb alcohol intake, which may deter or limit the vaccine's working in the first few weeks. Alcohol is bad for the liver and also dims the body's immune response. Some researches also say that alcohol can also make it harder for the body's immune system to defend the body against any germs or infections. More so, it can also make a person vulnerable to a host of communicable disorders, as well as COVID-19. Therefore, it would be a wise idea to curb alcohol as well as tobacco intake.

Any chronic or long-term stress can increase the level of cortisol and oxidative stress in the body, decrease the level of lymphocytes (white blood cells which participate in evading the infection) and make you more prone to catching infections. Therefore, the more stressed you are, the higher are your chances of getting sick. Acute stress can also alter health outcomes and immune response. Therefore, before getting vaccinated, ensure that you are stress-free and well aware of inoculation.

While there may be no MAGIC superfoods which work to strengthen your immunity or deliver a better response, healthy dietary habits must continue before and after a vaccine is injected to ensure the best possible outcomes. Make sure you are having multiple servings of seasonal fresh vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, poultry products (such as eggs), and natural spices, which all are good for your immune system.

Good quality, uninterrupted sleep (7-8 hours a day) is imperative to a healthy and strong immune system. Sleep is the time when the body detoxifies, cells regenerate and a lot of crucial bodily processes take place. In the lack of sleep, a person can experience high stress, which again, is bad for your immunity. In fact, experts have also found that good sleep can also make vaccines work efficiently. As per a study done by the International Journal of Behavioral Medicine, people who recorded less than 5-6 hours of sleep had flu vaccines work on them 50% less efficiently than the ones who had better sleep.

In fact, for better driven immune response and the vaccine to work efficiently, engaging in enough physical activity and exercise is also important. Exercise is indeed one of the best ways to ensure your immune system functions fine. It can also reduce the chances of complications and illnesses, which make you sick.
