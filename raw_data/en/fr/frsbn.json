Methods With a descriptive survey design, data of 423 postpartum women were collected via online and offline surveys. Results A total of 251 women (59.3%) reported CAM use during postpartum. Eating animal-based foods (65.3%), plant-based health foods (52.2%), and using oriental medicine (31.8%) were commonly used in postpartum women. The reason for using CAM were physical recovery (39.1%), breastfeeding (29.7%), weight loss (24.8%), prevention of postpartum complications (5.1%), and others (1.3%). People who recommended CAM use was mainly family (41.3%), and expense of using CAM was 751,188 Korea won. Most women discussed CAM use with doctor (44.9%), and 29.3% of women didn't even consult CAM use with health care providers. Most of (72.3%) women were satisfied with CAM use. Higher level of education and monthly income, being employed, primipara, normal range of gestational weight gain, no abortion experience, and no maternal complication were significantly associated with CAM use in postpartum women. Figures and Tables Table 1 Table 2 Table 3 Table 4 Summary Statement What is already known about this topic? Most existing studies reported massage therapy, vitamins, and acupuncture as the most common types of CAM used by postpartum women. What this paper adds? This study found that biologically based therapies such as animal-based foods, plant-based health foods, and Oriental medicine accounted for the majority use of CAM in postpartum Korean women. Implications for practice, education and/or policy This study can serve as baseline data required for promoting postpartum health in Korea and other parts of the world. Additionally, health care providers, including nurses, need to understand the cultural differences and provide postpartum women with appropriate care. References 1. Ahn S.
