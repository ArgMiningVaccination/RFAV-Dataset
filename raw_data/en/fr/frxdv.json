Rate this book 576 pages, Hardcover First published September 13, 2022 The institution [The Royal Society, the pioneering scientific academy founded in 1660] was at the forefront of Britain's colonial project, sponsoring voyages by Captain James Cook (including the one in which he laid claim to New Zealand), and for over forty years the Royal Society was led by one of Cook's fellow explorers, the wealthy botanist Joseph Banks, described by a British colonial official as \"the staunchest imperialist of the day.\" [emphases added]--Instead of only critiquing science's values (Peterson), what is capitalism's value system?
