Training new pilots is a complex process involving: the recruitment andselection of trainees; the delivery of training courses, from the first lessons in asingle engine propeller aircraft to operational training ensuring that front linepilots are combat ready; and the deployment and career management of trainedpilots. Figure 1 shows this process together with the various influences on thetraining pipeline. This report focuses on the initial stages of pilot training \u0096 fromelementary training to the transfer of pilots to their individual Services foroperational training. 2 Initial pilot training is handled by the Department\u0092s Training Group Defence Agency for all three Services. Pilot training is staged, with all traineesundertaking elementary flying training, following which Royal Air Force and RoyalNavy trainees are streamed, according to their assessed aptitude \u0096 the Armyrequire helicopter pilots only. Trainees then receive further training dedicated totheir aircraft types \u0096 fast jets, helicopters and multi-engine aircraft. IndividualServices then take responsibility for operational training \u0096 when new pilots aretrained to fly specific front-line aircraft. 3 During the five years from 1994-95 to 1998-99, the Services needed some 250 new pilots each year. This figure is set to increase to some 290 in 2001-02. Inrecent years, the Agency have trained fewer pilots than Service staffing plansindicated were necessary, and some 45 a year (18 per cent) fewer than neededhave entered operational service after operational training. This shortfall has inpart contributed to an overall shortfall in operational pilots - the retention of pilotsis another important factor - and is particularly severe for the stock of fast jet pilots.On present plans, a shortfall in such pilots will continue until 2012, even if output ofnew pilots meets targets every year. The numbers of trainees entering the trainingpipeline have broadly met targets but at times during the 1990s there have beensevere blockages in the pipeline and the time taken to train pilots has increased. 1Training new pilots2Training new pilots Figure 1 Our study centres on the Agency and Operational Training Unit management of pilot training, but considers broader recruitment selection and retenti on issues as they affect pilot training. si e of applicant poolrate start trainingnumber pilots in trainingrate transfer to operational trainingnumber pilots available for front line trainee intake quality to complete trainingaircraft utilisationcontracted servicesflying hoursadverse weather airspaceaircraft available for training aircraft awaiting servicing available instructors simulators rate transfer to front linenumber of pilots undertaking operational trainingtri-service trainingavailability of spares Training Group Defence Agencyrecruitment and selectionretention and career management Operational Training UnitsThe major processes influencing pilot training ey Where each factor Influences the flyingtraining process.4 Departmental costing systems do not readily identify the costs of flying training, nor the relative importance of the various cost elements. Our analysis ofthe Department\u0092s data estimates the overall cost of initial pilot training in 1998-99to be some \u00a3280 million, with operational training an additional cost. Despitedifficulties in achieving targets for new pilots, the Agency have had to contribute tothe efficiency savings demanded of the Department as a whole \u0096 in the five years to1998-99 the Agency have reported savings of \u00a350 million against a target of\u00a341 million. 5 In view of these circumstances, we looked further at the following main issues: n recruitment, selection and overall success rates: the process of delivering new pilots embraces more than just the training activity, itincludes general activities such as recruitment, as well as specificselections for pilot training and progression through the stages, whichcontribute to overall performance. This Part of the report therefore looksat the effectiveness of these activities from the perspective of subsequentpilot training outcomes; n fast jet training: we selected the training of fast jet pilots as a case study because of the combination of a shortfall in desired output and the highcost of this stream of training. The focus on fast jets enabled us to generatebetter cost and activity data, and to link initial training with subsequentoperational training and deployment; n managing for quality: the training process has had to deliver pilots of the right quality while making savings. This Part looks at managementmeasures taken to promote quality and efficiency, including joint-Serviceinitiatives, which contain an element of both quality and efficiencyimprovement. Recruitment, selection and overall success 6 Recruitment arrangements in the round lie outside the scope of this report but we examined those aspects of recruitment and selection which bear directly onflying training. Trainee pilots may be direct officer recruits, selected servingofficers or, in the case of the Army or Royal Marines, selected non-commissionedofficers. All Services, however, apply the Agency\u0092s aptitude tests as part of theirtrainee pilot selection processes. While aptitude tests are designed to predictsuccess during elementary training, we found that there was a strong correlation 3Training new pilotsbetween higher aptitude test scores and greater likelihood of subsequent success in pilot training. However, there was only a small absolute difference in successrates between very high aptitude test scores and much lower scores. In takingforward their aptitude tests there would be benefits if the tests could discriminatemore clearly between those candidates who are likely to do well in future pilottraining. We also noted that other countries have developed psychometric testingto help evaluate candidates\u0092 fighting instincts. 7 All Services use direct experience of flying as part of their selection process, to some degree. Royal Navy and Army trainees have 13 hours of flying experienceafter which they are graded, with the best trainees moving on to elementarytraining. The Royal Air Force take trainee pilots either after around 90 hours offlying at University Air Squadrons, or from direct recruitment, when candidatesoften have little or no flying experience, although some candidates may have AirTraining Corps experience. 8 Different approaches led to different results. 12 per cent of Royal Navy candidates failed the flying grading element of selection. The corresponding figurefor the Army was 64 per cent \u0096 in part because the Army select from a broad rangeof Service personnel and they place greater weight on grading rather than aptitudetesting. But Army wastage rates at later stages of helicopter training remainedhigher than for the other Services. During elementary flying training the wastagerate for Royal Air Force direct entrant trainees was marginally higher than for theother Services who include flying as part of their selection process. Royal Air ForceUniversity Air Squadron trainees were more successful at providing premium fastjet pilots than the direct entrant route, but by less of a margin than targeted \u0096providing 55 per cent of fast jet pilots rather than 70 per cent. 9 Although wastage rates have reduced overall, and in some areas such as operational training are less than the expected rates used for planning purposes,they remain stubbornly high for fast jet trainees (Figure 2). Comparisons withoverseas countries are complicated by differences in standards and processes. Butindications are that overall wastage is in line with that in, for example, the UnitedStates and Canada. 4Training new pilotsWastageratesduringpilot training1997-98and 1998-99Figure 2 While actual wastage on most courses is less than planned, wastage rates in fast jet training are substantially higher than for other aircraft streams.

Fast jet training 10 We looked to see why there was a shortfall in new pilots in our case study of fast jet training. We found that the reasons for the shortfall centred on theincreased length of time taken for pilots to reach operational status - some5.5 years down from a peak of 6.0 years in 1997-98 compared with just over threeyears planned, (and which was achieved in the early 1990s) - rather than factorssuch as recruitment or wastage during training, which have been at or better thanplanned values. That increase in elapsed time in part reflected factors internal tothe training process, such as difficulty in obtaining sufficient qualified instructors,and securing available aircraft and facilities. But in part training delays alsoreflected external decisions, such as those on commitments to operations, whichreduced the pool of qualified pilots to act as instructors. And cuts to OperationalTraining Units reflected a reduction in the size of the Royal Air Force, even thoughthe number of trainees already in the system was appropriate to its former size.The reduced front line meant that newly trained pilots could not be absorbed,leading in turn to backlogs in the training pipeline and the need for refreshertraining. A lack of coherence in planning meant that the impact of actions in onepart of the training system was not fully appreciated for the system as a wholeoperating beyond the boundaries of the Agency. 11 We analysed the cost of fast jet training, the most expensive stream of training, in more detail. That analysis suggested that the cost of training flyinginstructors was the largest single component (30 per cent), and that the actualtraining courses made up some 29 per cent of cost. We estimated that wastage, theneed to fly more hours than planned (in part as a result of simulators not beingavailable), and costs due to delays in moving trainees through the systemcontributed 27 per cent to the unit cost of a successful trainee of some \u00a33.8 million. 5Training new pilots12 The costs of operational training are dependent on the particular front line aircraft to which a trainee is assigned. But, because front-line aircraft are moreexpensive to operate than training aircraft, the cost of such training is significant.As an illustration, we estimate that the cost of an operational training course for aTornado GR1 pilot adds some \u00a31.9 million to the \u00a33.8 million unit cost of theirinitial flying training. 13 Finally, we looked for a measure of the significance of the shortfall in new operational fast jet pilots. Valuing the shortfall as the cost of an operationalTornado GR1 (comprising the flying hours expected of an operational pilot and thecost of maintaining and operating one aircraft), we estimate the cost to be\u00a36 million annually for each vacancy. While this is a crude figure, it shows clearlythat the economic effects in one year of a failure to produce a pilot are of the sameorder as the total training cost of a new pilot. Of course, small numbers of pilotshortages do not mean that the aircraft fleet will be under-utilised and theDepartment are managing the current shortages of fast jet pilots such that thereare no gaps on front line squadrons. Indeed the Department have been able tomaintain their operational commitments, in part by increasing the frequency ofdeployments of trained pilots. There are, however, longer-term consequences as'over-stretch' may well affect morale and add to the difficulties of retaining trainedpilots. Managing for quality and efficiency 14 United Kingdom military pilots enjoy a high reputation internationally, a fact confirmed during our consultation with overseas colleagues and in theperformance of United Kingdom pilots in international operations, exercises andcompetitions. The quality of their initial training has clearly played a part in thatoutcome. In the past output quality standards throughout the training pipelinehave been unclear, but the Agency have made recent progress on agreeingstandards for the various aircraft streams and customers. In March 2000 theAgency agreed output standards with Royal Air Force fast jet customers and theyexpect to agree standards for other aircraft in 2000-01, establishing service levelagreements with Royal Navy and Army customers by September 2000. 15 There are, nevertheless, aspects of the training system which do not sufficiently grip quality issues. The quality target for the Agency is poorlyformulated and there has been no credible mechanism for obtaining customerviews of quality achieved. The Agency are, however, developing newarrangements for tracking quality. Our survey of Operational Training Unitssuggests that there are several areas meriting attention. The majority of unitsconsidered that the quality of trainees was lower than in the past and that there 6Training new pilotswere shortfalls in some skills levels. Without clear output standards it is difficult to determine whether these perceptions are firmly evidenced or whether they reflect\u0091output creep \u0092 - a ratcheting up of expectations. An indication of the quality of initial pilot training might be provided by the extent to which Operational TrainingUnits undertake additional training - but the Department do not collect these data. 16 Similarly, targets for outputs were not in place for all of the Agency's customers, and their 'efficiency target', which they have achieved in recent years,takes the form of a simple economy target - to make savings on expenditure. Thereis no efficiency measure in place which brings inputs and outputs together. Moregenerally, there is no clear string of customer/supplier agreements runningthrough from recruitment to final output of a trained, operational pilot. 17 Some of the weaknesses evident in setting targets also show through in other initiatives. The Agency have pursued a variety of site rationalisation andcontractorisation projects with mixed results. Weaknesses in specification ofservices and contract monitoring and enforcement have cost the Departmentoutput and money. And similar weaknesses in planning have meant that theimplications of site rationalisation were not fully understood, with the result thatfewer sites have been sold than planned, and some initially closed have had to bere-opened. Overall, however, contractorisation and rationalisation havecontributed towards improved efficiency, if not on the scale originally envisaged. 18 On more general management matters, the Agency have vigorously pursued a number of externally-framed management initiatives, such asparticipation in the Public Sector Benchmarking Project and assessment againstthe European Foundation for Quality Management Business Excellence Model, aswell as obtaining ISO 9000 and 'Investor in People' accreditation. Assessmentagainst the business excellence model shows that there is scope for improvementin the management of the Agency, achievement of which is addressed in theAgency's business improvement plan. We welcome the efforts made to assess thequality of management by reference to external benchmarks, and to pursueimprovements according to the results of the comparison. 7Training new pilotsRecommendations On recruitment and selection and the numbers of pilots 19 While the current recruitment and selection systems deliver candidates in the planned number and overall wastage is less than plans allow for, the trainingpipeline delivers fewer pilots than required. There is scope for rationalisation ofapproaches between Services, and improvement of the various mechanismsemployed, to help achieve overall requirements for new pilots. The Departmentshould: n review the way aptitude tests and the grading of trainees following directexperience of flying are applied across the Services, to ensure that bestvalue is obtained from the existing, relatively cost-effective, aptitude tests; n explore the scope to improve aptitude tests' ability to discriminatebetween the capabilities required of fast jet, helicopter and multi-enginepilots, to facilitate early and accurate decisions on streaming of trainees;and n in the light of variation between forecast and actual wastage rates, reviewplanning assumptions which inform the numbers of trainees required. On training activity 20 Training a new pilot takes over three years even in ideal conditions, and involves several stages, and many different trainers and training facilities. Andthere are many different ways of achieving the same outcomes. In thesecircumstances, the quality of management information, and the incentives to acton it, are crucial to providing cost-effective training. To improve currentarrangements, the Department should: n ensure that information on training activity, and the performance oftrainees, trainers, and facilities, is collected in a standardised way, andmade readily accessible, so that analysis of training activity is facilitated; n recognise the importance of the elapsed time taken for a trainee to qualify,and include elapsed time in monitoring of training performance; 8Training new pilotsn improve the system for capturing the costs of training, and their major elements, so that monitoring of cost-effectiveness can be attempted, andanalysis of possible improvements is more soundly based; n ensure that current initiatives to set formal output standards for thevarious stages and types of flying training are quickly brought to fruition,and extended to all stages, streams and customers; and n make sure that the interactions between activities, resources, standardsand outputs are recognised and accurately reflected in analysis whichcaptures the effects on the system as a whole, of varying a given elementwithin it. On management of the training system and resources 21 The training system involves many different stakeholders in public and private sectors, and consumes significant resources - in current and capital terms.Managing a complex system on this scale places a particular strain on the overallcoherence of management actions and on the accuracy of planning and projectimplementation. The Department should improve their performance in theseareas by: n making sure that the customer/provider logic of current arrangements ismore fully and consistently applied through the training system, bothwithin the Agency and between the Agency and their suppliers,contractors and colleagues who deal with operational training; n ensure that the targets set at various stages reflect overall targets andobjectives, have a common format, and are soundly based on analysis ofcurrent and potential performance; n revitalise arrangements which provide customer input to target settingand performance monitoring, and charge the 'owner' with more activereview of training system performance as a whole; n continue with current Agency quality management initiatives, to helpconsolidate and improve the professionalism of Agency management, andconsider extending that approach to all elements of the system, topromote a uniform management culture; 9Training new pilotsn consider the prospects for greater commonality of content and joint delivery of Elementary Flying Training, which should offer cost andoperational benefits; and n make important services to training management, such as contractsexpertise, both accessible and responsive, and ensure that local managerswho monitor contractors\u0092 performance are in full possession ofcontractual details. Concluding comments 22 The process of training new pilots is complicated and resource-intensive, and must be viewed as a whole if best value for money is to be achieved. Even smallchanges to the system can result in wasted effort, or money, if those changes havenot been set in the context of the overall process. For example, a change to trainingaircraft maintenance contracts to incentivise higher aircraft availability can resultin nugatory payments, even when customers are desperate for more pilots, if thereare not sufficient trainees, instructors and airspace to make use of that extraresource. The Department should look at possibilities for making existingarrangements, already drawn together to a good degree in the Training GroupDefence Agency, more coherent. They should: n review the boundaries between personnel commands, the Agency, andoperational commands, to ensure they are sensibly drawn, and that aconsistent approach to training is maintained across any boundaries; n make sure adequate information is available to support decision onchange, and that analysis covers the full range of implications of change,and known disturbances to the system - such as, for example, the effects ofdeployments on instructor availability; and n develop an outline model of the pilot training system, drawing on ourwork in Figure 1 and Appendix 2, to facilitate understanding of theinteractions and dynamics of the system, and to refine the indicators andtargets used to manage pilot training. 23 Moves in this direction should help the Department achieve full value from the resources committed, and from projects undertaken, while also enablingmanagement to form a clearer view on the overall efficiency of the system, and theadequacy of its resourcing. Overall, pilot training has to be seen as part of a 10Training new pilotscontinuous process with a series of customer/supplier relationships crossing commands and all three Services, covering trainee numbers, timetables andquality standards. The output from one stage of training provides the input to thenext stage and if an holistic view is not maintained, there is a risk that changes inone stage of training will impact adversely on later, more costly stages of training. 11Training new pilots "}
