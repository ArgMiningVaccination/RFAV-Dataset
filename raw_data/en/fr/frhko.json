Even in mothers with no known dietary deciency risks, the use ofprenatal vitamins during lactation is commonplace and isconsidered safe for the breastfed infant (Table 1). 2,3Some lactating mothers may elect to consume high-dose or ''megadose'' vitamin therapy, beyond that required for ade-quate daily intake. Commonly used vitamins taken in megadoses are listed in Table 2. Depending on the vitamin, dosage, and the mother's underlying vitamin status, thispractice could potentially lead to vitamin concentrations in milk that are harmful to the infant. This column briefly re- views the available published data and provides recommen-dations for nursing mothers considering vitamin megadosing. Vitamin C Average milk vitamin C concentrations are 50-80 mg/L in well-nourished mothers consuming adequate vitamin C intheir diet, and their milk concentrations are not markedly increased with routine daily multivitamin supplementation. In a study of mothers given high doses between 250 and 1,000 mg daily, average milk concentrations were *100- 120 mg/L after 2 days of supplementation, but were not sig- nicantly related to dose. The maximum measured concen-tration was 158 mg/L in a subject taking only 250 mg/day. 4In a separate case, a mother taking 4,000 mg vitamin C per day during pregnancy and lactation had a milk concentration of105 mg/L.5Based on the highest milk concentration reported, an exclusively breastfeeding infant would be expected to consume *25 mg/kg per day, which is similar to the treat- ment dose for infants with scurvy, and well below infantexposures known to cause harm.6A once daily 500 mg vi- tamin C dose, along with 100 IU of vitamin E, also improves the milk biochemical antioxidant prole.7Maternal use of high-dose daily vitamin C ( >200 mg/day) is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding. Vitamin B 2(riboflavin) Average milk concentrations are 300-600 mcg/L in well- nourished mothers consuming adequate riboflavin in their diet. Routine 1.8-2 mg daily supplementation modestly in-creases milk concentrations by 30-70 mcg/L in both under- and well-nourished lactating mothers. The highest supplemental dose studied has been 10 mg/day; milk concentrations increased from 200 mcg/L at baseline to 750 mcg/L after several months of supplementation.8There have been no reports of milk concentrations or breastfed in-fant safety during maternal high-dose riboflavin therapy.Intravenous high-dose riboflavin has been safely used in hyperbilirubinemic newborns as an adjunct to phototherapy. Riboflavin is considered to have a wide safety margin inhumans and there is no established upper limit of tolerability. A common benign side effect of larger doses is bright yellow urine discoloration. 6,9Owing to a lack of data, other drugs for migraine prophylaxis with good safety records during breastfeeding (e.g., propranolol, nortriptyline) are preferred over riboflavin. However, considering the wide safety marginof riboflavin, maternal use of 400 mg/day of riboflavin is not areason to discontinue breastfeeding. Vitamin B 6 Pyridoxal is the dominant form of vitamin B 6in human milk rather than pyridoxine or pyridoxamine. All three formsare equally bioactive and interconvertible in the mother's body. Pyridoxine is used medicinally because it is the most chemically stable. Average total vitamin B 6milk concen- trations are 70-180 mcg/L in healthy mothers not taking asupplement. Modest daily maternal supplementation with 6- 7.5 mg pyridoxine increases milk concentrations to 200-400 mcg/L, whereas higher daily doses of 10-20 mg increaseconcentrations 400-700 mcg/L. At these higher concen- trations, the breastfed infant would only be exposed to *100 mcg/kg per day. Pyridoxine 25 mg/day is recommended in mothers taking isoniazid and is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding according to CDC and WHO tuberculosis managementguidelines. Very high dosages of 300 mg/day can be used totreat neuritis caused by certain drugs, and 200-600 mg/day has been studied for postpartum lactation suppression by decreasing prolactin production, although it is often not ef-fective. 10With usual dosages found in vitamin supplements, pyridoxine has no effect on prolactin or lactation. There have been no reports of milk concentrations or breastfed infantsafety with the very high doses of pyridoxine, although the clinical situations in which such dosages might be used typically preclude breastfeeding.

For personal use only. response of milk vitamin B 6concentrations to maternal supplementation, maternal megadosing (200-600 mg/day) isvery likely to expose the breastfed infant to well above theirdaily requirement. However, such exposures are unlikely to be greater than the 1 mg/kg per day infant pyridoxine dose routinely used to prevent isoniazid-induced neuritis. Vitamin B 12(cobalamin) Average milk concentrations are 400-900 ng/L in well- nourished mothers with adequate vitamin B 12status. A daily 250 mcg maternal dose in B 12decient mothers increased milk concentrations by *90 ng/L, providing exclusively breastfed infants an extra 0.013 mcg/kg per day of vitamin B12.11 Vegan mothers in the United States taking high-dose daily B12supplements (range 100-5,000 mcg/day) had a median milk vitamin B 12level of 830 ng/L at 2 weeks postpartum, and 15% had milk concentrations at or more than the assaylimit of 1,670 ng/L.12Even at such a high milk concentration, a breastfed infant would only be exposed to 0.25 mcg/kg per day, which is about two to three times the adequate dailyintake. Vitamin B 12is considered to have a wide safety margin in humans and there is no established upper limit of tolerability. Neonates with suspected B 12deciency, mega- dosing vitamin B 12would be expected to normalize breast milk concentrations and is not a reason to discontinuebreastfeeding. Megadosing vitamin B 12has not been studied in women with normal B 12status; however, the expected increase in milk B 12concentration from taking B 12400- 1,000 mcg/day for cardiovascular health should be clinicallyunimportant and not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding. Biotin Milk biotin concentrations are 5-10 mcg/L in well- nourished mothers not taking a supplement. In poorly nour-ished mothers given a supplemental dose of 250 mcg/day of biotin, milk concentrations were 5 mcg/L compared with 1.6 mcg/L in those not given a supplement.8 Higher biotin doses have not been studied in lactating women. Biotin has a wide safety margin in humans and there is no established upper limit of tolerability. Maternal use of high-dose (2.5 mg/day) biotin is not a reason to discontinuebreastfeeding. Vitamin D Milk vitamin D concentrations are highly variable between individual mothers due to the positive effect of sunlight ex-posure. Those taking daily supplements with 400-2,000 IUhave average milk concentrations of 50-80 IU/L. These concentrations are slightly higher than those in non- supplemented well-nourished mothers living in higher lati-tudes during winter months, but not necessarily in summer. In small studies, mothers with normal or borderline deciency vitamin D given daily supplemental doses in the 4,000-6,400IU range, or a one-time 150,000 IU dose, had their breastfed infants' vitamin D status improve, on average , to more than the minimum cutoff for deciency during the study periodwithout any direct infant supplementation. 13,14Since not all infants studied achieved this outcome, infant serum 25-OH- vitamin D monitoring would be prudent to conrm efcacy ifa mother chooses to megadose in this range without directlysupplementing her infant. Average milk concentrations in these studies were 130-370 IU/L after 1-3 months of treat- ment, which would not be expected to expose the breastfedinfant to excessive vitamin D if the infant were to be also directly supplemented at the recommended 400 IU/day dos- age. However, average milk concentrations of *900 IU/L were reported in mothers after 7 months of 6,400 IU/day supplementation plus increased seasonal maternal sun ex- posure. Thus, the combination of maternal megadosing 6,400IU/day plus copious summertime sun exposure plus infant supplementation could potentially expose the exclusively breastfed infant to excessive ( >1,000 IU) daily doses of vi- tamin D and should be avoided or closely monitored. Vitamin K Concentrations of vitamin K 1(phylloquinone, phytona- dione) in breast milk are 1-3 mcg/L in most studies of well- nourished women not taking a supplement. Single large oralvitamin K 1doses of 20 mg can transiently increase milk K 1 concentrations to *130 mcg/L within 12-24 hours after dosing, but concentrations return to baseline after 1 week.Daily administration of 2.5 or 5 mg K 1increases milkTable 1.Vitamin Reference Values Vitamin RDAaPNVbULcInfant AId B2 1.6 mg 2 mg NE 0.3 mg B6 2 mg 2 mg 100 mg 100 mcg B12 2.8 mcg 4 mcg NE mcg 30 mcg NE 5 mcgC 120 100 mg 2,000 mg 40 D 600 IU 400 IU 4,000 IU 400 IU K 90 mcg \u2014 NE 2 mcg aRecommended dietary allowance (RDA) per day for lactating women >18 years of age.9 bTypical prenatal vitamin (PNV) content may vary slightly among different products. cUpper limit (UL) of daily tolerability for lactating adult women, from NIH.9 dAdequate daily intake (AI) for infants 0-6 months of age.9 Table 2.High-Dose Oral Vitamin Uses Vitamin high vegetarianism250-5,000 mcg Biotin Skin and hair health 2.5 mg C Common cold 250-1,000 mgD Bone health, cancer prevention 2,000-6,000 IUK Bone health, CV health 1-5 mg aPurported benets in the mother, not necessarily endorsed by the author.

For personal use only. concentrations to 60-80 mcg/L. Such concentrations would provide the exclusively breastfed infant with *10 mcg/kg per day of K 1, which is more than the adequate intake, but very similar to the intake of formula-fed infants. One studyfound that a 5 mg daily oral maternal K 1supplement im- proved the infant biochemical vitamin K status and lowered the infant risk of K 1deciency compared with no maternal supplementation, in exclusively breastfed infants who also received a standard birth intramuscular 1 mg dose.15High- dose maternal vitamin K (1-5 mg) is, therefore, safe forthe breastfed infant, but available data do not support ma- ternal supplementation as a substitute for direct administra- tion of vitamin K for the prevention of vitamin K deciencybleeding. Although K 1is the dominant form of vitamin K in the diet and in human milk, vitamin K 2is also naturally present in milk, predominantly as the K 2subtype menaquninone-4, also called MK-4. Very high MK-4 doses of 15-45 mg/day are commonly promoted for bone health based on studies con- ducted in postmenopausal women to lower the risk of oste- oporosis. No published information regarding vitamin K milk levels in mothers taking any dose of MK-4 supplements could be located. MK-4 has a higher reported milk-plasma ratiothan K 1, which is consistent with its known wider distribution throughout the body. There are also multiple forms of K 2 besides MK-4 that may be contained within products mar- keted or labeled as ''vitamin K 2.'' Lactating mothers should be discouraged from taking very high dose K 2or MK-4 until better data are available. Low maternal vitamin K 2doses (<1,000 mcg) taken as a daily supplement to maintain normal dietary intake would not be a reason to discontinue breast- feeding. Summary Although megadosing of vitamins is usually unnecessary for the mother or infant, there is little evidence of infant harm from this practice. Extremely high doses of pyridoxine mightsuppress milk production. Disclosure Statement No competing nancial interests exist. References 1. Keikha M, Bahreynian M, Saleki M, et al.
