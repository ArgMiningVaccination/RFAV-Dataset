Holistic Medicine 101 - What is Holistic Medicine? Holistic medicine (or alternative or complementary medicine) is a patient-focused, cooperative, and often more natural treatment option for various health conditions.

One of the incredibly beneficial components of holistic medicine is the collaborative approach to the care patients receive. Working as a team, a holistic medicine practitioner works with their patients to diagnose the real source of dysfunction within the body that is resulting in disease. There are so many different types of holistic medicine treatments.
