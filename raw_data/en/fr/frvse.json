This might make you wonder about how the child and adolescent immunization schedule works and what the research says about safety. That's a totally normal reaction; as a parent you just want to make sure you're looking after your child as much as possible. Right off the bat you should know that one of the best ways to keep your kids safe is to follow the recommended immunization schedule. [Delaying vaccines](https://www.self.com/story/vaccine-hesitant-patients) for any reason only puts people\u2014especially unvaccinated children\u2014at risk of contracting harmful or even deadly diseases. You should also feel reassured that a ton of effort and research goes into making sure the immunization schedule is safe and effective, and we'll explain this process below. We'll also provide answers to a lot of the questions you might have around the immunization schedule, like what happens when your child gets several vaccines at once, why this is a safe practice, and why medical experts don't recommend delaying vaccines. If you have additional questions don't hesitate to bring them up with your pediatrician, who should be happy to talk you through it. How vaccines work Let's briefly go over [how vaccines work to protect people](https://www.self.com/story/what-is-herd-immunity), especially young ones, from illness. It helps to think of the body's immune system as an army and pathogens (like viruses and bacteria that can cause disease) as enemy invaders. You wouldn't want to send an army into a fight unprepared, right? \"What a vaccine does is help train the immune system to detect the enemy and go into battle,\" [Walter A. Orenstein](http://vaccines.emory.edu/faculty-evc/primary-faculty/orenstein_walter.html), M.D., professor of medicine, epidemiology, global health, and pediatrics at Emory University, associate director of the [Emory Vaccine Center](http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), and director of Emory Vaccine Policy and Development, tells SELF. \"If it does get attacked by that enemy in the future, it already recognizes the invader and it is equipped to fight it off.\" Basically when you get vaccinated against a [disease](https://www.self.com/story/treating-vaccine-preventable-illness), the vaccine triggers your immune system to respond as if you had actually encountered that disease in the wild. But with vaccines you don't face the risk of being overwhelmed by the level of disease that you would be when exposed naturally, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/prinvac.pdf) explains\u2014meaning you don't get sick with the disease, you just trick your immune system into thinking it's a possibility. This process causes your body to produce white blood cells called T-lymphocytes, which will stick around in your body and remember the pathogen as well as how to respond to it. The result is that if you're ever exposed to that pathogen again in the future, those white blood cells are already there as part of your defense system and will immediately know how to fight it off. As the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/conversations/downloads/vacsafe-understand-color-office.pdf) explains, there are five main types of vaccines recommended for babies and children in the United States: - Live, attenuated vaccines use living\u2014but very weak\u2014viruses or bacteria. These include the MMR vaccine and the varicella (chicken pox) vaccine. People with compromised immune systems (such as those who have an infection like [HIV](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/hiv-aids)or who are [taking immune-suppressing drugs](https://www.self.com/story/parent-child-who-cant-get-vaccines)to treat an illness) generally can't receive this kind of vaccine. - Conjugate vaccines use a combination of polysaccharides (sugar molecules) and proteins to target bacteria that have a deceptive outer layer of polysaccharides. Normally a child's immune system has a tough time recognizing that bacteria with an outer layer of polysaccharides can be dangerous, but the vaccine makes this easier. An example is the [pneumococcal conjugate vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/pneumococcal/vaccination.html)that protects against 13 types of bacteria that can cause illnesses like pneumonia. - Inactivated vaccines use dead versions of bacteria and viruses (like polio). - Subunit vaccines use select portions of the virus or bacteria that they're vaccinating against. One example is the pertussis part of the DTaP vaccine. - Toxoid vaccines use weak toxins that can't cause actual illness to help train your body to protect against toxin-causing bacteria that could make people sick. Diphtheria and tetanus protection from the DTaP vaccine come from their respective toxoids. Although these types of vaccines are different, they all have the same effect of strengthening a person's immune system. Why the CDC sometimes recommends multiple vaccines at once Quick clarification before we dive in: There are combination vaccines that contain multiple immunizations in one shot, like DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and [pertussis](https://www.self.com/story/whooping-cough-in-the-picu)) and MMR ( [measles](https://www.self.com/topic/measles), mumps, rubella) vaccines. Then there's the practice of giving someone multiple vaccines, where they're getting more than one shot in the same visit. Sometimes one or more of those shots is a combination vaccine. For instance a one-year-old might get an MMR vaccine the same day as the varicella vaccine. So it's possible that your child might get multiple shots during one checkup (and also possible that some of those shots contain multiple immunizations). There are two main reasons why this makes sense, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/multiple-vaccines-immunity.html) explains. For starters, giving babies and younger kids multiple vaccines in the same visit when recommended means they're getting protection from potentially harmful diseases as early as possible. [Infants](https://www.self.com/story/4-month-old-catches-measles) especially are vulnerable to dangerous illnesses because their immune systems are weaker, so getting them vaccinated before they're even exposed to certain diseases is really important, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/multiple-vaccines-immunity.html) says. \"The vaccine schedule is designed to...optimize the immune response and ensure protection at as early an age as possible for people who are vulnerable to those diseases,\" Dr. Orenstein says. Additionally, bundling vaccines together is more convenient! As the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/multiple-vaccines-immunity.html) points out, fewer doctors office visits translates into spending less time and money for you as a parent. It can also be a benefit if your kid isn't a fan of doctor's appointments...or shots. Since there's such a rush to boost babies' immune systems, you may be wondering why the vaccination schedule doesn't just recommend giving newborns all their immunizations right away. But there are two main reasons why this doesn't happen. If you're pregnant and up to date on all of your recommended vaccines, your baby will have what's known as [passive immunity](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/prinvac.pdf). This passive immunity protects your baby from certain illnesses you were vaccinated against, and it can last for anywhere from a few weeks to a full year depending on the vaccine. Passive immunity happens because antibodies that fight disease can spread from you to your baby via the placenta in the last one to two months of pregnancy, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/prinvac.pdf) explains. This is part of why there's such a large push for people hoping to become pregnant and those who already are pregnant to get all of their vaccines. It helps make sure you're as safe as possible, but it also allows you to confer passive immunity to your baby. How long this passive immunity lasts helps inform the immunization schedule. On top of the fact that babies already have some measure of safety from certain illnesses when they're born (as long as their parent got all the recommended vaccines), some research indicates that infants' immune systems respond best to certain vaccines at certain ages, Dr. Orenstein says. For example, it appears as though babies who get their first of two MMR vaccine doses at six months instead of the recommended one year may have temporarily delayed or reduced immunity to the diseases they were vaccinated against, according to a [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6204a1.htm) paper. This could be because passive immunity basically prevents a vaccine from \"taking hold\" in a baby's system, Dr. Orenstein explains, and also just because their immune systems are a little too underdeveloped and weak to have the intended response. (Doctors sometimes still recommend early vaccination in certain instances, such as if a parent has to take a six-month-old to an area where there's a measles outbreak.) Where the immunization schedule comes from What you should know is that getting multiple vaccines is proven to be safe, including for babies and children. Here's how we know that and how that knowledge informs and guides the immunization schedule. The [U.S. immunization schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/parents-adults/resources-parents.html) is crafted by the [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/index.html) (ACIP), a body within the CDC. The ACIP is made up of public health experts who review data on the safety and efficacy of vaccines, ultimately collaborating with 30 medical organizations\u2014including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)\u2014to issue a recommended vaccine schedule for U.S. children and adults. \"[The vaccine schedule] is arrived at through very careful deliberations and is based on scientific data,\" Dr. Orenstein says. And they aren't just looking at research that tests each vaccine independently. They're also looking at research analyzing the safety and efficacy of multiple vaccines given together. Whenever a new vaccine is licensed, it has already been tested alongside the existing vaccines on the schedule for that age group, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/tools/parents-guide/parents-guide-part4.html). \"When we're doing a randomized trial of a new vaccine, where half of the people get the new vaccine being tested and half don't, we do it in the context of the current vaccine schedule,\" [Saad B. Omer](https://www.saadomer.org/saad-b-omer.html), Ph.D., M.P,H., inaugural director of the [Yale Institute for Global Health](https://medicine.yale.edu/yigh/), professor of infectious diseases at Yale School of Medicine, and the Susan Dwight Bliss Professor of epidemiology of microbial diseases at the Yale School of Public Health, tells SELF. \"So when the evidence for its safety and effectiveness comes out, it's not only looking at the evidence for that vaccine in isolation\u2014it's looking at it added to the current schedule.\" How babies' and children's immune systems respond to vaccines Babies' and children's immune systems can handle the low antigen level in vaccines\u2014yup, even the combined level that happens when getting multiple vaccines at once. First things first: All [vaccines](https://www.self.com/story/how-to-get-immunization-records) only contain very small amounts of [antigens](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/terms/glossary.html). Antigens are foreign substances (like viruses and bacteria) that could make you sick if you encounter them naturally\u2014but in vaccines there aren't enough of them to make you sick, only enough to produce the intended immune response that will protect you against them in the future. The vaccines administered to babies and children each contain between one and 69 antigens, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/multiple-vaccines-immunity.html). To put that in perspective, babies are exposed to thousands of antigens every day as soon as they're born, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/multiple-vaccines-immunity.html) explains. \"The number of germs that the body is naturally exposed to on a given day [is] much greater than [the amount of germs] in the vaccines in a given doctor's visit,\" Dr. Orenstein explains. \"Vaccines are a very trivial small fraction of all that.\" \"All that\" includes the legions of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens infants and young children introduce into their bodies by doing typical kid things like sucking on their fingers, trying to eat everything in sight, and even just breathing, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/multiple-vaccines-immunity.html) explains. (Babies put their hands or other objects into their mouths hundreds of times an hour, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/multiple-vaccines-immunity.html) estimates. What else are they going to do all day?) \"Even at that young age, the baby is naturally and fairly robustly handling many antigens at the same time,\" Omer says. It's just that some germs are too strong and dangerous for their budding immune systems to deal with, which is why we vaccinate: to offer protection against those illnesses in a way their body can safely handle. So the vast majority of the time, a baby or child's body is equipped to safely control the well-tested combinations and intervals of vaccines that the immunization schedule advises. The rare exceptions to this rule include situations like a child being [immunocompromised](https://www.self.com/story/rely-on-herd-immunity) or any other medical reason why they can't get a vaccine at that time, like having some type of acute illness with or without a fever. Possible side effects from getting multiple vaccines at once As with any medication, [vaccines](https://www.self.com/story/medical-exemption-vaccines) can have side effects, but they're typically minor (like a few days of swelling and tenderness at the injection spot), the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm) says. Very rarely vaccines may cause serious allergic reactions\u2014however, the risk is estimated to be around one in a million, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/adverse-reactions.html) says. (It's also incredibly rare but still technically possible to experience longer-term side effects like persistent shoulder pain after a vaccination\u2014but when vaccine side effects occur, the vast majority of them are mild and temporary.) Sometimes [vaccines](https://www.self.com/story/adult-vaccines) can also cause fevers, though they're also typically mild. \"That fever is really a sign that the vaccine is working because a fever is a very common part of an immune response,\" [Daniel Salmon](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/1015/daniel-salmon), Ph.D., M.P.H., professor and director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, tells SELF. And this is also rare but worth noting that post-vaccine fevers can sometimes cause temporary and harmless seizures in children between six months and five years old, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/febrile-seizures.html) says. These febrile seizures, as they're known, can happen due to any condition that causes a fever, including some of the very illnesses vaccines protect against, like chicken pox and the flu. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/multiple-vaccines-immunity.html) estimates the rates of vaccine-related febrile seizures to be at most 30 febrile seizures out of every 100,000 children vaccinated. Febrile seizures are most common when a child's temperature reaches 102 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, though they can happen with lower temperatures or receding fevers as well, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/febrile-seizures.html) says. They are more likely to happen after a child has gotten a combination of vaccines at once, but this doesn't mean that getting multiple vaccines at once is dangerous or overburdening a child's immune system in some way. A healthy child's immune system can still handle the multiple vaccines (which contain far fewer antigens than kids encounter every day). While no parent ever wants to watch their child have a seizure, it's important to know that febrile seizures typically end within a minute or two and don't cause any lasting damage, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/multiple-vaccines-immunity.html) says. A febrile seizure is an understandably scary thing but it's worth reiterating here that the risk of a child having one from a vaccine is very low. And sticking with the vaccine schedule can actually help prevent febrile seizures in babies and children by protecting them from illnesses that can lead to fevers, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/febrile-seizures.html) explains. If your child is [six months or older](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fever/in-depth/fever/art-20050997) with a fever at or over 102 degrees, it's generally safe to give them the recommended dosage of acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce their fever. But since febrile seizures can happen at any significantly elevated temperature and also when a fever is on its way down, these types of drugs haven't been shown to prevent febrile seizures from happening. But these medications can help your child feel better if they're experiencing a post-vaccine fever. Risks of modifying the vaccine schedule It's [risky to go off-schedule](https://www.self.com/story/treating-vaccine-preventable-illness) to avoid multiple vaccines or to space vaccines out farther apart from each other than recommended. For starters there is simply no data to suggest that veering off the ACIP schedule has any benefits in healthy children. \"There's no evidence that you're preventing something bad,\" Salmon says. The exception, as we mentioned above, is in situations such as if a doctor recommends not giving your child live, attenuated vaccines because they're immunocompromised. In fact delaying vaccines can be a pretty dangerous move. Sometimes people refer to this practice as \"vaccine spacing\" or an \"alternative immunization schedule,\" Salmon says, which he believes is a euphemism. \"It makes it sound like it could be a good thing,\" he explains. \"What it really [means] is delaying vaccines. You're leaving your child vulnerable. If during that time when your child is susceptible [they are] exposed to the disease, they could get it.\" Not to mention they could pass illnesses on to other children, like [babies](https://www.self.com/story/4-month-old-catches-measles) who might be too young to receive certain vaccines. Unless a child's doctor has determined there's a medical reason why they can't receive certain vaccines, delaying vaccines simply isn't safe. It only puts people\u2014including your child\u2014at unnecessary risk. \"All parents want what's best for their kids,\" Omer says. \"That's what [the immunization schedule] represents\u2014the best thing for the child.\" This story is part of a larger package called Vaccines Save Lives.
