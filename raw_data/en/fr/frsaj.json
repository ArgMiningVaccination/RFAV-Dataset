The [naturopathic doctors at Toronto Centre for Naturopathic Medicine](https://www.torontonaturopathicmedicine.ca/?post_type=staff) combine the best of traditional European herbalism and Chinese herbalism with the most recent advances in pharmacognosy (the study of plant pharmacy), as well as an awareness of potential herb-drug interactions. Benefits of Botanical (Herbal) Medicine Botanical (herbal) medicines have been used for millennia in the treatment of any and all health conditions. Their effectiveness in treatment of disease has been confirmed by innumerable scientific studies. Approximately 40% of prescription medications are derived from plants, and in 80% of cases, the use of a plant as a botanical (herbal) medicine is identical to the use of the pharmaceutical derived from that plant. Plants have been confirmed to have over 124 pharmacological actions, including: - Anti-cancer - Antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal - Immune system activity boosting [Antidepressant](https://www.torontonaturopathicmedicine.ca/depression/) [Anti-anxiety](https://www.torontonaturopathicmedicine.ca/anxiety/) [Sedative (insomnia reducing)](https://www.torontonaturopathicmedicine.ca/insomnia/) - healing - Endurance/energy increasing What to expect Botanical (herbal) medicines may be used alone, but are usually integrated in a holistic treatment plan. Botanical (herbal) medicines can take the form of tinctures (a concentrated, liquid form of botanical [herbal] medicine used in small amounts, typically one to three teaspoons daily), standardized extracts (capsules or tablets), teas, or salves and creams. Benefit from an effective botanical (herbal) medicine prescription is usually evident after between two to six weeks. After initial health improvements have been stimulated, doses are usually reduced to a maintenance level, with the eventual goal of complete removal of the medicine. Naturopathic doctors are the most thoroughly trained primary health care professionals in the safe and effective use of botanical (herbal) medicines.
