This is the highest quality, true-to-herb flavor olive oil available. The natural herb oil extracts and hint of fresh garlic have been combined with a fresh, super premium extra virgin olive oil base to create an inspired olive oil of the highest culinary standard. Top notes of dried basil, marjoram, garlic, oregano, thyme, rosemary, and crushed red pepper create a flavor explosion that is both balanced and harmonious. This classic infused olive oil is great for everyday use but especially delicious when drizzled on grilled vegetables, pizza, or pasta. "}
