These resources should be used together. You can view and download the following resources from http://cbseaca demic.nic.in : Learning ladder for science Assessment specification for science Sample lesson plans This document is a compilation of the sample items for Science Class 8. There are 36 items. This item bank is supported by the assessment specification which sets out the end -of-class assessment requirements and the learning ladder for the subject which maps the CBSE syllabi content to the NCERT curriculum. The item index (page 6) shows how each item maps to the learning ladder content and the assessment objectives. What these assessment items can be used for You can use the bank of questions in whatever way you wish but three main purposes have been identified: Create end -of-class assessments usi ng the items from the bank to meet the requirements set out in the assessment specifications. Create end -of-topic tests using the items from the bank for when you finish teaching a topic. Use individual or groups of questions from the bank to create or add to worksheets for use in class and for homework. What is in this document You will find linked questions and single questions which cover different aspects of the learning ladder content and different assessment objectives. You can use these questions to create your own assessments. Each item in this document begins with the metadata (see Figure 1). The metadata gives details of the content, assessment objective coverage and the number of marks. There is then a section showing any source material nee ded followed by the questions themselves and finally the mark scheme for the questions. www.britishcouncil.org 3 Item identity AO1 marks AO2 marks AO3 marks AO4 marks Content Reference(s) Science 8VS61a 1 8.1.7 1 Science 8VS61b 1 8.1.7 1 Total marks 2 Figure 1: Example of metadata How to use the assessment items You can peruse the bank of items by flicking through this document and selecting questions you wish to use. However, if you are assessing specific content then you can use the learning ladder to identify this content and then use the item index (page 7) to find any items which cover that content. Please note that not all of the content will have items. The item bank is only a sample of the questions which could be created so it may be necessary for you to write questions of your own to fill gaps. When y ou find a relevant assessment item in this document, you can copy and paste the question(s) and any source material into a new Word document which will form the assessment or worksheet. Other questions from the bank can be copied and pasted to this docume nt and an assessment or worksheet covering a range of items created. The questions can then easily be edited in the new document using Word and you can add any questions you write to best meet the needs of your classes. Once the questions have been past ed into the new document the numbering of the items can be changed so that they run through 1, 2 etc. There should be no need to change the numbering of parts (a), (b) etc unless a question has been deleted. You can create the mark schemes in the same way by copying the relevant section of the item documents and pasting them into a separate Word document which will form the mark scheme. Again, the question numbering will need to be amended. You can use these mark schemes to make sure that the marking is standardised, particularly if more than one teacher uses the assessment. When creating an end -of-class test the teacher should use the assessment specification to identify the number of marks and questions needed, the balance of content to be covered an d the weighting of the assessment objectives needed. You can then select items from the bank to build a test that meets the assessment specification and then order these in a logical manner so that it allows the students to work through the assessment. Y ou should also add a front page with the assessment name and details of the number of marks and the length of the assessment. Again, the mark scheme can be created at the same time and question numbers will need to be amended. www.britishcouncil.org 4 When copying items from the bank care needs to be taken to keep the format and style of the items consistent including the spacing and layout and ensuring that the number of marks available for each question is clearly linked to the question. www.britishcouncil.org 5 Assessment objectives This d ocument sets out the assessment objectives for CBSE Science and their percentage weighting for the CBSE end of year tests for the different classes from VI to X.

Source(s) FRICTION - Any object, moving over the surface of another objects slows down when no external force is applied on it. If force is applied along the left, friction acts along the right. The force of friction always opposes the applied force. Friction is caused by the irregularities on the two surfaces in contact. The force of friction is greater if a rough surface is involved. Question(s) 1 Explain using ideas of friction why it is difficult to move on a wet marble floor. (1 mark) Mark scheme 1. Why it is difficult to move on a wet marble floor? Answer Guidance On a wet marble floor, frictional force between the foot and floor decreases making it slippery, thus we feel difficult to move o n a wet marble floor. (1) Rolling friction is smaller than all the given frictions.
