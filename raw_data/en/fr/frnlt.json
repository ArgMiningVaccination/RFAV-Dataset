I remember in the first lockdown, I walked into the supermarket, shopping list ready, and it suddenly hit me that I hardly had any fruit or veg on my list and barely any left at home. There I was in the middle of a pandemic and I had forgotten about the crucial nutrients, depriving myself of the very thing that helps my body fight the nasty stuff. I have to be honest and say I was scared because we didn't know much about the virus at that time, the news was reporting all the cases, the number of people in hospital and all the deaths and I got incredibly freaked out to the point where I started caring about my immune system more than ever before. It was the thought that my immune system wasn't just a tool anymore, it could be the very thing that saves my life. I was thinking 'if there's this virus going around that's very dangerous to us to the point where we have to lock down the country then I need to do whatever I can to help my body'. So I started going for walks more regularly, taking vitamin supplements and of course eating more fruit and veg. The most important thing... Another thing I was also doing to help in a big way was targeted energy work* for boosting my immune system using Health Kinesiology which has majorly helped. [More about Health Kinesiology](https://kinesiologynorwich.co.uk/about/). Energy work means we are working in your energy system where you have energy pathways running up and down your body, this is your yin and yang. Energy is like life force, it is always there but we can't see it and it's not tangible. You may have heard of chi which means energy.) I did the energy work to make sure my immune system was the best it could be which also put my mind at ease knowing that if I did catch anything I was in the best position possible to fight it. My immune system has also improved gradually over the years since I've been having Health Kinesiology. I originally started having Health Kinesiology for IBS which you can read about [here](https://kinesiologynorwich.co.uk/about/). How does Health Kinesiology help my immune system? Because with Health Kinesiology you're working with the body as a whole, other things get better along the way too as well as the original issue you go for. Along with no longer being asthmatic my immune system is a lot more robust. I used to get all the colds going around and then they really used to do me in plus they would just linger for so long and always turn into a cough which would then last even longer! Whereas now when I get a cold I only have it for a couple of days and sometimes it doesn't even come out properly which is fab because I can still continue on with my day to day and it doesn't cripple me like it used to. Hurrah! Overall my body is now much more equipped to deal with whatever comes its way. Now you might have found yourself at some point over the course of the year thinking about your immune system, thinking about your body and not really knowing how to help it. Sometimes we don't understand what impact we could have by changing what we eat and doing some exercise. What you might not know But also, what you might not know is that it's not just food or exercise that will help or hinder our immune system. So, for example, let's say you're reacting to a certain food, not so subtly or entirely subtly (sometimes we can be having a reaction and not know it). If you're reacting to a certain food and then get a virus, your body is not in the best shape to then fight off that virus because it's too busy dealing with the reaction so your body is already weakened. There's only so much your body can cope with at once. There are lots of other factors that can impact our immune system without us realising. So what can we do to boost our immune system? On a very positive note, there is something we can do to change the impact on our immune system so that our immune system is absolutely top notch. What is that something we can do? It's not changing diet, it's not exercising. It's easier than that! Why it's Health Kinesiology of course! We do the energy work to sort out whatever might be going on with your body that we don't consciously know about. This works because your body knows what's going on in there. It knows what's hurting it and it knows what it needs in order to get better. And in order to clear out the bad and get your immune system to the best, we do Health Kinesiology. Join the group session! Start boosting your immune system now For this I'm doing 2 online boosting immune system group sessions via Zoom. One on the 28th Jan at 8pm for 30 mins and one on the 29th Jan at 12pm for 30 mins. They both cost \u00a320 each (the normal hourly fee is \u00a360 so it is significantly reduced for you to start you off with boosting your immune system). [Book for 28th Jan 8pm](https://mailchi.mp/d1ce38f33fda/group-healing-session-boost-immune-system-28th-jan) [Book for 29th Jan 12pm](https://mailchi.mp/48ab28ee6928/group-healing-session-boost-immune-system-29th-jan) These group sessions are really great because you have the option of doing one session or both sessions to get more of a boost and then of course there is still the option of doing 1 to 1 targeted sessions as well. These group sessions are fantastic because it will get you started off, it will give you a taster if you've never had health kinesiology before to see what its like without having to commit and pay for a whole hour session and it'll also give you that boost for your immune system. [Book 1 to 1 session](https://kinesiologynorwich.co.uk/book-now/) How will the group session work practically? I will be doing the group healing session online, through Zoom. Once you book I will have your email address ready to send you a Zoom link on the day. If you already have Zoom all you need to do is get yourself comfy and click the link just before the meeting starts.
