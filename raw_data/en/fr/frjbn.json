Learn more about how we facilitate spiritual support and connection. Welcome The Center for Spiritual Life is Emerson's inclusive, multifaith hub for religious and spiritual programming, support, and education. Our team of chaplains and student leaders work to foster a campus environment where faith traditions and spirituality can be practiced freely and wholly. Through one-on-one conversations, retreats, lunches, and meditative gatherings, we seek to provide spiritual nourishment to our campus. Come visit us on the 4th floor of 172 Tremont Street! Our Reflection Room overlooking the Boston Common is open for drop-in self-guided meditation and prayer weekdays from 9:00 am-12:00 pm and our Private Prayer and Meditation Room is open for drop-in use anytime the building is open. From Our Director Thank you for visiting the Center for Spiritual Life at Emerson College! College can be a time of transformative growth, exploration and self discovery\u2014and often that self discovery relates to some of life's big questions about who we are, what we believe, what matters to us, where we come from, and why we do what we do. Here at the Center for Spiritual Life, we seek to provide a safe and inclusive environment to explore these questions, build community, and get connected with the [wide array of spiritual communities](/departments/spiritual-life/houses-worship-practice) both here at Emerson and throughout Boston. Please join us by scheduling a one-on-one conversation with a chaplain or by attending any of our signature programs such as [Wisdom Wednesdays](/departments/spiritual-life/offerings-programs/wisdom-wednesdays) (a meditative gathering every Wednesday at noon) or our \" [What Matters to Me and Why](/departments/spiritual-life/offerings-programs/what-matters-me-and-why)\" lunch series, or by checking out one of our six student organizations.
