I learned great relaxation skills to help with my anxiety. I have been implementing meditation into my daily life. The retreat has allowed me to think clearly about how I want to integrate both western and holistic medicine into my life dealing with severe inflammation and pain. I learned more about Ayurveda in one morning than I did in my entire 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training. It was extremely helpful to have such expert, caring, and humble faculty facilitating the program. I believe the experience will have long-lasting healthful effects for a long time. I will be coming back for future programs. The program helped me pay close attention to how I respond physically and mentally to the world (diet, social activity, relationships, etc). It increased overall awareness that reminds me to be kinder to myself and to practice patience when faced with things beyond my control.
