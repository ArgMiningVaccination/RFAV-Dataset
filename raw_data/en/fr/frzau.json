Wakefield and his colleagues note that the Vaccine Safety Committee of the U.S. Insti - tute of Medicine has stated, when discussing the possibility of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism, that \"challenge re-chal - lenge would constitute strong evidence of an association.\" \u2014 \"Persistent ileal measles virus in a large cohort of regressive autistic children with ileocolitis and lymphonodular hyperplasia: revisitation of an earlier study,\" S.

A new research review, by Gladys ElChaar and colleagues, indicates that the drug is very safe for pe - diatric patients. ElChaar et al. evaluated all journal articles describing or evaluating the useful - ness and/or safety of naltrexone in children with autism spectrum disorders. In all, they reviewed data from three case reports, eight case series, and 14 clinical studies. The dosages used in these studies were typically far higher than those currently being used in low-dose naltrexone therapy. While current evidence indicates that the lower doses are much more beneficial, ElChaar et al. found that larger doses also could be effective in reducing self-injury and sometimes in reducing hyperactivity, agitation, irritability, tantrums, social with - drawal, and stereotyped behavior. The only adverse event frequently reported by the studies was sedation, although two children experienced panic attacks which appeared to be dose-related. The researchers conclude, \"A child af - fected by autistic disorder may benefit from a trial of naltrexone therapy, particularly if the child exhibits self-injurious behavior and other attempted therapies have failed.\" Naltrexone, an opioid-blocking drug, is most frequently used to treat individuals ad - dicted to opiates or alcohol. Researchers in the studies analyzed by ElChaar et al. used dosages of the drug ranging from 0.5 to 2 mg per kilogram per day, while low-dose naltrexone therapy typically uses a total dose of about 3 mg administered transdermally. Reported benefits include improved mood, cognition, language, and socialization. \u2014 \"Efficacy and safety of naltrexone use in pediatric patients with autistic disorder,\" G. M. ElChaar, N. M.

A new European study of 61 children with ADHD indicates that pycnogenol is highly effective in reducing symptoms of the disorder. Jana Trebaticka and colleagues admin - istered 1 mg/kg/day of pycnogenol or a placebo to the children for four weeks, in a double-blind study. Participants were tested before and after treatment, as well as at a follow-up one month after treatment ended, using the Conner's Teacher Rating Scale, the Conner's Parent Rating Scale, the Child At - tention Problems (CAP) scale, and a modified version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for children.The researchers report, \"Results show that one-month pycnogenol administration caused a significant reduction of hyperactivity, [and] improved attention and visual-motoric coor - dination and concentration of children with ADHD.\" No gains were seen in the placebo group. Children taking pycnogenol relapsed after the treatment was discontinued. The researchers conclude, \"Our results point to an option to use pycnogenol as a natural supplement to relieve ADHD symp - toms of children.\" \u2014 \"Treatment of ADHD with French maritime pine bark extract, Pycnogenol,\" J.

To the Editor: The recent abstract regarding B6, by Jim Adams et al. (ARRI 20/1), does not say why vitamin B6 works. It does report correctly that cell levels of P5P are lower in autistics than in controls. However, the 113 enzymes needing P5P is not an explanation focused on autism. Next, I must point out that just B6 alone helps only about 30%. According to ARI's LETTER TO THE EDITORparent ratings of treatments (February 2006), 8% get worse, and 63% show no behavioral improvement. In other words, B6 alone is not beneficial in at least 70% of cases per parent reports. The problem with B6 (pyridoxine) is slow phosphorylation. Zinc is the tor; melatonin signals for phosphorylation; slowed sulfation caused by megadose pyridoxine or P5P. It's likely that pyridoxine + magnesium + zinc + melatonin would help 70%, but that's speculation.The conclusion that P5P caused 10% to exhibit worse behavior is not significantly different from 8% worse for pyridoxine per ARI Publication 34. Because of individuality, some autistic children will do best on pyridoxine, some on P5P, some on a blend of both, and almost all will do best when zinc, magnesium, and melatonin are included.
