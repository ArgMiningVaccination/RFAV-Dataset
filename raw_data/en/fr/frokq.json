A large proportion \"of unconventional practices entail theories that are patently unscientific.\" \"It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride. There cannot be two kinds of medicine \u2014 conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work.\" \"I submit that if these treatments cannot withstand the test of empirical research, ... then we have wasted a lot of time and effort. The time has been wasted on all the people who have spent years learning falsehoods about acupuncture points and the principles of homeopathy. And the patients have wasted their time, money, and efforts receiving treatments that were not what they were represented to be or were harmful.\" - Type - Article - Information [Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics](/core/journals/journal-of-law-medicine-and-ethics), [Volume 31](/core/journals/journal-of-law-medicine-and-ethics/volume/808E6C6E1E8CCD1005835A6CAD45E2A0), [Issue 2](/core/journals/journal-of-law-medicine-and-ethics/issue/ED3E3BB93932EB35402A0BD347D30FC1), Summer 2003 , pp. 222 - 235 - Copyright - Copyright \u00a9 American Society of Law, Medicine and Ethics with Peripheral Stem Cell/Autologous Rescue, Treatment for Breast Cancer, in 2 Hayes Directory of New Medical Technologies' Status (updated May 1997), available through < Responsibilities: Models of Defined Contribution (Washington, D.C.: Academy for Health Services Research and Health Policy, 2002), available at < [http://hcfo.net/pdf/definedcontribution.pdf](http://hcfo.net/pdf/definedcontribution.pdf)>; Robinson, J., \"The End of Managed Care,\" JAMA, 285 (2001): 2622-28; Freudenheim, M., \"H.M.O.
