This curiosity has bred a desire for alternative ways of being that focus on sustainability, compassion and plant-based living. Ayurveda is the world's oldest system of healthcare that is based upon the relationship between the mind, body, soul and emotions. Ayurveda provides us with the tools to live in harmony with our environment while not only curing disease but preventing it through plant-based living, daily + seasonal rituals/practices and an emphasis on mental + emotional wellbeing. Ayurveda is the sister science to Yoga. Each season brings with it different recommendations for what to eat. Here are some suggestions for Winter: Ayurvedic Winter Food Principles by [Chasca Summerville](https://mailchi.mp/9900e25c8ed7/fuby941oe5?mc_cid=e8059024aa&mc_eid=0c8cb3741c) As the cooler weather sets in, our internal fire (Agni) retreats deep within, sparking our appetite and need for more substantial, nourishing, heating foods to fuel us over winter. With our digestive capacity at its strongest, now is the time for... - Hearty meals consisting of spices, oils, vegetables, grains, legumes, seeds & nuts. - Focus on curries, stews, soups and pies containing vegetables like onions, potatoes, carrots, beetroot, radishes, spinach, asparagus, okra and other greens. - Incorporate hot spices like garlic, ginger, turmeric, black pepper, mustard seed, paprika, cayenne and chilli. - Utilise cooked grains like oats, barley, rice and quinoa to provide fibre and energy. - All beverages (including water) should be warm to ignite Agni, keep digestive processes invigorated, cleanse the respiratory tract and improve circulation. - Adopt a tea ritual and sip throughout the day. A good way to start this is with warm water and a slice of ginger. - Remember to avoid anything cold or frozen (which will dampen Agni), as well as dairy products, as they emphasise congestion.

The cleanse is designed to be done from the comfort of your own home and will include 2 live Zoom gatherings (also available for on-demand viewing) At the heart of this cleanse lives the healing powers of Kitchari - an ancient recipe consisting of rice, lentils and spices, which has been used for thousands of years to assist healing & rejuvenation. Kitchari is warming, grounding, highly nutritious and delicious. Ayurvedic cleansing is based on mono-meals (eating largely the same simple food) which allows your gut to rest & reset, so be prepared to largely consume Kitchari during this time, with the addition of Sooji (semolina porridge) in the morning and lots of lovely healing teas + elixirs.
