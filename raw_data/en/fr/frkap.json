However, concern for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) sensitization subsequent to vaccination exists. Methods: A retrospective review of pediatric kidney transplant candidates (PKTCs) 18 years old who had received vaccinations between February 1, 2017 and November 30, 2019 was conducted. Emergence of de novo anti-HLA antibody (HLA-Ab) 3-4 weeks postvaccinations detected by the Luminex single antigen bead assay (SAB) was evaluated. Outcomes assessed included change in the HLA-Ab mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) 25% from baseline, and 10 000. Results: Sixty vaccinations were administered to 14 patients. Forty-one potential de novo HLA-Ab were detected in five patients. After additional antibody panel testing, 5/41 potential de novo HLA-Ab were determined to be HLA specific; the remaining 36 were deemed nonspecific. The 5 de novo HLA-Ab were observed in three patients and were deemed weak antibody (Ab). Median MFI showed a significant increase for nonspecific Ab, but not de novo HLA-Ab. Median MFI values were deemed transient at 7-10 week follow-up. No HLA-donor-specific Ab developed posttransplant in the patients who developed de novo HLA-Ab. Conclusion: Vaccination resulted in a transient increase in non-HLA-specific Ab. The majority of responses were non-HLA specific, hypothesized to be related to denatured antigens on single antigen beads. These data suggest limited clinical impact of vaccinations on the emergence of de novo HLA-Ab. |Original language||English (US)| |Article number||e14304| |Journal| Keywords - HLA antibody - pediatric - sensitization - vaccination ASJC Scopus subject areas - Pediatrics, Perinatology, and Child Health - Transplantation "}
