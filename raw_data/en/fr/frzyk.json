Feedback from last retreat: \"The best parts for me were the Kambo Ceremony, our first ceremony as a group Saturday night, and the hike we took on Sunday. All three still sit and resonate with me greatly everyday. The environment Saturday night was so special. Having the fire pit lit, the music going, us all comfy and laying next to one another. It felt like such a time for personal growth but group bonding as well. I also loved being outside so much, and what a perfect day for it.\" \"...best part of the retreat was the main ceremony Saturday night and the sensation of everyone's energy plus the harmonious sound bath. But the combination of medicines leading up to it was beyond my initial expectation, I think they all fostered a positive bodily experience.\" \"...I can't believe how good I feel.\" [Mountain April 1-4](https://mailchi.mp/d336716d05d4/untitled-page), 2022 $825 near Burnsville, NC Snaggy Mountain is an artist retreat located in the mountains of NC on a sustainable homestead.

YOUR INSTRUCTORS Connie Magee Connie Magee MS Ed, E-RYT500, LMT has 9 years as Experienced Yoga & Meditation teacher, massage therapist, sound healer, shamanic medicine practitioner, energy worker and acupuncture student. Clients and students value Connie's creative, integrative and inspired approach. Vinyasa Flow is her foundational style, as well as integrating multiple meditation styles into the movement and seated practice. With 12 years experience as adventure Guide and Wilderness EMT, she's taken clients all over the world and US on awesome retreats. She teaches weekly classes at The Center Yoga and workshops in 7 states. As a bodyworker, she has deftly integrated sound healing, stones and shamanic healing into her work for the past 5 years, offering private sessions as well as workshops. Her mesmerizing guided meditations blend with elements of nature and instruments, for transformative states and deep clearing and healing. She began sound healing and teaching yoga during her life in NYC, at Sonic Yoga and courses with Satya Brat and Don Conreaux. Sandra Diaz Sandra has has been a yoga practitioner for 15 years and completed her 200 hour teaching training through Neighborhood Yoga in Boone NC in 2015. She is also a mindfulness practitioner, and helps facilitate Whispering Waters Sangha, a local meditation group. Sandra's philosophy: Yoga means to yoke, to join. When we bring our breath, our mind and our body into unison, we allow the wholeness that is our essential nature to express itself. We step on the mat to intentionally witness how we move through the world, in order to lovingly encourage this wholeness to shine through. The more peace we can generate within ourselves, the more peace we have to offer the world. We can then express our values through thought and action from a place of groundedness and spaciousness. The path of the \"wholehearted warrior\" empowers us to create the world in which we want to live. Yoga, therefore, can be an act of resistance to the forces that encourage us to remain fragmented and distracted from our larger truth. Matt Wasson Since 2012, yoga has become a cornerstone practice for Matt's well-being. Yoga taught Matt how to listen to his body and opened the door to other practices like meditation and dance that are key elements of a happier, healthier and more connected lifestyle today. Matt teaches a vinyasa flow style in which poses are built from the ground up and the core out and every transition is initiated from a place of support. His teaching is informed by many modalities including the Alexander Technique, which was the basis for my recovery from chronic back pain. Matt's intention in teaching yoga is to help students learn to listen to their bodies and use them more wisely and to increase their range of motion, strength, equanimity and mindfulness. OPTIONAL: Kamb\u00f4 Frog Medicine Cleanse, Thursday night Oct. 3, ~7:00pm and Sunday, Oct 6, 1:00pm Requires a 12-hour fast prior. No food, minimal water , the entire day Thursday. The ultimate cleanse- body, mind, spirit? Kamb\u00f4 is the medicine of transformation, as it is the Master Cleanser. Multi-dimensional healer Connie Magee offers a special ceremony the night before our retreat. Traditionally, we receive Kamb\u00f4 medicine at every season change, for health and alignment. You will sleep deeply and awaken with incredible clarity, lightness and clearer skin and sensory organs! This will enhance your weekend experience and allow you to connect more deeply to the movement, the energies of nature, the nourishment of the foods, and ultimately yourself as a divine being. Rap\u00e9h & Sananga will be served, as well. These indigenous medicines are legal, powerful agents of emotional & spiritual transformation as well as physical cleansing of the entire system. Bioactive peptides allow your system to dump its toxic load and fully release. All medicines offered are legal and safe. These are not psychedelics. This indigenous and ethically obtained medicine is from the Amazon, where it has been used for centuries to purge the body, cleanse the spirit, release energetic attachments and heal disease of all kinds. It is known simply as \"The Inoculation.\" Tribespeople take Kamb\u00f4 at every season change, lifelong. The medicine provides incredible mental clarity, sensory acuity and restored physical function, as well as pain relief for chronic conditions. It is also known as \"Hunter's Medicine,\" as is taken by tribesmen prior to hunting in the jungle at night, due to the stamina and mental clarity it provides. It is especially effective for depression, anxiety, substance abuse/addictions, PTSD, sexual trauma, autoimmune issues, Lyme disease, musculoskeletal pain, heavy metal and chemical toxicity, infertility and many other conditions. Clients invariably report feeling lighter, more emotionally intact, and empowered to make changes in their lives, where they were previously blocked. Longstanding physical and mental issues show improvement or complete resolution with this medicine. Kamb\u00f4 is best received in a Cycle of 3 during one moon cycle, or ideally, 3 in 3 days. Connie offers this medicine continually by appointment in Harrisonburg and other areas, and in group session at the season changes. This allows the Medicine and process to work at progressively deeper levels, for greatest benefit. If you wish to incorporate a Cycle of 3 into the retreat, Connie can offer an additional ceremony on Sunday at 1:00. There are dietary and spiritual preparations- contact Connie directly via fb Messenger or email to initiate. A detailed preparation document will be sent and each participant will receive an in-depth 1:1 screening. This medicine is not offered to anyone with serious heart conditions, history of aneurysm, Crohn's or Addison's Disease or an active drug or alcohol addiction. A fast of 12 hours is required prior to each ceremony, and meat/dairy-free diet for 3 days before and after. This medicine is safe, powerful and effective. References available upon request.

Jan 2019 Feedback: Spending a weekend with Connie Magee was a profoundly grounding opening beautiful awakening. I went to the weekend with an empty cup no expectations, but knew that I have been dealing with many anxieties and fears and I've been trying to work through over the past year. Connie held space on a beautiful sacred mountain top where there was no light pollution, no cell phone service, no flight Paths. Through movement/yoga, breath work, daily individual and group sound healing with her magnificent gongs and singing bowls, energy work, and chanting all held in sacred ceremony, I feel as though I was able to release all of the things I intended To let go of, and created space and openings for many blessings that I've been waiting to receive.
