We remain true to the vision and values of our founder, Sir Hen ry Wellcome, a medical entrepreneur, collector and philanthr opist. Our Philosophy: Good health makes life better. We w ant to improve health for everyone by helping great ideas to thriv e. Since 1936, our support has helped to save and improve millio ns of lives around the world through science, research, eviden ce and engagement with society.

Seizing opportunities To be more focused and proactive in specific areas. We want to connect experts from different disciplin es, build partnerships, and lead advocacy, policy development, communications and public engagement. We will do this by providing focused support that creates a step change over five to ten years. Research Ecosystems in Africa and Asia: Build partnerships in low- and middle- income countries more scientists in these places can pursu e world-class research. Our Planet, Our Health: Build understanding of how global food systems and urbanisation connect to health, improving the evidence base for public policy. Drug-resistant infections: Explore how best to use and protect the treatments we have and to encourage the development of new ones. Vaccines: Explore how best to stimulate research, technology development and policy to address critical unmet needs.
