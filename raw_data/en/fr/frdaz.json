Considering how we are about to enter the of the cold and flu season, it makes sense to take a proactive approach when it comes to protecting your health. Boosting Your Immune System You may already be aware of various ways you can remain healthy throughout the winter season, but the real question is whether or not you actually follow through with the type of recommendations you've been offered over the years. If performing at your best and living a healthy, active lifestyle are important to you, consider the following tips the [Chiropractors at AICA College Park](https://www.chiropractorcollegepark.com/) believe will keep your immune system strong. Chiropractic Tips for Boosting Your Immunity Get Plenty of Rest Medical studies show a direct correlation between rest and sickness. People who are able to get at least eight hours of sleep each night tend to be sick far less than those who aren't well rested. If you have difficulty sleeping, not only can a Chiropractic Adjustment improve your immunity against harmful viruses, it can also help correct any sleep disorder you may be struggling with. Add More Veggies and Fruits To Your Diet Chiropractic offers holistic solutions that focus on overall health and wellness, which is why our Chiropractors refer to personal diet plans when evaluating each patient's health. Eating plenty of vegetables and fruits, instead of processed or refined carbohydrates, helps improve your immune system's performance and helps you perform at peak levels. Consuming enough vitamins and minerals allows you to maintain a healthy body, while also preventing various critical conditions from developing such as type II diabetes. Exercise More Each Week Working out for at least 30 minutes a day, three days a week can go a long way when it comes to ridding your body of waste products and toxins that accumulate through various channels (e.g. environment, diet, personal habits). Exercising helps your body perform better, boosts your immune system and helps get your blood pumping. Regular Chiropractic Adjustments Chiropractic Adjustments remove barriers (subluxations) from your spine, which allows your internal systems to function correctly and communicate with each other. Receiving Chiropractic Adjustments on a monthly basis is proven to help people avoid getting sick, especially those who often suffer from some sinus infection. Flush Out Your System Often Drinking plenty of water allows you to flush out your system on a regular basis, which helps eliminate free radicals and other harmful substances. Most Chiropractors recommend drinking at least eight cups of water each day to support a healthy immune system and to stay hydrated. Adjusting Personal Habits Altering various aspects of your personal lifestyle tends to have the most impact on supporting a healthy immune system for the long-haul. If you identify with any of the following situations, ask our Chiropractors for help finding ways to substitute or eliminate these harmful habits: - Smoking cigarettes - Overeating - Consuming excessive amounts of alcohol - Avoiding regular health screens - Not practicing basic sanitary habits e.g. washing your hands Learn Other Great Ways You Can Boost Your Immune System and Stay Healthy By Scheduling A Consultation Following these tips will put you on the right path toward living a healthy and active life.
