The three CAM strategies provided were massage, acupuncture, and chiropractic therapies. The evaluation team worked with a peer recovery support specialist and tribal evaluation intern to co-create a one-page, eight-question, fixed-response instrument based on previous work in the community. Surveys were collected by the peer support specialist post-session with individuals receiving CAM therapies. Surveys assessed self-reported impacts, reasons for attending CAM sessions, and mental, physical, spiritual, and emotional health before and after CAM sessions. The greatest increase observed was for physical health (M = 5.32, SD = 2.53) and physical health after (M = 8.38, SD = 1.60) based on self-report data; t(78) = 6.46, p = .0001. CAM sessions positively influenced participants; 83% (n = 33) reported being more hopeful about their overall health and wellness. The holistic approach demonstrated promising results and potential benefits of CAM on overall wellness and belonging. Further research is needed to explore how CAM may be implemented as a culturally centered approach to managing chronic pain often associated with opioid use disorder. | || |[ ] ~ FULL TEXT [ Complementary and Integrative Health Approaches and](ABSTRACTS/CIH_Approaches.shtml) Pain Care Quality in the Veterans Health Administration Primary Care Setting: A Quasi-Experimental Analysis J Integr Complement Med 2023 (Mar 27) [EPUB] Our data suggest that incorporating CIH approaches may reflect higher overall quality of care for patients with musculoskeletal pain seen in primary care settings, supporting VHA initiatives and the Declaration of Astana to build comprehensive, sustainable primary care capacity for pain management.

Of these, 19 studies (including ~14,002 patients) were specific to quality of life (or well-being) as a main outcome. Most studies included were multidisciplinary studies (n = 12), followed by acupuncture (n = 4), chiropractic (n = 3), and massage or reflexology (n = 1). The short-form group of questionnaires (SF-12, SF-36, SF-8) were the most used quality-of-life/well-being questionnaire, comprising 37% of studies (n = 7), and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures comprised 21% (n = 4). Both questionnaires are normed to U.S. population, allowing for comparison. The average improvement across the comparable SF and PROMIS measures for Physical Health was 6% (range 2%-20%) and for Mental Health was 5% (range 1%-11%), demonstrating clinical significance.

Recommendation rates were higher among female physicians than among male physicians and varied by medical specialty. General/family practitioners and internists recommended CHAs at higher rates than pediatricians, and more than half of psychiatrists recommended mind-body therapies, compared with <30% of physicians from other specialties. Understanding practice patterns of U.S. physicians related to recommendations for CHAs, and their differences across medical specialties and physician sex, could inform consumers, physicians, and medical schools. | || |[ ] ~ FULL TEXT [ The Use of Complementary and Integrative Health Approaches](../Cost_Effectiveness/The_Use_of_Complementary_and_Integrative_Health.shtml) for Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain in Younger US Veterans: An Economic Evaluation PLoS One. 2019 (Jun 5); 14 (6): e0217831 According to our propensity score-weighted HLM analysis, in a cohort of younger Veterans with chronic MSD pain during 2010 through 2013, any use of complementary and integrative health (CIH) was not only cost-effective, it was cost saving. Any use of CIH was associated with an average reduction in healthcare costs of $637, a 0.34-point reduction in pain intensity on a 0-10 pain scale, and a less than one percentage point increase in opioid use during the year after CIH start. Given the VA's growing interest in the use of CIH, further, more detailed analyses of its impacts are warranted. | | Researching the Appropriateness of Care in the Complementary and Integrative Health Professions | || |[ Part 1: Physiol Ther. 2018 (Nov); 41 (9): 800-806 ~ FULL TEXT Although there is general agreement that all patients should receive health care that is appropriate to their health problem and that inappropriate care is costly, [1] the challenge comes in determining what is appropriate care. [2] In general, appropriateness comprises the right therapy, for the right problem, and for the right patient. In the current health care system, one answer to the question of appropriateness is that evidence-based care is appropriate care. However, this answer only shifts the problem from deciding what is appropriate to deciding what is evidence-based. Further, there is considerable debate about what percentage of treatments can claim to be evidence based. Some estimate that as little as 15% to 20% of all medical practice can truly claim to be evidence based. [3-6] Hicks notes, \"It is generally accepted that between 20% and 60% of patients either receive inappropriate care or are not offered appropriate care.\" [6] For large areas of health care, including complementary and integrative health (CIH; previously known as complementary and alternative medicine [CAM]), [7, 8] we have very little data on how much care is appropriate or evidence based. | || |[ Part 2: What Every Researcher and Practitioner Should Know](ABSTRACTS/Researching_the_Appropriateness_of_Care_Part_2.shtml) About the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and Practice-based Research in the United States. J Manipulative Physiol Ther. 2018 (Nov); 41 (9): 807-813 ~ FULL TEXT For this study, we provided clinics with information about what the rules are under HIPAA, demonstrated how the study complied with those rules, explained the logic behind the necessity for collecting files from both the prospective and retrospective samples, and if requested, provided clinics with a confidentiality agreement signed by the study principal investigator and an organizational contracts representative. We hope that the process we developed will assist other CIH researchers and practitioners in future studies. | || |[ Part 3: Designing Instruments With Patient Input](ABSTRACTS/Researching_the_Appropriateness_of_Care_Part_3.shtml) J Manipulative Physiol Ther. 2019 (Jun); 42 (5): 307-318 ~ FULL TEXT It is important to collect valid data about patients' experiences and beliefs for research and clinical care. In many instances, as with our study, the best approach may be to use existing measures for some constructs, to modify existing measures for other constructs, and to create entirely new measures for constructs where the existing measures are insufficient. In this article, we have described how we used multiple qualitative methods and a review of the literature to identify constructs and then design questionnaires that were successfully administered as part of a national survey of chiropractic patients with chronic low back and neck pain. We have presented preliminary reliability and validity data for one of our novel measures, which addresses coping behaviors. We have also outlined suggestions for CIH researchers and providers who want to collect this sort of information from patients. | || |[ Part 4: Putting Practice Back Into Evidence-based Practice](ABSTRACTS/Researching_the_Appropriateness_of_Care_Part_4.shtml) by Recruiting Clinics and Patients J Manipulative Physiol Ther. 2019 (Jun); 42 (5): 319-326 ~ FULL TEXT In this paper, we have outlined the way in which we can make the evidence practiced based in a way that ensures rigorous methods are applied and valid and reliable data are collected. Through this process, we learned that clinic staff is essential. The study demonstrated that at least in chiropractic, and we think CIH generally, there is a strong desire among practitioners to be involved in research and therefore a good basis to move the \"P\" into EBP. If the chiropractor supported the study, so did the staff, and if the staff and chiropractor supported the study, so did the patients. Another lesson from this study was the amount of effort needed to obtain a substantial and empowered sample. The RAND Corp was helped by its earlier studies in chiropractic and its positive reputation in the chiropractic community, but it was also helped by the responsiveness of the profession in engaging in research. | || |[ Part 5: Using Patient Records: Selection, Protection,](ABSTRACTS/Researching_the_Appropriateness_of_Care_Part_5.shtml) and J Manipulative Physiol Ther. 2019 (Jun); 42 (5): 327-334 ~ FULL TEXT The chiropractic record data collection for this project focused on evaluating the appropriateness of mobilization and manipulation for chronic low back pain (CLBP) and chronic cervical pain (CCP). Additional data were collected to summarize the duration of care, frequency of visits, and nature of treatments provided. For this study, the chiropractic record provided the most comprehensive data to assess appropriateness of chiropractic care. Records of care were successfully obtained from most study sites. This paper set out to provide an overview of the 4-step process (consent, selection, protection, and abstraction) of acquiring a large sample of chiropractic patient records from multiple practices and subsequent data abstraction. As we noted, each step poses challenges, and in each step, we documented the solutions we implemented. For future research based on chiropractic clinics, it is clear that improved record keeping and easier access to files would greatly simplify the task of abstracting data from a patient file. Use of an EHR may improve clinical content, but even paper-based records could benefit from improved and better use of templates to document patient history, examinations, treatment, and outcome measurements. Consistent documentation would ease ongoing research efforts and support providers in case of legal questions or a reimbursement audit. As chiropractic care becomes more accepted in medical settings that may require more provider collaboration, maintenance of complete treatment documentation will become even more important. | || |[ ] ~ FULL TEXT [ Complementary and Alternative Medicine Services](ABSTRACTS/Complementary_and_Alternative_Medicine_Services.shtml) in the Military Health System J Altern Complement Med. 2017 (Nov); 23 (11): 837-843 Three-fourths of military treatment facilities (MTFs) offering CAM provide stress management/relaxation therapy, two-thirds provide acupuncture, and at least half provide progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, chiropractic, and mindfulness meditation. MTFs most commonly report CAM use for pain and mental health conditions. Acupuncture and chiropractic are most commonly used for pain, and stress management/relaxation therapy and mind-body medicine combinations are most often used for mental health-related conditions. We estimate 76,000 CAM patient encounters per month across the MHS.

In contrast only 8.1% of children without pain conditions used CAM (2: p<.001). CAM use among children with pain was associated with female sex (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.49, p=0.005), higher income (aOR=1.61, p=0.027), and presence of 4+ comorbidities (aOR=2.01, p=0.013). Among children with pain who used CAM the 2 most commonly used CAM modalities were biologically-based therapies (47.3%) (e.g., special diets and herbal supplements) and manipulative or body-based therapies (46.3%) (e.g., chiropractic and massage).

Medications may provide only partial relief from this chronic pain and can be associated with unwanted effects. As a result, many individuals turn to complementary health approaches as part of their pain management strategy. This article examines the clinical trial evidence for the efficacy and safety of several specific approaches-acupuncture, manipulation, massage therapy, relaxation techniques including meditation, selected natural product supplements (chondroitin, glucosamine, methylsulfonylmethane, S-adenosylmethionine), tai chi, and yoga-as used to manage chronic pain and related disability associated with back pain, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, neck pain, and severe headaches or migraines. | || | [ Mapping the Health Care Policy Landscape for Complementary](ABSTRACTS/Mapping_the_Health_Care_Policy.shtml) and Alternative Medicine Professions Using Expert Panels and Literature Analysis J Manipulative Physiol Ther. 2016 (Sep); 39 (7); 500-509 ~ FULL TEXT One generally recognized characteristic of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is holism, which is a focus on treating the whole person. [1, 2] Complementary and alternative medicine practitioners use a wide range of techniques embedded within various broad healing paradigms to provide treatment. However, despite this broad approach and holistic goal, CAM is often addressed in policy and research as individual procedures (ie, modalities or treatments). In sociology, this dichotomy is one of CAM practitioners as members of professions vs members of skilled occupations, with professions having broader authority and autonomy because of a systematic body of theory that goes beyond skills.

Sointu [58] argues that CAM use is becoming increasingly common because the \"discourse of well-being\" (9) embedded in CAM interactions (see also [24, 25]) resonates with how people understand their bodies and selves. Our data support the finding that CAM participants report greater awareness of the need for ongoing engagement in their own care, an increased sense of control or empowerment, and motivation to seek effective coping strategies.

Unlike conventional allopathic health care, complementary and alternative medicine is primarily paid for out of pocket, although some services are covered by most health insurance. Examining trends in demand for complementary and alternative medicine services in the United States reported in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey during 2002-08, we found that use of and spending on these services, previously on the rise, have largely plateaued. The higher proportion of out-of-pocket responsibility for payment for services may explain the lack of growth. Our findings suggest that any attempt to reduce national health care spending by eliminating coverage for complementary and alternative medicine would have little impact at best. Should some forms of complementary and alternative medicine-for example, chiropractic care for back pain-be proven more efficient than allopathic and specialty medicine, the inclusion of complementary and alternative medicine providers in new delivery systems such as accountable care organizations could help slow growth in national health care spending. | || | [ A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Efficacy,](../Cost_Effectiveness/Systematic_Review_and_Meta-analysis.shtml) Cost-effectiveness, and Safety of Selected Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Neck and Low-back Pain Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2012 (Nov 24); 2012: 953139 ~ FULL TEXT Reports of 147 randomized trials and 5 non-randomized studies were included.

The success of this program has been confirmed through a mixed-methods evaluative process. Programmatic success was achieved by the concerted efforts of all stakeholders, especially when led by an institutional champion. High satisfaction with the program was reported by administrators, practitioners and patients. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by a standardized outcomes protocol. Our findings demonstrate that the majority of patients with MSK complaints obtained clinically important improvements when able to access chiropractic care. This is especially important given the frequency of chronic, complex complaints with numerous co-morbidities in our study population and the significant barriers these people face in accessing traditional hospital services. Our team found that CAM therapies may be useful adjuncts in the management of MSK pain conditions, even in highly systematized settings of primary care hospital clinics and for clinically complex and marginalized populations. | || | [ Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among](ABSTRACTS/CAM_Use_Among_Military_Family.shtml) Military Family Medicine Patients in Hawaii Military Medicine 2010 (Jul); 175 (7): 534-538 ~ FULL TEXT Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a growing component of medicine within the U.S. civilian and military populations.

The results are quite fascinating: The top 6 CAM therapies for LBP, starting with the most-used, are chiropractic, massage, herbal therapy, acupuncture, yoga/tai chi/qi gong, and relaxation techniques. Chiropractic use (76% of respondents) was greater than all the other 5 therapies combined (see Figure 1) - [2] Chiropractic users scored their satisfaction (and benefits) the highest of all 6 approaches used. (see Table 2). This reconfirms earlier findings from the [Archives of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation 2005](../ChiroZine/ABSTRACTS/Chronic_Pain_in_Persons.shtml), which reported that SMT provided the greatest pain relief (7.33), scoring higher than nerve blocks (6.75), Opioid analgesics (6.37), muscle relaxants (5.78), Acupuncture (5.29), or NSAIDs (5.22). | || | ~ FULL TEXT [ Unanticipated Benefits of CAM Therapies for Back Pain:](ABSTRACTS/Unanticipated_Benefits_of_CAM.shtml) An Exploration of Patient Experiences J Alternative and Complementary Medicine 2010 (Feb); 16 (2): 157-163 Our analysis identified a range of positive outcomes that participants in CAM trials considered important but were not captured by standard quantitative outcome measures. Positive outcome themes included increased options and hope, increased ability to relax, positive changes in emotional states, increased body awareness, changes in thinking that increased the ability to cope with back pain, increased sense of well-being, improvement in physical conditions unrelated to back pain, increased energy, increased patient activation, and dramatic improvements in health or well-being. The first five of these themes were mentioned for all of the CAM treatments, while others tended to be more treatment specific. A small fraction of these effects were considered life transforming. Our findings suggest that standard measures used to assess the outcomes of CAM treatments fail to capture the full range of outcomes that are important to patients. In order to capture the full impact of CAM therapies, future trials should include a broader range of outcomes measures. | || | [ Intractable Migraine Headaches During Pregnancy](ABSTRACTS/Intractable_Migraine_Headaches_During_Pregnancy.shtml) Under Chiropractic Care Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice 2009 (Nov); 15 (4): 192-197 The absence of hormone fluctuations and/or the analgesic effects of increased beta-endorphins are thought to confer improvements in headache symptoms during pregnancy. However, for a number of pregnant patients, they continue to suffer or have worsening headache symptoms. The use of pharmacotherapy for palliative care is a concern for both the mother and the developing fetus and alternative/complementary care options are sought. We present a 24-year-old gravid female with chronic migraine headaches since age 12years. Previous unsuccessful care included osteopathy, physical therapy, massage and medication. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication with codeine provided minor and temporary relief. Chiropractic care involving spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) and adjunctive therapies resulted in symptom improvement and independence from medication. This document provides supporting evidence on the safety and possible effectiveness of chiropractic care for patients with headaches during pregnancy. | || | [ Costs of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)](../Graphics_Box_ALT-MED/Abstracts/ Costs_of_Complementary_and_Alternative.shtml) and Frequency of Visits to CAM Practitioners: United States, 2007 National Health Statistics Reports 2009 (Jul 30); (18): 1-14 In 2007, adults in the United States spent $33.9 billion out of pocket on visits to CAM practitioners and purchases of CAM products, classes, and materials. Nearly two-thirds of the total out-of-pocket costs that adults spent on CAM were for self-care purchases of CAM products, classes, and materials during the past 12 months ($22.0 billion), compared with about one-third spent on practitioner visits ($11.9 billion). Despite this emphasis on self-care therapies, 38.1 million adults made an estimated 354.2 million visits to practitioners of CAM. About three-quarters of both visits to CAM practitioners and total out-of-pocket costs spent on CAM practitioners were associated with manipulative and body-based therapies. A total of 44% of all out-of-pocket costs for CAM, or about $14.8 billion, was spent on the purchase of nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products. | || | [ Chiropractic Care Amongst People With Multiple Sclerosis:](ABSTRACTS/Chiropractic_Care_And_MS.shtml) A Survey of MS Therapy Centres in the UK Clinical Chiropractic 2009 (Mar); 12 (1): 23-27 ~ FULL TEXT Many of the musculoskeletal symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) can be managed with physical therapy.

Three single CAM techniques and three CAM treatment systems (integrating several techniques and/or covering a wide range of indications) were to be scored on their seriousness,with 4 answers possible: rather credible, rather questionable, undecided, don't know. Acupuncture was judged rather credible by 394 (76.4%), chiropractic by 373 (73.3%), homeopathy by 257 by 183 (35.5%),and autologous blood therapy by 144 (27.9%). The two latter techniques were chosen because of their widespread use in Germany in spite of explicit nonrecommendations given by the Federal Joint Committee, a national board of physicians and insurance providers. | || |[ ] [ Do Chiropractors Identify with Complementary and](ABSTRACTS/Do_Chiropractors_Identify.shtml) Alternative Medicine?

This article provides an up-to-date review of the efficacy of selected CAM modalities in the management of chronic pain. Findings are presented according to the classification system developed by the National Institutes of Health National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (formerly Office of Alternative Medicine) and are grouped into four domains: biologically based medicine, energy medicine, manipulative and body-based medicine, and mind-body medicine. | || | [ Use of Complementary and Alternative Therapies in](ABSTRACTS/Community_Dwelling_Older_Adults.shtml) Community-dwelling Older Adults J Altern Complement Med 2007 (Nov); 13 (9): 997-1006 Overall, 62.9% (N = 445) of the respondents reported use of one or more complementary and alternative medicine modalities with an average of three modalities (SD +/- 1.9, range 1-11). The top five CAM modalities used were nutritional supplements (44.3%), spiritual healing/prayer (29.7%), megavitamins (28.3%), herbal supplements (20.7%), and chiropractic (17.8%). Maintaining health and treating a health condition were the primary reasons for CAM use. The most common conditions treated were arthritis (44.4%) and chronic pain (23.3%). | || | [ Pattern and Frequency of Use of Complementary and Alternative](ABSTRACTS/Pattern_and_Frequency_of_Use_of_CAM.shtml) Medicine Among Patients with Epilepsy in the Midwestern United States Epilepsy & Behavior 2007 (Jun); 10 (4): 576-582 Thirty-nine percent (of those interviewed) reported using CAM; 23% reported using CAM specifically for their epilepsy. Prayer/spirituality was the most commonly used form of CAM (46%), followed by \"mega\" vitamins (23%), chiropractic care (24%), and stress management (16%). CAM use is common among midwestern patients with epilepsy, although the pattern of use may be slightly different than in other regions of the United States and elsewhere. | || | [ Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among US Navy](ABSTRACTS/CAM_Use_Among_US_Navy.shtml) and Marine Corps Personnel BMC Complement Altern Med. 2007 (May 16); 7: 16 Of 3,683 service members contacted, 1,446 (39.3%) returned a questionnaire and 1,305 gave complete demographic and survey data suitable for study. Among respondents, more than 37% reported using at least one CAM therapy during the past year. Herbal therapies were among the most commonly reported (15.9%). Most respondents (69.8%) reported their health as being very good or excellent. Modeling revealed that CAM use was most common among personnel who were women, white, and officers. Higher levels of recent physical pain and lower levels of satisfaction with conventional medical care were significantly associated with increased odds of reporting CAM use. | || | [ A Large-sample Survey of First- and Second-year Medical Student](ABSTRACTS/A_Large_sample_Survey.shtml) Attitudes Toward Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the Curriculum and in Practice Altern Ther Health Med 2007 (Jan); 13 (1): 30-35 Nearly all (91%) students agreed that \"CAM includes ideas and methods from which Western medicine could benefit\"; more than 83% agreed that \"knowledge about CAM is important to me as a student/future practicing health professional\"; and more than 73% felt that CAM should be included in the curriculum. Among all students, the most frequently indicated level of desired training was \"sufficient to advise patients about use,\" for 11 of the 15 modalities. The greatest level of training was wanted for acupuncture, chiropractic, herbal medicine, and nutritional supplements. The descriptions of CAM in future clinical practice that occurred most frequently were endorsement, referral, or provision of acupuncture, biofeedback, chiropractic, herbal medicine, massage, nutritional supplements, prayer, and meditation. | || | [ Chiropractic and CAM Utilization:](ABSTRACTS/Chiropractic_and_CAM_Utilization.shtml) A Descriptive Review Chiropractic & Osteopathy 2007 (Jan 22); 15: 2 ~ FULL TEXT Studies looking at chiropractic utilization demonstrate that the rates vary, but generally fall into a range from around 6% to 12% of the population, most of whom seek chiropractic care for low back pain and not for organic disease or visceral dysfunction. CAM and chiropractic often offer lower costs for comparable results compared to conventional medicine. | || | [ How Far Can Complementary and Alternative Medicine Go?](ABSTRACTS/How_Far_Can_CAM_Go.shtml) The Case of Chiropractic and Homeopathy Soc Sci Med. 2006 (Nov); 63 (10): 2617-2627 The data revealed four main strategies: (1) improving the quality of educational programs, (2) elevating standards of practice, (3) developing more peer reviewed research, and (4) increasing group cohesion. Although both groups identified similar strategies, the chiropractors were bolstered by more resources as well as state sanctioned regulation. The efforts of the homeopaths were constrained by scarce resources and the absence of self-regulation. In both cases the lack of strong structural support from government and the established health professions played an important role in limiting what was possible. In the future, it may be to the state's advantage to modify the overall shape of health care to include alternative paradigms of healing along with conventional medical care. | || | [ Use of Selected Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)](ABSTRACTS/Use_of_Selected_CAM_Treatments.shtml) Treatments in Veterans with Cancer or Chronic Pain: A Cross-sectional Survey BMC Complement Altern Med 2006 (Oct 6); 6: 34 ~ FULL TEXT One of the largest groups to utilize alternative therapies is veterans. A recent mail survey evaluated selected alternative medicine use among 264 veterans. The survey included questions on demographics, health beliefs, medical problems and use of six common alternative therapies (chiropractic, herbs, dietary supplements, massage therapy, acupuncture and homeopathy). Seventy-two patients (27.3%) reported alternative therapy use within the past 12 months. COLOR=\"#8B0000\">One-fourth of patients (26%) used chiropractic care to alleviate their pain. Back pain was the most frequently reported medical problem (62.3%). While most veterans (76.9%) had used prescription pills to treat their medical problems, 67% of veterans who had not used alternative therapies reported that they would use it if offered by the Veterans Administration (VA). | || | [ U.S. and Canadian Pharmacists' Attitudes, Knowledge, and](ABSTRACTS/US_and_Canadian_Pharmacists.shtml) Professional Practice Behaviors Toward Dietary Supplements: A Systematic Review BMC Complement Altern Med 2006 (Sep 19); 6 (1): 31 ~ FULL TEXT There is strong agreement among pharmacists for the need to have additional training on Dietary Supplements (DS), increased regulation of DS, and quality information on DS. In addition, survey data indicate that pharmacists do not perceive their knowledge of DS to be adequate and that pharmacists do not routinely document, monitor, or inquire about patients' use of DS. Despite this, a large proportion of pharmacists reported receiving questions about DS from patients and other health care practitioners. | || | [ Insurance Coverage and Subsequent Utilization of](ABSTRACTS/Insurance_Coverage_and_Subsequent_Utilization.shtml) Complementary and Alternative Medicine Providers Am J Manag Care 2006 (Jul); 12 (7): 397-404 Among more than 600,000 enrollees, 13.7% made CAM claims. This included 1.3% of enrollees with claims for acupuncture, 1.6% for naturopathy, 2.4% for massage, and 10.9% for chiropractic. Patients enrolled in preferred provider organizations and point-of-service products were notably more likely to use CAM than those with health maintenance organization coverage. The use of CAM was greater among women and among persons 31 to 50 years of age. The use of chiropractic was more frequent in less populous counties. The CAM provider visits usually focused on musculoskeletal complaints except for naturopathic physicians, who treated a broader array of problems. The median per-visit expenditures were $39.00 for CAM care and $74.40 for conventional outpatient care. The number of people using CAM insurance benefits was substantial; the effect on insurance expenditures was modest. | || | [ The Role of Evidence in Alternative Medicine:](ABSTRACTS/The_Role_of_Evidence.shtml) ~ FULL TEXT Contrasting Biomedical and Anthropological Approaches Soc Sci Med. 2006 (Jun); 62 (11): 2646-2657 In this paper, the supposed objectivity of scientific, biomedical forms of evidence is questioned through an illumination of the multiple rhetorics embedded in the evidence-based medicine phenomenon, both within biomedicine itself and in calls for its use to evaluate alternative therapeutic systems. Anthropological notions of evidence are constructed very differently from those of biomedical science, and offer a closer resonance with the philosophy of alternative medicine. Examples are given of the kinds of evidence produced by anthropologists researching alternative medicine. | || |[ Complementary Healthcare:](../Graphics_Box_ALT-MED/FULL/Complementary_Healthcare_A_Guide_for_Patients.pdf) (PDF) A Guide for Patients Prince of Wales's Foundation for Integrated Health ~ 2005 This report, prepared by the The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health advises British citizens about the regulated professions of chiropractic and osteopathy, the soon-to-be regulated field of acupuncture, and 12 other unregulated techniques, ranging from Aromatherapy to Yoga. | || | [ An Analysis of Sickness Absence in Chronically Ill Patients](ABSTRACTS/An_Analysis_of_Sickness_Absence.shtml) Receiving Complementary and Alternative Medicine: A Longterm Prospective Intermittent Study BMC Public Health 2006 (Feb 12); 6 (1): 28 Results of this longterm observational study show a reduction of sick leave in chronically ill patients after a complex multimodal CAM intervention. However, as this is an uncontrolled observational study efficacy of any specific CAM treatment can not be proven. The results might indicate an general effectiveness of CAM in primary care, worthwhile further investigations.

For the good news, in this network, of the 42 PCP providers, only 3 are not linked through referrals to at least one CAM provider in the period studied. But the bad news, however, is that for most of the PCPs, the number of referrals is quite low. Any CAM provider relying solely on the referrals to generate a patient flow would not do very well in this network. This finding might reflect either the nature of the patient population, one which does not necessitate referral, or may reflect reluctance or inexperience on the part of the PCPs with the type of CAM therapy offered by DOMs or DCs. | || | [ Consumer Reports' Survey of 34,000 Readers Finds](ABSTRACTS/Consumer_Reports_Survey.shtml) Hands-on Treatments Most Successful A press release from Consumer Reports (July 2005) Readers gave the highest marks to hands-on treatments, which worked better than conventional treatments for conditions such as back pain and arthritis.

Acad Med 2005 (Mar); 80 (3): 286-290 Pluralism, which has been relatively ignored, calls for cooperation between the different medical systems rather than their integration. As an ethical model, pluralism realizes that physicians must be prepared to disagree with patient choices to pursue alternative therapies, and urge patients not to forgo medically indicated treatment. Pluralism encourages cooperation, research, and open communication and respect between practitioners despite the possible existence of honest disagreement, and preserves the integrity of each of the treatment systems involved. | || | [ Policies Pertaining to Complementary and Alternative Medical](ABSTRACTS/Policies_Pertaining_to_Complementary.shtml) Therapies in a Random Sample of 39 Academic Health Centers Altern Ther Health Med 2005 (Jan); 11 (1): 36-40 This research documents policies in 39 randomly selected academic medical centers integrating complementary and alternative medical (CAM) services into conventional care. Twenty-three offered CAM services-most commonly, acupuncture, massage, dietary supplements, mind-body therapies, and music therapy.

It identifies the processes of exclusion and marginalization as the main mechanisms by which symbolic boundaries are marked daily in the professional field. These processes enable the biomedical profession to contain its competitors and at the same time to avoid overt confrontations and mitigate potential tensions between the two medical systems. | || | [ Complementary and Alternative Medical Therapies for](../Non-pharmacologic_Therapy/Complementary_and_Alternative_Medical_Therapies.shtml) Chronic Low Back Pain: What Treatments Are Patients Willing To Try?

The U.S. public's use of CAM increased substantially during the 1990s (1-11). This high rate of use translates into large out-of-pocket expenditures on CAM. It has been estimated that the U.S. public spent between $36 billion and $47 billion on CAM therapies in 1997 (5). Of this amount, between $12.2 billion and $19.6 billion was paid out-of-pocket for the services of professional CAM health care providers such as chiropractors, acupuncturists, and massage therapists. These fees are more than the U.S. public paid out-of pocket for all hospitalizations in 1997 and about half that paid for all out-of pocket physician services (12). Explanations for this growth in CAM use have been proposed, including marketing forces, availability of information on the Internet, the desire of patients to be actively involved with medical decision making, and dissatisfaction with conventional (western) medicine (13).

Yet many conventional healthcare professionals refuse to take CAM seriously \u2014 one often-voiced argument is \"there is no research in CAM\" Certainly, for some modalities there is no compelling evidence base, and some of the research into CAM has methodological flaws and biases.

In my personal experience, the main obstacle to research of complementary medicine precepts has been the censorship of dissenting data from orthodox medical literature. The most blatant example of this is the studied neglect of the \"tunnel vision information\": the knowledge that vision improves in appropriately ill patients when the spine is manipulated. | || |[ ] [ Alternative Medicine and Leo Galland, M.D.](../alt_med_abstracts/FULL/Alternative_Medicine_Doctor.shtml) Two decades ago Leo Galland, M.D., an honors graduate of Harvard University Medical School, left academic medicine to establish a private practice in a small Connecticut town. \"As soon as I stopped working with critically ill patients in the intensive care unit and started seeing people who were chronically ill, it became apparent that what worked for emergency situations was not very useful for restoring health.

There are several views among DCs on which path to follow at the crossroads. Some would have us be musculoskeletal or back specialists, dealing exclusively with pain management; others would have us be subluxation specialists, limiting our concern to the articulations of the spine - an extreme of reductionism, though perhaps a viable one for many; and yet others would like to see us as primary care providers, differing from medical physicians in our focus on health, rather than disease, and on assisting the body through noninvasive means to restore balance and achieve optimal function. | || |[ ] [ Willingness of Emergency Department Patients with](ABSTRACTS/Willingness_of_Emergency_Department_Patients.shtml) Musculoskeletal Complaints to Participate in Complementary and Alternative Medicine Research CJEM 2002 (Nov); 4 (6): 401-407 Of 107 eligible patients, 93 participated (87%).

Seventy-six percent of patients had utilized CAM previously during their lives, and 13% were currently using CAM for their presenting problem. The majority of patients stated an informed hypothetical willingness to enroll in a CAM study of the following therapies: traditional Chinese medicine 74%; chiropractic 70%; and other CAM therapies 92%. Of patients asked, 99% stated they would comply with 4 to 6 weeks of outpatient follow-up, and 70% stated they would participate in a placebo-controlled study. | || |[ ] [ Chiropractic: A Profession at the Crossroads](../ChiroZine/ABSTRACTS/Chiropractic_Profession_at_Crossroads.shtml) of Mainstream and Alternative Medicine Annals of Internal Medicine 2002 (Feb 5); 136 (3) Feb 5: 216-227 ~ FULL TEXT Chiropractic is a large and well-established health care profession in the United States.

Dissatisfaction with aspects of conventional care, particularly its reliance on prescription medications, was an important component in their motivation to use CAM. Results also suggest that the conventional medical system's lack of holism (inadequate information regarding diet, nutrition and exercise, and ignorance of social and spiritual dimensions) is also an important motivation for turning to CAM in this particular population. | || |[ ] [ Use of Alternative Therapies by Older Adults with Osteoarthritis](ABSTRACTS/Use_of_Alternative_Therapies_by_Older_Adults.shtml) Arthritis Rheum 2001 (Jun); 45 (3): 222-227 More than 47% of participants reported using at least one type of alternative care during the 20-week intervention period. Among alternative care consumers, the most commonly used treatments were massage therapy (57%), chiropractic services (20.7%), and nonprescribed alternative medications (17.2%). Four percent of subjects reported using only alternative care during the study period. | || |[ ] [ Integrated Health Care:](../Graphics_Box_NUTRITION/FULL/Integrated_Health_Care.shtml) Applying Best Practices From Two Medical Models Nutrition Science News (May 2001) Allopathic medical practitioners have been ill-prepared to deal with the rapid proliferation of alternative medical therapies and natural supplements, many of which are being used by their patients in conjunction with traditional treatments. While practitioners are justifiably hesitant to begin an integrated practice, there are valid reasons for becoming more knowledgeable about alternative approaches to health care, and more willing to start adding select remedies to their practices. | || |[ ] [ Legal Status of Traditional Medicine and](../Graphics_Box_ALT-MED/FULL/Legal_Status_of_Traditional_Medicine_and_CAM.pdf) Complementary/Alternative Medicine: A Worldwide Review World Health Organization 2001 (199 pages) National policies are the basis for defining the role of traditional and complementary/alternative medicine in national health care programmes, ensuring that the necessary regulatory and legal mechanisms are created for promoting and maintaining good practice; assuring authenticity, safety and efficacy of traditional and complementary/alternative therapies; and providing equitable access to health care resources and information about those resources. | || |[ ] [ Presenting Chiropractic to Medical Students](ABSTRACTS/ Manipulative Physiol Ther 2000 (May); 23 (4): 290-290 For the past 3 years I have lectured to 4th-year students at Medical College of Virginia as part of an elective course on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Because most US medical schools now offer at least one course in CAM [1, 2] and because chiropractic is generally considered an important part of this growing field, opportunities for chiropractors to lecture at medical schools are likely to increase in the coming years. The purpose of this article is to initiate a discussion about what constitutes appropriate content for such medical school lectures. As a result, chiropractors currently offering such lectures may be able to improve their presentations; furthermore, chiropractors to whom such speaking opportunities are offered in the future will not have to prepare notes without background assistance. Please see the Appendix for an outline of my presentation; what follows are my observations about the students, a rationale for my choice of topics, and commentary about my experiences. | || |[ Visit Our Older Alt-Med Articles](Older_Articles.shtml) [ ] "}
