Primary Course Concepts This course will bring students into their own unique healing experience while fostering the formation of the healer that exists in each of us.

Your instructor will guide you through this experience using the following: This teacher training will enlighten you along your pathway to discover how you can help others find freedom from suffering through healing with the goal of being. As you move through the course, you will gain an understanding of what you require for your own unique self-healing. By working in unison and harmony, the teacher that is within you emerges. Our philosophy is based on the elements of self-health, life, and lifestyle. We draw from the natures of self-awareness and mindfulness, self-worth, healing, love, environment, humanity, help and the unity that yoga as a discipline allows in body and mind within self and life itself. Historical principles within current levels of consciousness are explored to bridge the gap between east and west, past and present, and rather the focus is aligned with now. This is about invoking a sense of self and life practice that is relevant to you and your surroundings, whilst being compassionate and sensitized to others and their surroundings. Our foundation modules are philosophy enable a culture to be born to enable the individual to become the best version of themselves, what they are completely and what they felt, believed and envisioned before the world told them what they should do. Our belief is you cannot solely teach an ancient practice authentically, but you can teach your essence of what you value to be healing and a way to balance and unify, to invoke soul in self and life through movement and moving practices mentally, physically, emotionally and energetically, both inwardly and outwardly. Therefore, our philosophical teachings underlying purpose is to encourage an individual to find home in self and life itself, whilst healing preventing further imbalances mentally, physically, emotionally and energetically to allow for the best version of themselves that is wealthy in health in self and life itself, in turn enhancing a healthier humanity and earth. Abode Yoga is a healing modality in itself, and both our graduating Abode Yoga Teachers and Natural Healing practitioners will naturally be in a relationship together in supporting the wholeness and well-being of humanity and our planet. A hands-on, heart-to-heart Natural Healing & Yoga Training delivered in a way that healing was shared between our ancestors. This training focuses on feeling into your unique healing process, birthing the healer that you naturally are through the pathways of Reiki, Yoga, Ayurveda, and Cosmic Bodywork. It is a union in relationship with harmony that invites us into our self's moving psychology. Teachers emerge through this process, through an understanding gained from within. This understanding happens through the spiritual self-healing that is unique for all of us. Therefore we teach \"we need not an eternal teacher, but rather a supportive mirror to remember and invite this understanding forth. This happens through the body language of wisdom (light), guided by intuition (seeing clearly). Abode Yoga is a universal philosophy of BEING, rather than a system of worship, its Love. If you are after space to feel home, free your being, and delight in holding space for others to remember, see you in the heart space we have opened together. You will be immersed in the intimate healing aspects of yoga mentally, physically, emotionally, energetically and spiritually through the eight limbs of yoga from the eight-limbed healthcare system of the Ayurveda approach. This course allows you to intimately move through the ancient healing arts of Reiki, Cosmic Bodywork, and Spiritual Law. Victoria offers this certification through the hands-on Reiki Healing that you will be attuned to be able to offer yourself healing as well as offer healing treatments and sessions as a practitioner. Reiki is communicating energy between our body systems and our chakra system; it is an energy practice of wholeness, therefore strengthens anyone's practice, sharing, and or teaching of yoga (union). Ayurveda looks at the wholeness of the individual and its lifestyle. Reiki energetically is whole, allowing what isn't whole to return or what is blocking living wholeness to be released. Randall also works very closely with harmonizing wholeness through hormonal listening to allow energetic connection and clearing of un-serving patterns in action. She feels it is the subtle bodies is how we physically can see our deeper intimacy as a human being, understand our wholeness in nature and know when it is or is not in a rhythmic flow. This experience is playful, expressive, and wise. When we say \"heal or healing\", we do not mean the healing of a part. Instead, we are focused on healing the relationship between the components. This requires creativity, art, and communication. This training is lead through the heart, centered in intuition, and is felt with our body. This is why you will also experience this training through various disciplines. The reason why we choose to offer this natural healing practitioner certification aspect as a part of our Abode Yoga Teacher is because Yoga and Reiki go hand in hand in the process of Abode Yoga as a spiritual self-practice.
