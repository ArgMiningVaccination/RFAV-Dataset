INTRODUCTION The veterinary Homeopathy has continued to develop despite the apparentdifficulty in adapting questioning techniques for animals.\u00b7 The efficacies, which have alreadybeen observed with Homeopathic medicines in human being often find comparable applications in animals. The study has been made to observe the efficacy of veterinary homoeopathy to the treatment of domestic animals. INTRODUCTION Alternative veterinary medicine can be defined as the utilization of alternative therapies in the treatment of diseased animals. Homeopathy is believed to be the alternative therapy most commonly applied in dairy herds. Alternative therapies are commonly regarded as holistic. The regulation restricts the use of homeopathy or other alternative therapies to situations in which the treatment is effective for the current animal species and condition. This has created concerns that such treatments are used to the exclusion of conventional treatments, and that this may influence animal welfare adversely (Ekesbo, 2000, Hammarberg 2001 ).Homeopathic medicines were developed based on observations of healthy subjects made by physicians. However, they also found application in veterinary medicine: as early as 1833, a German practitioner, Guillaume Lux, was already treating a certain number of diseases in horses and cattle using four Homeopathic medicines: Aconitum napellus, Camphora, Nux vomica and Opium. possesses qualities of \"rebalancing the terrain\"; tested . favorably by many livestock farmers on family and industrial farms that enable Homeopathyto be used preventively, in order to improve animal production; Homeopathy allows theanimal to be treated without residues, which makes it a non-toxic treatment not only for the treated animal but also for the consumer and the environment: finally, treatment costs are generally low. therapies in the treatment of diseased animals.

These advantages have led certain branches of high-quality animal production (brand- name production where the specifications are strictly regulated) to share in the financing for research in veterinary Homeopathy. Specific to livestock, this series of arguments supplement the life experience of Homeopathic veterinarians. In practice, these veterinarians see, for example, that faced with a disconcerting clinical picture, Homeopathy renews the therapeutic strategy. Homoeopathy is a safe, effective and powerful form of medicinal treatment which works on the principle SIMILIA SIMILIBUS CURENTUR i.e. let like be cure by like. This principle was discovered and developed by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann in the eighteenth centuries. Homoeopathy means treatment of the disease using a substance which has the power to produce similar symptoms. Here medicines are proved on healthy human beings. Homoeopathic medicines works effectively in animals as it works on human being. In 1813, Leipsic, Dr. Hahnemann lectured on the use of his medicinal system on animals .He stress out that principle of homoeopathic treatment on animals should be the same as in human. The publication is a hitherto unknown manuscript has made possible given by the university of Leipsic with a special permission. This script prepared for a lecture \"THE HOMOEOPATHIC SCIENCE OF HEALING DOMESTIC ANIMALS\" In MATERIA MEDICA PURA Dr. Hahnemann points out the advantage of proving carried out on animals. Here all types of animals respond from pets to farm animals, from horses to wild animals, from birds to fish. Organic farmers rely upon the homoeopathy which does not rise research in veterinary Homeopathy.

Organic farmers rely upon the homoeopathy which does not rise drug residue in meat, milk or egg. Problems arise during prescription..... 1. Animals cannot brief the doctors about their pain & illness, as detailed history of the patient is needed for a perfect homoeopathic prescription. 2. Mentals symptoms are difficult to collect from animals which create an obstacle. 3. Dosage may differ according to specific need of animals. 4. Actions of drugs may differ in animals as proving are done on healthy h man beings. 5. Prescription is usually based on local affection. Some of the remedies are mention in homoeopathic books useful in animals with their indications: \u00b7 Mag Phos: in colic of horses and cows when Colocynth fails to relieve. \u00b7 Anthracinum: in epidemic spleen disease in cattle horse and sheep. Aesculus.hip - in chest complains of horses. Dr. Curie in cyclopedia of drug pathogenesy proved the homoepathacity of Drosera in TB in its widest and most importance aspects, that he showed that Drosera breaks down the resistance to tubercle every time in animals suppose to be absolutely immune to that disease and he also proved the Drosera is able to raise the resistance 0 tubercle by using in early pthisis. THRAEUTICS: Some of the common disease affecting the animals with their indications: Colic: \u00a7 Aconite-- when mouth is dry and ear are cold/hot. \u00a7 Nux vom. - Due to indigestion with constipation animal walks around and then rise down suddenly with blotted appearance in ano or both flanks. \u00a7 Ars.

Examples of Cases by Stalwarts: 1. A Case of Gastro-enteritis with haemorrhage- A dog was brought having vomiting with blood & trembling when the physician saw he got the impression that he was dying. The head was hanging down, the legs old barely support him and the back was curved. The eyes was dull and expression less, on examination pulse 140/min, temp.30c, also rumbling audible in the intestine. Treatment-Ars alb 200, 1 dose every 10 min for 1 hr. After 2 hr the animal was some- what better there was no more vomiting, the expression of eyes was improved. the next morning the morning, the dog went on his usual walk. (The Journal of British homoeopathy Association, vol-41, no-4.) 2. A case of Fever after getting we Dog was suddenly restless , the abdomen rumbles as if diarrhoea were coming on, the animal feels warm to touch, on examination temp-40c, on previous day it had been completely drenched, on auscultation sounds in bronchi. Treatment-Rhus tox 200 1 dose was given, the next day everything was well again.(The Journal British Homoeopathy Association,vol-41,no-4 . Horse that had a cough for 9 month, cough was dry when in the stable. Treatment-8doses of Bryonia in a fortnight cured the cough & the horse has been well ever since. (John Rush-The Handbook to Veterinary Homoeopathy) Conclusions: The main aim of homoeopathic approach is to build up the health of animals & increase the resistance towards the diseases. From the above study it is much clear that homoeopathic system of medicine is not only effective but safest method off treatment. The farmers' personal experiences and beliefs are important in the choice of treatment. Independent of efficacy, the homeopathic remedies help the farmers fulfill their aim to reduce the use of antibacterial drugs. However, Preventive measures should be the main focus in future research on Veterinary Homeopathic Treatment. References: 1.
