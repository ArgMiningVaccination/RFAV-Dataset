Are you in need of relaxation or relief from muscle tension, stress, or pain? Massage Near Me - at BoPo \"The issues are in our tissues\" - so the saying goes. Physical pain, emotional pain, and mental pain are all stored in our bodies. Massage therapy includes the manual manipulation of soft body tissue and uses a healing human touch to help reduce this pain, releasing stored tension, anxiety, and stress. Used as a tool to regulate your mood, massage stimulates a range of hormones: dopamine - \"the happy - - \"the stress hormone,\" and adrenaline - \"the fight or flight hormone. As such, it is a practice that can help restore balance, health, and well-being to your body and mind.

Swedish Massage [Swedish massage](https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-is-a-swedish-massage#:~:text=The%20Swedish%20massage%20is%20one,protect%20the%20skin%20from%20friction.) is the most common form of therapeutic massage, a very relaxing type of bodywork. It combines oils or lotion with an array of strokes such as rolling, kneading, and percussion to help improve circulation, release tight muscles, and relieve pain. Our massage therapist uses long gliding strokes to relax your entire body. Deep Tissue Massage A deep tissue massage uses many of the same techniques as a Swedish massage, but our massage therapist applies more pressure, making it feel stronger and go deeper. It is often used to help heal specific injuries, restore range of motion, or get into an area that feels so tight that it's practically numb. Reflexology Massage Reflexology focuses on applying pressure to the specific nerve zones in your feet. Unlike other foot massages that relieve tension in the feet themselves, reflexology is a far more in-depth science that aims to harmonize your entire body. According to reflexology, every part of the human body is mapped into your feet. Your reflexologist will work on specific points on the feet, which correlate to each organ, as a means to promote healing in the corresponding organ. It has been found to be very effective for conditions, such as allergies, depression, and headaches. Manual Lymphatic Drainage MLD is a treatment for lymphedema that promotes the movement of lymphatic fluid out of the swollen limb(s), boosts the immune system, and deeply relaxes the body and mind. It is recommended to filter out cellular debris after injury, surgery, or whenever there is a congestion of lymph. MLD increases blood flow in deep and superficial veins and is effective for swelling, pain, hormonal imbalances, some allergies, and digestive issues among others. Regular MLD is also suggested for anyone wanting to boost the immune system, regardless of swelling. Prenatal Massage (+ pregnancy massage including the first trimester) A prenatal massage is similar to a full body massage, but our massage therapist makes modifications to ensure the comfort and safety of both mother and baby. For example, the mother-to-be lies on her side while the abdomen is not massaged. The aim of pregnancy massage is relaxation and the soothing of the various aches and pains that accompany many pregnancies. Acupressure Pressure is applied on specific meridian points along the body to help ease aches, pains, tension, and symptoms of illness. Acupressure helps strengthen organs, as well as releases blocked energy and physical resistance to healing. It is deeply relaxing and revitalizing.

NJ Massage FAQ Massage therapy can be supportive for those who may suffer from anxiety or depression, as well as those who may experience short-term discomfort or chronic pain. Studies have shown that people who receive regular massages experience less anxiety than those who do not and that massage therapy can help people cope with chronic conditions such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, and migraines.
