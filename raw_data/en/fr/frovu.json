Here, we have all of the traditional wedding anniversary gifts by year from your 1st wedding anniversary all the way up to your 90th. We've also included the modern alternatives for the milestones which have them, giving you plenty of options on what to gift your love. 1st Wedding Anniversary Gifts - 10th Wedding Anniversary Gifts Whether it's your first anniversary or your tenth, it never stops being special. Here we go through the modern and traditional anniversary gifts for the first ten years of a relationship or marriage. 1st Wedding Anniversary - Paper Traditional 1st anniversary gift: Whoever devised the meanings of anniversaries probably figured newlyweds would be pretty broke after paying for the wedding - so the [1st wedding anniversary](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/organising-and-planning/first-wedding-anniversary-gift-ideas/) is nicely affordable. Paper also represents your new marriage as like a blank sheet ready to be coloured in! Our favourite twist is to give tickets to an experience - print them out and it totally counts as a paper gift. [Virgin Experience Days](https://www.virginexperiencedays.co.uk/1-year-anniversary) offer everything from a trip to London landmarks like the Shard to a romantic break away for two. We love the [food and drink experiences](https://www.virginexperiencedays.co.uk/food-and-drink) - there are so many different cuisines, classes and experiences to choose from, you could spend your entire first year of marriage trying them all out. Modern 1st anniversary gift: For a modern spin, couples can gift each other clocks. This is said to represent their eternal love for one another - how cute?! In terms of colours, gold represents the standard first anniversary colour, while pansies and orange blossoms are the known flowers. You could combine the traditional colours and flowers with the modern gift by opting for a gold watch with floral details for a first anniversary gift that truly covers all bases. 2nd Wedding Anniversary - Cotton Traditional 2nd anniversary gift: For those who want to stick to tradition, cotton is the [2nd wedding anniversary gift](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/fun/second-wedding-anniversary-gift-ideas_878.htm) for this milestone. Cotton is made from lots of thread woven together and the longer you are married the more your life becomes intertwined. It represents how marriage brings couples closer together and the material is both strong and flexible, symbolising adaptability and a strengthening relationship. There are plenty of sweet 2nd anniversary gifts to choose from, such as [personalised pillowcases](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/kokoblossom/product/personalised-couple-wedding-pillowcases) or co-ordinating robes (check out [The White Company](http://www.thewhitecompany.com/Cotton-Classic-Robe/p/CLCBR?swatch=Pearl+Grey)), which you can snuggle down in. If your partner loves to give or receive flowers, then these cute cotton blooms from [Little Foundry](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/littlefoundry/product/handmade-fabric-flowers) will be their favourite gift and they'll last a lifetime. You can also order a sweet personalised oak charm to go with them. Modern 2nd anniversary gift: The modern alternative to cotton is china, and the second year of marriage is represented by the colour red and the lily of the valley blooms. These can absolutely be incorporated together to gift the perfect present after two years of marriage. Think pretty china sets, a china vase for a bouquet of lily's or a fancy dinnerware set. 3rd Wedding Anniversary - Leather Traditional 3rd anniversary gift: The traditional [3rd anniversary gift](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/fun/third-wedding-anniversary-gift-ideas/) is leather, said to represent the durability of a marriage or relationship. Leather is durable, strong and has a sense of resiliency - three things that a marriage should also have. Traditionally, it has been used as a material to protect things, like couples protect one another. As your marriage matures your relationship becomes much stronger, so giving your partner a leather gift for 3rd wedding anniversaries is a perfect way to represent this. If you're looking for a timeless leather anniversary gift, then a classic handbag, purse or wallet from Mulberry is perfect. The [Bayswater handbag](https://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/cat/mulberry-bayswater-leather-tote-bag_R00134791/?previewAttribute=BLACK-OAK) is a staple from Mulberry, but a purse, wallet or leather iPhone case are also brilliant. Ideal leather anniversary gifts also include a belt or hip flask - [Aspinal of London](https://www.aspinaloflondon.com/products/8-card-billfold-wallet-in-smooth-black-and-cobalt-suede) have lots of gorgeous leather gifts and accessories that can be monogrammed to make them even more personal. Modern 3rd anniversary gift: The modern 3rd anniversary gift is crystal or glass, which is said to represent the multiple facets that every relationship has. In contrast to leather, it pays homage to the fragility of a relationship, and the fact that it takes great care in order to maintain it. But glass and crystal withstand time, making it a great gift to mirror your relationship. Three years together is also represented by bright fuschia flowers, and pearls which also make for lovely anniversary gifts. 4th Wedding Anniversary - Fruit or Flowers Traditional 4th anniversary gift: As your marriage blossoms and your partnership ripens following four years of marriage, it makes sense to give an [4th anniversary gift](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/fun/fourth-wedding-anniversary-gifts_1153.htm) of fruit or flowers (or both, if you're feeling generous!). This has to be one of the most romantic wedding anniversary years when it comes to the gifts. If you're opting for flowers over fruit, roses traditionally represent how much your love has blossomed so take your present-giving to the next level by [naming a rose](https://www.gettingpersonal.co.uk/gifts/name-a-rose-gift.htm) after your love. You choose the name, it's officially registered, and then you receive a pack of seeds to grow your own roses. [Bloom and Wild ](https://www.bloomandwild.com/)offer a huge range of gorgeous bouquets or flower gift subscriptions for 4th wedding anniversaries if your fingers aren't quite so green. Modern 4th anniversary gift: Flowers not their thing? The modern alternative for 4th wedding anniversary gifts is appliances. Is there anyone whose morning wouldn't be improved with a brand new [coffee machine](https://www.lakeland.co.uk/31936/lavazza-jolie-coffee-machine-with-milk-frother-black-18000216)? The idea behind this is to simplify home life and leave you with more time to spend together, building on your connection. In terms of colours and stones, it's blues and greens that are synonymous with four years together. If gemstones are the way to your love's heart, blue topaz is the 'feeling stone' and perfectly fits this period in your relationship. 5th Wedding Anniversary - Wood Traditional 5th anniversary gift: The idea of using wood to celebrate your [5th wedding anniversary](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/fun/fifth-anniversary-gift-ideas_1047.htm) comes from the fact that trees were seen to be strong and symbolised wisdom. Your marriage is solid and you have deep roots that are entwined. How wise you both are by the time you celebrate this wedding anniversary! A [romantic sign](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/designbyeleven/product/5th-anniversary-memories-print) to hang in your home will be a cute gift for your other half or, even better, is this [miniature wooden signpost](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/noordinarygiftcompany/product/our-five-year-journey-3d-signpost-framed-print) marking all the major moments in your journey together. From your first date to when you bought a house, it's a great way to tell the story of the first five years of your marriage. If you're feeling sentimental about your wedding day, why not celebrate with a bottle of the wine you had on your big day presented in a [personalised oak box](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/sophiavictoriajoy/product/personalised-couples-oak-bottle-box)? Or choose a [wooden photo frame](http://www.thewhitecompany.com/uk/Home/Home-Accessories/c/photo-frames) to give your wedding pictures a new lease of life. Modern 5th anniversary gift: The modern anniversary gift for five years is silverware, which may seem a bit old fashioned, but it's actually got a really sweet reason behind it. The idea is that you buy new silverware to represent all of the meals you've shared over the five years you've been together. Sapphire is the gemstone that represents 5th anniversaries, with pink and blue being the traditional colours. Sapphires symbolise sincerity and being faithful, two things well worth celebrating as a couple. For flowers, it's daisies, which are the perfect bloom if your anniversary falls in spring. 6th Wedding Anniversary - Sugar Traditional 6th anniversary gift: Traditionally, the [sixth anniversary gift](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/fun/6th-wedding-anniversary/) is sugar - we can definitely get on board with this. Life is thought to be getting sweeter by the time you reach your sixth wedding anniversary, so you and your partner can indulge in some sugary treats - this has to be one of the best wedding anniversary years, right? [Hotel Chocolat](http://www.hotelchocolat.com/uk/shop/gift-ideas/shop-by-occasion/best-chocolate/) have some delicious and seriously stylish gift ideas, while [Virgin Experience Days](https://www.virginexperiencedays.co.uk/anniversary-gifts) have amazing [afternoon tea](https://www.virginexperiencedays.co.uk/afternoon-tea) deals across the country. Modern 6th anniversary gift: The modern alternative to sugar is iron, so why not choose something romantic like this [iron-influenced wall art](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6091&awinaffid=565019&clickref=hitched-the-complete-wedding-anniversary-guide&platform=dl&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fuk%2Flisting%2F558715160%2Firon-anniversary-custom-music-sheet-with) featuring the sheet music from your first dance? A timeless [cast iron casserole dish](https://www.houseoffraser.co.uk/brand/pyrex/pyrex-oval-casserole-dish-944015#colcode=94401508) is brilliant gift idea for someone who loves cooking - it will last you for decades and makes a lovely sixth anniversary gift. The amethyst stone is the gem that symbolises six years of marriage. It's known to have protective properties and is said to act as a shield for negative energy - we don't need any of that in our relationships, right? 7th Wedding Anniversary - Copper & Wool [7th anniversary gift](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/fun/seven-year-wedding-anniversary-gift-guide/)and have been chosen for their ability to conduct heat. After seven years together, your marriage is warm and comforting, much like an evening cup of hot chocolate in bed from this [personalised copper mug from Not On The High Street](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/beckybroomeltd/product/personalised-geometric-copper-mug?referredBy=search). Or for something wool, [The White Company](http://www.thewhitecompany.com/uk/Luxury-Wool-Cashmere-Throw/p/luxury-wool-cashmere-throw?swatch=Grey) have some gorgeous cashmere throws that are perfect for snuggling under while you watch a film. Modern 7th anniversary gift: If you'd rather go for the modern alternative for a 7th wedding anniversary gift, it's a desk set...yes, really! Suited best to those who are now part of the working-from-home crew, these gifts are symbolic of the pride in the work you've done together as a married couple. Browse the amazing selection at [Paperchase](https://www.paperchase.com/en_gb/) for the perfect, modern 7th wedding anniversary gift or a [Wayfair desk](https://www.wayfair.co.uk/furniture/sb0/desks-c1774332.html) to work from. When choosing colours to celebrate with, yellow is the shade of choice for seven years together, along with healing onyx stones which are said to help with eliminating stress and aid sleeping - we all know how easily grouchy arguments happen when we haven't gotten a good night's sleep, don't we? 8th Wedding Anniversary - Bronze Traditional 8th anniversary gift: Bronze is the chosen [8th anniversary gift](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/fun/8th-wedding-anniversary/) as it's very strong - in fact, it's a mixture of two metals (copper and tin) that are stronger together than separately. Traditionally, it was said to hold healing powers and represents good health and the sustenance that you give each other as a couple. Choose a keepsake that will take pride of place on a shelf forever, like this [miniature bronze stag statue](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/gingerrose/product/miniature-bronze-stag-statue) - they even do a gorgeous [spaniel one](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/gingerrose/product/miniature-solid-bronze-spaniel-sculpture) for dog-loving couples. Alternatively, you could gift these [gorgeous copper initial cufflinks](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/graciecollins/product/bronze-letter-cufflinks) or, for a couple, a [personalised copper framed print](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/betsybenn/product/couples-bronze-anniversary-framed-print). Modern 8th anniversary gift: The modern alternative for 8th wedding anniversary gifts is linen and lace. There's nothing nicer than slipping into fresh, clean sheets at night and your partner will love some elegant [linen bedding from Marks and Spencer](https://www.marksandspencer.com/l/home-and-furniture/bed-linen/duvet-covers-and-bedding-sets). Just make sure it's a fancy set like these and add some rose petals for the perfect mood-setter. If you're into your gemstones, it's tourmaline, a stone known for shielding a person from unwelcome energies and balancing one's mood - lovely stuff. 9th Wedding Anniversary - Pottery or Willow Traditional 9th anniversary gift: Pottery and willow are the two traditional gifts to [celebrate a 9th anniversary](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/organising-and-planning/9th-wedding-anniversary-willow-pottery-and-leather-gift-ideas/). Pottery is moulded by hand and the painstaking process results in a work of art, whereas willow is flexible but strong and can be woven to create beautiful things - representing teamwork and harmony within a relationship. [This willow picnic hamper](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/prestigewicker/product/large-wicker-picnic-hamper-basket) is the perfect 9th wedding anniversary gift - take it on a date and toast to making it almost a decade in wed. If you would prefer to go for pottery, then how about a [pottery-making lesson for two](https://www.virginexperiencedays.co.uk/product/private-bespoke-ceramics-workshop-katherine-fortnum)? Modern 9th anniversary gift: Leather is the modern alternative for 9th wedding anniversaries, so if you didn't get leather gifts for your third anniversary now is the time. Appropriate for both leather, pottery and willow altogether, is the terracotta colour scheme that symbolises nine years of marriage. Along with this, you can also celebrate with the vibrant poppy - why not get a clay vase to put a bouquet of them in? 10th Wedding Anniversary - Tin or Aluminium Traditional 10th anniversary gift: The traditional [10th anniversary gift](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/fun/10th-wedding-anniversary-gifts_1543.htm) is tin. Tin was used to store and preserve things which is why it is used to mark ten years of marriage. When another metal is coated in tin, it prevents it from corroding and can prolong the life of what it's storing. Mark a decade of a strong and resilient marriage by giving a tin gift such as this garden accessory from [Not On The High Street](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/thelittleboysroom/product/personalised-grey-metal-standing-planter) can be personalised with your initials and will look amazing in your garden. Modern 10th anniversary gift: If tin isn't your thing, you might like to know the modern alternative for 10th anniversary gifts is diamond - which is well deserved after an entire decade together. We're lusting after the [Monica Vinader rose gold Riva diamond hoop ring](https://www.monicavinader.com/riva-diamond-hoop-ring/rose-gold-vermeil-riva-diamond-hoop-ring-diamond), which will look perfect alongside your wedding and engagement ring. The traditional 10 year flower is daffodil which represents happiness, and colours to look out for are silver and blue. Metallics seem very appropriate for such an important milestone, don't you think? 11th Wedding Anniversary Gifts - 20th Wedding Anniversary Gifts Don't let the excitement dampen when you get here - more than ten years of marriage or a relationship is well worth celebrating - and here are the modern and traditional anniversary gifts to mark it with. 11th Wedding Anniversary - Steel Traditional 11th anniversary gift: To celebrate 11 years of marriage, why not gift the traditional [11th anniversary gift](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/organising-and-planning/11th-wedding-anniversary/) of steel which is valued for its durability and strength. Entering a second decade of marriage (it's not as scary as it sounds!), you might immediately think of a watch, [stainless steel cufflinks](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/talesfromtheearth/product/stainless-steel-infinity-cufflinks) or a hip flask, but there are lots of interesting gift ideas out there. Think outside the box: horseshoes are made of steel, so what about a horse riding experience day? Skis also have steel edges - what about a ski break? If you want to stick with the theme, a [personalised tie clip](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/wue/product/personalised-tie-clip), [swiss army knife](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/naturalgiftstore/product/personalised-multi-tool-pocket-knife-11-functions) or cocktail shaker set, like [this personalised one](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/theforestandco/product/cocktail-set-with-a-personalised-leather-handle), are great. Modern 11th anniversary gift: The modern 11th anniversary gift is jewellery - we're sure you have plenty of ideas for this. Perhaps you want to give your engagement or wedding ring an upgrade, or have a piece of jewellery from your wedding day restored. If you want to combine the modern gift with the traditional stone, you'll be pleased to know it's turquoise, one of the most beautiful gemstones out there, considered sacred by many. The traditional flower is actually morning glories, which are famously known for their short lifespan of 24 hours. This is said to remind us of precious moments and the importance of time. 12th Wedding Anniversary - Silk [12th anniversary gift](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/organising-and-planning/12th-wedding-anniversary/), because there is so much choice when shopping for silk gifts. The elegance of silk and its interwoven threads symbolise the way a couple's relationship has strengthened over 12 years and reminds the couple to luxuriate in the finer things in life. This luxurious material symbolises protection, security, comfort, and the strength of a relationship, represented by the interwoven threads silk contains. Silk pyjamas, robes or lingerie are a romantic gift to give to your partner, and, as fine linen counts too, a linen shirt or accessory would also work perfectly. These gorgeous [cream silk pyjamas](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/minilunn/product/coco-silk-pyjamas) can come monogrammed too. Modern 12th anniversary gift: The modern equivalent is elegant pearl. We love everything from [Olivia & Pearl](https://oliviaandpearl.com/) who specialise in contemporary pearl jewellery. For men, mother-of-pearl works great as an inlay into gifts like fountain pens, shaving kits, cufflinks - even on a Fender guitar. The colour synonymous with a 12th wedding anniversary works perfectly with the modern gift - it's oyster white - and the gemstone to look out for is jade, a semi-precious stone which ranges from mid to dark green, although there are rare nephrite gems which include white jade, too. 13th Wedding Anniversary - Lace Traditional 13th anniversary gift: Lace is the traditional [13th wedding anniversary gift](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/organising-and-planning/13th-wedding-anniversary/), and there are plenty of options for giftinghere. It's chosen because the interlacing fibres of lace (and the modern equivalent of textiles or fur) represent the close bond that couples have at 13 years into their marriage. Lace can make for very sensual gifts and you can't go wrong with lace underwear from a brand like [La Perla](https://www.laperla.com/uk/) or [Boux Avenue](https://www.bouxavenue.com/lingerie). Modern 13th anniversary gift: The modern take on 13th wedding anniversary gifts is fur. Real fur is out of the question for most - but textiles and faux fur are great materials for gifts. They represent the warmth and comfort most will feel after 13 years of marriage. Consider gifts such as faux fur-lined gloves, a silk scarf or a leather jacket. A rug or throw, briefcase or handbag, or even something out there like a camping trip in a canvas tent all count as well. The 13th year is a pretty stylish anniversary in terms of gifts, and the matching stones, flowers and colours are just as chic. White shades and elaborate bouquets of hollyhock are recommended, and the citrine gemstone adds warmth to this colour palette. Citrine is said to resemble positive and optimistic attitudes and good for those who practise manifestation. 14th Wedding Anniversary - Ivory Modern 14th anniversary gift: Instead, the elephant or the colour ivory is often taken as the [14th anniversary gift](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/organising-and-planning/14th-wedding-anniversary-gifts/) theme, with elephants reflecting the stability, patience and dignity inherent in a long marriage, and the colour ivory having an association with weddings. We love this [personalised ivory leather photo album](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/begolden/product/beautifully-bespoke-large-wedding-album) that you can add your names, wedding date or another special date to and fill with pictures of your life together, as well as [ this personalised ceramic ivory token](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/littlefoundry/product/14th-ivory-wedding-anniversary-ceramic-love-hearts). If the symbolic elephant is more your vibe, consider [these adorable elephant tea light holders](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/marbletree/product/valentine-elephant-t-light-holders) or a gorgeous [personalised elephant anniversary cushion](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/thealphabetgiftshop/product/personalised-love-elephant-cushion) for your sofa or bedroom. Gems to look out for after 14 years of marriage are opals which have strong links to loyalty and faithfulness, very fitting for our elephant-themed anniversary. 15th Wedding Anniversary - Crystal Traditional 15th anniversary gift: To celebrate 15 years of marriage, you could consider the traditional [15th wedding anniversary gift](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/organising-and-planning/15th-wedding-anniversary/) of crystal. Crystal is the traditional pick for couples as it's a luxurious product, chosen for its clarity and purity: as a transparent product it represents how the couple sees each other clearly after 15 years together. Crystal jewellery will always be a welcome gift - we love this matching necklace and earrings set from [Goldsmiths](https://www.goldsmiths.co.uk/Ted-Baker-Hadeya-Crystal-Heart-Gift-Set-TBJ1943+24+02/p/37240632). Modern 15th anniversary gift: For those who aren't a fan of crystal, the modern anniversary alternative is to give a watch. [Beaverbrooks](https://www.beaverbrooks.co.uk/search?text=crystal+watch) has several beautiful rose gold watches that actually use crystal - a win-win! For the gents, there are loads of [stylish watches](https://www.beaverbrooks.co.uk/watches/mens-watches) on offer that will last a lifetime. We've got some great [wedding watches](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/bridalwear-articles/groom-watches/) you can be inspired by! In-keeping with the opulent theme is the traditional gemstone for 15th anniversaries - the ruby. Known for being one of the most durable gemstones (coming in at just a tad softer than a diamond!), these stones represent durability and stability. Marriages lasting 15 years and counting show much strength and the ruby really represents that. To match, pair a ruby gift with a simple red rose, which is the traditional flower and colour for this milestone. 16th Wedding Anniversary - Wax Traditional 16th anniversary gift: Yes, you read that right, wax is the traditional [16th anniversary gift](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/organising-and-planning/16th-wedding-anniversary-gifts/), and it might seem a tricky symbol to buy for, but that isn't the case at all. Wax for your 16th wedding anniversary represents how you've moulded your lives together after this many years; wax can melt, bend and change shape, just as you have to be flexible to make a marriage work. This is why luxury candles are such a lovely gift idea: try [Jo Malone](https://www.jomalone.co.uk/home/candles/home-candle), [Diptyque ](https://www.diptyqueparis.com/en_uk/l/home/scented-candles.html)and [Neom](https://www.neomorganics.com/collections/candles). It's especially nice if you choose a scent that was also in your wedding flowers. Modern 16th anniversary gift: And the modern gift is silver holloware (which basically just means any tableware that isn't flat). For silver hollowware, what about a [Champagne and wine cooler](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/marquisanddawe/product/silver-hammered-champagne-cooler) and a bottle of the wine you drank at your wedding, to make it extra special? Wax feels like quite a regal gift, as does silver holloware, making the colour schemes of silver and emerald green super appropriate. The peridot gemstone symbolises 16 years, so pair that with some silver jewellery and you have yourself a perfect gift. 17th Wedding Anniversary - Furniture Traditional 17th anniversary gift: There's no traditional option for this anniversary year, but the modern one makes up for the lack of tradition! Modern 17th anniversary gift: The modern [17th wedding anniversary gift](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/organising-and-planning/17th-wedding-anniversary-gifts/) is furniture. If you bought a new bed or sofa a few years into your marriage, now's the time to refresh your space. We adore the idea of adding a [loveseat](https://www.made.com/helma-2-seater-sofa-moonlight-blue-velvet) into a living room - it's so cosy and romantic - or perhaps you want to redecorate your bedroom as an anniversary treat and buy a new bed frame. Think outside the box with this one too. How about adding a cool dresser? If you love being outside, what about some [garden furniture](https://www.wayfair.co.uk/garden/cat/garden-furniture-c477027.html)? A lovely new [coffee table](https://www.wayfair.co.uk/furniture/cat/coffee-tables-side-tables-c476868.html) or [dining room table](https://www.wayfair.co.uk/furniture/sb0/dining-tables-c1804844.html) are ideal if you like having guests over. Giving you all the marriage confidence in the world is this year's traditional gemstone, the carnelian, known for restoring vitality and motivation, adding that new lease of life 17 years into marriage. 18th Wedding Anniversary - Porcelain Traditional and modern 18th anniversary gift: Both the traditional and modern [18th wedding anniversary gift](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/organising-and-planning/18th-wedding-anniversary/), Porcelain is long-lasting and durable, just like your marriage after 18 years together. Made by clay being heated to an extremely high temperature, there's something special about a beautiful material coming from such humble beginnings. It's incredibly elegant too, and lends itself to everything from jewellery to home accessories.

Here are all of the traditional and modern anniversary gifts for milestones between 21 and 50 years together. 21st Wedding Anniversary - Brass or Nickel Modern 21st anniversary gift: Your 21st anniversary doesn't have a traditional gift, but there is a modern alternative for 21 years of marriage. Toast to your [21st wedding anniversary](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/organising-and-planning/21st-wedding-anniversary-gifts/) by swapping brass or nickel anniversary gifts, think along the lines of [brass jewellery](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/search?term=brass%20jewellery) or a [brass watch](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/search?term=brass%20watch) and you can't go wrong. A [brass bottle opener](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/atticus/product/personalised-auric-steel-bottle-opener) or a [personalised brass photo print](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/oakdenedesigns/product/personalised-solid-brass-photo-print) will also go down a treat, we promise.

Silver is a precious metal, and no matter how old it is, if it's treated properly and polished regularly, it will continue to gleam. There is no modern alternative, showing how timeless silver is as a 25th anniversary gift.

As an alternative, what about a [personalised Champagne bottle ](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/bottlebazaar/product/silver-25th-wedding-anniversary-personalised-champagne)to an [engraved sterling silver bookmark?](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/david-louisdesign/product/personalised-sterling-silver-bookmark) For blooms, the traditional flower is Iris, and the colour is (no surprise here!) silver. 30th Wedding Anniversary - Pearl or Ivory Traditional 30th anniversary gift: The [30th anniversary gift](https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/fun/30th-wedding-anniversary-gifts_1586.htm) for three decades of committed marriage is the timeless pearl. Pearls are a symbol of hidden beauty - they are cultivated over time within the not-so-pretty oyster, but once you open it up you find something precious inside. After three decades together it's unlikely you'll appear the same as you did when you first met, but it's what's inside counts. Pearl-inspired anniversary gifts are the way to mark this occasion and we love this stunning [pearl rose gold plated bracelet](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/lhgdesigns/product/purity-pearl-rose-gold-plated-swarovski-bracelet).

It is still precious and protected today so think carefully when it comes to choosing a coral-inspired anniversary gift and maybe choose something inspired by the beautiful colour or shape of coral as opposed to the real thing. You can either choose a [white decorative piece of coral](https://www.wayfair.co.uk/home-decor/pdp/highland-dunes-blythe-sculpture-bbfl7258.html) or take a more practical approach and book an incredible holiday somewhere where you can scuba dive in a coral reef. Be sure to book with a trusted retailer that runs sustainable and environmentally-friendly excursions. Modern 35th anniversary gift: The modern alternative for a 35th anniversary gift is jade, still a vibrant colour but more environmentally friendly.
