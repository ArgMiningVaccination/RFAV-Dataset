Therefore it has led to various different concepts and views regarding the matter. It is a well established part of preventive and public health medicine and is one of the greatest advancements in medicine in the previous century that is accepted in reducing the burden of m any infectious diseases. Since the discovery of smallpox vaccine there is gradual addition in the number of vaccines each year used for prevention of diseases. Also with time there are different outlooks on the efficacy and side effects of injected vaccine s.This article tries to throw some light on different views in Homoeopathy that has been stated by various stalwarts and also studies conducted over the years. Keywords: Vaccination, vaccinosis, vaccines, homoeopathy Introduction Vaccines are immune- biological preparations that provide specific protection against specific diseases. It stimulates the production of defensive antibody and other immune mechanisms which can lead to local reaction like inflammation, fever and pain at the sight of injection or severe reaction occasionally due to some other vaccine constituents. The vaccines are prepared either from live modified organisms, inactivated or killed organisms, extracted cellular fraction, toxoids or combination of these [1]. The vaccines are considered to be extremely preventive and effective, but no immune response is completely free from the threat of adverse reactions or faraway sequelae. The destructive effects after vaccination can either be true destructive events or can be a coincidental process [1]. Among a varieties of vaccines in use the most recently brought vaccine was for COVID -19. The facts concerning the protection is still lacking. Various mentioned side effects of Covid vaccination are weakness, numbness, ataxia and severe conditions su ch as encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination with Guillian -Barre syndrome [2]. Apart from these physical and pathological adverse effects there are several other reactions which are related to anxiety about vaccination. These may include symptoms such as fainting, vomiting, convulsions and hyperventilation [3]. These adverse effects have been mentioned in various places in homoeopathic literature. It is often termed as \"vaccinosis\" where other phrases used are \"ill effects of vaccination\" or \"consequences of vaccination\". Various rubrics regarding these ill effects are mentioned in Homoeopathic Repertory. For instance, there are around forty seven rubrics in Synthesis Repertory for such condition, about ninety eight rubrics in Murphy Repertory whereas Comp lete Repertory mentions about thirty three rubrics related to the subject [4, 5. 6]. These vast amount of rubrics and medicines mentioned cannot be overlooked by a Homoeopathic physician. Views of stalwarts on vaccination Dr. Hahnemann in his Organon of M edicine has mentioned his views regarding vaccination. Firstly , in Aphorism 46 he has praised vaccination saying - \"This seems to be the reason for this beneficial remarkable fact namely that since the general distribution of Janner's Cow - pox vaccination, h uman small -pox never again appeared as epidemically or virulently as 40- 45 years before when one city visited lost at least one -half and often three -quarters of its children by death of this miserable pestilence\" [7]. Though he has supported the idea of va ccination he further warns against the use of vaccination in Aphorism 56 footnote stating - \"To attempt to cure by means of the very same morbific potency (per idem ) contradicts all normal hu man understanding and hence all International Journal of Homoeopathic Sciences https://www.homoeopathicjournal.com ~ 217 ~ experience. Those who first brought Isopathy to notice, probably thought of the benefit which mankind received from cowpox vaccination by which the vaccinated individual is protected against future cowpox infection and as it were cured in advance. But both, cowpox and smallpox are only sim ilar, in no way the same disease. In many respects they differ, namely in the more rapid course and mildness of cowpox and especially in this, that is never contagious to man by more nearness. Universal vaccination put an end to all epidemics of that deadl y fearful smallpox to such an extent that the present generation does no longer possess a clear conception of the former frightful smallpox plague......But to use a human morbific matter (a Psorin taken from the itch in man) as a remedy for the same itch or for evils arisen therefrom is - ? Nothing can result from this but trouble and aggravation of the disease [7].\" J Compton Burnett in his book \"Vaccinosis and its cure by Thuja \" describes the term 'vaccinia' as a local phenomena that occurs at the insertion po int of the vaccinial pus whereas 'vaccinosis' as a diseased state of the constitution that occurs after the injection of the vaccinial pus. It includes vaccinia and few other symptoms. This condition presents itself as acute fatal disease or as a chronic affection. Further he has described series of cases and Thuja occidentalis as the remedy for vaccinosis due to its homoeopathicity. He also states that the law of similar is applicable for prevention of disease [8]. Stuart Close in his lectures \"The Genius of Homoeopathy\" states that the fundamental idea in production of vaccines is to alter the initial poisonous products (toxins or viruses) derived from animals and convert them into a substance that can be used for prevention of various diseases. Thus they can be considered as a counterpart of homoeopathic method of potentiation. This method is particularly disagreeable mainly because of the involvement of many uncertain factors. It is impossible to completely understand the complex changes that are constan tly taking place in a body and as a result the impact of insertion of such altered substance cannot be understood properly. When such products are inoculated in human body they can only lead to a false immunity and lead to destruction of normal susceptibil ity. It has a morbific influence over the entire being and also set an unhealthy condition in a normal healthy person [9]. If we compare the method of potentisation that Hahnemann undertook with the above method the former is purely physical, objective and mechanical. It does not concern with any unknown and unpredictable factors. The components are only the substance or drug that has to be potentised, a vehicle (sugar of milk, alcohol, or water) in certain amounts and handling of the process under conditio ns which are all under check [9]. HA Robert in his book \"The Principles and Art of Cure by Homoeopathy\" mentions that it is claimed that the preparation of vaccines are homoeopathic i.e. similar as they are potentiated as in homoeopathy removing them from identical sphere. He explains that although potentiated the fact remains that that it was not similar but identical in first place. Secondly the process is done in form of mass production where the substance used for potentisation and filteration is not in ert but through living creature of lower order. There is a difference in the longevity and average weight of human race and animals. The serum from this source when injected into humans can cause severe impact upon vital energy. Thus while vaccines are con sidered potentiated past all danger by the ordinary medicine, homoeopathy has an opinion that potentisation in any form is a means to bring out the power of substances that usually remain dormant in their crude form. 10 Dr. George Vitholkas in his work \"The Science of Homoeopathy\" has given a detailed description on vaccination. He considers the concept of vaccination an exact opposite of homoeopathy due to the fact that it is injected in an entire population disregarding the individuality of a person. The s usceptibility of every person to a particular vaccine varies in a population but while vaccinating a large group this individuality is not taken into account. The electromagnetic vibration rate is altered by the inoculation of vaccine in a similar way as caused by a conventional drug or disease. The response to a vaccine depends on the health of a person. According to this two conditions are possible as depicted in the flowchart below. 11 International Journal of Homoeopathic Sciences https://www.homoeopathicjournal.com ~ 218 ~ In the second case where there is some sort of reaction present after vaccination the three variety of response according to intensity indicate: - Mild reaction : It shows that the person is susceptible to the disease but his defense mechanism is not powerful to the extent that it can completely counteract the effect of vaccination. Strong reaction: It shows that the defense mechanism is able to tackle with the bad effects of vaccination. Very strong reaction: It shows that the susceptibility of a person to the disease is high but the defense mechanism has no power to fight against the morbific influence of vaccination and therefore it leads to a diseased state in the patient [11]. In \"The Homeopathic Recorder\", Vol. XVI, No.12, publi shed in 1901 Dr. James Tyler Kent states that -\"I have watched over the pros and cons of vaccination and after observing the question for many years I have come to the conclusion, that the positive evidence for vaccinations are very doubtful. In fact it hasbeen a major factor for the enormous damage to the individuals and entire human race. They led humans to get sick, have produced many ulcers and undoubtedly cause of many constitutional ailments. Considering all this, I see no reason to recommend vaccinations. I have refused vaccinations for many years and if a patient is adamant about it t hen he has to turn to other places . I do not assume responsibility. I have applied many medicines as preventive as long as the disease was present and so I have several evidences for it, that the indicated remedy acts prophylactically\" [12]. Though the abo ve discussed views clearly state the strong resistance to the idea of vaccination, the current studies lack the clinical evidence regarding the effect of homoeopathy in such cases. The Australian Register of Homoeopath and British Homoeopathic Association has also recommended the continuation of use of conventional vaccination. Further they do not recommend the use of homoeopathic medicines in place of vaccination [13]. Thus apart from the vast literature mentioned, clinical studies to prove the efficacy of homoeopathy in such cases is required. Cases of vaccinosis and their cure according to observations of J C burnett Dr. Burnett has made variuos observations on vaccinosis and described them through a series of cases in his book \"Vaccinosis and its cure by Thuja\" . Two of such cases are discussed below to give a clear view on the matter. Case 1: Vaccinosis and Neuralgia of Right eye \"28th June 1882- A male of 50 years presented with neuralgia of the right eye. Patient complained of constant pain in the rig ht eye since six months. Along with this there was a brown, eczematous, itchy eruption on both shins and between the toes. The symptoms of eye aggravated both at day and night but particularly more at night. Past history of neuralgia of head in 1866 for which he was injected with much amount of morphia. On further questioning about history of vaccination he particularly feared being vaccinated as he suffered a lot from previous vaccinations. The case in hand seemed to be of vaccinial neuralgias, so Thuja 30 was given in frequent dose. July 8 th the pain was better after the first dose and was permanently cured after the repetition. Considering that how \"awfully ill\" the patient was after his first vaccination there is a high probability that the case was an e xample of vaccinosis [8].\" Case 2: Vaccinosis bars the way to the cure of ringworm by Bacillinum A forty four month old girl brought with manifestations of ringworm - large patches, originally circular but now covered with scabs. Aprevious 3 months trial of Bacillinum was given by local homoeopathic chemist. Her maternal grandparents died of phthisis. This seemed to be a case where vaccinosis barred the way as simple ringworm does not become pustular and encaked with mattery scabs as in this case. Thuja 30 was given, when great scabs were srill seen on the scalp, but they were dryer. Then after 2 months under Bacillinum 30 (infrequent doses), the scabs had fallen off, and the circular patches were covered with young hairs. After another 2 months of treatment under Bacillinum 30 , the cure was complete. Thus we can observe that vaccinosis is a super implanted disease that has to be treated for the underlying tuberculous taint to be cured [8]. Conclusion Over the time vaccination has become the most high quality scientific approach in managing infectious diseases. The vaccines are used to induce immunity with the aid of inflicting the recipient's immune system to react against the vaccine which can lead to a range of mild to extreme reactions [1]. In the current scenario vaccination is one of the most controversial topic in homoeopathy because of damaging consequences like fever or development of auto immune disorders that have been observed by various eminent stalwarts. Even Dr. Hahnemann's casebooks clearly document the acute facet consequences of vaccination, but still many of its chronic ill -effects are unknown. It was Wolf, Boenninghausen and Hering who once realized that the orthodox vaccination was causing an itrogenic chronic miasm named vaccinosis and als o in accordance to Dr. J C Burnett, vaccinosis has a long damaging adverse constitutional impact on the affected person. 14Several remedies are illustrated under a wide range of rubrics in different homoeopathic repertories for ill effects of vaccination an d other vaccine associated complaints.For example, in Kent repertory remedies mentioned under ailments after vaccination are above discussion a deeper ex pertise and further study is necessary in the area for better understanding of the subject.
