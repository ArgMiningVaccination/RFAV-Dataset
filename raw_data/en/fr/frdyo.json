Furuncles appear as red, swollen, and tender nodules on hair-bearing parts of the body, and the most common infectious agent is Staphylococcus aureus, but other bacteria may also be causative. The management of recurrent Furunculosis is problematic and may be disappointing. Simple incision and drainage may be enough in solitary lesions, but systemic antibiotic therapy may be required. S aureus has the ability of developing resistance to different antibiotics. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) believes Furunculosis is mostly caused by invasion of dampness and heat. The treatment in TCM is intended to dissipate heat and detoxify the body. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that Recurrent Furunculosis can be treated without the use of antibiotics. Methods: Through the report of two clinical cases, both men, suffering from Recurrent Furunculosis, presented little improvement with the use of antibiotic therapy. Through earlier Medicine theories, such as TCM, methods for energy balance of Yin, Yang, Qi and Blood were used, allied with Apex Ear Bloodletting to withdrawal of Internal Heat, as well as dietary counseling. Results: Both cases obtained a significant improvement with dietary counseling according to Traditional Chinese Medicine and auricular acupuncture sessions associated with apex ear bloodletting to clear out the internal heat. Conclusion: By reporting these two clinical cases, we can conclude that Recurrent Furunculosis can be treated without the use of antibiotics. For this goal, we must resort to earlier medicine theories like TCM to treat the root of the problem, not only the symptom.
