Please note that not all therapies are appropriate for every individual. Your Sanoviv doctor will select the therapies that are most appropriate for you. We are not an a-la-carte facility, so these therapies must be administered as part of a [comprehensive treatment program](https://www.sanoviv.com/medical-programs/comprehensive-medical-program/). Many of these therapies are most effective when done in combination with other complementary therapies, administered in an environment of detox and healing. Many patients have found healing at Sanoviv using many of the same therapies that they have tried elsewhere with little effect. This is because of the synergy of the healing environment along with supportive therapies found here. Please check with your admissions coordinator or your doctor for more information about which therapies may be recommended for you. The descriptions below are meant to provide a general overview of the therapy and are not a guarantee or promise of a successful outcome. Individual results may vary. Sanoviv cutting-edge therapies available Amygdalin Therapy Amygdalin (B-17) is a naturally occurring anti-cancer agent, or cyanogenic glycoside. It is not appropriate for all cancers, but can be very effective when used by our skilled practitioners. Research continues to show the potential of Amygdalin as a supportive anti-cancer therapy, especially when used in conjunction with immunotherapies. It is believed to promote cell death by upregulating expression of proapoptotic protein and caspase-3, and downregulating expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. When used in conjunction with a full integrative cancer treatment program, this therapy can slow or block cancer cell proliferation and growth. We have used amygdalin for over 20 years and we think it plays a role in the metabolic approach to treating cancer. Anti-Angiogeninic Therapy We use a combination of botanicals that have the potential to modulate EGFR and other cytokines that promote cancer new blood vessels formation. For example, bioactive agents extracted from sea cucumbers contain unique components that are rich in nutrients and have powerful anti-inflamatory, anti-tumor, and anti-disease properties. This concentrated formula has been shown to prevent colon cancer in rodent models, and is part of our overall cancer treatment program. Aromatherapy treatments & Massage Artesunate IV Auriculotherapy This therapy is available in our bio-energetics department at Sanoviv. Pinpointed microcurrent stimulates ear acupuncture points to enhance your body's proper function. Different points activate energy for specific protocols such as obesity, pain, addictions, anxiety, etc. Avazzia Rejuvenation MicroCurrent delivers gentle, extremely low electrical frequencies that mimic the skin's own electrical signals, stimulating the musculature and accelerating natural cell processes of the skin. This therapy is designed to lift and tone the facial muscles and skin tissue, reduce appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, improve hyper-pigmentation and acne, shrink enlarged pores, reduce dark circles and puffiness under the eyes and reduce symptoms caused by eczema, melasma and rosacea. The Ezzi-Lift device includes LED light therapy approved by the FDA. After an LED treatment, your skin may look and feel tighter, smoother, rejuvenated, and more hydrated with a natural radiant glow. Brainspotting Brainspotting is a revolutionary new type of therapy that has an impact on our mental and emotional well-being. Brainspotting can help in the treatment of PTSD, Complex trauma and other types of trauma that sometimes can make it harder for the body to heal or stay healthy. This is different to traditional therapy, as this comes from a brain/body model, rather than a talk therapy model that focuses thoughts and emotions. Bemer This device stimulates and enhances the microcirculation in the smallest capillaries and vessels, reducing inflammation and pain and promoting healing and proper organ function. It uses a very soft pulsating signal through electromagnetic fields that stimulates micro vessels to optimize blood flow to all tissues and organs. Device from Germany. Bio Energetic Therapies Most people are familiar with the chemical side of our body, that consists of millions of chemical reactions, and can be affected by medications, chemicals, food, etc. But, many don't realize that we are also energetic beings with electrical impulses flowing throughout the body. Understanding and balancing this flow of energy is just as important to our state of health as treating the chemical side. In our bio-energetic department we use various tools and therapies to restore balance and flow to energetic systems of the body, which helps to support and increase the effectiveness of therapies that are being done in other departments. This synergistic, whole-body approach to healing sets Sanoviv apart and contributes to the positive results that many experience. Biological Dentistry Biological dentistry is a more natural approach to treating oral conditions. Instead of considering oral health as separate from the health of the rest of the body, as in conventional medicine, Biological Dentistry is the bridge between oral health and your overall state of health. Biological Dentistry goes far beyond the cosmetic look of your teeth, to identify pockets of infection or blockages that may contribute to many chronic health conditions. Dental problem can often correlate with current health conditions you may be experiencing, and may contribute to chronic degenerative diseases, central nervous system diseases, heavy metal load, heart and blood circulatory problems, and more. Our Biological Dentists work closely with other medical practitioners to identify and treat the root cause of disease. Dental treatments, materials and procedures are selected and performed with the complete health of the person in mind. [Learn more](/health-concerns/biologicaldentistry/) Biotron with Magnets This therapy is available in our bio-energetics department at Sanoviv. Biotron uses pulsating magnetic fields (PMF's) to help oxygenate your cells, reduce pain and inflammation, and regenerate tissue, using magnetic wave stimulation and positive/negative polarities to concentrate on specific areas. Device from Germany. Body Code We offer a form of energy work called The Body Code, designed to identify and correct the imbalances that cause physical and emotional problems. Practitioners look at the health of the energy body, and release trapped emotional energies (emotional baggage), correct blocked meridians, and evaluate other systems. They can also detect physical abnormalities, including infections, toxins, nutritional deficiencies and structural imbalances, and address those according to whatever your body needs. Basically, this work is all about removing imbalances in the physical and energetic body in order to make conditions right for the body to heal itself. Chelation Therapy Chelation is an IV treatment where we use CaEDTA IV to form a chemical bond with the heavy metals found in the body. This bond allows the body to release the heavy metals into the blood, and consequently into the other detox systems of the body: lymph, kidney, bowel, etc. Cell Therapy All healing begins at the cellular level. When cells are strong, thriving, and functioning normally, the body is healthy. Weak, damaged, toxic, or mutant cells result in disease. With this in mind, at Sanoviv we provide an environment of healing, with a particular focus on cellular health. Various cell therapies are used to promote cellular health, including Dendritic Cell Therapy, Stem Cell Therapy, and more directly impact your health on the cellular level. Chi Therapy Chiropractic Treatments Chiropractic is grounded in the principle that the body can heal itself when the skeletal system is correctly aligned, and the nervous system is functioning properly. To achieve this, the practitioner uses his or her hands or an adjusting tool to perform specific manipulations of the vertebrae. It can benefit people with specific imbalances and illnesses in their body or can be used for prevention. Our chiropractors use Applied Kinesiology as a tool to find the root cause of those imbalances in body and assess if the cause is mostly structural, biochemical or emotional. Colon Hydrotherapy Colon Hydrotherapy is a safe and effective treatment used to remove debris and toxic waste build-up in the intestines, using pure water. This is one of the most powerful detoxifying therapies that can be done to cleanse the colon. When combined with wheat grass juice implant, there is an increased response in detoxification and cleansing of the colon. It can also improve overall digestive function. Learn more about [Colon Hydrotherapy](/therapies/colon-hydrotherapy/). Cryotherapy Tumor Ablation This is a surgical procedure where instead of removing the tumor, it is frozen in place, effectively killing the tumor. Afterward, it slowly dissolved into the surrounding tissues. This procedure is performed at an outside surgical center. We are currently not performing surgeries at Sanoviv. Dendritic Cell Antigen Therapy (Immunotherapy) Dendritic Cells are part of the body's own immune system that can be used as a potent, non-toxic form of immunotherapy use to treat cancer. This therapy uses the body's own tumor tissue and white blood cells to create mature dendritic cells that are then reintroduced into the body to activate the T-cells of the immune system to fight and destroy cancer tumor cells. Thus, dendritic cell therapy is also considered to be a vaccine therapy. This immune therapy helps to address the circulating tumor cells to reduce the risk of a metastasis. Learn more about [Dendritic Cell Antigen Therapy](/therapies/dendritic-cells/). The biopsy is performed at an outside surgical center. We are currently not performing surgeries at Sanoviv. Dental Amalgam Removal The mercury contained in amalgam (silver) fillings is among the most toxic substances known to man. Patients with amalgam fillings accumulate mercury, which can interfere with virtually any process of any organ of the body. Amalgam Removal is designed to safely replace mercury fillings taking into account the body's natural main detoxification pathways. The biological dental team is structured, uses special equipment and the safest protocol for removal of mercury to protect you, the personnel, and the environment. [Learn more](https://www.sanoviv.com/health-concerns/biologicaldentistry/). Dental Surgeries (Biological) When pockets of infection form in the oral cavity, they can affect the overall health of the individual and contribute to chronic disease. In our Biological Dentistry department cavitation surgeries can put these patients back on the road to health. [Learn more](/health-concerns/biologicaldentistry/) Enema Therapy Enzyme Therapies Pancreatic enzymes are well known in the physiology of digestion of fat and carbs. In cancer patients or patients with chronic diseases, digestion and nutrition absorption are often significantly compromised. These enzymes are useful to reduce systemic inflammation, and to dissolve the protective coating around cancer cells. Equiscope This therapy is available in our bio-energetics department at Sanoviv. Equiscope is a pain-management micro current device designed to treat neural tissues and connective tissue, stimulating detoxification pathways on the cellular membrane. It also can reach and work via meridians, chakras, reflex points, acupuncture points and nervous system via spinal and brain waves to support the treatment of chronic disease. Equiscope therapy is among the most effective methods of pain relief available today. It may also be used to speed the healing process, reduce inflammation, enhance skin tone and appearance, and to stimulate detox. Fitness Programs Fitness is a critical aspect of healing, but it needs to be based on the specific needs of each guest to support their individual situation. Our Fitness experts can offer a wide range of services in these sessions, like designing a specific exercise program for the guest to follow, especially when they are new to this; modifying a current exercise plan if results or expectations are not being met; and specific therapeutic support in healing any type of lesion or physical deficiency. FMT - Fecal Microbiota Transplant Our digestive system contains trillions of bacteria cells, with many diverse species called the microbiome. When properly balanced, these bacteria help with digestion and keep you healthy. But, when the bacteria become unbalanced, or when unhealthy strains such as C. difficile become dominant, it can lead to many health problems. Antibiotics can make this worse by destroying healthy bacteria. FMT is transplanting a fecal preparation from a carefully screened, healthy donor to a patient. This can help to repopulate healthy bacteria and restore the balanced microbiome community. There are various methods of administration. FMT has a cure rate of up to 80% of C. Diff sufferers and may help with other gastrointestinal problems. Glutathione IV Glutathione is the second most prevalent molecule in our body, and is critical for immune function and controlling inflammation. It is the master detoxifier and the body's main antioxidant, protecting our cells and making our energy metabolism run well. When administered as an IV, it can stimulate detoxification. HIPEC surgery Some types of cancers are very difficult to treat. Cancer that has spread to the lining surfaces of the peritoneal (abdominal) cavity from primary colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, appendiceal cancer or from mesothelioma and pseudomyxoma peritonei-known as peritoneal carcinomatosis-are such cancers. Despite numerous recent advances in chemotherapy, the overall chance of chemotherapy being curative is still low, and the side effects are difficult for the patient to endure. However, when these cancers are confined to the peritoneal cavity, Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) becomes an option for candidate patients. The term \"Intraperitoneal\" means that the treatment is delivered to the abdominal cavity. The term \"Hyperthermic Chemotherapy\" means that the solution containing chemotherapy is heated to a temperature greater than normal body temperature. Before HIPEC is administered, the surgeon-using standard surgical methods-will remove all visible tumors that can be removed throughout the peritoneal cavity. This is known as cytoreductive surgery. Following cytoreductive surgery, in the operative setting the surgeon will administer HIPEC treatment. Homeopathy At Sanoviv we regularly offer our guests homeopathic treatments for their health issues. We have trained staff in Classical Homeopathy and Homotoxicology, and we apply both disciplines depending on the nature of the illness or the desired therapeutic effect. Learn more about [ homeopathy and homotoxicology](/therapies/homeopathy-and-homotoxicology/) at Sanoviv. Homotoxicology At Sanoviv we regularly offer our guests homeopathic treatments for their health issues. We have trained staff in Classical Homeopathy and Homotoxicology, and we apply both disciplines depending on the nature of the illness or the desired therapeutic effect. Learn more about [ homeopathy and homotoxicology](/therapies/homeopathy-and-homotoxicology/) at Sanoviv. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) HBOT therapy can improve the oxygenation levels and saturation in the body. It can promote the growth of new blood vessels resulting in the increase of blood flow, which can be helpful in heart conditions. It also promotes the production of antioxidants and is recommended for anti-aging purposes. Sanoviv has three hard-shell, professional hyperbaric oxygen chambers. HBOT can increase the oxygen concentration in the body 10 to 15 times more than what is delivered at normal atmospheric levels or at sea level, allowing the oxygen to reach tissues with compromised circulatory function and increasing the oxygen entering the blood stream. This allows the oxygen to reach difficult parts of the body like bones, plasma, the brain and central nervous system as well as the lymphatic system, and aid in healing. [Learn more](/therapies/hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy/) Hyperthermia Therapeutic hyperthermia refers to heating the body in a specific way to treat illness directly or intensify the effect of other therapies. Hyperthermia is a powerful immunotherapy, as well as a proven primary treatment for chronic infectious diseases. At Sanoviv we use both Regional Hyperthermia (using the Celsius 42+ equipment from Germany) and Whole Body [Whole Body Hyperthermia](/therapies/whole-body-hyperthermia/) (using the Heckel HT3000 equipment from Germany). To be effective, hyperthermia must be done with high quality equipment in a hospital setting and an environment of detoxification. Using an inferior heat source or method may technically be referred to hyperthermia, but will not have the advanced therapeutic effect found at Sanoviv. Immune Modulation Therapies Immune Modulation therapy brings the ratio of different types of immune cells back into balance so that they can perform their critical function to search, detect, and destroy foreign or diseased cells. Balancing the immune system is much better than simply stimulating the immune system (which could cause it to over react and attack healthy cells). Restoring healthy immune function is especially important for those with cancer. There are various types of therapies that modulate the immune system, including Transfer Factor, Peptide Therapies, T-Cell Modulators, etc. Immunotherapy [Immunotherapy](https://www.sanoviv.com/therapies/immunotherapy/) refers to a whole category of treatments that work WITH the immune system, in contrast with other types of cancer therapies that suppress the immune system and attempt to attack the cancer directly. Immunotherapies have been around for many years but are just getting the attention of the traditional medical community. Examples of immunotherapies include Dendritic Cell Antigen Therapy, Hyperthermia, Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy, Ozone, T-Cell Modulation (TCM) therapies, Specific Tumor Vaccines, and many more. Intra tumoral treatments (ozone, procaine and more) IV Chelation Low dose chemotherapy with target therapy Conventional cancer therapies such as chemotherapy are rarely used at Sanoviv because our first choice is to pursue natural therapies, such as immunotherapy. However, there are cases when targeted, low dose chemotherapies can contribute to the overall healing strategy for a patient. Low dose radiation (IMRT) enhanced by regional hyperthermia In rare circumstances where our doctors feel that radiotherapy could enhance the patient's overall healing strategy, it may be used in conjunction with other therapies such as regional hyperthermia to enhance the effect. Lymphatic Massage A medical spa therapy that promotes the healthy flow of lymph, which carries waste out of the tissues. It can reduce blockages in the lymphatic system, sooth swelling in the lymph area, and help clear/drain the lymphatic system. Lymphatic massage is one of the many ways we stimulate the lymphatic system, an important detox pathway. Major Autohemotherapy with UV Ozone therapy, administered directly into the bloodstream is called Major Autohemotherapy. It can enhance your antioxidant enzymes, improving your ability to modulate oxidative stress, improve delivery of oxygen, activate and modulate immune and growth factors, increase the release of nitric oxide, generate super-gifted erythrocytes, and release stem cells. Blood is passed through a UV filter which can help to reduce or eliminate unwanted bacteria, viruses, fungi, yeast, and other pathogens. Metabolic Cancer Therapies Increasing evidence indicates that cancer can be considered a metabolic disease because malignant cells change the way they function. They become increasingly dependent on glucose and glutamine as energy sources and change the way they respond to their environment. This contributes to their rapid growth. But, it also reveals potential weaknesses. Sanoviv uses specific metabolic cancer protocols to exploit these weaknesses, which supports and enhances the effectiveness of other cancer therapies. These protocols include dietary changes to significantly reduce glucose, and therapies to increase oxygen levels, all carefully timed for maximum effectiveness. Mind/Body Therapy The Mind/Body Therapy Department at Sanoviv offers a variety of treatment modalities designed to reduce stress, heal emotional wounds and change limiting patterns affecting physical, mental, and emotional health. The therapies used are validated by years of research and clinical studies. Each practitioner chooses the most relevant and effective therapy for each guest based upon their immediate needs and their willingness to learn new stress reduction tools. Therapies may include: - NET (Neuro-Emotional Technique) - Body Code - NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) - FAST (First Aid Stress Tool) [Laughter Yoga](https://www.sanoviv.com/therapies/laughter-yoga/) MRT - Matrix Regeneration Therapy Soft connective tissues, often called matrix, can become overloaded by environmental toxins, stress, and inflammation. The matrix connects the vascular, lymph and nervous system with the organ cells, so when compromised, it can result in chronic conditions, allergies, immune problems, etc. MRT is designed to free the soft connective tissue from environmental and metabolic waste and to strengthen the immune and connective tissue cells. This medical spa therapy links three holistic methods to one treatment: petechial suction, rhythmic direct current, and bio-information therapy. Mycoplasma Vaccine Mycoplasma is a type of bacteria that adhere to the platelets surface or penetrate them to take what is needed to survive and develop. Mycoplasma can predispose people for cancer, diabetes, auto-immune diseases, multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue, etc. A vaccine can be developed from the patient's own blood which may help control this infection. Nanoknife Tumor Ablation Also referred to as IEP (irreversible electroporation), Nanoknife is a procedure where electrodes are laparoscopically inserted to surround a tumor, then an electric field is passed through the tumor, potentially killing the tumor without damaging surrounding healthy tissues such as nerves, muscles, or tendons. This procedure is performed at an outside surgical center. We are currently not performing surgeries at Sanoviv. Neural Therapy Neural therapy is a tool that we use to treat illness and pain caused by disturbances of the body's electrophysiology. It helps stimulate the tissue and the nervous system back into balance thus allowing normal neural activity in this area. Neural Therapy treats dysfunction(s) within the autonomic nervous system. It involves the injection of Procaine (also known as Novocain), a common local anesthetic, into various but very specific areas to treat chronic pain conditions. Neural Therapy injection can sometimes instantly and lastingly resolve chronic long-standing illness and chronic pain. Learn more about [Neural Therapy](/therapies/neural-therapy/) at Sanoviv. Neuro Emotional Technique (NET) NET or Neuro Emotional Technique, is a type of therapy that focuses on releasing \"stuck\" stress patterns that can affect our healing. Many of these patterns come from past negative experiences that have not been fully resolved. NET uses a combination of the latest scientific research and ancient Eastern healing techniques to release these emotions in a short period of time. NET acknowledges the relationship between stress, environmental toxicity, nutritional balance and structural integrity, and how finding balance in these we can create a better health and well-being. Nutrition Therapy At Sanoviv, food is medicine. One of the cornerstones of our work is using food and nutrition as therapeutic tools to help achieve your health goals. Our diet is based on 100% organic whole foods, eliminating the most common food allergies, such as gluten and dairy, designed by nutritionists to suit your health needs and prepared by chefs for your enjoyment. (low glycemic, organic, gluten-free, dairy-free diet, plus daily juice) Onda-Med This therapy is available in our bio-energetics department at Sanoviv. This is a biofeedback device used to determine which frequencies of sound, as well as the accompanying weak pulse electromagnetic fields, cause a response in a patient's autonomic nervous system. This promotes relaxation, muscle re-education, and can be used for pain relief, reduction of inflammation and improvement of immune system function. It uses pulse biofeedback magnetic wave frequencies using either pulse-guided support, or pre-set programs recommended by your Sanoviv doctor. Organ preserved surgery This can be done with either a full tumor removal or a biopsy. Essentially, a piece of the tumor containing cancer cells is preserved so that it can be used to create specific tumor vaccines or antigen therapies. Orthomolecular Medicine In complementary and functional medicine, orthomolecular medicine refers to directly supplying the body with nutrients, bypassing gastrointestinal absorption. Orthomolecular medicine is designed to correct chronic nutritional deficiencies. Examples include proprietary Partial Parental Nutrition (PPN) formulas that contain vitamins, minerals, amino acids and more, to help restore balance in our cells and between them. Ozone Therapy [Ozone therapy](https://www.sanoviv.com/therapies/ozone-therapy/) can enhance your antioxidant enzymes, improving your ability to modulate oxidative stress, improve delivery of oxygen, activate and modulate immune and growth factors, increase the release of nitric oxide, generate super-gifted erythrocytes, and release stem cells. Ozone therapy can be administered in several ways, including IV (Major Autohemotherapy), rectal insufflations, and more. Medical ozone is also used to disinfect and treat disease. The mechanism of action is by inactivating bacteria, viruses, fungi, yeast and protozoa, stimulation of oxygen metabolism, activation of the immune system. Psychology - Stress Relieving Therapies Our psychology department focuses on supporting health and healing, especially through teaching our guests how to create relaxation and how to relieve stress. Stress and relaxation, which are biochemical responses in the body, can play an active role on how our body responds to healing therapies. Relaxation supports healing, as it signals that the body can focus on healing and repair. Stress, especially too much of it, signals that the body needs to stay active, focusing part of our energy and attention away from healing. We will help you find the right tools to create balance in this part of your nervous system. Pain Management (Advanced) Paracentesis Photon Laser Therapy This therapy is available in our bio-energetics department at Sanoviv. Infrared rays stimulate your metabolism, promoting the elimination of toxins that accumulate in your cells, such as: carcinogens, heavy metals, toxic substances from processed food, etc. It helps to stimulate brain waves through alpha waves to alleviate stress, anxiety, and depression. It can also reduce pain, regenerate tissue following surgeries, and help with bruises, cellulite, and skin-muscular discomfort. Device from Germany. PK Protocol The PK Protocol was developed by Dr. Patricia Kane, Ph.D. It offers safe and effective detoxification methods for the Brain and the Central Nervous System. It uses targeted supplementation and intravenous therapy to stabilize the health of the cells, the brain and the body, and is particularly suited for those suffering from neurological conditions. Sanoviv staff was personally trained in its use by Dr. Kane. Plasmapheresis This is a procedure where quantities of blood are removed, and the plasma is separated from the blood cells. Plasma contains most of the unwanted foreign pathogens, antibodies, and toxins, so removing this can help patients with sensitivities or autoimmune conditions. The plasma is replaced with Albumin or saline, and mixed with the remaining blood cells, then restored to the body. Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy PRP is a process of enriching platlets from the patient's own blood sample by centrifugation, and reinjecting, as microinjection, very superficially below patient's own skin. It stimulates the production of collagen, elastin, revitalizing the skin, resulting in a younger, smoother and better skin. PRP is one of the most innovative regenerative medical tools in anti-aging medicine. Procaine Procaine is well known as an anesthetic. But at sanoviv we use this product in different modalities, according to protocols from Huneke and Lyftogt. These modalities are intended to treat chronic pain by using peri neurotherapy application at specific trigger points. Other uses including the diagnosing of energic interference. So it can be both diagnostic and therapeutic at the same time. Psychology - Stress Relieving Therapies Radiofrequency Tumor Ablation Radiofrequency Tumor Ablation is a procedure where frequency-generating probes laparoscopically inserted to surround a tumor, then radio frequencies are passed through the tumor, potentially killing the tumor without damaging surrounding healthy tissues such as nerves, muscles, or tendons. This procedure is performed at an outside surgical center. We are currently not performing surgeries at Sanoviv. Rectal Insufflation Ozone This therapy can enhance your antioxidant enzymes, improving the capacity of your body to modulate oxidative stress, improve the delivery of oxygen, activate and modulate immune and growth factors, increase release of nitric oxide, and generate super-gifted erythrocytes. This also releases stem cells in the body, although at lower levels than other ozone therapies, which is advisable as an initial therapy. The process consists of applying ozone in the rectum, and then it's absorbed and taken to the portal vein to have a systemic effect on the entire body. Regional Hyperthermia This is a targeted heat therapy used mainly for tumors and inflammation. Research has shown that high temperatures can damage cancer cells with minimal damage to normal cells; consequently, this can help reduce the size of tumors. We use the state-of-the-art Celsius 42 loco-regional hyperthermia equipment from Germany, which focuses targeted heat to specific regions of the body. In addition to weakening tumors, Regional hyperthermia can also be used to potentiate and activate other anti-cancer therapies. It can also enhance treatments for other illnesses. The Celsius system uses radiowaves to produce the heat response and target it directly to the specific area of the body to be treated. Reiki Therapy Rife Therapy This therapy is available in our bio-energetics department at Sanoviv. Rife Therapy delivers frequency resonance at the identical intensity known to match with the natural frequency oscillations of the particular microbes and organisms causing the disease in the patient, causing them to distort and disintegrate from their own structural stress. Electrical impulses work at specific frequencies and the nerve/cell level, to help release toxins from your body. It also offers many options for pain, stress, and anxiety. Sodium Bicarbonate IV This IV therapy is intended to help restore the natural PH balance in our body\u2014especially in cancer patients. It is well known that chronic disease produces a hostile environment (chronic low systemic PH) by many mechanisms. Specific Tumor Antigen Vaccine (immunotherapy) A specific tumor vaccine is created from the patient's own tumor tissue following an organ preserving surgery or biopsy. It stimulates the immune system to recognized and attack cancer cells. Tumor-specific antigens are proteins or other molecules that are found only on cancer cells and not on normal cells. These antigens can help the body make an immune response against cancer cells. They may be used as possible targets for targeted therapy or for immunotherapy to help boost the body's immune system to kill more cancer cells. Tumor-specific antigens may also be used in laboratory tests to help diagnose some types of cancer. We have a tumor specific antigen vaccine therapy by which we can enhance the immune response with a specific antibody against the antigens cancer cells are expressing, for this we take a biopsy so our laboratory can examine the specific antigens cancer cells are expressing and develop the antibody against these antigens. This therapy will not cause any toxicities since it is used against the antigens on cancer cells only. The biopsy is performed at an outside surgical center. We are currently not performing surgeries at Sanoviv. Stem Cell Therapy [Stem Cell Therapy](https://www.sanoviv.com/medical-programs/stem-cell-rejuvenation/) is one of the most exciting and promising areas of medical advancement in the 21st Century. These cells can differentiate into many different cell types to regenerate and renew damaged or diseased cells. Stem Cells may help with numerous chronic or degenerative conditions, including: chronic pain, degenerative joints, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune conditions, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's, and more. Stem Cells can repair and rejuvenate tissues damaged by many health conditions. They also have the potential to slow the aging process for improved performance and a more youthful appearance. At Sanoviv, we have carefully researched potential sources to provide the highest quality cells. [Learn more](/medical-programs/stem-cell-rejuvenation/) Superimmune IV Cocktails At Sanoviv, we have many proprietary IV formulations designed to boost the immune system and speed your healing. If recommended for you, the specific formula will be selected by your doctor. Super Tuning This therapy is available in our bio-energetics department at Sanoviv. Magnetic waves, laser color and therapeutic frequencies of sound stimulate and scan your energy field and determine what areas of your body requires grounding energy. Sooner or later, most of us experience \"deviations\" from these natural and health-supporting frequencies. Super Tuning System is detecting and balancing fundamental switching errors in the organism's triggering and control system. Often used for Balancing biological clocks, jet lag, harmonization, sleep issues, etc. Device from Germany. Surgical Procedures Surgery is always the last option considered for a Sanoviv patient. However, there are times when surgical procedures are necessary, including times especially when cancer can be isolated and successfully removed, or when tumors are interfering with body processes. Surgical biopsies and organ preserving surgeries (for use in creating antigen therapies) are also available. Surgery in some cases is the ideal treatment modality since removing the tumor when it is localized is curative in certain circumstances. We have the specific type of surgeries for every cancer and the safe oncologic approach needed in each case. From an open approach to minimal invasive laparoscopic procedures we will perform the procedure indicated in each case without altering the bodies normal functions, recovery is enhanced by using our supportive therapies to help each body heal faster and with less pain. Targeted Cancer Therapy Putting an anticancer agent (immunotherapy, low dose chemotherapy, antigen therapy, etc.) at the site of the cancer, usually by injecting it directly into the tumor). T-Cell Modulation (TCM) Therapy T-Cell Modulation therapy is a type of immunotherapy using donor peptides. The peptides are derived from shark and crocodile spleen. Crocodile peptides are considered to be 10 thousand times more potent than those obtained from a human, and Shark peptides can be up to one million times more potent. TCM is directed to increasing lymphocyte (white blood cell) population in tumor regions so the immune effect can be potentiated. The job of these peptides is to turn off those interleukins that are producing inflammation and at the same time stop the disease. In some cases, we will use a combination of shark, crocodile or blue scorpion. It is administered as an IV, followed by booster doses at home. Thalassotherapy Thalassotherapy at Sanoviv is a succession of pools filled with seawater, at different temperatures, to stimulate detoxification. Alternate between hot and cold plunges, this therapy stimulates the lymphatic flow, promotes detoxification through the skin, and provides a deep sense of well-being when resting between the sessions. [Learn more](/therapies/thalassotherapy/) Therapeutic Massage Transfer Factor (immunotherapy) Immunoactive Transfer Factor is an effective immune modulator peptide. These are very small molecules, found in all species, that help cells to communicate with and identify one another. Transfer Factors are polypeptides (44 amino acids). Because of their small size (less than 5kDa), they do not trigger allergic reactions. They work by modulating TH1-TH2 helper cells and cytokines, improving the body's ability to detect fungi, parasites, intracellular organisms, viruses, and cancer. Transfer factors also have the ability to suppress an over-reacting immune system. Learn more about [Transfer Factor](/therapies/transfer-factor/) therapies at Sanoviv. Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation Therapy Viral Therapies Vitamin C IV Vitamin C is an important antioxidant when obtained from a healthy diet, or taken as a nutritional supplement. But, given in high doses as an IV, it can have an oxidative effect designed to attack pathogens and may even weaken cancer cells. Vitamin C IV therapy is intended to produce many reactive oxygen species like peroxide, that can help restore balance in chronic infections and provide therapeutic support for cancer patients. Sanoviv uses pure non-corn sources of Vitamin C. Whole body hyperthermia Whole Body Hyperthermia Therapy refers to the medical use of heating the whole body to achieve an elevated core temperature for therapeutic purposes. It can be used a primary or complementary treatment for many conditions, including chronic infectious diseases such as Lyme, cancer, mold toxicity, etc. It can also be used to support and potentiate other types of therapies.
