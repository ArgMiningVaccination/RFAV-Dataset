That feeling could be caused by toxins in your body. You can feel the balance of toxins in your sweat and in the way your body generates energy. To feel fresh again, you may need to detox. What is a detox? Detox is a method of purging your body of unwanted toxins. Many people try detox diets or juice cleanses to eliminate toxins in their cells and digestive system for a cleaner, more energetic daily experience. While they can be helpful, it's possible to get the same detoxing effects without going through a dietary change. You might just need to sweat it out. Water and exercise (plus a few nuts and berries) are what your body already uses to cleanse itself, eliminating harmful toxins. With a few intense days of hydration, exercise, and selective nutrition, you can learn how to detox your body from toxins without completely altering your diet. Use these helpful detox tips to get you started. Let's dissect this in two pieces. Detox: a regimen or treatment intended to remove and eliminate toxins and impurities from the body Cleanse: a very restrictive short-term diet primarily intended to remove toxins from the body Bringing them both together, a detox cleanse is a short-term restrictive diet, limiting certain foods in an effort to remove toxins and impurities from the body. A detox cleanse can help reset your digestive system, helping it heal so it can absorb nutrients more efficiently. Simple enough, right? The number one tip for detoxifying your body of any kind of toxin is to drink water. Your body uses water to flush out toxins. It's pretty hard to [over-hydrate](https://www.mdriveformen.com/blogs/the-driven/is-drinking-a-gallon-of-water-per-day-too-much-not-enough-or-just-right), and your body will gladly start filtering all the residual toxins in your cells and liver directly into the urine. To help your body out, cut back on salty foods. Salt helps your body retain water and other things. Cutting back on salt consumption will help your cells let go of toxins they have been holding onto. With less salt in your system, your body will have an easier time cleansing itself. Combine sleep with water and let your body do what it does. Did you know that when you are in [deep sleep](https://www.mdriveformen.com/blogs/the-driven/12-ways-to-get-more-sleep), your entire body swells up and goes through a repair cycle? Part of this maintenance cycle is flushing all that water through your cells. The reason you may wake up urgently to use the bathroom is that your body has accelerated the toxins-to-urine process. Drink another glass of water and go back to sleep. Enough sleep with plenty of hydration can help accelerate your body's natural detox process. One of the best ways to help detox your body is to exercise\u2014hard. Cardio, weight training, gymnastics, HIIT (high-intensity interval training) and anything else that causes you to sweat is a plus because several toxins are excreted through your sweat. When you're hydrated and sweating, you can get rid of harmful toxins, just by exercising regularly. Make a habit of working up a sweat. You may feel a little sticky or oily at first, but after a while, the sweat feels thinner and evaporates more cleanly. This is called sweating clear and is a sign that you've cleared some toxins that were lingering below the skin. Let your stomach go empty except for water once a day. Always having something in your digestive system can contribute to buildup and blockage. Letting your system run on empty helps achieve one full water flush before a big meal. This is especially important since fat cells tend to hold toxins for a long time. It can be hard to flush some toxins until the fat cells are burned. Optimizing your day for fat burning can help cleanse very old toxins from your body that are suspended in lipid cells. It's not easy avoiding food for extended periods. This process is called intermittent fasting. We have a complete guide about [18:6 intermittent fasting](https://www.mdriveformen.com/blogs/the-driven/18-6-intermittent-fasting-schedule) if you are interested in reading further. That's why it may be easier to start your morning with just a couple of glasses of water. But if you want to train your body to run on empty, or are interested the potentially losing weight, I would definitely look into [intermittent fasting.](https://www.mdriveformen.com/blogs/the-driven/what-you-need-to-know-about-intermittent-fasting-and-how-it-works) Macronutrients, like carbs, fats, and protein, provide energy and the building blocks for maintenance. But to detox your body, you need micronutrients\u2014especially antioxidants and fiber. What are micronutrients? Micronutrients are the vitamins and minerals that are crucial for removing toxins from your body. A detox diet is quiet simple. Mixed berries, nuts, and yogurt are the easiest ways to add a diversity of vitamins, minerals, pectins, natural fiber, and antioxidants to your diet. Simply put: focus on getting more micronutrients and less macronutrients. See below. mixed berries nuts yogurt processed protein and carbs frozen foods canned foods These processed, frozen or canned foods are high in macronutrients, chemical colors, salt, and preservatives that are more likely to increase your toxin balance than decrease it. Most detox cleanses last for 1-10 days, depending on the intensity and the diet that your specific cleanse follows. Keep in mind that detox's are not long-term solutions, and while they can also be great for short-term weight loss, if that is your goal you should instead focus on clean eating: avoiding processed and high-fat or sugary foods, replacing them with more whole foods like fruits and vegetables. There are various types of detoxes, each designed to target specific areas of the body or health concerns. Here are some common types of detoxes: Juice cleanse: This type of detox involves consuming only fresh fruit and vegetable juices for a set period of time. Water detox: This type of detox involves drinking only water for a set period of time. Some water detoxes may also include herbal teas or supplements. Raw food detox: This type of detox involves consuming only raw, unprocessed foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Sugar detox: This type of detox involves cutting out all sources of added sugars from your diet for a set period of time. Liver detox: This type of detox involves consuming foods and supplements that are believed to support liver function, such as beets, dandelion root, and milk thistle. Colon cleanse: This type of detox involves using supplements, enemas, or colonic irrigation to remove waste and toxins from the colon. Heavy metal detox: This type of detox involves consuming foods and supplements that are believed to bind to and remove heavy metals from the body, such as chlorella, cilantro, and zeolite. Skin detox: This type of detox involves using saunas, steam rooms, or dry brushing to remove toxins through the skin. A cleanse or detox program is designed to remove toxins from the body, which can accumulate over time due to exposure to environmental pollutants, poor dietary choices, and other lifestyle factors. Some of the toxins that can be targeted through a cleanse include heavy metals, such as lead, mercury, arsenic, and cadmium, which can be found in contaminated water, cigarettes, and food sources including fish, rice and bone broth. Additionally, a cleanse can help to remove chemicals and pesticides from the body, which can be found in conventionally grown produce and other food products. A cleanse can also help to support the body's natural detoxification pathways, including the liver and colon, which can help to improve overall health and wellness. Detoxing your body doesn't have to mean a crazy diet or daily ritual. Just give your body what it needs to clear toxins naturally. Get enough water and sleep, exercise regularly, avoid processed foods, and improve your diet by adding a Mdrive supplement.

Personally, I believe in making everyday healthy eating choices that if done consistently keep your body healthy over the long term. Detoxes or cleanses don't necessarily fit in that category. However, some of the activities recommended during your \"detox\" will generally contribute to a healthier lifestyle; for example working out, staying hydrated, limiting processed foods, and consuming more micronutrients. I'm a huge fan, but if you decide to take on any cleanse or detox, I would recommend you first consult with a professional dietitian or your doctor. So, what's the best detox for men? Working out, getting sweaty, eating healthy and staying driven! Potentially. There are a limited amount of studies and research, and no long term research. So in short, a detox cleanse could help lose weight short term but the weight lost could potentially come right back. If you're interested in weight loss more than eliminating toxins, read our [posts about nutrition.](https://www.mdriveformen.com/blogs/the-driven/tagged/nutrition) Generally speaking, the health benefits seen from detoxing are likely not from \"being on a detox diet\" but rather the [other activities](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26026145/) that coincide with the temporary diet. For example: exercising and sweating regularly increasing water intake eating whole foods avoiding processed foods drinking more green tea There is no scientific evidence that supports the idea that the body needs to undergo a specific detoxification program. However, the body does have natural detoxification processes in place to eliminate harmful substances, such as toxins, that may accumulate over time. Potential signs your body may be under stress: Chronic fatigue or low energy levels Unexplained headaches or migraines Digestive issues, such as bloating, gas, or constipation Skin issues, such as acne or eczema Brain fog or difficulty concentrating Joint pain or muscle aches Insomnia or difficulty sleeping Increased sensitivity to environmental toxins, such as fragrances or chemicals Bad breath or body odor If you do decide to attempt a detox, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new detoxification program.
