Dieting fads are in the public eye more than ever, thanks to their ubiquity on social media and popularity among celebrities. Many of these popular diets, like [Whole30](https://www.insider.com/what-is-whole-30-2017-1) and [the 80/20 diet](http://www.health.com/nutrition/80-20-rule), include some version of restrictive eating and are known as \"clean\" diets. They are touted by celebrities like Kardashians, and [Instagram fitness stars](https://www.insider.com/the-dark-side-of-instagram-fitness-culture-2017-6). \"Clean\" diets have become especially popular among young women, with a recent UK survey f [inding that four in ten young people](https://www.insider.com/clean-eating-diet-could-cause-osteoporosis-2017-4) ages 18 to 24 have tried clean eating. Taking a break from processed foods, alcohol, sugar, and other food \"evils\" may sound like a great idea, but it's a slippery slope into territory that experts say could damage your mental health and/or become the catalyst for an eating disorder. We spoke with nutritionists and eating disorder experts about the close correlation between restrictive diets that sometimes cut out entire food groups and orthorexia: a new classification of eating disorder that combines the fear of gaining weight with an unrelenting obsession with eating healthy foods. \"Clean\" diets generally prohibit processed foods, refined sugars, gluten, and/or dairy. Unlike most dieting trends, there is no one specific way to [define clean eating.](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-blog/clean-eating/bgp-20200665) However, its followers generally try to avoid processed foods and eat foods as close to their natural, organic state as possible. The diet can also restrict or prohibit consumption of alcohol, dairy, gluten, and sugar. Nutrients completely come from organic produce, lean proteins, legumes, and sometimes unrefined whole grains. There can be a dark side to \"clean\" diets when it comes to maintaining a healthy relationship with food. Restrictive diets like clean eating are usually almost impossible to keep up with in the long run. But the clean eating journey, however short, can come with associative feelings of guilt, fear, and a negative relationship with food. \"When new clients say they eat clean, I know that what they are doing is elevating certain types of food (e.g. organic, locally-sourced) as 'good' and 'clean' while demonizing all other food as 'bad,'\" Brittany Markides, dietitian and founder of the Choose Food nutrition counseling service, [told INSIDER](https://www.insider.com/celebrities-worst-eating-habits-diet-2017-7) [.](https://www.insider.com/celebrities-worst-eating-habits-diet-2017-7) \"In order to maintain clean eating, people start to avoid social situations where they are uncertain about the food [...] Because the thought that the foods they are craving are 'bad' is deeply ingrained, eating these foods causes guilt and shame.\" The National Osteoporosis Society [has warned that](https://www.insider.com/clean-eating-diet-could-cause-osteoporosis-2017-4) cutting all dairy products out of your diet could increase your risk of osteoporosis, and that dieters need to be careful to get their calcium and other important vitamins from other sources. Orthorexia can be a particular risk for dieters who become obsessive about clean eating. When it spirals out of control, clean eating can lead to a relatively new classification of eating disorder called orthorexia. The term was coined in 1996, and [the National Eating Disorder Association](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/orthorexia-nervosa) defines it as an \"unhealthy obsession\" or \"fixation on righteous eating\" associated with an \"iron-clad will to maintain\" that rigid diet. The diagnosis is relatively uncommon, but symptoms often overlap with anorexia and bulimia. Dr. Neeru Bakshi, medical director of the [Eating Recovery Center ](https://www.eatingrecoverycenter.com/)in Washington, said that orthorexia symptoms include an obsessive avoidance of artificial ingredients, GMOs, fat, sugar and salt; complaints of imagined food allergies; increased consumption of supplements; and a drastic reduction in the amount of acceptable foods a person will eat. Does this sound familiar? Orthorexia is clean eating dialed up to eleven. Jacquelyn Eckern, nutritionist and president of Eating Disorder Hope & Addiction Hope, notes that cutting out entire food groups \u2014 not just dairy \u2014 can be dangerous for your health because \"our bodies need these nutrients to function correctly.\" She explained that when you start restricting heavily, your body will often crave those foods which can lead to a cycle of restricting and bingeing \u2014 all signs of disordered eating. To be clear, clean eating is not synonymous with orthorexia. But it can be problematic, especially if you are genetically predisposed or have a family history of eating disorders, experts say. \"Not everyone who tries clean eating will develop an eating disorder,\" said Jennifer Lentzke, dietitian at the Rosewood Centers for Eating Disorders in Wickenburg, Arizona. \"They might improve their eating patterns and feel better overall, but won't have a problem with indulging sometimes. With people who are genetically predisposed to disordered eating, there's usually some underlying mental health issue: anxiety depression, etc. that is triggered by restrictive dieting. As a dietitian, I advise everyone to make healthy eating choices, but when it starts interfering with your life, then it's an issue.\" There are some healthy alternatives to restrictive dieting. Nutritionists say that clean eating is unsustainable at best and dangerous for your well-being at worst. So, what are some better alternatives? Lentzke advises four general guidelines for leading a healthy lifestyle: - Balance between healthy foods and indulgences; - Variety of food groups and nutrients; - Moderation: Don't eat a candy bar every single day, but neither should you shun candy for the rest of your life; - Freedom with food: do not bind yourself with extreme rules and restrictions.
