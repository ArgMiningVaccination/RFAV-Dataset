In 1912, it was renamed King Edward VII Medical School, in recognition of a gift of $120,000 from the King Edward VII Memorial Fund. Substantial academic expansion took place and the name was further changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine in 1921 to reflect its status as an academic institution of university status. In 1949,the college amalgamated with Raffles College to form the University of Malaya. This later became the University ofSingapore and in 1981 became the National University of Singapore. In 2005, when NUS celebrated its centennial anniversary, the Yong Loo Lin Trust made a transformational gift of $100 million dollars to the Medical School, which was similarly matched by the Government. The gift will provide funding to recruit and retain top faculty as well as to develop new infrastructure and state-of-the-art facilities to position the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine as the key driver in Singapore's Biomedical Science initiative. To reinforce its position as a Health Science academic campus, Singapore's first Bachelor of Science (Nursing) Programme was launched by the School in August 2006 through the establishment of the Alice Lee Centre for NursingStudies. The founding of the Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies was made possible through a $10 million donation from the Lee Foundation. The School established two additional centres to complement its active research programmes, the Centre for Health Services Research in collaboration with RAND-Health; and the Centre for Biomedical Ethics through a donation of $2.5 million dollars from the Chen Su Lan Trust. These two centres further cement the School's status as a Research Centre of Excellence. These initiatives will help ensure that the School's mission will continue to succeed for generations to come: to provide excellence in medical education for successive generations of healthcare practitioners, generate world-class researchaimed at changing the way medicine is practiced, and to provide healthcare of the highest quality to serve the people ofSingapore and the region. 0 items Save Printer-friendly version Send by email PDF version ABOUT US PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS CURRENT STUDENTS GRADUATED STUDENTS myEmail IVLE Library Map Careers Calendar NUS Website Faculty's Commitment 2001-2012 National University of Singapore.

A fundamental andcommonly known fact in education is that assessment drives student learning, and that well-designed assessmentinstruments will have a positive steering effect on student learning and learning outcomes. In the selection and design of assessment instruments it is critical, therefore, to adopt best practices which will ensure matching with the desired learning outcomes that will drive students learning in a positive way. Assessment strategies that will be implemented for the B.Sc. (Nursing) programme will: Be holistic and designed to test the cognitive, psychomotor and affective domains of learning. Test the various levels of learning (knows, knows how, performs, does) as described in the Miller's pyramid (Miller, 1990). Ensure the validity and reliability of test instruments used for both formative and summative assessments e.g.integrated, scenario-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and extended matching items (EMIs) which testhigher-order thinking skills will replace recall, rote-memory-based Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs). Include testing of clinical skills, log book record of clinical practice and case presentations at clinical conferences inits clinical assessment. Include multiple test instruments based on their utility with respect to the validity, reliability and practicality. Base pass/fail judgement on, whenever applicable, pre-determined criteria (i.e. criterion-based assessment).

Longitudinal Tracks There are several broad-based curricular components that are integrated with biomedical sciences and clinical teaching,running through various Phases of the undergraduate medical course: Health Ethics, Law and Professionalism The Health Ethics, Law and Professionalism (HELP) longitudinal track aims to develop ethical sensitivity, theoreticalunderstanding, reflective and critical skills, and professional attitudes in medical undergraduates through all five years ofthe curriculum. It is student- and patient-centred; case-related, multidisciplinary and inter-professional; fully integrated intoall phases of the curriculum; and regularly assessed, both formatively and summatively. Information Literacy This longitudinal track aims to enable all students to gather and critically evaluate research information, effectivelyincorporate the selected information into their knowledge base and apply the knowledge in patient care, and also to laythe foundation for future training in carrying out high quality research. Medicine and Society This longitudinal track aims to expose students to the concepts of preventive healthcare at the population and individuallevel, with emphasis on the epidemiology of common communicable and non-communicable diseases, as well as onvulnerable groups. It also aims for students to gain an understanding of the influence and relevance of behavioural, social,cultural, environmental and economic factors that will assist in their promotion of health and management of illness as future doctors. Patient-based Programme and Clinical Skills Foundation Programme These two Programmes aim to give medical students an introduction to the Singapore healthcare system, the practice of medicine and the importance of the preclinical sciences. Students will be trained to become practitioners with skills inlistening and questioning, and who understand and reflect on patient-centred care. Examples of skills that the studentsare expected to achieve are the ability to conduct and manage an open interview; introduction to the physical examination; the ability to evaluate and reflect on their interviewing skills; and to understand another person from that person's point of view. These longitudinal tracks begin in Phase I (Year One) and will run through to the end of Phase II (Year Two) of thecurriculum.

A fundamental andcommonly known fact in education is that assessment drives student learning, and that well-designed assessmentinstruments will have a positive steering effect on student learning and learning outcomes. In the selection and design of assessment instruments it is critical, therefore, to adopt best practices which will ensure matching with the desired learning outcomes that will drive students learning in a positive way. Assessment strategies that will be implemented for the B.Sc. (Nursing) programme will: Be holistic and designed to test the cognitive, psychomotor and affective domains of learning. Test the various levels of learning (knows, knows how, performs, does) as described in the Miller's pyramid (Miller, 1990). Ensure the validity and reliability of test instruments used for both formative and summative assessments e.g.integrated, scenario-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and extended matching items (EMIs) which testhigher-order thinking skills will replace recall, rote-memory-based Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs). Include testing of clinical skills, log book record of clinical practice and case presentations at clinical conferences inits clinical assessment. Include multiple test instruments based on their utility with respect to the validity, reliability and practicality. Base pass/fail judgement on, whenever applicable, pre-determined criteria (i.e. criterion-based assessment).

Longitudinal TracksBachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.,B.S.) | NUS Registrar's Office http://www-test.nus.edu.sg/registrar/nusbulletin/yong-loo-lin-school-medicine/bachelor-medicine-and-bachelor-surgery-mbbs[5/7/2014 4:30:01 AM]There are several broad-based curricular components that are integrated with biomedical sciences and clinical teaching, running through various Phases of the undergraduate medical course: Health Ethics, Law and Professionalism The Health Ethics, Law and Professionalism (HELP) longitudinal track aims to develop ethical sensitivity, theoretical understanding, reflective and critical skills, and professional attitudes in medical undergraduates through all five years of the curriculum. It is student- and patient-centred; case-related, multidisciplinary and inter-professional; fully integrated into all phases of the curriculum; and regularly assessed, both formatively and summatively. Information Literacy This longitudinal track aims to enable all students to gather and critically evaluate research information, effectively incorporate the selected information into their knowledge base and apply the knowledge in patient care, and also to lay the foundation for future training in carrying out high quality research. Medicine and Society This longitudinal track aims to expose students to the concepts of preventive healthcare at the population and individual level, with emphasis on the epidemiology of common communicable and non-communicable diseases, as well as on vulnerable groups. It also aims for students to gain an understanding of the influence and relevance of behavioural, social, cultural, environmental and economic factors that will assist in their promotion of health and management of illness asfuture doctors. Patient-based Programme and Clinical Skills Foundation Programme These two Programmes aim to give medical students an introduction to the Singapore healthcare system, the practice ofmedicine and the importance of the preclinical sciences. Students will be trained to become practitioners with skills inlistening and questioning, and who understand and reflect on patient-centred care. Examples of skills that the studentsare expected to achieve are the ability to conduct and manage an open interview; introduction to the physical examination;the ability to evaluate and reflect on their interviewing skills; and to understand another person from that person's point ofview. These longitudinal tracks begin in Phase I (Year One) and will run through to the end of Phase II (Year Two) of thecurriculum.

A fundamental andcommonly known fact in education is that assessment drives student learning, and that well-designed assessmentinstruments will have a positive steering effect on student learning and learning outcomes. In the selection and design ofassessment instruments it is critical, therefore, to adopt best practices which will ensure matching with the desiredlearning outcomes that will drive students learning in a positive way. Assessment strategies that will be implemented for the B.Sc. (Nursing) programme will: Be holistic and designed to test the cognitive, psychomotor and affective domains of learning. Test the various levels of learning (knows, knows how, performs, does) as described in the Miller's pyramid (Miller, 1990). Ensure the validity and reliability of test instruments used for both formative and summative assessments e.g.integrated, scenario-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and extended matching items (EMIs) which testhigher-order thinking skills will replace recall, rote-memory-based Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs). Include testing of clinical skills, log book record of clinical practice and case presentations at clinical conferences inits clinical assessment. Include multiple test instruments based on their utility with respect to the validity, reliability and practicality. Base pass/fail judgement on, whenever applicable, pre-determined criteria (i.e. criterion-based assessment).
