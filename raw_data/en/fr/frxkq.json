OLD CLEAN UP REPORTS...........................3 SHORT -STAFFED? WE CAN HELP............................3 PRESIDENT CALLS FOR MASS VACCIN A- TION.....................................4 MORBIDITY REPORT................................4 O n December 16, 2002 GlaxoSmithKline a n- nounced the FDA approval of its pentavalent vaccine, Ped iarix. This new combination vaccine combines Diphtheria, Tetanus Toxoids, Acellualr Pertussis Absorbed, Hepatitis B (Recombinant) and Inactivated Poliovirus vaccines. Pediarix is a p- proved for administration at 2,4, and 6 months of age, and its use is expected to result in up to six fewer injections for infants. Pediarix was tested in studies of over 7,000 infants in both the United States and Europe (where a version of it has been in us e since 2000). Side effects of the new vaccine were the same as the side -effects to the three separate va c- cines, except that Pediarix produced slightly higher rates of fever in some of the children. The new vaccine is contraindicated in infants with known hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine including yeast, neomycin, and polymixin -B. In May of 1999 the ACIP published the fo llowing statement in the Morbidity & Morta lity Weekly Report (48(RR05);1 -115) as part of their discussion on combination vaccines: \"To minimize the number of injections children r e- ceive, parenteral combination vaccines should be used, if licensed and indicated for the patient's age, instead of their equiva lent component vaccines. \" At the time of that statement there were two co m- bination vaccines on the schedule, DTaP and MMR. Adding Pediarix to the list of available va c- cines offers patients the option of fewer shots for their child with the same level of protection. There will be some initial confusion as to how the new va c- cine combination will fit onto the schedule as cu r- rently published for children who have already r e- ceived vaccines as well as confusion and uncertainty when children are treated by multiple vaccine pr o- viders who use different products. These issues arise any time a multivalent vaccine is approved for use. Pediarix is not yet avai lable through the VFC program but is expected to become available in early Spring 2003. \u0088 FDA APPROVES NEW 5 -VALENT COMBINATION VACCINE Pediarix \u0089Protects infants with up to 6 fewer injections \u0089Saves time, effort and storage space \u0089May reduce infant pain and discomfort assoc i- ated with multiple inje c- tions O n November 7th, the New England Journal of Medicine published an article titled \"A popul a- tion-based Study of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccination and Autism\", which refutes the h ypothesis that the vaccination caused autism. The article is part of an established body of evidence that disproves a connection between vaccines and autism. It has been suggested that vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) is a cause of autism. Researchers conducted a retrospective cohort study of all children born in De n- mark from January 1991 through December 1998. The cohort was selected on the basis of data from the Danish Civil Registration S ystem, which assigns a unique identification number to every live-born infant and new resident in Denmark. MMR -vaccination statu s was obtained from the Danish National Board of Health. Information on the children's autism status was obtained from the Danish Psychiatric Central Regis ter, which contains information on all diagnoses received by patients in psychiatric hospitals and outpatient clinics in Denmark. They then obtained inform a- tion on potential confounders from the Danish Medical Birth Registry, the National Hospital Re g- istry, and Statistics Denmark. Of the 537,303 children in the cohort (representing 2,129,864 person -years), 440,655 (82.0 percent ) had received the MMR vaccine. 316 children were identified with a diagnosis of autistic disorder and 422 with a diagnosis of other autistic -spectrum disorders. After adjus t- (Continued on page 2) DANISH STUDY FINDS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN MMR AND AUTISM Page 2 (Continued from page 1) ment for potential confounders, the relative risk of autistic disorder in the group of vaccinated children, as compared with the unvaccinated group, was 0.92 (95 percent confidence inte r- val, 0.68 to 1.24), and the relative risk of another autistic - spectrum disorder was 0.83 (95 percent conf idence interval, 0.65 to 1.07). There was no association between the age at the time of vaccination, the time since vaccination, or the date of vaccination and the development of autistic disorder. Researchers concluded that this study provides strong evidence against the hypothesis that MMR vaccination causes autism.

The Connecticut D e- partment of Public Health has established a co n- tract with a private vendor (Bellco Corp.) who will be responsible for shipping vaccines directly to each provider. Providers w ill no longer need to pick up vaccines at their designated vaccine distribution site. The process for ordering vaccines will no t change. Vaccine orders should still be faxed by the first of each month to (860) 509 -8371. Also, providers will now be allot ted a two and a half month supply for their inventory. **If you have any questions regarding the new service, please contact e ither Tim Egan or Mick Bolduc at (860) 509 -7929. AAP DEVELOPS NEW \"REFUSAL TO VACCINAT E\" FORM Despite persistence of pediatric providers in communica t- ing the benefits of childhood vaccination to their patients parents, some parents still refuse to have their children vaccinated . Many times the provider against his/her own medical judgment will not give the vaccine and up until now there was no formal w ay to document this. The AAP has developed a form to insert in the child's chart when a pa r- ent refuses to vaccinate their child. By using this form it may: (1) induce a wavering parent to accept the providers recommend ations (2) help to reduce any potential liability should a vaccine -preventable disease occur in the un - immunized patient (3) hel p explain why vaccinations are missing when an assessment is being conducted. The form is NOT a legal document, and will not ex empt parents from their child's state school or day care requirements. The form can be found at www.aap.org and may be reproduc ed and/or tailored to suit the providers needs . DANBURY TAKES PRIDE I N AN 84% IMMUNIZATION RATE How do you raise immunization rates in an area with a high-risk population? Having one of the best immunization rates in the state takes a blend of the right ingredients. While every town is unique, Danbur y makes the most of what is available in their community to raise immunization rates. The size of the population is manageable for tracking and outreach. They are a one hospital town with a medical director who is very pro -active when it comes to childre n's health care needs. They have resources for the uninsured that include the Hanahoe Memorial Clinic and the Wellness On Wheel s van, both of which see children for free. According to Irene Litwak, IAP Coordinator for the Danbury area, p e- diatricians work well together and are very committed to immunizing children on time. What works in YOUR community? NEW THERMOMETERS ARE ON THEIR WAY TO YOU Through the Vaccines for Children Pr o- gram , the State Immunization Program has purchased new thermometers for every pediatric provider in CT who uses state vaccine. These graphic thermometers use a sophisticated tec h- nology that tracks temperatures round the clock with acute precision, so when you're not in the office you'll know if there was a fluctuation in temperature. The r- mometers will be delivered throughout the year by state and local immunization staff.

After evaluation of the software, a decision will be made by the end of February whi ch system CT will use to replace the old dos -based registry software. Goldenrod reports, which are a clean -up report of two y ear-olds will be run shortly. The report has been improved. The top sheet of the report will now have the child's name, D.O.B and the immunizations that are missing on that child. This should help our pediatric providers to f o- cus on specific children with specific vaccines missing without having to check every child's chart. When providers receive thi s report it is important to find any children who may appear late with immunizations and catch them up as soon as possible as it will affect the immunization rate for the practice. The next immunization rate report will be run on children born in 2000. T his report will be available to all pediatric providers in the summer.

This plan, often called Stage 1 or Phase 1, has set in motion, in Co n- necticut, a process whereby approximately 4,000 people will be vaccinated. The last \"case\" of smallpox in the United States o c- curred in 1949. The last \"case\" of smallpox in the world o c- curred in 1977. At that time, the only remaining smallpox virus existed in two places. Specimens remained at the Ce n- ters for Disease Control, and in the former Soviet Republic. With the break up of the former Soviet Republic in the 1990s, many scientists were out of work. In an effort to o b- tain money, it is has been speculated that some of those sc i- entists may have sold some of the virus to other countries. A number of countries have been mentioned as possible pu r- chasing agents for this virus. Any \"case\" of smallpox that o c- curred today, would be classified as a bioterrorist event, since \"wild\" smallpox has not occurred since 1977. The smallpox vacc ine was last routinely used in the U. S. in 1972. The program to vaccinate infants was disconti n- ued because the U.S. had not seen a case since 1949 and, the vaccine caused a number of \"unpleasant\" adverse reactions. Among th e more serious was 1 -2 deaths per million people vaccinated. It is a \"live\" vaccine. It was a single dose a d- ministered to infants over the age of 1. Routine \"revaccination\" or \"boosting\" was not done. It is not known how long this single dose provides protection. It is, however, speculated that anyone who received a vaccination, in the U. S. as a child, would nee d revaccination to assure protection. \"There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still.\" -Franklin D. Roosevelt "}
