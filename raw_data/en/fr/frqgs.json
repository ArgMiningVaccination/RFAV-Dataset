OS-1208-06 SCOPE OF PRACTICE AND LICENSURE DEFINITIONS Board Action: The Board agreed t hat this topic is complicated and needs to be discussed at the subcommittee level. The Board Chair expressed concern that licensure levels are difficult to discern , especially when one looks at licensing schemes around the country. A close examination of these schemes must Government of the District of Columbia Department of Health BOARD OF DIETETICS/NUTRITION 4 be taken to avoid adding confusion to what a \"Diet itian\" or a \"Nu tritionist\" means, she said. The Board Chair invited interested members of the public to assist in this effort by contact ing the Board and participat ing in subcommittee meetings t hat will help reshape and add clarity to the licensure landscape. Dr. B. Mich elle Harris of the University of the District of Columbia expressed interest and said that she hopes that the efforts to reshape licensing scheme do not disenfranchise or marginalize minority populations. OS-1208 -07 LGBTQ CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUI REMENT Board Action: The Board voted to fold the two (2) CEUs of LGBTQ training into the current thirty (30) -credit CEU requirement for every licensure renewal. However, the Board Chair cautioned that the Board should look closely at the number of availabl e courses to ensure that licensees are not forced to pick from a narrow group of course offerings set at exorbitant prices. The Executive Director agreed with this concern and promised to conduct a survey of courses available nationally. OS-1208 -08 CONTINUING EDUCATION AUDIT Board Action: The Board asked staff to post a notice on the website to notify licensees of the possibility of an audit following the November 2017 licensure renewal. Government of the District of Columbia Department of Health BOARD OF DIETETICS/NUTRITION 5 Dr. Harris of UDC asked whether a group who decides to conduc t research in a journal club, for example, would receive CE credit for \"research.\" The Executive Director said that something like this should probably be examined at on a case -by-case basis. The Board Chair said that she would be interested in receiving p ublic comments and looking further at this issue in the near future. OS-1208 -09 CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK (CBC) POLICY Board Action: The Board tabled this issue until the next meeting. The next meeting is scheduled for Thursday, March 9, 2017 . DC Board of Licensing Review Page 1 of 60 UTILIZATION OF COMPE TENT PARAPROFESSIONAL AUT HORITY POSITION(S) IN THE D ISTRCT OF COLUMBIA WIC PROGRAM PROPOSAL Presented to the District of Columbia Board of Dietetics and Nutrition March 9, 2017 Prepared by the DC Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) State Agency DC Board of Licensing Review Page 2 of 60 Table of Contents Background of the WIC Program ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ....................... 3 CPPA: Proposed Credentials and Basic Responsibilities 45 DC Board of Licensing Review Page 3 of 60 Background o f the WIC Program The Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) , established by Congress in 1975, is a public health program under the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The mission of the program is to safeguard the health of l ow-income women, infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutritional risk by providing health screening, nutrition education and counseling, nutritious foods to supplement diets, breastfeeding support, and referrals to health care. WIC serves pregnan t women, breastfeeding women, non -breastfeeding postpartum women (up to six months post partum), infants and children up to age five. Description of Purpose The District of Columbia (DC) WIC program proposes to utilize a Competent Paraprofessional Autho rity (CPPA), to perform initial health and dietary assessments, provide nutrition education on basic eating and healthy lifestyles, assign default food packages and make referrals to health and social services. This position would be under the direct supervision of a licensed nutrition professional. Determination of nutritional risk as part of the WIC certification process has become increasingly automated and rudimentary. Utilization of a CPPA to perform the routine health screening and assessments and provide basic nutrition education will enable the licensed nutrition professional, defined as a Competent Professional Authority (CPA) (see Credential, p. 5) , to better utili ze their training and skills to provide in -depth assessment and client -centered counseling to high -risk WIC participants requiring Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) . Examples of h igh-risk participants include pregnant women with medical and /or nutritional conditions such as gestational diabetes, history of low birth weight and multi -fetal pregnancies, breastfeeding women, infants that are small -for-gestational age or low birth weight, and children with inadequate growth or failure -to- thrive. With implement ation of this model, DC WIC will continue to employ licensed dietitians and nutritionists to serve these high -risk clients as well as seek Medicaid reimbursement for MNT when appropriate . Furthermore , participation in WIC is declining. While reasons for this decline in participation is multi -factorial, long wait times at clinic sites is one contributing factor. Utilization of paraprofessional staff to complete basic certifications will improve cli nic efficiency and patient flow, potenti ally increasing enrollment and participation rates. Current Staffing : Credentials and Basic Responsibilities DC WIC sites are currently staffed with the following position categories : A. Competent Professional Authority (CPA) [Code of Federal Regulatio ns 246.2; Nutrition Services Standards, U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service, August, 2013] o A physician or nutritionist (Master's or Bachelor's degree in Nutritional Sciences, Community Nutrition, Clinical Nutrition, Dietetics, Public Health Nutrition or Home Economics with emphasis in Nutrition), dietitian, registered nurse, physician's assistant certified by the National Committee on Certification of Physician's Assistants or certified by the State medical certifying DC Board of Licensing Review Page 4 of 60 authority, or Sta te or local medially trained health official). ( Note: State or local medically trained health officials includes paraprofessionals. ) o Has successfully completed a competency -based training program on performing the duties of a CPA. All CPAs are trained in Value Enhanced Nutrition Assessment (VENA) as recommended by the Food and Nutrition Service. o Has literacy and language skills appropriate to address the needs of diverse participants. o Is licensed in accordance with the District of Columbia Board of Dietetics and Nutrition a s administered through the Department of Health Regulation and Licensing Administration o Perform s nutrition assessments and client -centered counseling for al l identified nutritional risks o Supervise s technical staff B. Technician s and Administrative Assistants o Has a minimum of a high school degree or GED o Has literacy and language skills appropriate to address the needs of diverse participants. o Performs income and residency intake o Perform s anthropometric and biochemical measurements as part of the nutrition assessment process o Explains the WIC food package o Provides referrals to health and social services C. Nutrition Education Technician (NETs) o Has a minimum of a high school degree or GED o Has literacy and language skills appropriate to address the needs of diverse participants. o Perform s anthropometric and biochemical measurements as part of the nutrition assessment process o Conduct s individual and group education on basic nutrition and healthy lifestyle behaviors o Explains the WIC food package o Provides referrals to health and social services D. Breastfeeding Peer Couns elors o Has a minimum of a high school degree or GED o Has literacy and language skills appropriate to address the needs of diverse part icipants. o Has b reastfed an infant for at least six months o Is a f ormer or current WIC participant o Completed the USDA \"Loving Support for Breastfeeding: Grow and Glow\" competency -based curriculum o Promotes and advocates for breastfeeding o Counsels and supports breastfeeding mothers with routine breastfeeding issues and concerns CPPA: Proposed Credentials and Basic Responsibilities Competent Paraprofessional Authority (CPPA) o Has a m inimum of a high school degree or GED. BS or BA in Nutrition, L icensed Practical Nurse (LPN) , Dietetic Technician, Registered (DTR) and home economists with a general bachelor's degree are preferred. DC Board of Licensing Review Page 5 of 60 o Has completed a competency -based training program on performing the duties of a CPPA. The DC WIC training program incl udes education on basic nutrition principles; life -cycle nutrition specific to maternal and child nutrition and breastfeeding promotion and support; participant - centered counseling skills; and training on specific dietary risks within the CPPA scope of wor k, such as increasing iron -rich foods or tips to decrease consumption of sugar -sweetened beverages. o Perform s anthropometric and biochemical measurements as part of the nutrition assessment process o Performs health and nutritional screening o Conducts individual and group education on basic nutrition and healthy lifestyle behaviors o Assigns default food packages o Provides referrals to health and social services In summary, the Competent Paraprofessional Authorities (CPPAs) will differ from the current NE TS by performing the additional tasks of health and nutritional screening and assignment of default food packages. CPPAs will be directly supervised by a CPA that is a licensed nutrition professional. Description of WIC Nutrition Services [CFR246.5; 246.7 ] Certification is a process to determine if an applicant qualifies for participation in the WIC program. The certification process includes 1) verification of residency in the District of Columbia, 2) verification of income and 3) determination of nutritional risk. Determination of eligibility for residency and income is typically performed by a WIC Technician or Administrative Assistant. Nutritional Risk is determined by a multi -step assessment. Three major types of nutrition risk are recognized for WIC eligibility: 1) medically -based risks such as anemia, underweight, history of pregnancy complications, or poor pregnancy outcomes; 2) dietary risks, such as inappropriate nutrition/feeding practices or failure to meet the curren t Dietary Guidelines for Americans and 3) conditions that predispose persons to inadequate nutritional patterns or nutritionally related medical conditions, such as homelessness or migrancy. Risks are classified as High Risk or Low risk. (See Appendices A-C) Steps to determine nutritional risk include: A. Anthropometric and Biochemical Measurements Federal regulations mandate that at a minimum, nutritional risk assessment include a nthropometric (height, length and weight) measurements and biochemical measurements (Hgb finger prick) . Measurements are taken in the WIC clinic or recent measurements can also be provided to WIC by the participant's healthcare provider. WIC technicians and NETs are trained to perform these measurements. B. Health Screening A standard ized self-administered questionnaire is used to screen for health risks. The screening tool includes q uestions on health history , diagnosed health conditions , dietary and lifestyle behaviors . WIC technicians assist participants with filling out the questionnaire . A CPA then reviews the form with the participant and identifies medical, health, dietary and behavioral risks based on responses provided. DC Board of Licensing Review Page 6 of 60 C. Nutrition Education Federal regulations mandate that all WIC participants receive nutrition education at least quarterly. High risk participants must receive individual counseling by a CPA for all required nutrition contacts. Low risk participants may receive two of their n utrition education contacts via a group class, online or through a mobile app. Or WIC Technicians can provide Individual and group nutrition education for non-high risk participants. D. Food Package Prescription The WIC program provides specific food benefi ts to participants according to their participation category , such as infant, child, pregnant wom an, non -breastfeeding woman or breastfeeding woman . There are seven food packages authorized per federal regulations. Each food package is design ed to provide the Maximum Monthly Allowance or Full Nutrition Benefit (FNB) (see Glossary) for the category. The DC WIC Community Automated Reliable Electronic ( CARES ) system will automatically assign default food packages for a participant category. Defaul t food packages are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (7 CFR Part 246) for each participant category and must contain the types and amounts of food to guarantee the Maximum Monthly Allowance of the WIC food package. Federal regulations allow local WIC staff some flexibility and customization for individual tailoring of the food package by a CPA after a thorough assessment . However, s ome dietary substitutions also require prescription by a physician or other authorized healthcare provider. In th ese instances, a CPA is required to authorize the prescribed food package in the CARES system. Federal regulations allow a standardized substitution of yogurt and/or cheese for some of the authorized quantity of milk up to certain amounts (1 lb. of cheese for 3 quarts of milk or 1 quart of yogurt for 1 quart of milk). The DC CARES system is programmed to assign substitutions in the appropriate amounts. In the new staffing mode l, DC WIC proposes to allow a CPPA to assign yogurt and cheese substitutions for milk. E. Provision of Referrals State and local WIC agencies coordinate with services of other public and private programs to assist with meeting additional needs of participan ts to improve their health, nutrition and social needs, as well as provide a continuum of care to support women, infants and children. Currently, WIC Technicians , NETS and CPAs may provide referrals . Proposed Procedures Utilizing CPPAs A. Certification Under the new model, the CPPA will perform steps 1 -3 below . Currently, paraprofessional WIC Technicians and NETs perform Step 1 and assist with Step 2 . 1. Performs a nthropometric and biochemical measurements for Hemoglobin (H gb) levels. 2. Administration of a standardized questionnaire to screen for medical -based risks , dietary risks , or conditions that predispose to inadequate nutrition . 3. Assignment of risk codes. R isk codes are system -assigned by CARES based on entered information such as height and weigh t and hemoglobin levels or risks are identified through DC Board of Licensing Review Page 7 of 60 the screening tool and entered into CARES . Additional risk codes are assigned based on responses to the screening tool. Once the screening process is completed, the next steps of certification will be completed by either a CPPA or a CPA depending on the identified risk(s) of the participant . (See Appendices B -G) B. Nutrition Education A CPPA may provide education on basic nutrition and healthy lifestyle behavior to low risk participants (see Appendix F). This education is provided under direct supervision of a CPA. The DC WIC State agency provides scripts and lesson plans developed by a licensed nutritionist or dietitian for CPPA u se. Local agency staff must use curriculum approved by the DC WIC State agency nutrition coordinator for any group education classes. Examples of nutrition education provided by CPPAs include: Increasing iron -rich foods in the diet Oral health care How t o read a food label Healthy Snacking Smart Shopping A CPPA must document nutrition education contacts in the CARES system. Documentation will be monitored and evaluated by the supervising CPA. C. Food Package Assignment A CPPA can assign a default food package which may include non-exempt contract formulas that do not require a medical prescription in powder or concentrate form. CPPAs cannot assign a food package containing an exempt formula needing a medical prescription; cannot tailor a food pac kage beyond cheese and yogurt substitutions for milk; cannot prorate a food package; cannot prescribe a homeless food package or a breastfeeding infant package (See Appendix B ) D. Referrals The CPPA may provide WIC participants with referrals to local and in ternal health and social services. Referrals must be documented in the CARES system. Documentation will be monitored and evaluated by the supervising CPA. Training Competency -based training of CPPAs will be an essential component to ensure quality nutri tion services. Competency -based training focuses on the outcome and each learner's performance is evaluated by whether or not they can demonstrate the outcomes. Training will include the six competency areas for WIC nutrition assessment as described in \"VENA: A Guide to the Art and Science of WIC Nutrition Assessment.\" These six competency areas include: 1. Principles of life -cycle nutrition - Understands normal nutrition issues for pregnancy, lactation, the postpartum period, infancy, and early childhoo d. DC Board of Licensing Review Page 8 of 60 2. Nutrition assessment process - Understands the WIC nutrition assessment process including risk assignment and documentation. 3. Anthropometric and hematological data collection techniques - Understands the importance of using appropriate measurement techni ques to collect anthropometric and hematological data. 4. Communication - Knows how to develop rapport and foster open communication with participants and caretakers. 5. Multicultural awareness - Understands how sociocultural issues (race, ethnicity, religion, g roup affiliation, socioeconomic status and world view) affect nutrition and health practices and nutrition - related health problems. 6. Critical thinking - Knows how to synthesize and analyze data to draw appropriate conclusions. Continuing education is provided by both the Local agency and the State agency. Continuing education activities assure that personnel maintain and refine their skills and have opportunities to develop new ones.
