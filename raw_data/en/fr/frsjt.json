Pain in the tailbone area is called coccydynia in medical terms. The area in between your buttocks that lies above the anus is the site of the tailbone or coccyx. When this bone is inflamed, you experience pain and tenderness. When you sit, this pain gets aggravated ( [1](http://www.medicinenet.com/coccydynia/article.htm)). Causes Of Tailbone Pain Injuries are the most painful conditions that affect the lower back and tailbone. There are many ways you can contract this dreaded condition. Let's list a few below: - Falls are a common cause of tailbone injuries.

Why Does Your Tailbone Hurt During Pregnancy? The tailbone lies right behind the uterus. During pregnancy, the weight of the baby (and its bones) puts pressure on the tailbone, causing pain. Also, the hormones released during pregnancy help your pelvic muscle ligaments to relax. This, in turn, relaxes the bones and they can move around and cause pain. You may also experience tailbone pain after pregnancy. This is due to the pressure subjected on the tailbone joints during delivery. These joints can loosen up and cause tailbone pain, especially when you sit. Risk Factors For Tailbone Pain During Pregnancy Tailbone pain during early pregnancy or other stages of pregnancy, or even during delivery, poses the risk of bone dislocation, which can be extremely painful. Please consult your doctor if you are experiencing incessant tailbone pain. How Long Will It Take For My Tailbone To Heal? As this is a bone injury, it takes a while to heal. A simple bruise can take up to four weeks, but a fracture can take 8-12 weeks to heal. When Should You See Your Doctor?
