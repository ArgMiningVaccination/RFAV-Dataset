They bring glowing reports of the high peak of excellence achieved at many of these vineyards-their enthusiasm is rather like Balboa 's when first he gazed at the Pacific. There is little question that there are golden nuggets of great Cabernet Sauvignon , Zinlandel, Chardonnay and Johannisberg Riesling hidden in those California hills . But un\u00ad fortunately they are doled out by the handful and most are consumed only by the wine-proud, wine-loving Californians . Alas-up to now , New Yorkers were denied the privilege of obtaining these great American wines-wines that can hold their heads high even in the company of a Beychevelle , Gevry-Chambertin , Hacienda and Caymus , north ot San Francisco-but we hopefully expect to offer these in the Fall). The only negative aspect of this joyous message is that some vineyards are dispatching only minute quantities-so they must be rationed by the bottle, thus assuring their lair distribution and the greatest possible exposure to the wine-lovers of New York. NOW-FOR THE FIRST TIME-New Yorkers can share with San Franciscans the greatness of the grape as achieved on American soil. All of the best vineyards of California ar listed below (perhaps the only exceptions are Ml. Eden and Cha/one, WHILE IN SAN FRANCISCO , Michael and Sam also visited the city's leading wine shops and carefully examined their lists of California offerings . None were as complete-or as dedicated-to the best of that State as the outstanding collection that appears below. Choose among them-have a happy trip through the noble vineyards of California. Please order quickly because some of these may be sold out within a week . Compare them to the French wines that currently rest in your wine cellar (it will be fun doing this) , and-like Christopher Columbus-you will discover a new world-not of land , but of the grape.

STONY HILL -San Franciscans travel to Napa Valley annually to pick up their allocation of Stony Hill white wine. At long last, a few cases will soon be in New York. WHITE WHITE RIESLING 1975 LIMIT [October) [#1168) . . 2 hollies SUTTER HOME -is so named because the man who owned it was part of the family on whose land gold was discovered in 1849. It is now the property of the Trinchero family who have won valley fame for its Zinfandel which comes from Amador County in the Sierra foot\u00ad hills. Th e mountain air is reflected in this popular, lusty wine. RED ZINFANDEL WENTE started it all in 1881 in the Livermor e Valley.

WHITE DE BLANCS [Blend two years) [#1171). 3.29 PINOT BLANC 49.50 57.95 6 bottles LIMIT We are all accustomed to drinking the wines of Bordeaux, the Rhone, Burgundy, the Rhine ?nd_ Moselle, and California . Our investigation mdtcates that many of these will be going up for fairly obvious economic reasons, the pri\u00ad mary one being inflation that ranges from country to country anywhere from 6% to 12%. However, there are more ominous signs - drought in northern California; March-April frosts in Bordeaux; demand exceeding limited supply in Beaujolais, Burgundy, and the Rhone Valley. It does not take a crystal ball to pre\u00ad dict that our Pouilly-Fuisses and California Chardonnays will cost more within a few months. It is also happening in Germany. Where should one turn to get good wine at liveable cost? One answer is Italy. Two good things are happening-the quality of wine is getting better with each passing year because of strict regulation by the Italian governmen t -and also [for reasons that we do not under\u00ad stand too we ll since we are not economists), the cost of the good Italian wine at the vine \u00ad yard simply did not go up [we do not know how long this will last but it is certainly good news for this Spring and Summer). We are taking the wines of Italy seriously. Recently, we comparatively tasted 380 ex\u00ad amples in order to compile this list of wines we consider the best. Some of them will amaze you by their excellence; particularly the Spanna, better Chiantis, Barolo, Carema, Gat\u00ad tinara, and Brunello. For simple everyday drinking , we are content with fruity young Valpolicella for the red and the dry, crisp Soave for the white. This summer, join us in a Fiesta of Italian wines. ITALIAN RED WINES Bottle Lambrusco grape, just west of Bologna. It is always extremely fruity and sweet with a special intense bouquet.

Perhaps the greatest cac he of Grand Cru 1971 red Burgundies has been resting in the cool, impressive cellars of Bernard Grive\u00ad let. Thanks to Grivelet's interest in the Ameri\u00ad can market and his spirit of generosity, a few cases each of his noblest 1971 red Burgundies have reached us. We offer them below on a first-come , first-served basis. Bottle Case CHAMBOLLE-MUSIGNY 7.69 87.70 Some of the most charming, vibrant, and fra\u00ad grant of all red Burgundies are produced in the 420 acre village of Chambolle-Musigny.

Th ere is no better vineyard in the land surrounding this picturesque little city than 'Cent Vignes.' Balance and grace when Frank Schoonmaker and Sam Aaron were vineyard\u00ad hopping, it was the good Moillard family who put them up and fed them. They are not only noted for their generous spirit but also for the superb quality of their wine. This 1971 will prove it. Burgundy was estab\u00ad lished by Cistercian monks in the 12th century. The production averages 10,000 cases and the Grivelet production is among the best becaus e it comes from some of the good as Chambo lle-Musigny is, when you select a Grand Cru vineyar d within the vil\u00ad lage's confines suc h as 'Les Charmes,' VOSNE-ROMANEE ........... 9.79 111.60 We told you how indebted we were to the Moillard family when we discussed Gevrey Chamberlin.

It s easy-to\u00ad pronounce name has made it popular in th e English-speakin g world. The trick is to get one of the better vineyards to experience what true Pommard can be. There is no vineyard other than 'Rugiens' to compete with the stature of Epenots. C los de Beze is 37 acres. Either is entitled to call itself 'Cham\u00ad berlin' but only Clos de Beze has the right to add the suffix Clos de Beze. At least Chamber\u00ad tin's equal but often better. Bernard Grive let.
