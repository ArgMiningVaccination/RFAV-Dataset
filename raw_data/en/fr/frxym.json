MollyPosted a year ago on BookRetreats I've just completed my 200hourYTTC here at Samyama and it was one of the best decisions I've made in my entire life. Where to even begin? I have been enriched to the deepest level of my being and it is with great pleasure that I offer my recommendation to any potential student or client of Samyama. I stayed in the villa (mezzanine floor) and I was so excited to stay in such a beautifully crafted space. It is so open and spacious and the river beside the villa is a welcomed lullaby. The facilities are beyond and it really feels like a private jungle abode. In true Balinese craftsmanship style, the architecture of the villa is alluring and minimalist, so if you are a light sleeper I would suggest sleeping on the mezzanine floor as one must practice light mindful footsteps above the private rooms. Nyoman is the resident goddess of the villa and she keeps the space full of love and light and bright flowers on a daily basis. She even keeps an eye on your washing if the clouds open and she is simply divine. Fragrant offerings fill the air as she glides seamlessly around the property fulfilling her devotional practice to the Gods. I adore her x The training itself is in an entire world of its own. I can say by completing this 200hour at Samyama you will be gifting yourself an offering like no other. I hesitate to use the word MUST - but you simply must. The way in which this course has been meaningfully and carefully curated is deliberate, powerful, and intelligent. A very intense course, the days are filled with meditation, yoga, lectures, exquisite food, more yoga, more lectures, more exquisite food, and rest. And so much more. The content is thorough yet the way in which our incredible teachers offer classes is dynamic and open. The teachers are intelligent spiritual powerhouses of succulence and strength and allow for focus and fluidity in every moment. They each bring a different flavor to the table and their combined skills, backgrounds, and transmission are synergetic, to say the least. This school prioritizes the deepest and truest essence of Yoga and meditation, delivering classical practices and philosophy. We simply cannot separate meditation from yoga or yoga from meditation so if you're looking for a quick fix course to get fit, look elsewhere (or perhaps, this is exactly what you need to discover the true messages of yoga). If you yearn for an authentic and traditional devotional experience in learning more about yourself through yoga and meditation, then look no further. Throughout the 28 days, we were continuously pushed and held and supported, and protected during every step both on and off the mat. Their deep passion for the true essence of Yoga is clear from day 1; this is their life's work, their calling, and their purpose in this world - no bullshit attached. This authenticity is felt from the content within the lectures to the genuine curiosity and love they showed to each and every one of us. Their combined experience and knowledge of Yoga left me in awe, humbled, connected, and hungry to further my own spiritual pathway with all my new shiny stunning tools and practices. I am in deep, eternal gratitude for Samyama. Thank you. Just do it. If you're on the fence, just do it! This place is a pure container of joy and love and power. The teachers are remarkable and hilarious and wonderful and so deeply kind that you will make lifelong connections. We laughed, we cried, we pushed, we sweat we transformed ourselves again and again and again. I will absolutely be completing my 300hour here as soon as I've processed this first wave. Tawny DavidsonPosted 3 years ago on BookRetreats I've learned more about yoga in the first day of this course than I have in all the classes I have attended! This is exactly what I was looking for, thanks :) Jon DemiglioPosted a year ago on BookRetreats Can't recommend the YTT at Samyama highly enough. The instructors were great and provided a life-changing, heart-opening experience. Looking forward to return for the 300hr YTT next year. LinaPosted 3 years ago on BookRetreats I love the lectures about the Yama's.
