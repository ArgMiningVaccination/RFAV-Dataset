This two stage qualitative study, using action research methodology and a cross sectional design, explored Traveller mens views as to why this might be , and what they and relevant agencies should do. Structured interviews co -designed by Traveller Advisors elicited qualitative and quantitative data. Findings were presented to two focus groups internal and external to the health sector, and recommendations made on healt h improvement. A literature review covers worldwide ine qualities in mens health which deepen for indigenous and nomadic men. Studies only rarely engage Traveller men in health research. Information was covered on demography: accommodation, age, education , unemployment, and experience of trades; lifestyle : exercise, nutrition, cholesterol, bl ood pressure, drugs and alcohol, smoking and protection against hazardous substances ; mental health: discrimination, impact of culture on health, stress and domestic v iolence; mortality: causes including suicide and access to services: primary care and belief in people with cures, health information , sources and rating and groups that would interest men. (x) This information highlighted the complexity of the problem and that no single reason existed for dying 15 years early , but many interrelated factors requiring multi -faceted solutions. The research concurs with Richardson & Carroll (2008) that the mens health movement is comparatively modern and approaches which comb ine health promotion/ prevention with holistic health and a social determinants/ community development approach are best practice. However action is also required to tackle racism and discrimination including a refreshed Racial Equality Strategy and a cult ural shift in attitudes by the general population. A robust community/ voluntary/ statutory sector partnership infrastructure critically enabled implementation of action research principles with the Traveller men and promoted high levels of engagement. (1) CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT (2) 1.1. Employment history and qualifications I qualified as a social worker in 1986. My e arly employment included community arts and youth and community work in the voluntary sector, and adolescent social work and community work in legacy health trusts. As a community worker in the Craigavon and Banbridge Trust I completed Practice Teaching and Post Qualifying Awards in Social Work in 1996 and 19 97. I moved to a Community Development Manager post in the Newry and Mourne Trust in 2001. The Promoting Well Being Department (PWBD) in the Southern Health and Social Care Trust (SHSCT) was established following the merger of four legacy Trusts and brough t Health Promotion resources at area and locality levels together with Community Development Teams from legacy Trusts. Since 2008 I have worked as a Promoting Wellbeing Manager (PWBM) in the SHSCT. In 2011 I obtained a Postgraduate Diploma in HSC Managemen t. The SHSCT Promoting Well Being Strategy (2010) outlines a number of key settings, priority groups, (including Black and Minority Ethnic [BME] groups), issues and approaches. Key approaches include personal and public involvement, community development and health improvement. 1.2. Professional interest My p rofessional interest in this research stems from past experience as a Youth and Community Worker (1988 -1992) with Newry Travellers and my current role as the PWBD Black and (3) Minority Ethnic (BME) lead. I represent the Trust on partnerships with part or full focus on Travellers needs including the Southern Area Action with Travellers group (SAAT), Safe and Well (SAW) and Belong. I also manage a Traveller Family Support Worker. 1.3. Rationale The impetus f or this research came from the All Ireland Traveller Health Study (AITHS, 2010) . According to this study: - In 1987 the gap in life expectancy between Traveller men and settled men was 9.9 years (AITHS, 2010, p. 94); - A male Traveller now can expect to die 15.1 years before his general population counterpart aged 61.7 (AITHS, 2010, p. 95). These statistics represent a significant health inequalit y and provide the rationale for this study. 1.4. Aims and objectives Aims - To explore adult male Traveller health in the Southern Trust area through Traveller mens own viewpoint to inform the development of services aimed at improving their health and wellbeing . Objectives - To explore Traveller mens attitudes to findings in the All Ireland Traveller Health Study about inequalities in their (4) health and what actions they , and relevant agencies , need to take to improve their health status. - To identify responses from relevant co mmunity, voluntary, and statutory sector groups to Traveller mens expressed views on the factors that would make a difference to their health. - To conduct an international literature review on male nomadic health in order to explore cultural and service barriers to accessing services and identify models of best practice. - To fulfil requirements for the authors NI Leadership & Strategic Award under the Northern Ireland Post Qualifying Education and Training Framework in Social Work (Appendix 1) and for t he MSc Professional Development in Social Work of the University of Ulster. (5) CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW (6) 2.1. Introduction This literature review will begin with a definition of the term \"Travellers\" set within a legal and cultural context , followed b y definitions of key concepts. The study is then set within the wider context of generic mens health at European, Republic of Ireland and Southern Trust levels. Inequalities in health experi enced by indigenous / nomadic communities across the world including the Aboriginal and Tor res Straits Islanders , Canadian First Nation s and Mori communities are highlighted. Communities living within developed nations have been chosen to enable more suit able comparison. Inequalities faced by Gypsy, Traveller and Roma Communities in the UK and Ireland are noted , before concluding that although aspects of Traveller mens health are covered in the literature addressing health status and inequalities, racism, access to services, lifestyle, health promotion, ethnicity/ culture, mental health , equality and social determinants of health, studies focused exclusively on Trave ller mens health are rare. A strategy for gathering information was adopted as described below . First , computer and manual searches were undertaken, using online and catalogue resource , at the University of Ulster at Jordanstown. Searches were conducted using online databases including Medline, Proquest, Cinahl, Psychinfo, ASSIA and Ovid. Additional information was sourced from the Mens Health Forum websites in Ireland and Europe . Follow up searches to literature cited in Van Cleemput (2010) and in the AITHS (2010) were undertaken . Key words used to refine the search strat egy (7) included Travellers Health , Traveller mens health , Ethnology , Aboriginal mens health , Gyps y, Romany mens health , mens health , inequalities in health , social determinants of health with social work , health promotion and nursi ng added. The literature included books, journals, professional magazines and policy documents. The SMR tells us how much worse or better any particular g roup is compared to the general population. SMR = Observed Deaths divided by Expected Deaths x 100 . The Standard Mortality Ratio for Traveller men is 3.7 times that of the general population (AITHS, 2010, p. 90) . The AITHS estimates that - There is a population of 3,905 Travellers in Northern Ireland living in 1,562 families (AITHS, 2010, p.85). 43% of Northern Irish Travellers were living in the Southern Trust area in Newry, Armagh, Dungannon, Coalisland and Craigavon in March 2011 (SAAT, 2011 p. 11). There were 251 adult Traveller males in the SHSCT area in March 2012 (SAAT, 2012, advanced viewing - estimate for Dungannon unavailable). The age profile of the Traveller Community in Northern Ireland is markedly different from that of the general population as a comparison of Figure 1 and Figure 2 demonstrates. 75% of Travellers are under thi rty and only 1 % over sixty -five. The variation is particularly stark in older age group s. This reflects in part a higher birth rate, higher mortality rates and inward migratio n from the Republic of Ireland. (8) Figure 1 Population pyramid of Traveller community in Northern Ireland 2008 (courtesy o f Gossrau -Breen D 2010, PHA) Figure 2 Population pyramid of the general Northern Ireland population (courte sy of Gossrau -Breen D 2010, PHA (9) 2.1.1. Ethnicity The Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 recognises Irish Travellers as a racial group within the meaning of the law. It defines the Irish Traveller community as \"a community of people commonly so called who are identified (by themselves and others) as people with a shared history, culture and traditions, includi ng, historically, a nomadic way of life on the island of Ireland\" (Part 1, Article 5, 2a). For this reason many practitioners would concur with Van Cleemput (2010) who pleads that a capital T is used when writing the word Travellers , as they are a recogn ised ethnic group and should be afforded this respect. However the literature is replete with lower case references. 2.1.2. Culture In the 1960s and 1970s, Traveller culture came under scrutiny from policy makers and academics from anthropological, historical, and sociological backgrounds. According to Rozelle (2008) there is now a general consensus from this literature that Traveller s base their lives around their extended families and are a collectivist society, following a \"gemeinschaft\" community model rather than the individualistic, competitive \"geselleschaft\" one in which most contemporary Irish persons live. This means that Tra vellers do not define themselves by what they do for a living or where they live, but by their genealogies and the names of their relatives. (10) 2.1.3. Definitions of key terms and concepts Appendix 2 contains definitions of key terms including relevant agen cies and mens health and key concepts relevant to this research, including health inequality and inequity, social determinants of health, primary care, community development, asset based approaches, health promotion, racism, sectariani sm and discrimination. 2.2.0. Men's Health: General 2.2.1. Men's Health - Europe The State of Mens Health in Europe ( EC, 2011) highlights the range of mortality and morbidity data arising from different health conditions that affect European men, and d oes so through the perspective of mens lives. Patterns emerge that show marked differences betwe en the health of men and women in Europe (life expectancy for men is 76.1 as compared to 82.2 years for women) and at the same time large disparities in health outcomes between men in different countries , and within male populations in each Member State. The main message is that there is a high level of preventable premature morbidity and mortality in men, which will only be addressed by targeted activity acros s the lifespan. 2.2.2. The Republic of Ireland (ROI) In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the burden of ill -health experienced by men in Ireland (Richardson, 2004; McEvoy & Richardson, 2004). Male life expectancy is (11) almost 5 years lower than female life expectancy (CSO, 2006) and men in Ireland have higher death rates for most of the leading causes of death across the lifespan (CSO, 2003; CSO, 2005). The National Mens Health Policy (Richardson & Carroll, 2008) is an example of a nationa l gender proofed policy and builds on key principles through adopting approaches which consider: gender mainstreaming, social determinants (Courtenay, 2000), community development, health promotion/ prevention, intersectoral and interdepartmental work, tac kling mens health from a strengths perspective and supporting men to become more active agents and advocates for their own health. 2.2.3. Northern Ireland In 2006 -08 male life expectancy in Northern Ireland reached 76.4 years which represented a 0.8 year increase from 2001 -03. Female life expectancy also increased by 0.8 years to reach 81.3 years in 2006 -08 (Rodgers & Stewart, 2011) Cushnahan (2008) puts forward reasons for inequalities between men and women including: poorer use of health services (Insti tute of Cancer Research, 2009; Southern Investing for Health, 2007) ; a lack of political will to tackle mens health on the one hand , but problems with men not effectively campaigning for improvement on the other ; ineffective gender biased health promotion campaigns ; and lifestyle choices including smoking, drinking (Marques - Vidal et al, 2000) and taking illegal drugs. (12) 2.3.0. Indigenous/ nomadic men 2.3.1. Indigenous men - international Literature from indigenous communities provide useful comparisons for Travellers, as studies show comparable inequalities in life expectancy and levels of economic, social and educational disadvantage contributing to poor health outcomes. According to Adams (2011) Aboriginal and Torres Strait s Islander men have by far the worse health outcomes of any sub -population in Australia with a life expectancy of 56.3 (20.3 less than non - indigenous men). Adams presents evidence of Mori men living to 67.3, USA First Nations, 67.4 and C anada First Nations, 68.9 (Figure 3 ) although more recently Mori life expectancy has risen to 69 years (Cormac 2007). (13) In 1999 , New South Wales became the first Australian state or territory to adopt a mens health policy (NSW Health Department, 2000). Brown & Macdonald (2009, p.16) contend that - \"Despite the commitment to the social determinants of mens and boys health, there appears to be a growi ng emphasis on behaviourism: a men behaving badly Figure 3 Comparisons of life expectancy for Indigenous peoples in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States of America (courtesy of Adams 2011) (14) approach to mens health. Current government priorities of reducing smoking, unhealthy drinking and obesity risk overshadow ing the social determinants of health .\" In Canada First Nation men living on reserves die an average of 5 years younger than those living off reserve and 8.9 years younger than Canadian men in general (Frohlich et al, 2006). In a review of 254 citations on aboriginal populations in Canada, Young (2003) concluded researchers had not adequately examined several important health needs of the aboriginal population. The proportion of papers did not reflect the demographic composition of aboriginal people in Cana da. Robertson et al (2009) contend that although Canada is internationally renowned for its health promotion policies, mens health has remained neglected nationally and recommends the establi shment of a Mens Health Forum/ Network. 2.3.2. Research into Tra veller, Gypsy and Roma men Research on health outcomes indicates that Gypsies and Travellers have the worst physical health outcomes of any ethnic group in the UK (Parry et al, 2007). There are extremely high rates of morbidity associated with card iac problems, diabetes, asthma and arthritis, and high rates of hereditary conditions associated with intra comm unity marriage (Matthews, 2008). Although there are extensive studies of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller ( GRT) communities documented by V an Cleemput (2010) and in the AITHS (2010) , scant attention has been paid to the issue of mens health. (15) In a literature revi ew of 78 studies by V an Cleemput there are no studies cited which deal exclusively with GRT mens health. Of the 489 studies cited in the AITHS there are only limited references to GRT mens health, although aspects of mens health and wellbeing are covered under: health status :- (Barry et al, 1989; Ginnety, & 1996; (Fountain, 2006; V an Hout, 2009); health promotion: - (Smart et al, 2003) ; ethnicity / culture: - (Gmelch &Gmelch, 1976; (Kennedy et al, 2002; Treise & Shepperd, 2006; Walker, 2008); equality :- (Equality Authority, 2006; Equalities Review, 2007 Commission for Racial Equa lity, 2006); and social determinants literature (Farrell et al, 2008; Marmot et al, 2008; Wilkinson & Marmot, 2003). The DHSSPS (2008) recommended carrying out a needs assessment into Traveller mens health and providing culturally appropriate material on mens health due to a lack of information on their needs. There are some exceptions to the scant literature on Traveller mens health in the Republic of Ireland and United Kingdom. (16) ONeill et al, (2008) identified a number of barriers to Traveller men eng aging with health , including disconnection, fear of scrutiny, hierarchy and challenge of engagement, the need to be convinced, feeling left behind by Traveller women, machismo (The Mens Development Network, 2008), rigid paths to learning, previous experie nce of agencies, historical and economic suspicions. Clarke (2010) reviewed activities in a Traveller mens group in Spring Lane Halting Site, Cork. Issues ranged from horses, land and facilities, training and education in trades to mental health, depress ion and the impact of suicides. In relation to access to services, 63 per cent of Traveller attendees at a clinic in Ireland were women and 37 per cent were men (Clohessy - McGinley, 2002). Men generally find it harder to access health services and it is particularly common for Traveller men to be stoical about their health (Parry et al., 2004; Van Cleemput et al., 2007) . Van Hout (2009) found high incidences of Traveller men presenting with increasingly problematic alcohol use, because of dissipation of the ir culture and their experiences of marginalisation, discrimination, depr ession, illiteracy and poverty. 2.4. Racism and health According to Krieger (2000; 2003) research on racism as a determinant of poor health is a recent development . Krieger highlights three issues - the links between racism, biology and health ; methodological controversies on how to study the impact (17) of racism on health ; and debates over whether racism or class underlies racial and ethnic disparities in health. She argues race is a soci al rather than a biological category , with one group benefiting from dominating others. She describes direct and indirect methods to test the hypothesis does racism harm health? and questions validity and recall in investigations relying on self - report . 2.5. The All Ireland Traveller Health Study The All Ireland Traveller Health Study (AITHS, 2010) is the most comprehensive study of Travellers in Irish history and contains research activity from 2007 to 2010. Researchers employed a mix of quantitative an d qualitative methods to conduct seven sub - studies: census of Travellers ; quantitative study of health status and health service utilisation ; mortality study ; birth cohort study ; qualitative consultation ; service provider study ; and Travellers in instituti ons study. Of the estimated 10,618 Traveller families on the island of Ireland 8,492 were interviewed for the study (78% ROI and 93% N.I.). The study employed a social determinants model (Dahlgren and Whitehead, 1991) which acknowledges educational, cultural, engagement (Mackenbach et al, 2008) , and psycho -social issues (including the effects of discrimination [Krieger et al, 2005]) .It supports the contention of Marmot et al, 2008) that health policies overly dominated by disease -focused and reduction ist solutions at the level of the individual , without a wider appreciation of social determinants , are unlikely to be successful. (18) The most common causes of death included heart diseases and strokes (25%), cancer (19%), respiratory diseases (13%), and death s from external causes (e.g. accidents, poisonings, drug overdoses, suicides.) Male Travellers had a suicide rate which was 6.6 times that of men in the general population and accounted for 11% of all Traveller deaths (AITHS, 2010, p. 91 - 94). In NI 44.3% w ere diagnosed with high blood pressure and 36.8% with high cholesterol in the previous twelve months (AITHS, 2010, p.61). As regards the social determinants of health, research into the economic activities of Traveller culture identifies an emphasis on income generation rather than wage d employment. However with increasing regulation and enforcement in work areas associated with Travellers (e.g. recycling, waste disposal, horse trading) opportunities for self - employment have become more difficult to find ( AITHS, 2010, p14). Data from Connolly and Keenan (2002) cited in the AITHS (2010, p14) indicates that 59% of Travellers aged 16 -24 left school with no qualifications compared to 17% of the general NI population. 92% of Travellers had no GCSEs or higher qualifications. Literacy difficulties (reading and filling out forms ) was reported by 28.8% of ROI families and 35.3% of those in NI , but 95.5% of ROI and 89.8% of NI family respondents could calculate change from a Euro or Pound Sterling as relevant (AITH S, 2010, p.46). A majority of respondents (66.3% in ROI and 64.6% in NI) considered illicit drugs to be a problem in their community and this (19) was a consistent pattern for both men and women and across age groups. 53.9% of Traveller men in N.I. were smoker s (AITHS, 2010, p67). Four in ten Traveller respondents in ROI (40.3%) and 31.3% in NI reported eating fried food less than once per week, with just 11.8% in ROI and 12.9% in NI reporting daily consumption. Men were more likely to consume fried food freque ntly than women. 30.9% of Travellers said price was a factor that prevents them eating healthily (AITHS, 2010, pp. 71 -72). In ROI 41.0% had complete trust in health professionals treating them, compared to 34.6% in NI . Women reported more trust than men bu t there was no consistent age pattern. 83% of Travellers interviewed obtained their health information and advice from Primary Health Care for Travellers Projects (AITHS, 2010, p. 76). However a limitation of the AITHS was that of the 88 research co - ordin ators, 5 (6%) were male and of the 302 peer researchers, 6 (2%) were male, although the study did engage with males at pre - consultation stage and in the survey. 2.6. Summary Traveller mens life expectancy is 15.1 years less than the general population. Traveller health inequalities are reflected in nomadic and indigenous groups across the world. (20) Studies of Traveller mens health , which engage men in the research design , are rare with Traveller women historically taking the lead. Racism can have a detrim ental effect on health. The mens health movement is comparatively new and approaches which combine health promotion/ prevention with holistic health and a social determinants/ community development approach are considered best practice.

Action research This was primarily a qualitative study employing an action research methodology (Gilmore et al, 1986) . A cross sectional survey (Sarantakos, 2005) was used to gather data from the Traveller participants : \"Action research...aims to contribute both to the practical concerns of people in an immediate problematic situation and to further the goals of social science simultaneously. Accomplishing this twin goal requires the active collaboration of researcher and client, and thus it stresses the importance of co -learning\" (Gilmore et al, 1986, p.161). According to Dick B (1993) action research lends itself to use in work or community situations. Practitioners can use it as part of their normal activ ities. Mainstream research paradigms in some field situations can be more difficult to use. This is especially the case with a group which has been traditionally hard to reach and is suspicious of statutory authorities. Other researchers are using action r esearch methods to ensure that their research instigates a process of empowerment for Gypsy - Travellers and enlightenment for researchers and commissioners (Greenfields & Home, 2006; Brown et al, 2007; Lomax, 2008). Stage 13 Complete report Stage 14 Dissemination (24) 3.1.2. Mixed methods Structured Intervie ws designed by Traveller Advisors utilised open and closed questions to elicit qualitative and quantitative data to interrogate biomedical, lifestyle and social determinant factors in Traveller mens health. Creswell & Clarke (2007) describe this kind of a mixed method design as the \"Embedded Design\" in which one data set provides a supportive secondary role in a study based primarily on the other data type (Figure 5). Figure 5 The Embedded Design (Creswell and Piano Clarke (2007, p68) 3.1.3. Focus groups Flick et al (1991) advocate use of qualitative methodology when there is a need to study reality from the point of view of the subject and the standard of knowledge in the area of the research Qualitative Quantitative Interpretation based on qualitative results (25) subject is inadequate. Flick (1998) also advocates the use of focus groups to test group strategies in solving problems. Focus groups were held with key informants from 2 existing strategy groups; a multi -disciplinary Trust Traveller Action Group (n=6) and an Interagency Group comprising of representatives from health, housing, education, voluntary/ community sector and local government (Southern Area Action with Travellers, n=8). The purpose of these groups was to explore emerging themes in the primary resear ch and answer the question what can relevant agencies do? 3.2. Traveller Advisors To overcome mistrust, introductions to Traveller Advisors were obtained through Traveller Support Groups and personal contacts. According to Brown & Scullion (2010) involving members of the community who are the focus of the study helps ensure the questions being asked are appropriate, methods of consultation are unobtrusive, insight is gained into the cultural dos and donts, and contact is made with people who ar e suspicious of participating , hidden , or difficult to engage. The Advisors (8 male and 4 female, n=12) drawn from 5 areas, agreed the terms of reference and ensured that question s were culturally appropriate. They designed the structured interview and helped with access to men in each area using a \"key informants\" approach (Bloor & Wood, 2006) . Although in some studies trained peer researchers conduct research , considerations around confidentiality and time led this author not to pursue this route. (26) Advis ors were aware of the potential need to supplement the sample with additional recommendations from Traveller Support Groups , due to family dynamics. 3.3. Traveller Support Groups Traveller Support Groups are community groups which employ staff to assist Tr avellers with health, accommodation, education and community development issues. In the Southern Trust area there are groups in Craigavon, Armagh, Coalisland and Dungannon. There is a Traveller Family Support Worker in Newry. In this study another area wid e initiative Safe and Well , focusing on Traveller support, was included. 3.4. Design of structured interviews Key findings relevant to men from the AITHS were discussed with the first Traveller advisor, and questions developed. The structured interview was refined through five subsequent meetings . Considerations around sequencing of questions and analysis of the structured interview , as discussed on the Social Work Methods course , influenced the final version (Appe ndix 3). Prompts and probes were used to encourage participants responses (Sarantakos, 2005, p. 278). Although Sarantakos (2005, p. 290) lists disadvantages of face to face surveys compared to telephone or mail surveys (high inconvenience, unsuitability for sensit ive questions, and high cost ), this is outweighed by advantages (a high response rate, more (27) opportunity to probe, the ability to conduct a long survey with high complexity , and opportunity to overcome literacy issues ). 3.5. Validity and dependability Research rigour and validity are perhaps more difficult to establish in qualitative , typically using a small number of participants, rather than in quanti tative research (Bryman, 2004). However, over 8000 Travellers were surveyed in the AITHS which influenced the design of the structured interview in this study , contributing to its validity. Participatory research approaches have emerged from studies that involved working with oppressed or powerless people and groups in developing countries (Fals -Borda &Anishur Rahman, 1991; Hall, 1993). According to Brown et al, (2012, p.4), researchers interested in enhancing marginalised people s voices , and ensuring their research has validity , have increasingly opted to involve community members in the research process (Temple and Edwards, 2006; Jacobs, 2007; Lomax, 2008). Furthermore it has been argued that research , without the involvement of the community being researched , cannot be entirely valid (Temple & Steele, 2006). In this study validity has been increased by the participation of key informants (Traveller Advisors) in the compilation of all questions. To ensure validity of the qualitative data gathered from interviews (Sarantankos, 2005, p. 268) , an independent researcher analysed a sample of survey t ranscript data. Subsequently, she also (28) completed thematic analysis and compared her results with those of the primary researcher. In promoting dependability (Guba & Lincoln, 1994) complete and accessible records at all stages of the research process were kept to facilitate independent audit. 3.6. Focus groups with key informants from strategy meetings Results and preliminary reco mmendations were considered by two focus groups: a Trust Traveller Action group and Southern Area Action with Travellers (SAAT) , an interagency strategy group co-ordinating Traveller work in the Southern Area . The AITHS was already known to these groups . The aim of the focus groups was to consider appropriate responses to the research findings from Stage 1 and to answer the question - what can relevant agencies do? (See Appendix11 and 12). Consent was sought from focus group participants for attribution of their comments to their department/ agency/ group (Appendix 14). Findings w ere disseminated , using a D VD, to Travellers in partnership with Safe and Well and Traveller Support Groups , and to stakeholders in education, training, health, accommodation, councils and the community sector. 3.7. Sampling Structured interviews were conducted with 20 Traveller men using a combination of key informants (Bloor & Wood, 2006) and purposive sampling approaches (Sarantakos, 2005, p.164). (29) In a key informants approach research subjects in ethnographic studies have a disproportionate weight and role in the conduct and outcome of the research and are key in that they facilitate access through social networks . Without the help of Traveller Advisors the high response rate would have been harder to achieve , and the opp ortunity for real engagement and empowerment missed . Purposive sampling produced subjects relevant to the project i.e. Travellers from a range of families, accommodation types, ages and locations. Purposive sa mpling was also used to choose two strategic focus groups : an area wide SHSCT multi -disciplinary group implementing recommendations from the AITHS (n=6) and an area wide inter -agency group promoting Traveller health and wellbeing (SAAT, n=8). 3.8.0. Ethical approval 3.8.1. Guidelines/ principles/ ethical approval The research was conducted as advocated by Good clinical practice for investigators guidelines (ICH, 1996) issued by the Southern Trusts Research and Development Office. The researcher attended Trust training in relation to both this issue and the Application of Research Methods in Social Work . The Code of Practice for Research (2009) issued by the UK Research Integrity Office also informed practice. Following review by the University of Ulster Research Ethics Committee filtering syst em, ethical approval was sought and obtained via the Office of Research Ethics Committees Northern Ireland (ORECNI) and the Southern Trusts Research (30) Governance Committee. Permission to commence was subject to submission of amended documents (Appendices 15-17). Subsequent to the finding that 35% of the sample had problems with literacy , a substanti al amendment was submitted for the production of a DVD to disseminate research findings. This obtained ORECNI and Trust approval (Appendices 18-19). 3.8.2. Payment of expenses According to Brown & Scullion (2010, p.178) in their review of Gypsy - Traveller research ; \"It is becoming increasingly common for researchers to offer something to research participants to compensate for their participation\". Argum ents favouring this approach include valuing participants time, and affording a mark of respect to people experiencing financial deprivation. Reimbursement for participants and advisors meals were offered together with a thank you letter to acknowledge participants time (Appendices 9 and 10) . 3.8.3. Literacy/C ulture Traveller Adv isors eliminated any potential problems arising from culturally inappropriate questions . Literacy difficulties were overcome by the researcher manually recoding structured interview responses, when required (Appendix 3). (31) 3.8.4. Information needs arising from interview/ distress protocol Following an introductory letter read by the researcher (Appendix 4) or Traveller Support Worker (Appendix 5) an information pack (Appendix 6) was made available to Traveller participants . Backup copies of both were accessible through TSGs. The pack detailed support services should men feel upset or distressed by anything discussed during the interview. 3.8.5. Legal issues inc luding confidentiality and data management The research was carried out in compliance with the Data Protection Act (1998) and Freedom of information Act (2000). Confidentiality was addressed , as recommended by Babbie (1999) , by making data anonymous throug h allocation of a unique identifier and by changing dates, place names and recorded personal information that might lead to the eventual identification of the participants. Interview codes and participant identification were kept in separate locations. Personal data was stored in a locked filing cabinet. A secure master identification file was created that linked the identifier to names to permit the later correction of missing or incorrect information. A Participant Inform ation Sheet (Appendix 7) and Consent Form (Appendix 8) ensured that participants gave informed consent and were aware of the implications of taking part. Regarding unexpected disclosures , participants were informed both verbally and in writing (through the Participant Information (32) Sheet) regarding the limitations of confidentiality , should professional misconduct or child protection issues become evident. Written consent was gained prior to each interview. A consent form was presented to the Research Governa nce Committee as part of ethical approval. All participants were given a copy of their consent form . A written copy of their responses was available on request. Information will be destroyed after 5 years , in line with Trust data retention policies. Analy sis of data was on a secure encrypted, password - protected laptop to comply with the Data Protection Act (OPSI 1998). 3.9. Method of Analysis Responses from the interviews and focus groups were analysed using manual t hematic data analysis to produce qualitative information (Burnard , 1991 ). In stage 8 of the research, transcriptions from open questions in the structured interviews with 20 Traveller men were analysed using this method. This included reading and re -reading transcriptions to formulate, initially broad then refined headings. To aid validity an independent researcher repeated this process with 3 scripts. (Glaser & Strauss ,1967 ). With categories agreed , each script was coded against each heading and the categories or themes were collated and written up. (33) The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyse the data gathered from the remaining closed or Likert - style questions within the interview. A code book was prepared for all closed questions in advance of t he survey (Appendix 20). In Stages 10 -11 findings from this initial analysis were brought to two focus groups (N= 14) . The transcriptions of these meetings underwent further analysis in order to inform the final recommendations of the report. (34) CHAPTER 4 FINDINGS (35) In this chapter the findings from qualitative and quantitative analyses of the interviews are followed by focus group members response analysis . Additional cross cutting themes raised by the focus group members are then presented. Focus group members were provided with - - Printed s lides from a power -point presentation addressing an overview of the study aims, rationale and methodology , and summary responses to the structured interviews (Appendix 21 ) which they were invited to annotate - Templates for the 7 sections of the findings. E ach person was asked to complete the mortality section , due to its centrality to the research quest ion, plus one additional section. Group discussion in each of the focus groups (Trust Traveller Action Group, n=6 and Southern Area Action with Travellers, n=8) followed, which was taped and transcribed. Notes from the annotated power -point slides , response templates and group discussion were collected and subjected to thematic content analysis. (36) Section 1 Demographic profile This section will cover demographic profile including family, age, area, accommodation, employment, trades, and education . Figure 6 provides an overview, using themes derived from the structured interview responses . (37) Demographic profile Family Age Employment Area Accommodation Trades Education Figure 6 Thematic map of demographic profile (38) 4.1.1. Participating families Twenty Traveller men , from 6 family groups , were interviewed (Figure 7) .Two family groups were predominant with 8 participants (40%)1 from Family C and 5 (25%) from Family D . Figure 7 Profile of participating families 1 The researcher used this style of reporting results using a number followed by a percentage on advice from Professor Brian Taylor 0123456789Number Family Profile of participating families A B C D E F N=2 N=3 N=8 N=5 N=1 N=1 (39) 4.1.2. were based on the AITHS (2010, p86) with the lowest band being modified to 18 instead of 15 years to reflect the adult sample (Figure 8) . There was a good spread across the life span with the highest numb er in the 25 -39 age group; 7 (35%) followed by 6(30%) in the 40 -64 age group and 5 (25%) in the 18 -24 age - group. Two people were int erviewed in the 65 + age -group. Figure 8 Age profile Response from focus group members Seven respondents reacted to the slide on Traveller age with six focusing on their shortened life expectancy compared with settled people and one on how : \"Travellers see themselves older beyond time\". 012345678Number Age Band Age Profile 18 - 40-64 65 years+ N=5 N=7 N=6 N=2 (40) Comments included : \"A 15 year gap - needs to be addressed as a priority\". \"This is totally unacceptable and requires a new long term properly resourced initiative across the region\" . Another was surprised that 2 men in the study were over 65 years old. This was perceived as a: \"Higher % of 65+ than demographic norm of 65+ . 4.1.3. Area of R esidence Four were interviewed in Craigavon, Dun gannon and Armagh (Figure 9) . A decision was made to interview a fifth person from Newry when the opportunity arose to interview two men from an un -servi ced site in Newry, to improve representation in respect of accommodation type (see below). (41) Figure 9 Area of residence 4.1.4. Accommodation Response from Travellers 12 (60%) of the sample resided in NIHE accommodation; 5(25%) on a serviced site; 2(10%) on an un -serviced site) and 1 (5%) in a Housing Association house (see Figure 10). N=5 N=4 N=4 N=4 N=3 (42) Figure 10 Accommodation type Response from focus group members Seven members responded to the accommodation findings . Two made a direct link between accommodation and Traveller health and wellbeing: \"Travellers moving into houses have had no impact on health improvement\"; \"Housing facilities have impacted on culture and the feeling of Travellers feeling hemmed in\" Another suggested : \"Lifestyle programmes need to be tailored to the circumstances of housed Travellers recognising the negative impact housing has had on mental health\" . Two highlighted the impact of accommodation type on ability to make generalisations from this study : N=5 N=2 N=6 4.1.5. Employment Response from Travellers Overall 9 (45%) respondents indicated that they wo uld normally be self -employed (usually casual employment). 15 (75%) indicated that they are currently out of work; 2 (10%) are of retirement age and 3 (15%) are currently self - employed. No -one was working for an employer . Response from focus group members Eight respondents reacted to information about employment. Three commented on high levels of unemployment : \"Significant levels of unemployment vs. settled community\" Three noted the importance of self - employment in Traveller culture. One felt this was a direct result of discrimination : \"Travellers dont seem to be able to access employment in normal society at all - with a few exceptions they are treated as outcasts\" Another believed self - employment was a strong cultural value. One respondent noted that Extern and Southern Regional College are currently developing Pathways to E mployment for Traveller men. One person believed that Travellers felt that working for someone else was a sign of w eakness: (44) \"Will not identify this as Traveller men do not want to look silly in front of other Travellers\". Two considered the implications fo r training , employment and education . 4.1.6. Experience of trades Response from Travellers Figure 11 details the number of men with experience of various trades. The most frequently reported trades were scrap dealing 17 (85%), power -washing 16 (80%), market trading 14 (70%) and door to door sales 11 (55%) . No major differences in experience of trades across geographical areas were found . (45) Figure 11 Experience of trades Response from focus group members Focus group members com mented on the prevalence of manual labour ; the predominant trades ; the failing nature of the traditional trade s; and the barriers to training which included economic pressures, duration, entry requirements and perceived relevance : \"Prevalence of manual labour\" ; \"Scrap, power -washing, sales \"; \"Old trades failing \"; \"Not seeing the benefit of general education and training as they all still provide for their families and dont believe that (46) formal training will enhance that - rather it is s een as too time consuming\" ; \"The duration of courses was a barrier , the minimum requirements are too high (GSCE English and Maths)\" . Some focus group members suggested a change in mind set from Traveller men would be req uired 4.1.7. Father's trade Response from Travellers In response to the question: Did your father also do any of this work or did he do something different ? 18 (90%) said yes , commenting that their father worked on the same or similar trades as themselves: \" Much the same - scrap and power -washi ng\"; \"Same power -washing were tinsmiths , with one man stating \"Since Travellers moved into houses theres an issue with making noise - hammering. You can still buy tin, but there is no-one to keep the tradition going. Plastics also affected this\" . 4.1.8. Age of joining and leaving school Response from Travellers In relation to leaving school early 13(65%) respondents gave no answer . 4(20%) stated they joined and left school to engage in religious milestones ( sacraments of First Communion and Confirmation) as (47) school based preparation was their main reason for going to school, 1 (5%) completed school aged 16 , 1 (5%) never attended. 1 (5%) made the following comment: \"School will chase Travellers up who leave school early, but live in houses. They won't follow you up if you're in a trailer because you are not part of their culture\". Another commented: \"I didnt attend full time as I was moving around a lot\". I (5%) attended night -school to learn to read and write . Response from focus group members Ten respondents provided comments in relation to age of joining and leaving school. One person noted the importance for Travellers of accessing sacraments through school: \"To access sacraments of Holy Communion and Confirm ation\". Three commented on 75% having left school by 14 and one person said : \"None 16+ in education\". One person noted the disadvantage of leaving school early as it was: \"likely to lead to limited literacy and qualifications - linkages with unemploymen t/ sense of wellbeing\" . (48) Two suggested the need for a link with policy: \"Education; we need a new strategy with new ideas. Empowerment, confidence building etc. from early years\"; \"75% are out of school by age of 14 - why retention in post primary needs to be addressed - exemplars needed. \" Others referenced the work of the Taskforce on Travell er Education, highlighted economic pressures, the duration, entry requirements and perceived relevance of education as challenges . \"Not seeing the benefit of genera l education and training as they all still provide for their families and dont believe that formal training will enhance that - rather it is seen as too time consuming\" . She went on to note that : \"Traveller men are less interested in recreational courses and more interested in trades\" She suggested a change in mind set from Traveller men as a way forward : \"Travellers need to be able to see the tangible benefits of remaining in Further Education and Training\" She added that: \"Children should be encouraged and supported to remain in further education\" The issue of length of courses as a barrier was further elaborated: (49) \"Lack of understanding that it can take up to three years full time including work experience to qualify for a trade - an impossible time comm itment for Southern Regional College (SRC) courses - these requirements are not set by the SRC but by awarding bodies...The minimum requirements are too high (GSCE English and Maths)\" . 4.1.9. Qualifications attained Response from Travellers In response to a question on whether any exams had been passed, 1 person reported attaining 8 G CSES, NVQ 3 in joinery and computer qu alifications, 2 (10%) obtained Junior C erts, 1 (5%) obtained maths, science and sports qualifications and 1 reported grade C in first year exams . 9(45%) participants in Armagh and Newry reported no qualifications . Response from focus group members Three people noted that there were no qualifications reported in Newry or Armagh and three noted that one person had obtained 8 GCSEs. One person remarked on problem reporting on such a low sample : \"Difficulty in using percentages in qualitative research (nos. are so small)\" . (50) 4.1.10. Literacy by area and barriers Response from Travellers Figure 12 provides details on literacy levels by area. Newry had the lowest levels of l iteracy with 4 (80%) out of the 5 reporting they couldnt read and write. In Coalisland all 4 (100%) respondents were literate. 3(75%) out of 4 in Craigavon were literate and similarly 3(75%) in Dungannon sa id they could read and write with the fourth person saying he could \"a small bit\". Figure 12 Literacy by area of residence Of the 7 (35%) respondents with literacy problems all said they would like to read and write . Barriers to reading and writing included negative school experience and a perception that it was now too late to learn. (51) Response from focus group members Six respondents noted that 35% had literacy issues and two advised comparison with other disadvantage d groups. Another noted impact of illiteracy: \"Implications - means to engage in relevant issues\". Five reacted to the statement that one man would like to learn how to order on e -bay, seeing this as a culturally relevant opportunity to introduce computer training: \"Opportunity for education to use the computer as a hook to wider education\"; \"Influences of IT - logical for Travellers; Buying/selling important and reflects on culture\"; \"How to use e -bay- entrepreneurial spirit\" . Three reacted to the comment that it was too late to learn : \"At 43 years of age man felt it wasnt worth learning\" One person remarked on the mens learning style : \"Learning styles - activist/ pragmatic\" One person stated she : \"Tried to run various co urses and the level of literacy was a problem\" . Literacy was viewed by her as an essential skill : (52) \"Lack of literacy impacts on every course and its the course SRC have found the lowest uptake. They would prefer one - to one classes - however they are not cost effective\" . This respondent highlighted the CAWT (Co -operation and Working Together) Employment and Skills training as a model of success, but only for females : \"This was the first time a class of Travellers have gone to the SRC to take up IT and Lite racy and Maths -however the classes are all female\" . She suggested building numeracy and literacy into every training programme and training a : \"Traveller man to deliver training and pay him to deliver training to others\" . She also favoured men only group s with proper commitment and suggested : \"Travellers themselves need to engage when something has been set up . We have set these up several times for men and they didnt turn up which is why I would stress that this has to be a two -way approach\" (53) Section 2 Lifestyle This section covers fitness, blood pressure, cholesterol, diet, drugs and alcohol, smoking and protection against hazardous substances . Figure 13 provides an overview using a thematic map. (54) Figure 13 Thematic map of lifestyle Lifestyle Fitness Blood pressure Diet Drugs and alcohol Smoking Solutions to problem Educational Social factors Unemployment Paramilitaries Criminality Personal Addiction Barriers to stopping Personal Social Protection against hazardous substances: - Loss of nomadism Personal factors Control measures (55) 4.2.1. Fitness Response from Travellers When asked about fitness, 7 (35%) reported walking, of whom 2 also hunted , and 1 played golf. 7 (35%) said they dont keep fit : \"I dont - Id be interested in joining a gym, but I have arthritis in the lower spine and in left knee cap, sciatica, and I am blind in one eye\". 2 (10%) were interested in horses , 1 (5%) ran a half marathon, and 1 played handball in Cookstown but wanted a facility in Coalisland. 5 (25%) showed high levels of fitness and attended the gym : \"I am an All - Ireland Champion Boxer\" ; \"I am a member of the certified Training Academy and Leisure Centre \". Response from focus group members Seven respondents reacted to the finding on fitness. T wo commented on current activity and three made suggestions. Five reacted to the interest in handball. One queried the practicalities of handball in Coalisland : \"Is handball practical in Coalisland?\" Another spotted an opportunity to use it to incentivise a group : \"Use handball to retain a group\". (56) Others suggested further exploration of handball with the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) and local councils. One respondent reacted strongly to the finding on boxing , feeling that professionals and community groups were to o quick to offer boxing at the expense of other activities : \"Travellers are stereotyped and offered boxing - is domestic violence more of an issue in Travellers?\" He went on to suggest an alternative : \"Thinking about Traveller men as personal trainers for lifestyle coaching etc.\" One expressed surprise at the levels of walking : \"Wasnt expecting levels of walking\" . She went on to suggest a : \"Focus on walking development and its benefits for mental health\". This respondent felt that Travellers in the study showed a higher percentage of physical activity than the settled community and this demonstrated individuals taking responsibility for their own fitness . Fitness was viewed as a social norm . One person hig hlighted that duration of course and literacy were barriers to participation in a fitness course . (57) 4.2.2. Blood pressure, cholesterol and diet Response from Travellers In response to the question do you have high blood pressure and cholesterol ? 8 people (40%) reported high blood pressure and 7 (35%) high cholesterol. All respondents recognised healthy and unhealthy food s and could give examples of each. Response from focus group members 8 people reacted to the findings in relation to blood pressure and cholesterol. Reactions varied between : Prevalence : \"High prevalence: Awareness: \"Improving awareness\" Primary care implications : \"Means theyve been to have a test, usually age -related - opportunity for outreach service\"; \"Referred to Pharmacist and GP outreach initiatives\"; Others suggested: \"Need to take health checks to Travellers wherever they are\". (58) As regards diet, there was a mixed response from six members. One person highlighted the role Traveller women play in healthy living : \"The way to everymans heart condition is through his stomach - educate Traveller women in relation to healthy living\". Another person suggested including Cook It Programmes in the PWBD with young womens groups: \"Could have an impact on the type of food that they coo k for their families\" . There were conflicting views about healthy eating with two people commenting about good awareness of healthy and unhealthy food: \"Good awareness of healthy eating\" This contrasted have fries every day\" . Respo nses are perhaps best summed up by one respondent : \"Good awareness of right and wrong foods but unhealthy choices\" . (59) 4.2.3. Drugs and Alcohol Response from Travellers When p resented with 6 pictures of drugs , each respondent was asked if they could recognise a nd name the drug in the picture. Respondents were also asked if they knew anyone who had taken drugs , and whether the issue of drugs and alcohol had got better or worse within the last five years. 15 (75%) correctly identified cocaine ; 11 (55%) correctly identified cannabis; 13 (65%) correctly identified heroin; 11 (55%) correctly identified diazepam. By contrast, 14 (70%) either incorrectly identified mephedrone or didnt recognise it . 15 (75%) k new someone who had taken drugs. 15 (75 %) said issue of drugs and alcoho l had got worse in last 5 years . When Travellers were asked , how do you think this could be made better if its got worse? themes identified included: Control measures - including reduced availability of drugs, stiffer penalties and legalizing drugs Educational/ awareness measures - including awareness and counselling and use of media Personal action - including direct action and disassociation with drug dealers Underlying social factors - including unemployment, paramilitarie s, criminality and loss of nomadism Personal factors - such as addiction. (60) One person expressed how loss of nomad ism impacted on their drinking: \"Reason for drinking - I ended up badly depressed and drinking. When you are out and about you have your freedom moving from place to place - you're too much confined in a house \". Response from focus group members Recognition Five respondents commented on the high numbers of Travellers positively able to identify drugs : \"Overall findings were reinforcing the AITHS re high drug and alcohol issues. And initial reaction was shock at the high levels of Travellers able to positively identify drugs\" . It was noted however that the two people living in an un -serviced site had less awareness of drugs . How could the situatio n be made better? Five r espondents reacted to Traveller s answers to this question holistically by underlining or restating words like : availability, penalties, legalise, awareness, schools, counselling and media. One person felt the responses mirrored those of the wider community : \"Views on legal, educational, social personal factors mirror the views of the wider community\" , whilst another felt they were in line with official policy : (61) \"Sound - in line with official policy and the issues associated with use\" . 4.2.4. Smoking Response from Travellers Prevalence 60% (n=12) smoked . Age of first cigarette 5 (25%) respondents reported taking their first smoke aged 8 -12; 4 (20%) aged 13 -15 and 2 (10%) aged 18 -19. Smoking cessation Of the12 who smoked , 10 (83%) had tried giving it up and 2 (1) had not. 6(30%) said they would like to stop and 5(25%) wanted to know about services available . Asked whats stopping you smoking? Personal , social and medical t hemes were identified . Response from foc us group members Prevalence Three respondents commented on the early age five men took their first smoke : \"25% in 8 -12 category is frightening\" . Three commented on the high rate of prevalence in general : \"Prevalence x 2 of the settled community\" . (62) Gender One person felt there were gender differences : \"Traveller boys are allowed to smoke at any age whereas the girls have to wait until they are married\" . Smoking Cessation Service U ptake Two did not feel Travellers were accessing Trust services : \"Travellers are not making contact with services within the Trust\" . They queried motivation to stop and the need to consider targeting services . One person stated that Travellers had similar reasons for not stopping as settled people . 4.2.5. Protection against hazardous s ubstances Response from Travellers Figure 14 highlights the number of men who took protective action when dealing with hazardous substances. 10 (50%) reported experiences of working with burning plastic, 10 (50%) with paint fumes; 6 (30%) asbestos and 3 (15%) with copper wire. (63) Figure 14 Protection against hazardous substances 7 out of 10 wore masks when painting. 2 out of 10 took protective action when burning plasti c. 3 out of 6 either walked away, threw away or avoided asbestos , and 1 out of 3 took protective action whilst burning copper wire. One man reported : \"I keep my hands on my mouth and wear a mask in a caravan if cutting asbestos\" . Other comments included : \"I breathed in hypo chloride - also known as red label (farmers us e it and its used for cleaning the streets) - I wore a mask sometimes and sometimes I didnt.\" \"I wore old gloves for tinsmithing\" . Of 16 (80%) men power -washing , 7(35%) used protection which included wearing a mask and using goggles . (64) Response from focus group members There was a high response rate to this issue with 8 reactions, 6 suggestions and 2 comments on current activity. Reactions highlighted this as a gap : \"Risk w e normally dont address - how?\" \"Gap in protection because self -employed?\"; \"Costs too high for equipment\"; \"Not sufficient protection\". There were implications for awareness campaigns and training: \"Male health promotion - importance in the use of photos for campaign work\"; \"Need to do training for young men on hazardous substan ces\". One person from the Education Board stated : \"Some information available to wider community through a range of media publications\". He went on to suggest ways of tackling the issue through mapping existing information on hazardous substances and cons idering : \"production of c ulturally specific information\". He highlighted the K54 element of the curriculum at post primary within the Southern Education Library Board (SELB) which : (65) \"focuses on vocational opportunities for students/ schools to consider thi s issue\" He suggested influencing the Council for the Curriculum Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) : \"through revisions in wording in the curriculum - more focus on health and safety issues\". Another person from Wade Training highlighted opportunities through the Steps to Work option : \"for courses re hazardous substances and HGV license fee to be funded pending a job offer\" . She also noted that self- employment courses may include provision of personal and protective equipment , paid for by employers. The role of women in encouraging men to wear safety gear was raised : \"Women can encourage their men to wear safety gear. The Southern Regional Colleges upcoming course is very relevant and should be rolled over the area\" . The Southern Regional College highlig hted their accredited programme Working Safely as the beginning of a series of Traveller specific health and safety courses , to be provided on a time limited basis over the next two years. (66) Section 3 Mental health This section will cover the impact of culture on health, discrimination, domestic violence and stress. Figure 15 provides an overview of factors affecting mental health from thematic analysis including discrimination, stress , culture, access to services and domestic violence . (67) Figure 15 Thematic map: factors affecting mental health Culture Domestic violence Discrimination Stress Reason for pride in culture Reason for shame in culture Personal values and beliefs Traditions and culture Physical violence Verbal abuse Social exclusion Economic factors Mental h ealth Racism Sectarianism Living conditions Access to services (68) Summary and overview of Traveller responses Economic factors, personal values, beliefs and traditions were factors reported as contributing to pride in Traveller culture and positive mental health , whereas stress, domestic violence and discrimination were reasons for shame . (Travellers underst and shame to mean embarrassment). Discrimination arising from perceived sectarian or racist motives manifested itself in physical violence, social exclusion or verbal abuse. This was evident in both early life and recent experiences. 4.3.1. Culture Response fro m Travellers Q1'If you were to meet a stranger from America who knew nothing about Travellers how would you describe Traveller culture which makes you different from an Irish person? ' Thematic analysis identified 4 themes : 1. Personal values and beliefs 2. Social factors 3. Economic factors 4. Living conditions These themes and associated sub -headings are expanded below. (69) 1. Personal values and beliefs Separation from settled community \"We dont let our daughters go to discos or hang round locals - theyd pick up too many bad habits. We dont let them into house s - just stick to our own clan\"; \"Wed welcome the American but we wouldnt be taking them home\" . Family values \"Parents are stricter than country people - going smoking and drinking with girls before yo ure married. Theyd have more self -respect than country people. You wouldnt be allowed. When you come to a certain age you take on your own responsibilities - the opposite of country people\" . Marriage \"Marrying the one woman and being truly faithful\" . Equality \"Were a proud tradition as good as anyone. We dont have to rob people to be any good. There will come a time when there is no discrimination\" . Education \"Making sure the children are well educated - education is important in our culture and it wasnt always that way\" . . Identity Born into culture \"Im an Irish Traveller - I was born and raised in a caravan\" . Hiding identity \"I wouldnt describe a Traveller to an American if he di dnt know.\" Nomadism \"Buffers stay in the one spot - Travellers move from place to place\" . 2. Social Factors Traditions and culture \"Traditions and beliefs are a big issue - the fact theyre still holding on to their culture. Im proud of my culture. I cannot change it nor wouldnt change it\"; \"Different Travellers have different cultures\" . Dealing with conflict \"Travellers do a lot of fighting among each other\" . Discrimination - Jobs (71) \"One of the differences is I cant ge t a job except one in a hundred \". - Bars \"How you re treated getting into a bar\" . 3. Economic Factors Tinsmithing \"We made tin and sold it to farmers - tin pots, buckets, mugs etc. Travellers invented a penny tinker - a yoke with a clip and two washers at the side of a kettle\" . Horse -trading \"We have different ways of getting on - horse -dealing\" . 4. Living conditions \"How we lived in caravans - how tough they had it years ago. We lived up here when there was no running water or toilets. We brought creamery cans of water. My mother hand washed the clothes. We had a wooden hut with a range and a caravan to sleep in \". Q2 'What makes you proud of being a Traveller? ' Although answers contained similar themes to the question on defining Traveller culture , this question elicited aspects of culture promoting positive mental health. These were classified as : 1. Values and beliefs 2. Culture 3. Fighting discrimination (72) 1. Value and beliefs Family values \"Our family never do drugs or going around fighting and arguing\" ; \"My father makes me proud\" ; \"Some Travellers wouldnt let young girls out than 2. Culture Language \"We have our own language\" . Identity \"We didnt have to go take GCSEs - we know our own trades\" ; \"Its being part of that ethnic group\" . (73) Traditions \"Its the fact of having our own ways and traditions\" . Culture \"Although I was reared in a house...... I still kept the culture\" . Nomadism \"You can move where you want to be. If you dont like it you can move on\" . 3. Fighting discrimination \"We like doing our own thing. We dont like people telling us what to do. We dont like being discriminated against\" . Q3 'What kind of t hings makes you ashamed or feel bad about Travellers? ' Answers focused on aspects of discrimination in bars, schools and shops: \"Getting refused from pubs and clubs\" (15 comments) ; \"Refused from shops - getting followed round shops, being treated different for being a Traveller\" (5 co mments) ; \"Discrimination and hate crime and kids getting bullied\" (1 comment) . Sectarianism also arose: \"We helped Protestants build bonfires and paint flagstones...We still left because we knew that Protestants (74) didnt want the Catholics around during the 12th.... You werent just a Fenian; - you were a Gypsy Fenian (1 comment) . The negative impact of the m edia was raised : \"My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding\" - the caravan I have is all I need - for settled people to see fancy weddings, cars, glamour and I ask for 5 0 euros to wash a driveway theyd say what do you want 50 euro for? Youd be struggling to make ends meet.\" (1comment) . 'Do you think yo ur culture affects your health? ' Three themes from T raveller culture were identified as having an impact on health : 1. Racism 2. Access to services 3. Culture 1. Racism \"It does stress you out that they're judging you for no reason. It absolutely frustrates you - you feel what's the point talkin g if they're putting you down?; \"Being bullied causes depression and isolation \"; \"People looking at you coming into a bar - there'd be 20 there. All the people looking at you make you feel embarrasse d. We're not asking for nothing \"; (75) \"You haven't the same facilities as settled people. You haven't the same equal rights - you would have m ore pressure. A local man would get in and you wouldn't - you'd have a lot of worry\" . 2. Access to services Access to primary care and education were highlighted: \"Before St Christophers Park we had.... no doctors\" ; \"Travellers don't like going to doctors\" ; \"Youre more educated than you were 25 years ago. Now there are classes for learnin g - years ago there was nothing\". 3. Culture Physical activity and environmental aspects of the culture had an impact on health: \"Travellers are exercising all the time. As some Travellers do the hunting their healt h is good. They're also walking \"; \"Back years ago we were out in the rain camped out in caravans and tents, sleeping and eating rough. We never got fair play - the police had us round from place to place\" . 4.3.2. Discrimination Response from Travellers Early and recent discrimination were examined, whether incidents experienced were reported , and their outcomes. (76) 20(100%) experienced discrimination with 12(60%) experienc ing it before the age of 10 years . In total 3 9 incidences were described, 19 from early childhood and 20 which were more recent. 17(85%) did not report early discrimination and 15 (75%) did not report recent discrimination . As regards outcomes of discrimination when reported, one person pursued a successful court case concerning recent discrimination with the assistance of the Equality Commission , and two people described outcomes from early discrimination. Three types of discrimination in early childhood were described: 1. Verbal abuse 2. Exclusion/ social isolation 3. Physical violence 1. Verbal Abuse This included r acist name -calling such Other comments included : \"I dont like being called an itinerant which is a higher word than a dog\"; \"Vile comments about my family\". There was s ectarian name -calling : (77) \"We werent just Fenians - we were classed as Gypsy tinkers \" 2. Exclusion/ social isolation This was evident in school, at the shops and in leisure facilities : \"You are out -casted in primary class. The children wouldnt involve you in groups.\" \"I got put out of the shopping centre\" \"The football field beside us was denied to us\" . 3. Physical violence Physical violence varied from insults to physical aggression and included very severe incidents: \"Spitting\" ; \"They tried to bully you\" ; \"Burning clothes off line\" ; \"Thrown through window of school\" ; \"Burning house\" ; \"When we used to stand waiting for the bus the Protestants kicked the crap out of my four oldest brothers\" . Reporting early discrimination 17(85%) did not report early discrimination . (78) Two serious incidents of early discrimination were reported , resulting i n allocation of a new house and expulsion of offenders. One person who reported bei ng burnt out of his house said: \"My father would have had to report this. We got a different house with no electricity, n o windows, facing the graveyard \". Another person who was thrown through a school window stated: \"Yes, I reported it to the teacher . Five were expelled . One stared me in the eye and said \"don't tell on me\". Ever since that fellow looked after me because I didn't report him\" . Two incidents of school bull ying werent reported for fear of teacher and pupil reactions : \"No, I was a child at school. The Master gave you slaps too, so you couldn't report it to anyone\" ; \"No, pointless you'd be bullied again for reporting it after scho ol. He's a tout. \" Recent discrimination included social exclusion from bars 17 (75%) , shops 5(25%) , and leisure facilities 2(10%) : \"Barred and refused from pubs and restaurants for being a Traveller. Got told they had a bit of trouble with me and my mates the week before and it wa s my first time in the bar!\" ; \"Got followed around shopping centres by security - I felt very intimidated \"; \"We went to golf course in Dungannon to play a game of golf - five Travellers and six settled people. The following (79) week , five Travellers went out for golf and were refused entry three weeks in a row \". Reporting recent discrimination 15 (75%) did not report recent discrimination , despite experiencing it : \"No, a waste of time \". Those who did take action went to solicitor or court, the bar manager or took action themselves : \"No, we're more likely to floor somebody than report it\" . One person did take a successful case against a golf club: \"Took a case to the Equality Commission. They had to issue a public apology and offer compensation to each of the five of us . Told us we could play anytime. When we won - the course didn't refuse u s since \". Response from focus group members Overview One respondent provided an overview of the impact of social determinants on mental health : \"Clearly discrimination, poor health status, low education attainment, lack of government support, accommodation, access to services, income etc. will have a massive impact on Travellers experience of mental health\" . (80) Another set the issue within the wider NI context : \"How to place the wider context of discrimination that settled people will also have experienced due to conflict in N.I and additional impact on Travellers - level of risk very high\" . Culture There was a variety of reaction to information presented on Traveller culture. Two people saw potential educational value for settled people , especially regarding Traveller values : \"Something to make settled population to be aware of\"; \"Positive values to be supported and help othe r settled people to understand\". 5 others not ed positive values including self - respect, family values , cultural pride, integration and respect for Protestant culture and education : \"High values and family values\"; \"Pride in culture - aspiration for no discrimination\" \"Two things. There is a level of integration and respect for Protestant culture\" \"Education value noted in some localities - very valued\" . Another person picked up on the conflicting view expressed by a Traveller ab out GCSES: \"We know our own trades -dont see the value of education\" . (81) However one person reacted against the comment from a Traveller about not letting daughters go to discos or hang around locals : \"Control of children has an influence on their mental health - this goes down through generations\" . Another highlighted gender differences in attitude s to drinking : \"When women become mothers, they traditionally drink on special occasions, whereas it is acceptable for men to drink more freely\" . One person noted the impact of family values on education stating t hat they : \"had to ask Dads permission for daughters to take to take their courses involving intensive negotiations and providing guarantees relating to location of classes, nature of delivery, content of courses, tutor etc.\" . She added: \"Happy to do so i f it reassures parents and increases uptake of course\" . In relation to the slide on economic elements of Traveller culture , one person noted the impact on mental health of the decline of traditional trades and compared this with other disadvantaged communi ties: \"Historical trade/tradition now largely defunct - similarities with mental health on other communities e.g. East Belfast Shipyard Workers - decline of manufacturing\" . (82) This respondent went on to suggest that more Travellers should be employed by the Health Trust. In response to the Traveller who defined culture as \"fighting\" one respondent stated : \"How Travellers deal with conflict - violence and culture\" . As regards reactions to responses from Travellers about how culture affects health 6 respondents highlighted the effects of exclusion and bullying on mental health : \"Fundamental issues of exclusion can impact on health\"; \"Bullying lowers self - esteem\"; One person underlined a comment : \"All Traveller children bullied in school, made to feel differen t-being bullied causes stress and depression\" . Two noted issues in relation to accessing primary care : \"Mens health issue - dont like going to doctors\"; \"Travellers still facing barriers from front line staff - GPs may not be aware of staffs attitudes unless they contact GP through Traveller Support Worker/ Group\" . Four respondents noted down the observation from the researcher that the word \"ashamed\" meant \"embarrassed \"within Traveller culture. One respondent reacted to the Travellers comment concern ing hidden identity : (83) \"I wouldnt describe a Traveller to an American if he didnt know\" asking was this a form of protection against discrimination : \"?? Travellers hiding their identity for fear of discrimination\" . Another respondent gave an example of children trying to fit in with settled children by changing their accent : \"I am aware of Traveller children who speak like country people so as not to be recognised as Travellers\" . Racism Six members reacted to the complaint from the Traveller about the impact of TV programmes such as My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding on public perception of Travellers wealth . They viewed this as fuelling stereotypes and public ignorance of Travellers : \"Perpetuation of prejudice - inaccurate representation of Travellers\"; \"Medi a through Big Fat Gypsy Wedding has given a distorted view of the culture\"; \"Media - hurt and dilemma of mismatch - all of us to challenge negative stereotypes\" . Sectarianism Four respondents commented on the slide highlighting how one Traveller had helpe d Protestants build a bonfire but left before the 12th as he perceived himself to be viewed as a Gypsy Fenian , by noting public attitudes were both racist and sectarian : (84) \"Double whammy - sectarianism and racism\"; \"Both impacts - southern accent into No rthern area\"; \"Perceived threat and actual evidence - racism and sectarianism\" . Experience of discrimination Seven respondents reacted to the finding that 100% of the sample experienced discrimination. This finding evoked strong feelings from focus group members who noted the widespread prevalence of discrimination and its serious impact on mental health : \"Its such an everyday occurrence, most dont even recognise it anymore - it comes from all sources and never seems to have been addressed - legislation is clearly not enough\". Respondents from the Trusts Equality Unit and the Equality Commission N.I (ECNI) detailed a wide range of policy and practice initiatives and suggestions to reduce discrimination. The Equality Commission representative discussed the research with agency colleagues, culminating in a comprehensive response (Appendix 22). The Trusts Equality Department outlined training initiatives and resources for staff including Traveller cultural awareness training, \"E-learning on div ersity\", a Traveller awareness leaflet , and a multi -cultural handbook for frontline staff. (85) One respondent highlighted the potential under the Community Development Strategy for Health and Wellbeing (2012) for citizenship building and asset based approa ches as a way of counteracting discrimination and negativity . 14 respondents expressed concern about reports of childhood discrimination including the levels of harassment, the very early age of first experience of discrimination (including direct verbal discrimination), and its nature . Reporting discrimination Eight respondents commented on Travellers failure to report early or recent discrimination with one specifically querying whether the Traveller Education Task Force Action Plan address the issue of bullying through anti-racist school initiatives : \"Has this been picked u p in the Education Task Force?\" . Another person suggested the need for capacity building : \"Travellers need capacity development to enable them to feel confidence in making a complaint regarding discrimination\" . Another respondent expressed disappointment that Travellers do not report discrimination to the Equality Commission : \"Travellers are reporting discriminati on to Traveller Support Groups, Northern Ireland Housing Exec utive, or teachers but not to the E quality Commission \". (86) 4.3.3. Domestic violence Response from Travellers When asked if they thought that domestic violence was high amongst Travellers 12(60%) said yes, 7(45%) no , and 1(5%) dont know. On further questioning if they knew a man or woman who had suffered domestic violence 11 (55%) replied yes and 9(45%) no. Table 1 outlines mens knowledge on where to get help for domestic violence. There was a higher lack of knowledge of services in the Armagh and Dungannon areas than in Newry, Coalisland or Craigavon. Table 1 Knowledge of domestic violence services by area Area Question Reply Newry Craigavon Dungannon Coalisland Armagh Know where to get help for someone if they needed it? Yes No 4 1 3 1 1 3 3 0 3 3 (87) Response from focus group members Five respondents commented on the samples belief or actual knowledge of domestic violence levels : \"Significantly perceived to be higher than settled community - associations with mental health\"; \"Violence within the community seems to be an issue\"; \"Very high\" . In relation to findings about Travellers knowing where to access services related to domestic violence , one person stated in relation to the Armagh Travellers: \"At least knew where to get help\" . Another person reacted against what she perceived as oppression of Traveller women : \"Traveller women suppressed by men: not allowed to work, form groups etc .\" A third person sought reasons behind domestic violenc e and linked it to wider issues: \"Related to other pr essures that men have reported\". Another asked if Traveller women are more likely to have knowledge of domestic violence services than these male respondents . (88) 4.3.4. Stress Response from Travellers In response to a question how do you cope with stress? Traveller men reported a range of positive and negative coping strategies . Positive strategies included taking exercise, leaving the house, seeing the doctor, watching TV, seeking a friend, sleeping or working : \"Go for a game of football \": \"Get out of the house an d get over it - everyone worries \"; \"Go see a doctor \"; \"You come home in evening - let wife out and wa tch a video and then go to sleep \"; \"If someone hurts/excludes you go for a different friend\" ; \"Sleep it off - relax \"; \"Go get a bag of scrap \". Negative strategies included turning to drink, drugs or smoking, bottling it up or becoming depressed: \"Very bad - smoke... took a cocktail of drugs - odd joint.\" \"I wo uld bottle it up - tell my wife \". \"I would suffer from depression and I have a suicidal number on my phone. There are days I feel so depressed I say not another day - tablets only last for so long. Everything is stress\" (89) Response from focus group members Seven respondents reacted to findings about how Travellers coped with stress. There was a divergence of opinion with one person stating that Travellers employed a wide range of strategies and another felt limited coping strategies were used . A few comment ed on negative coping strategies , including the substance misuse and impact of bullying an d access to leisure facilities: \"Substance use/ misuse\"; \"Being bullied causes stress and depression\" . In relation to the exercise strategy, one person highlighted potential difficulties : \"Where there are services that Travellers can access\" . (90) Section 4 Mortality This section will cover Traveller mens perceptions of why they are dying earlier than the general male population , what they perceive as the main causes of death, and suicide. Figure 16 provides an overview of the reasons for early mortality as perceived by the men including ill-health, environment, lifestyle, menta l health and access to services. (91) Mortality Lifestyle Access to services Mental health Ill health Environment Cancer Stroke Heart disease Blood pressure Respiratory Suicide Accidents Drugs and alcohol Nutrition Smoking Exercise Discrimination Stress Living conditions Kidney infections Cholesterol Blood pressure Not taking medication Not seeing doctor in time Economic pressures Obesity Figure 16 Them atic map on causes of mortality (92) 4.4.1. Reasons for dying early Response from Travellers Respondents were asked for reasons why Traveller men were dying earlier than men in the general population . Answers focused on lifestyle, access to services, mental health , physical health and living conditions. Lifestyle Answers included drugs and alcohol, nutrition/ obesit y, smoking, exercise and sleep: \"Alcohol - drugs will ha ve an effect in next 12 years\"; \"An average Traveller man is eating too much salt and small portion of food, che ap brand of butter (hard block) \"; \"They p ut on a lot of weight over 40\"; \"Smoking\"; \"No exercise, no football, hurling, running - mostly driving a car/van and taking no exercise\"; \"Not sleeping right\" . Access to primary care services Answers focused on awareness of blood pressure, cholesterol, timely access t o doctors and taking medication: \"They don't have an awareness of blood pressure, cholesterol\" ; (93) \"Not seeing a doctor when you should \"; \"Not taking medication\" . Mental health Respondents highlighted discrimination, gender, stres s, economic pressure and suicide - \"Discrimination\"; \"Traveller men do not talk about their problems/they are not open about seeking help/think it is a macho thing. I went to a pub and they didn't serve me and the man was at school with me - very hurtful \"; \"Stress, hardship, providing for family\"; \"having no work would affect life expectancy\" ; \"There's a lot of Travelling men commit suicide\" . Physical health Respondents noted family history of cancer and hear t disease and kidney infections: \"They could have a family histo ry of cancer or heart disease\" ; \"Don't get kidney infections treated\" . Living conditions The impact of adverse environmental conditions was also highlighted: (94) \"Years ago all they had were wag ons - they were out in the cold\"; \"Hard life growing up \". 4.4.2. Main causes of death Response from Travellers When Travellers were asked what were the main causes of death within the last two years ?, answers covered chronic diseases, suicide, accidents, lifestyle, and non -attributable causes. In order of frequency cancer received the most comments (13) followed by strokes (7), mental health (including suicide) (5) and drugs/ alcohol (5), heart disease and blood pressure (3 each), non- attributable comments such as bad health or no particular reason (2) and respiratory infections or accidents (1 each). The issue of gender arose again in the context of mental health and suicide and emphasized that young mal e drivers are at risk of accidents: \"Men are afraid to speak out/ more ashamed to discuss their problems. Should be encouraged to take problems to a doctor/he listens. There's help there if people wants it. If you can get one man to come forw ard & get help you'll feel good \"; \"Suicide (it's d epression, everything builds up and they don't talk to anyone)\" ; (95) \"Car crashes - especi ally young fellow driving hard\". Response from focus group members As there is overlap in responses to the two questions Why do you think Traveller men are dying so youn g? and \"What do you think are the main causes of death amongst Traveller men in last two years? - responses will be grouped together under common themes. Figure 16 provides an overall framework for analysis. Mortality Seven respondents made general comment s about the widening gap in mortality, social and genetic determinants of health, loss of nomadism and impact of discrimination. One commented : \"Why has mortality got worse since last study (9:1 v 15:1) what has changed? Feedback says things are better Prevention and mental health promotion needs higher profile - support group potential\". One went on to highlight local and regional interagency initiatives which employ a social determinants perspective. Another noted impact of loss of nomadism : \"Traveller mortality has got worse because of the change to a more settled sedentary life\". Discrimin ation and depression were raised: (96) \"Discrimination, depression, mental and emotional wellbeing, racist attacks and attitudes at schools - we need to do more\" . He sugg ested: \"Action plans joined up with Travellers, awareness of support groups and help lines, better PR, Commissioning plans and Voluntary and Community Sector Fora\". The Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) was named as the prefer red lead. Another person expressed concern about how information on mortality is communicated to Travellers : \"The manner in which information re health is communicated to Travellers needs to be looked at\" . One highlighted a discrepan cy between knowledge an d action: \"Traveller men appear to know why but seem to ignore health facts\". Cancer screening and engaging men were suggested as ways forward: \"Cancer screening - all screening needs to be highlighted with the men and trust built up with them\". Lifestyle Five highlighted specific aspects of lifestyle including drugs and alcohol, smoking, exercise, diet, sleep pattern and unemployment. The Trusts Smoking Cessation Service and (97) Drugs and Alcohol Programmes were noted with a suggestion for Traveller male role models to be encouraged to come forward : \"Explore ways of encouraging Traveller male role models who come forward to seek help and influence others\" . One person acknowledged the work of the Promoting Wellbeing Department and asked if more could be done by other Programmes of Care: \"A lot is being done in the Promoting Wellbeing Department. How much is being done by other programmes of care?\" One respondent raised the importance of training for health promotion staff in Traveller cultural awareness : \"Need s taff trained in Traveller culture before delivering health promotion programmes\" . Mental health Seven commented on mental health issues including stress , gender , empowerment and employment: \"Traveller men their problems, stress and hardsh ip\"; \"Barriers - different approaches needed to empower group\" ; \"Have Travellers work in our health departments\". Access to primary care services Issues highlighted in relation to primary care included the need for more pharmacy programmes and the importance of literacy: (98) \"More pharmacy programmes for men\" : \"Taking wrong prescription\". 4.4.3. Suicide Response from Travellers Respondents were given a choice to answer a question on suicide with18 (90%) agreeing to answer it . 13 (65%) said their family had not been affected; 5 (25%) stated their family had been affected by suicide; 15 (75%) knew of other Travellers that have lost their life by suicide . 13 respondents (65%) did not know of suicide support groups . Two men descri bed personal experiences: \"I was drinking with a Belfast lad on Christmas Day and 3 weeks later I went to his funeral. Travellers wouldn't really go to things like that there\" ; \"I have suicidal thoughts - after Christmas I was bawling my eyes out I'd bad thoughts about it. I know of 3 chaps that hurt themselves\" . Response from focus group members Suicide evoked the largest response within this section with 13 comments. Four commented on the fact that 75% of respondents knew of a Travelle r who had lost his/her life by suicide : \"Quite high - big awareness\"; \"Suicide (6 times more likely)\" . (99) The majority highlighted issues about mens lack of knowledge of suicide support groups whilst also querying likely uptake if the knowledge was provided; gender differenc es; seasonal influences on suicide ; and the need for better promotion of services : \"Traveller women would be aware of PIPS - but men dont. Travellers do not understand the process of counselling from my experience\"; \"Would they uptake on support groups?\" \"Is Christmas linked to celebration/ drink?\" ; \"Better promotio n of services already on offer and sign posting \". (100) Section 5 Access to services This section covers access to and rating of primary care services. It also covers traditional beliefs, namely people with cures , and the reported outcome s. (101) 4.5.1. Access to Primary Care Response from Travellers In relation to Traveller mens access to their GP, Figure 17 shows that 13 (65%) had visited their GP within the last month, 18 (90%) had seen them in their GP surgery, 19 (95%) had made an appointment and 17 (85%) did not feel they were treated differently by staff and other patients , compared with the general population. Figure 17 Access to GP surgery 02468101214161820 Visited GP within last monthVisted them in GP surgeryMade an appointmentWere not treated differentlyWere put off goingAccess to GP surgery No. (102) One, who did fee l treated differently , commented: \"They came up with excuses - you were seen as only temporary\" . 10 (50%) were put off going to the GP at some time. Asked for the reasons why, if they had ever been sick and been put off from going to the doctor and not gone , respondents cited fear, time, self - healing, low motivation and shyness: \"Afraid of what's wrong with you\" ; \"You could be waiting 4 or 5 hours in Craigavon Hospital, so I went home despite the pain in my head\" ; \"I would be too shy\" ; \"Just never bothered\" ; \"The kids could be sicker than you - you'd get the kids seen first\". 4.5.2. Rating for doctors and nurses Response from Travellers Respondents were asked to rate doctors and nurses on a scale of 1-5 where 1 was dont tru st at all and 5 was trust a lot (Figure 18). 18(90%) generally trus t, trust or trust doctors and nurses a lot. (103) Figure 18 How do you rate doctors and nurses? 4.5.3. Reasons underlying rating of GPs Response from Travellers The main reasons for a positive rating included : professional values and non - racist attitudes, respect for a fa mily doctor and their knowledge: \"Most of the doctors are a fair judge. If I walked in I d know a man was racist - this hasnt been my experience of doctors\"; \"A doctor is only th ere to think of your wellbeing\"; \"My doctor in Dungannon is brilliant\" ; \"Theyre doing a good job. They went through all the qualifications \"; \"Theres doctors that are 100% and nurses too\" . (104) Reaso ns for negative rating included incompetence or a lack of trust: \"I ended up in hospital over him. I took a stroke and he gave me painkillers\" ; \"No-reason -just dont fully trust them\" ; \"Some doctors give you medicine for kids and they dont cure you - others do cure you \". 4.5.4. When to see a doctor Response from Travellers When asked how do you know its serious enough to s ee a doctor? the reasons were pain, dizziness , sickness, unable to cure oneself or to appease ones wife: \"If you were suffering the way I was youd go to see the doctor\"; \"If it was unbearable - before I got my appendix out\" ; \"If you take a dizzy spell\" ; \"Youd nearly know - youd be sick\" ; \"When you realise you cant cure yourself\" ; \"When you start complaining too much she would make sure you see a doctor\" . (105) 4.5.5. Who do men mention the pain to? Response from Travellers Table 2 Who do you mention the pain to? Who do you mention pain to? N Who makes appointments and gets medication? N Doctor 20 Wife 15 Wife 14 Mother 9 Myself 7 Friends 7 Mother 1 Son 6 Daughter in law 1 Daughter 6 Father 1 20(100%) mentioned pain to doctor and 15(75%) mentioned pain to their wives, mothers 9 (45%) , and daughters 6 (30%). Friends and sons also played a part 7(35%) and 6(30%) respectively . Strong gender roles were evident in the family with the wife 14(70%) playing an important role in arranging appointments and gettin g medication , although the men themselves also played a role in this 7(35%) . Response from focus group members Seven respondents noted surprise and/or encouragement at the high levels of attendance at the GP within the last month : (106) \"Surprised at % accessing primary care in previous month - especially for males, given historical perception that accessing services is challenging\" . However seasonal factors, a skewed NIHE sample (with high GP registration ) and possible hidden d iscrimination were highlighted : \"February more inclined to contact GP re colds, flus, not travelling\"; \"Figures may be skewed by number of sample being resident in NIHE accommodation -therefore more likely to be registered with GPs for a number of years. This would correlate with % being seen in GP surgery and level of satisfact ion as to how they were treated \"; \"Men may not be aware that wives may have faced discrimination while making appointment\" . Three people highlighted the important role of women in influencing male health appointm ents: \"Women have a key role in all communities in influencing how, when and where males access health services. Four people referred to the potential of a primary care initiative known as the Travell er Local Enhanced Servic e (LES) currently under review: \"LES is being provided by 8 GP practices in the Southern Area. This offers a potential for more specialised services to Travellers registered within these practices. (107) Another person suggested that the success in this scheme needs to be replicated regionally : \"LES in Southern area - success needs to be built upon regionally\" This was tempered with a comment about needing more local support: \"To develop potential of LES in Primary Care and tackle poor uptake amongst GPs\" . Nine respondents reacted positively to the high rating given to GPs. One person noted how trust had grown over time , affording good future potential: \"Primary care providers trusted and a great opportunity - shift over time and this level of trus t is an important opportunity\"; \"Good to see this - a lot of faith\" ; \"Surprised\" 4.5.6. Belief in people with cures Response from Travellers 18 (90%) believed in people with cures (Figure 19) : \"My father has a cure for ringworm - children and adults come to him \". 13 (65%) had been to a person for a cure : (108) \"I saw them in Tyrone for murmur in the heart. She got oatmeal, poured it into cork, wrapped hanky round top and went round body 3 times praying - took hanky off and it was empty. 2nd time cork half full and 3rd time I went up murmur was gone and cork was ful l\". 12 (60%) said they helped or cured the problem : \"I was poisoned with an arrow in the back of my leg - aged 15. When I was in Intensive Care parents went to a man who travell ed to Waterford and he cured me \". 8 (40%) did not trust people with cures more than doctors : \"No, a lot of the curer people are looking for a hand -out - I don't class them as real ones \". 6 (30%) trusted them the same as doctors : \"I would believe in traditional healing because of God - for tablets I'd trust the d octor\". 4 (20%) did trust people with cures more than doctors . (109) Figure 19 Belief in people with cures Other comments on traditional cures included: \"I'm the 7th son and I've the cure for ringworm. 1 Sign of cross on affected area 2 Blow 3 times 3 Put right hand on the affected area 4.Prayers 5. Sign of Cross 6. Blow 3 times cure finished\" ; \"My sister and grandfather were in a car crash on Monaghan Road - my father went to Dublin and left sister with my grandfather. My grandfather wasn't so bad. My parents went to a priest who'd said tomorrow you'd have good news - meant to have brain damage - doctors had no hope. Now she's 3 kids and married. My sister got confirme d with same priest who cured m e\"; (110) \"You have to believe - you never thank them you say God bless. She never asked for money. I gave her a fiver and boile d sweets for the telephone bi ll\"; \"Went to Lourdes - theres a cure for clot in the heart, pain s, and bleeding. Some cures are done over the phone or at their house \"; \"Theres another woman in Blaney for cure for rash in the head. There's somebody out there for sore mouths\" . Respons e from focus group members Seven people reacted to the information that Travellers believe in people with cures. The importance of understanding health beliefs set within a wider debate around alternative therapies was highlighted : \"Important to understand culture and health beliefs model\"; \"There has always been debate about a holistic approach to health and wellbeing, encompassing alternative therapies. The role of the faith healer, through culturally significant, is no different in this respect \". Two noted that 90% believed in cures and one person stated (in relation to prim ary care and traditional cures): \"Travellers in our care would use both\" . (111) One person suggested further exploration of the model to identify underlying risks : \"to explore folk medicine and its uses identifying health and safety risks\" . (112) Section 6 Health Information This section covers a range of sources and rating for health information including health professionals, family sources, type of health information and methods of delivery . (113) 4.6.1. Sources of health information Response from Travellers Table 3 shows that health professionals 19(95%) and family members 15(75%), followed by TV 13 (65%), friends 12(60%) and posters 9(45%) were the most used sources of health information. Internet ; 2(10%) and leaflets ; 6(30%) were amongst the least used . Response f rom focus group members Six respondents noted the importance of family members as sources of health information. One person underlined the 75% statistic for family as a source stating : \"Value of lay health programme\" . She referred to the Belfast Trusts employment of 2 female Traveller Lay Health Workers. Th is was echoed by another person: \"Need for peer support workers - male and female\" . Another comment highlighted the importance of build ing Traveller womens knowledge: \"As it ap pears women are at the forefront of giving information they should be educated so they can disseminate information to the men\" . Five noted the influence of TV. One referred to the programme - Citizen Traveller which she beli eved raised issues successfully: (114) \"Citizen Traveller was very successful in the Republic of Ireland in raising issues\" . Four commented on leaflets , with particular reference to a specially designed safety leaflet within the Promoting Wellbeing Department : \"Specific leaflets have been desi gned in relation to safety issues\" . One referred to a regional CAWT newsletter : \"A newsletter is being developed by NI Traveller Forum to inform Travellers about work of the Forum under CAWT Access to Services Programme\". Three respondents reacted to low internet usage highlighting literacy issues, lack of access and knowledge of IT: \"Level of access to internet is much poorer for Travellers compared to settled community\"; \"Reflects literacy need\"; \"No access to computers or unable to use one\" . One respondent asked if the slide on sources of information differed from the general population . (115) Table 3 Sources of health information Source of health information n % Health professional 19 95 Family member 15 75 TV 13 65 Friend 12 60 Poster 9 45 Leaflet 6 30 Internet 2 10 Conversations 2 10 Cousin 1 5 Locals 1 5 (116) 4.6.2 . Rate sources of health information Response from Travellers Table 4 shows results from a question asking people to rate sources of health information from 1 -5, with 1= not good , 3 = good , 5 = very good . 19(95%) rated health professionals between good and very good ; 18 (90%) rated one to one methods , and 12 (60%) rated group education meth ods within the same range. 14(70%) rated TV between good and very good although15 (75%) rated videos as not good to fairly good . Leaflets received mixed response with 12(60%) rating them between good and very good and 8(40%) responding not good to fairly good . 16 (80%) rated internet as not good . A cross tabulation of health information rating by levels of literacy (Table 21) revealed , that of the 7 respondents who could not read, 6(85%) gave the Internet , 5(71%) leaflets and 4(57%) posters low ratings. Of this group 6(85%) rated health professionals , 6(85%) one to one and 5(71%) rated word of mouth, group education and TV as fairly good to very good . Conversely of the 13 who could read 13(100%) rated health professionals, 12(92%) ra ted TV, word of mouth, one to one and leaflets as fairly good to very good . 9(69%) of those who were literate did not rate video or internet highly . (117) Response from focus group members Two respondents commented on one to one methods receiving higher rating than group methods . Others offered contrasting views on the merits of this method with one questioning its practicality and the other offering a one to one service : \"Low level for group education vs. one to one\" ; \"One to one method - is it practica l?\" \"PWBT Traveller Family Support Worker can promote health information on one to one basis to each family\". As regards group methods one person highlighted the need for single sex groups and training programmes addressing mens needs designed by men : \"Traveller men wont attend mixed training groups with males and females -more training programmes addressing Traveller mens specific health needs designed by Traveller men\" . General comments about health information focused on the need for plain English , a description of existing targeted health promotion initiatives including Reach (a Community Lifestyle Programme funded by the Lottery),Man Alive (a cancer prevention programme targeting male Travellers), and Safe and Well (offering health, community d evelopment and youth programmes to Travellers). Consideration was also given to the venue for information provision : (118) \"More health information could be given in sporting venues\" . One person highlighted the need for information sharing i n Neighbourhood Renewal areas (a reas of highest deprivation within NI funded by the De partment of Social Development): \"Neighbourhood Renewal areas need to be sure that Travellers are aware of whats happening in their areas - they may not be able to read leaflets or read ads in local papers - Traveller Support Workers should be informed of up and coming events so they can inform Travellers\" .

Groups that would interest men included e ducational, trades, Traveller culture, citizenship, health, social, and recreational. (121) 4.7.1. Groups that would interest men Response from Travellers Respondents were interested in educational, trades, Traveller culture, citizenship, health, social, and recreational groups for fitness and arts activities.15 (75%) requested at least a week ly meeting if not more frequently. 13 (65%) preferred it either in their own locality. The highest number 8 (40%) preferred evening meetings, although 4 (20% ) would consider any time .17 (85% ) suggested promot ing a group through word of mouth . Response from focus group members Education and trades The focus group responded to the potential additional benefits of ICT training (8 comments), venue (5 comments) , school curriculum, (4 comments) timing (2 comments) and t rades (1 comment) : \"Could ICT be a driver for the desire to improve literacy? E.g. e-bay and the increased use of internet technology -this in turn could improve access to information\"; \"To extend IT training to groups outside the Trust\"; \"To train one young Traveller man in ICT OCN level 2 by October\" (CAWT); \"To train Travellers t o teach IT as role models\" ; \"To further develop ICT skills for d rug and alcohol awareness, driving t heory; build literacy into other training\" ; (122) \"Look at these groups and link into health, numeracy and literacy\" . \"Mostly practical - implications for school curriculum on offer. Greater emphasis needed to reflect the world of work of Travellers and their culture\"; \"Programmes developed specifically for schools to provide vocational and recreational - interests to be met as well as literacy and numeracy - PHA could assist/lead with others to progress issue and has already influenced the commissioning of some social care\"; \"Offer opportunities at school on these issues i.e. trades, driving, sport, horses\"; implications for education to create a programme which addresses their career and lifestyle issues\" . Focus group members also had ideas about innovative methods of engaging men , either on a one to one basis or in small groups e.g. mens sheds . There were conflicting ideas about whether services should be offered on an outreach basis or whether mainstream venues should be ma de more welcoming to Travellers: \"Explore the idea of mens sheds\" ; \"Provide small structure directed training sessions in various locations throughout the region tailored to their need s - areas of interest e.g. topic of interest like hunting, fishing, handball. Could play a part i n focused topic for a portfolio \"; (123) \"Overall outcomes in SRC to break down the barriers faced by Travellers in accessing SRC provision and 2.5 years into the pro ject 7 classes have moved from community venues to SRC at the request of Travellers\"; \"CAWT Employment and Skills training : first time a class of Travellers have gone to the SRC to take up IT and Maths Classes p reviously done in the Community\" ; \"Campuses should be open to Travellers as to everybody else - Navan Fort for a Travellers venue - the feedback from Travellers was never been here before\" . Barriers to gaining qualifications in trades were highlighted. They felt Travellers were more intere sted in trades than recreational activities and recommend ed peer training and incentives: \"Barriers - may take up to 3 years for trades. They will also need literacy and numeracy for forklift, HGV, and Driving Licence\"; \"Trades and practical issues\"; \"Limited work areas in training, trades and recreation -peer training and incentives to small business \". The Safe and Well representative highlighted a Towing Licence course which they offer and suggested developing a HGV training opportunity. Another respondent saw training for trades as a natural progression from demographic information on experience of trades : \"Training for trades - natural progression from manual work referred to in employment statistics\" . (124) Timing One person underlined the highest nu mber preferring evenings which was a barrier for her agency but acknowl edged potential for development: \"Low uptake by Travellers of Wade courses - potential for development\" . SRC noted that they do provide evening provision. Training One respondent refer red to a Safe and Well capacity building course with Travellers: \"Train the trainers being carried out by Safe and Well\" . Recreation Four respondents reacted to information on recreation with three addressing fitness and one arts. In relation to fitness on e person queried the appropriateness of voluntary sector Traveller specific groups taking the lead indicating that the Council and GAA should be proactive : \"Is this something that the voluntary sector should be providing? What about the Council Sports Deve lopment Workers and GAA involvement?\" This issue was prompted by the interest in handball with another person suggesting that the GAA should develop hand ball clubs and other activities: (125) \"Development of Handball Clubs and sporting activities with the general population\" . She went on to acknowledge the psychological benefits of sport: \"Use sport to promote self -worth and self -belief\". Walking groups were also suggested. Another respondent reacted to the interest in boxing by drawing attention to a n after schools boxing/drugs and alcohol programme instigated by a Health Promotion student with the PWBT : \"In Newry a male student health promotion worker has just completed a very successful programme in partnership with a school\" . She went on to suggest the need for male workers. One respondent suggested a link with Arts -Care (a Voluntary organisation dedicated to arts provision in the health sector) to meet artistic interests also suggesting a c elebration of Traveller culture: \"More links with Arts -Care to promote history, storytelling, and music to capture and celebrate culture and pass on to the next gener ation\" . Health Drugs and Alcohol and cancer screening elicited two comments. The CAWT worker highlighted a Hidden Harm Drugs and Alcohol project which she suggested should be rolled out i n Monaghan: (126) \"Needs to be more widespread. Pilot Hidden Harm Project in Monaghan\" . Another person noted the Man Alive Cancer screening programme run by Ulster Cancer Foundation . Citizenship : Four commented on the interes t in Traveller rights highlighting the success of the Citizen Traveller TV programme in the Republic of Ireland and the limited success of Traveller rights initiatives in N.I.: \"Initiatives to inform Travellers of their own rights have had limited success with events cancelled at the last minute\" , although more work was being planned by the Equality Commission. Another person from S afe and Well suggested: \"More work with the Equality Commission\". 4.7.2 . Cross cutting themes In the final section cross cutting themes and new issues introduced by focus group members are explored. These include the social determinants of health, male engagement, gender, community development, community infrastructure, and ethnic monitoring. (127) Social Determinants of Health Although this was mentioned under mental health there were four comments throughout the research indicating its centrality : \"Action on the wider determinants of health will underpin any positive changes in mortality\"; \"Need action on wider social de terminants of health including poverty, education, jobs, inclusion agenda mixing with others in discos, bars\"; \"To move on health and social agenda \" (with reference to the Southern Area Action with Travellers). In reference to the study title one person commented : \"Two pronged approach important\" . A fifth person reacted to the slide on the literature review , recommending approaches that combine health prom otion with holistic health: \"Our Integrated Promoting Wellbeing Department\" . Male engagement and gender Six additional comments were made on the issues of male engagemen t and gender: \"Need for more engagement with men - men need to be given confidence to express themselves\"; \"To engage men where they are at\" ; (128) \"When giving research results from AITHS - men didnt want to know\" . \"Gender issue pervades all work for change\"; \"Common male issues - women to th e fore - need to build on women\". In relation to opening quotation from Ellen McDonagh : \"Interesting to start wit h a female perspective\"; \"Need to empower Traveller women to play a major part in improving their mens health\" . Community Development In addition to the reference to asset based approaches in the mental health section there is also a suggestion that Travellers should be offered training as volunteers : \"The need to engage Travellers in the new Volunteering plan in the HSC. Travellers need to be offered training as Volunteers\". Another respondent highlighted the Community Development and Neighbourhood R enewal Programmes. Another suggested : \"Citizenship \", asset based approach, Community Development strategy\"; \"HSCB/PHA commissioning securing Traveller work at Grassroots and Atlantic Philanthropy \"; (with OFMDFM taking the lead ). (129) Community Infrastructure There were two comments about the role community infrastructure played in enabling engagement for this research : \"Infrastructure has to be there for Fergal to engage with\" ; \"Infrastructure in area facilitated the engagement\" . One commented on the need for continuing investment in TSGs: \"Need to invest in the infrastructure of the existing Traveller Support groups and relevant staff\" . She observed that too much time was spent chasing funding. Another respondent suggested the establishment of a CAWT Cross Border Health Advisory Group. Ethnic Monitoring Ethnic monitoring was raised in the demography and health information sections as key to monitoring service uptake with the OFMDFM identified as the lead body : \"Many key information systems have the capability to record ethnic status but this is not seen as a priority and in many cases is not recorded. Priority is placed on religion, sex, disability, with these areas covered by legislation\" ; \"Ethnic monitoring will re quire a TOP DOWN organisational wide drive to ensure it takes place\". Suggestions included : \"Improve Ethnic Monitoring in order to assess the take up and use of agency services\"; (130) \"Improve data q uality and target services from obvious areas of weakness/ sh ortfall\"; \"A Racial/ Equality Ethnic Monitoring Strategy from OFMDFM across all professional groups\" . (131) CHAPTER 5 DISCUSSION (132) Preamble To address the central question \"Dying fifteen years early - what can Traveller men and relevant agencies do?\" this section will use themes from the National Mens Health Policy 2008 - 2013 (Richardson & Carroll, 2008) due to their relevance, international applicability and future potential . Issues identified by men and focus group members in the mortality section will be woven through these themes. Limitations in methodology will be addressed first. 5.1. Limitations of methodology 5.1.1. Action research and ethical consideration Sarantakos (2005, p.337) lists the weaknesses of action resea rch as: - allows no replication - biased towards interests of certain groups - cannot assure representativeness, objectivity, nor generalizability . However weaknesses need to be weighed against strengths. It has been evident that Traveller mens health has been neglected in Ireland with a concomitant shocking mortality rate. Action research methodology enabled exploratory research, innovative and in depth engagement and an opportunity to influence relevant agency policy and practice. Traveller Advisors played a key role in facilitating engagement in a group traditionally suspicious of statutory involvement and subjected to on -going racism and discrimination . The study fulfilled action research (133) principles: it was applied, situational, topical, collaborative, participatory and political (Sarantakos, 2005, p.333). In accordance with action research principles the researcher consulted with Traveller advisors abo ut terms of reference and the content of structured interviews prior to ethical consent. This caused nervousness among academic advisors in case it would be perceived by OREC that the research h ad commenced prior to approval. The researcher presented evide nce to OREC that i n Canada, the Tripartite Council of Policy on Ethics had established the principles of ownership, control, access, and possession (OCAP) when doing research with Aboriginal communities and within this context prior consultation was consid ered best practice. This was referenced by OREC when granting approval (Appendix 13) . However measured against these standards the research fell short of full action research methods in which peer researchers have been trained to conduct work within their own community (AITHS, 2010; Etowa et al, 2011; Brown & S cullion, 2010) although it did overcome issues concerning confidentiality and reliability highlighted in a recent paper (Brown et al, 2012). 5.1.2. Sample Due to the small sample size temptations to generalise should be resisted especially when so little health research has been done specifically engaging Traveller men. Even within the small sample differences of opinion existed. However Sarantakos (2005, p. 171) observes that (134) \"the more intense and in depth the method of data collection, the smaller the sample size\" . Weight is also added to the findings of this study through similar findings identified in the international literature . Purposive sampling was employed to ensure a representative spread of ages, accommodation types, family groups and area but again caution is required in making generalizations with such a small sample . However , it is acknowledged that a limitation of the study was that despite th ese efforts the sample was sk ewed towards Housing Executive t enants , which may have affected findings in relation to primary care. 5.1.3. Objectivity and bias Action research challenges positivist assertions that the methods of physical sciences are applic able in social science, truth is absolute, reality objective and the influence of the researcher neutralized (Sarantakos, 2005, p.34). Truth is viewed in action research as a social construct (Guba & Lincoln, 1994) . Some feminist researchers do not accept the neutral distant role and assumption that the interviewer is the expert while the interviewee is the ignorant party. T hey argue the relationship must be more egalitarian (Reinharz, 1992; Westkott , 1990 in Sarantakos, 2005, p.278). This research was not value free and the researcher took the side of respondents to help them understand their real situation , in terms of discrimination , and set out from the onset to bring findings to relevant agencies in order to affect change. This does leave the resear cher open to challenges about objectivity. (135) 5.1.4. Piloting, recording and instruction errors Some responses from focus group members could not be included due to illegibility. Time pressure to interview the Traveller participants before they departed for s easonal travel meant that there was insufficient time to pilot the structured interview . A two part question on domestic violence needed to be reworded for the second interview. Conversely the process of amending the structured interview tool whilst consu lting twelve Advisors counterbalanced the absence of the formal pilot. It provided an opportunity to develop a tool which was culturally relevant and easy to understand. Questions about discrimination more closely aligned to the format developed by Kriege r et al, (2005) and employed by the AITHS , would have allow ed standardised comparison s. However the principles of action research questions emerging from Advisors. 5.2. Social determinants of health From the onset this study adopted a social determinants of health perspective advocated by the AITHS (2010), and other health studies of indigenous men and men in the general population (McCalman et al, 2006; Brown & Macdonald, 2009; Smart el al, 2003; Cushnahan, 2008; European Communities, 2011; Richardson & C arroll, 2010). Focus group members recognised the need for action on wider determinants to underpin positive changes in mortality and mental health : (136) \"Clearly discrimination, poor health status, low education attainment, lack of government support, accommod ation, access to services, income etc. will have a massive impact on Travellers experience of mental health\" as did Travellers : \"One of the differences is I cant get a job except one in a hundred\" . An integrated multiagency long term strategy to tackle inequalities in partnership with Travellers was suggested : \"Action plans joined up with Travellers,[led by OFMDFM]\" One focus group member observed : \"Travellers moving into houses has had no impact on health improvement\". Disconnecting Travellers from th eir extended families leads to social isolation which can result in depression (Van Hout, 2011; AITHS, 2010). In Donegal 50% of Travellers living on sites stated that the accommodation situation was cause for stress, with more Travellers who lived on sites reporting depression than those resident in houses (Leonard & OLeary, 2006). Contemporary indigenous health literature reinforces this message. \"The health disadvantages experienced by Indigenous people ...are specifically manifest in measures su ch as education, employment, income, housing, access to services, social (137) networks, connection with land, racism, and incarceration\" (Thompson et al, 2011). Some Travellers commented on links between mental health issues like stress, unemployment, depressio n and suicide : \"suicide: it is depression, everything builds up and they don't talk to anyone\"; \"I would suffer from depression and I have a suicidal number on my phone. There are days I feel so depressed I say not another day - tablets only last for so lo ng. Everything is stress\" ; \"Stress, hardship, providing for family\"; \"having no work would affect life expectancy\". According to the AITHS (2010, p.94) Traveller men have a 6.6 times higher suicide risk than settled men. However according to Gossrau - Breen (2012) statistical information on suicide among Travellers is available for ROI via two recent studies but not for N.I. In the present study 13 (65%) said their family had not been affected and 5 (25%) stated their family had been affected by suicide; 1 5 (75%) knew of other Travellers that have lost their life by suicide and13 (65%) did not know of support groups. Evidence indicated a need for suicide support groups to be better promoted amongst Traveller men across the area . However fo cus group member queried if such services would be used due to existing cultural norms. (138) The need for a long term integrated strategy, based on the social determinants model of health to tackle Traveller inequality emerged as a clear way forward : \"A 15 year gap - needs to be addressed as a priority\"; \"This is totally unacceptable and requires a new long term properly resourced initiative across the region\". 5.3. Male engagement, masculinity and gender Gender is one of the major organising structures of social life. It is related to broad divisions of labour, social authority and control over resources, patterns of sexuality and emotional attachment, and identities. Groups of men and groups of women have differences in exposure to health risks, behaviour, interest and learn ing (Connell, 2000). Traveller culture is marked by patriarchy and strong gender demarcations (AITHS, 2010; Allen, 2011; Walker, 2008). Traditionally, women have been responsible for childcare and the home and have been financially dependent on their husba nds, who make the decisions. Masculinity, gender and male engagement issues permeated the study. For example macho attitudes were evident in the discussion about suicide : \"Men are afraid to speak out/ more ashamed to discuss their problems - should be encouraged to take problems to a doctor - he listens\" . (139) Cultural ideas around conflict were noted: \"Travellers do a lot of fighting among each other\" as were methods to deal with discrimination; \"No, we're more likely to floor somebody than report it\" . The extent of the anecdotally high levels of depression and bereavement in GRT families (Greenfields, 2008; Cemlyn et al, 2009) is not widely known, nor has the importance of the extended family as a source of strength and resilience been fully explored. T he cultural competency gap needs to be bridged through cultural awareness training for professionals, in order that mainstream services are perceived as more accessible by these communities. Gender issues emerged when making appointments for services, (70% said their wives made appointments) obtaining health information, (75% obtaining information from family members) choosing trades and recreational activities, addressing nutrition strategies and in taking action to report discrimination with high demarcat ion in roles. \"When you start complaining too much she would make sure you see a doctor\" The Belfast Trust recently employed two female Traveller lay health workers and reference was made by a focus group member to justification from evidence around Trave ller womens roles in health and the need to employ more Travellers in other workforces. (140) According to Etowa et al (2011) significant under -representation of Aboriginal peoples in the health professions is problematic in Canada. Increasing representation is a promising strategy to narrow the gap in access to appropriate health care for Aboriginal peoples. Etowa used Community Based Participatory Research to actively engage team members in all aspects of the research to address the three goals of CBPR; resea rch, education and action. Traveller men may feel traditional Traveller male roles are threatened as their traditional nomadic economy and bonding forms of social capital are depleted and undermined, whilst Traveller women may be more successful at developing bridging forms of social capital (Ryder & Greenfields, 2010). Focus group members highlighted gender differences throughout : \"Gender issue pervades all work f or change\" e.g. in lifestyle issues like drinking and smoking : \"Traveller boys are allowed to smoke at any age whereas the girls have to wait until they are married\" education and training : \"Not seeing the benefit of general education and training as they all still provide for their families and dont believe that formal training will enhance that - rather it is seen as too time consuming\"; domestic violence, stress and the role of women in accessing primary care : (141) \"Women have a key role in all communiti es in influencing how, when and where males access health services\" . Male engagement was present from the design stage (although not exclusively as the quotation at the beginning of this research and the gender ratio of the Traveller Advisors testifies) an d the themes of male engagement and the need for a gender strategy re-occurred in various parts of the research. 90% of the sample followed the trades of their fathers. A Traveller man was suggested as a paid role model to be trained to deliver numeracy an d literacy to other Traveller men. The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (ECNI) recognised the need for further work to increase the number of Traveller men taki ng discrimination cases. Other focus group member s highlighted the Man Alive cancer screening programme, a successful boxing/ alcohol and drugs programme delivered by a male health promotion student, and the need for more training programmes like the SAW towing programme. According to the AITHS, \"a gendered strategy needs to be adopted and mens health issues need to be addressed specifically, with an emphasis on empowerment and promotion of self -esteem for young Travellers of both sexes to improve mental health and wellbeing, but particularly drawing in the engagement of men. This requires a comprehensive cross -sectoral approach to facilitate work opportunity, break down the substance misuse problems and engage men in health service participation\" (AITHS, 2010, p174). (142) However gender politics is complex. Acco rding to Connell (2000) it is commonly assumed that a progressive politics of masculinity must take the form of a social movement such as the gay movement, labour movement or civil rights movement. But he argues Australian men as a group and heterosexual m en in particular are not oppressed or disadvantaged, and attempts by men to address sexism have been subverted towards a concern about being positive about men and masculinity therapy (Connell, 2000). Paradoxically, Connell reasons, to fight for justi ce in gender relations often means doing the opposite of the things that would create a \"mens movement\". That is, tackling issues that inevitably divide men rather than unite them, such as homophobia, affirmative action for women, equal pay, sexual harass ment and violence. These pose challenges for more traditional gender roles within Traveller culture and in the wider community. One idea which has gained momentum is the growth of mens sheds as a safe space for men to meet (www.mensheds.org ) and this was referenced by a focus group member as worth exploring. 5.4. Racism, sectarianism and discrimination 15(75%) r eported current unemployment compared with the N.I. unemployment rate for the period of 6.9% (March - May 2012, DETI 2012) . In the 2006 census in the Republic of Ireland (Central Statistics Office, 2007) the unemployment rate for Travellers was 75% compared to 9% for the general population. Traveller statistics from the NI 2011 Census are unpubli shed but (143) unemployment in NI for Travellers in 2001 was 89% (AITHS, 2010, p.14). Ryder & Greenfield (2010) have discussed how bonding social capital within the Traveller communities may have emerged as a defensive mechanism as a result of centuries of racis m and exclusion from mainstream society, including mainstream employment opportunities. Its no surprise then that 45% reported being normally self - employed. Reference was made by Travellers to the impact of unemployment on stress, depression and suicide : \"Stress, hardship, providing for family\"; \"having no work would affect life expectancy\"; \"Suicide -it's depression, everything builds up and they don't talk to anyone)\". 20(100%) of Travellers in the sample experienced discrimination (both early and recent with only one person not reporting experien ces of early discrimination). 39 incidences were documented. Findings elicited a comprehensive reaction from the Equality Commission N.I. ( ECNI) who suggest ed a strengthening of the racial discrimination l aws to bring them into line with the Equality Act 2010 (21/3/2012) and a refreshed racial equality strategy ( Appendix 22). Widespread discrimination and racism against Travellers is already well documented (AITHS, 2010; NICEM, 2011; Walker, 2008; Hellein er, 2000; Connolly & Keenan, 2002). Traveller (144) Advisors prioritised questions on racism and discrimination over others. In answer to questions about what made them proud or embarrassed about t heir culture the issue featured: \"Were a proud tradition as good as anyone. We dont have to rob people to be any good. There will come a time when there is no discrimination\"; \"Discrimination and hate crime and kids getting bullied\". 15 people reported experiencing recent discriminati on in bars/ clubs, 5 in shops and 2 in leisure facilities. Childhood discrimination focused on name calling, school bullying and physical violence with additional examples of social exclusion. One focus group member described Traveller comments about exper iencing racism and sectarianism as : a double whammy. Racist attitudes were exacerbated by media stereotyping in My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding which impacted directly on one mans livelihood. This programme offended Travellers and Gypsies across the UK and a related Channel 4 advert was referred to the Advertising Standards Authority after 370 complaints (Sweney, 2012). According to ECNI (2012) 35% of respondents would mind having a Traveller as a work colleague, 54% as a neighbour and 55% as an in law. ECNI calls for the Executive to address these attitudes through the Cohesion and Soc ial Integration (CSI) Strategy. The impact of discrimination on stress and mental health was clearly articulated : (145) \"It does stress you out that they're judging you for no reason. It absolutely frustrates you - you feel what's the point talking if they're putting you down? Findings around the impact of racism and discrimination elicited strong reaction from focus group members : \"Its such an everyday occurrence, most don t even recognise it anymore - it comes from all sources and never seems to have been addressed - legislation is clearly not enough\". According to Krieger (2000; 2003) research on racism as a harmful determinant on poor health is recent. Krieger highlights three issues - the links between racism, biology and health ; methodological controversies on how to study the impact of racism on health ; and debates over whether racism or class underlies racial and ethnic disparities in health. She argues race is a socia l rather than a biological category with one group benefiting from dominating others. She describes direct and indirect methods to test the hypothesis does racism harm health? and asks a question around validity and memory recall in investigations relyin g on self - report. On reflection this research would have benefited from the instrument Krieger et al (2005) used to measure discrimination , and which was used by the AITHS to allow direct national and international comparisons (AITHS, p.74). However findi ngs from this study resonated with the AITHS. Finally she raises debate over whether racism or (146) social class explains racial/ ethnic disparities in health and which is causally prior (Krieger, 2000; Krieger et al, 1993; Williams, 1999). According to the AIT HS (2010) Travellers experience of discrimination was widespread and affected every area of their life. Discrimination was reported by 3 out of 4 Travellers in accommodation requests ; 7 out of 10 at school, being served in a shop or pub, and on t he street/in a public place; 6 out of 10 when seeking work of from the police or in the courts. Experience of discrimination was more keenly felt in Northern Ireland than in ROI. Ethnic discrimination was higher among Travellers in the AITHS than in low incom e mixed race groups in US studies on the listed issues. Sectarianism may account for the higher levels of discrimination experienced in NI according to the AITHS . The contribution of sectarianism to the findings in this study requires further research as caution is required in drawing conclusions due to the small sample size. Focus group members commented : \"Both impacts - southern accent into Northern area\"; \"Perceived threat and actual evidence - racism and sectarianism\". Krieger outlines five pathways through which racism can harm health: 1. economic and social deprivation 2. toxic substan ces and hazardous conditions (147) 3. socially inflicted trauma (mental, physical, sexual, directly experienced and witnessed, from verbal acts to violent acts) 4. targeted marketing of commodities that can harm health e.g. junk food and psychoactive substances 5. inadequate or degrading medical care . The effect of these 5 factors is evident in this study to varying degrees as is variation in the individuals response t o discrimination . Examples of internalised oppression are manifest in the number of Travellers who did not report either early or recent discrimination : \"No, I was a child at school. The Master gave you slaps too, so you couldn't report it to anyone\"; \"No, a waste of time - the same pub discriminated against us a load of times\". Socially inflicted trauma was experienced and witnessed. 12(60%) of the sample felt domestic violence was high and 11(55%) knew someone who has experienced it. One focus group member queried whether domestic violence was related to other pressures. EHRC (2007), on the health of Gypsies and Travellers in Wrexham , reported that 61 per cent of married English Gypsy women and 81 per cent of married Irish Traveller women interviewed for the study had experienced direct domestic abuse. However no further information is available on whether the methods of identifying or recruiting women may have influenced these figures. A subsequent EHRC report makes the point that Gypsy an d Traveller women who have suffered domestic violence (148) will have suffered it more severely, and over a longer period of time than other women (EHRC Report, 2009). Domestic violence is not specific to Travellers and it has been contested whether it is more p revalent within the Traveller Community (Pavee Point, 2005). Yet, it has been suggested by Traveller women and service providers that domestic violence is more acceptable within the Traveller Community (AITHS, 2010; Allen, 2011; SAAT, 2011; Watson & Parson s, 2005). Three graphic incidents were recalled in relation to early discrimination in this study - being thrown through a school window, burned out of a house and physically attacked while waiting for a bus. Incidences of childhood verbal abuse and bullyi ng were among other examples of socially inflicted trauma : \"You are out -casted in primary class. The children wouldnt involve you in groups\" . Some focus group members offered praise for Belong, (www.belongni.org ) an evidence based programme in the Southern Trust area for 7 -12 year BME children employing anti- bullying, cultural competence and educational support programmes. Belong arose out of the work of Biggart et al (2009) which documented racism and discrimin ation amongst BME children (including Travellers). Some focus group members were keen that the Traveller Education Task force addresses the issue of bullying in is forthcoming strategy. (149) Another response documented harmful use of psychoactive substances like alcohol, drugs and tobacco in response to stress and depression : \"Reason for drinking - I ended up badly depressed and ended up drinking. When you are out and about you have your freedom moving from place to place - this is one of the biggest factors - you're too much confined in a house... theyre losing a lot of traditions over housing\" The AITHS (2010) reported that 38.1 % of respondents in ROI and 39.3% in NI indicated they never drank alcohol, although rates of non -drinking were considerably higher in women than men. According to Hurcombe et al (2010) the most important barrier to help -seeking for problem drinking is failure to address the stigma attached to alcohol problems and the experience of discrimination. To address racism and systems within organisations that support it, a comprehensive framework that assesses cultural competence has been developed (Fountain, 2009). 60% of the sample smoked tobacco compared with the Europ ean male average of 32% (European Commission, 2009) and N.I. male average of 25% (DHSSPS, 2011). The AITHS reported 52.5%of Travellers in ROI and 50.8% in NI were current smokers with 53.9% of male Travellers in N.I smoking. According to Robinson et al (20 09, p.13) the highest prevalence rates were among economically inactive people aged 16 -59 whose last job was a routine or manual one (50%). (150) 15 (75%) knew someone who had taken drugs; 15 (75%) said the issue of drugs and alcohol had worsened in the last 5 y ears. In the AITHS a majority of respondents (66.3% in ROI and 64.6% in NI) considered illicit drugs to be a problem in their community and this was a consistent pattern for both men and women and across age groups. Traditional anti -drug Traveller culture is diminishing in potency, as families become fragmented and Traveller youth assimilate within educational settings, and over time one would question if drug use among Travellers will replicate or even exceed that of the 'settled' population, given the mar ginalisation and d iscrimination they experience (V an Hout, 2011). This study presents evidence of Travellers taking limited protection agains t hazardous substances like asbestos, copper wire, burning plasti c, paint and power -washing and focus group members responded with suggestions to tackle this (see recommendations section). Responses to discrimination varied from inaction to active resistance . Those who did take action went to a solicitor or court, the bar manager or took action themselves : \"No, we're more likely to floor somebody than report it\" . The family who won their case against discrimination on the golf course through the ECNI were proud of this and saw it as a landmark event for Traveller rights and equality , although the ECNI acknowledges much more work is required to encourage male complainants to come forward (Appendix 22). In relation to marketing of commodities many men although able to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy food admitted to (151) eating fries and junk food . Some focus group m embe rs were keen to promote healthy eating through young womens groups. One Traveller stating how he would describe Traveller culture to an American s aid: \"I wouldnt describe a Traveller to an American if he didnt know\". A focus group member added : \"I am aware of Traveller children who speak like country people so as not to be recognised as Travellers\". Connolly (2011) provides evidence of ethnic awareness and attitudes among three to four -year-old children in Northern Ireland. Many GRT people choose to hide their identity , or they identify as another ethnic group in order to avoid racism (Cemlyn et al, 2009; AITHS, 2010). In summary , racism, sectarianism and discrimination have had an adverse impact on male Travellers mental health and employment chances leading to increased stress, depression and suicide . Action is required across statutory, voluntary and community agencies , in partnership with Traveller men , to tackle this. (152) 5.5. Community development, community infrastructure and empowerment An asset -based approach to community development has gained ground in recent years as a corrective to the more familiar deficit approach, which focuses on the problems, needs and deficiencies in a community such as deprivation, exclusion, crime, anti -social behaviour, illness and health -damaging behaviours. Focusing entirely on deficits can create a sense of hopelessness amongst communities and resignation amongst professionals. As a result, a community can feel disempowered and dependent. P eople can become passive recipients of services rather than active in their own and their families lives. Clearly it remains important to be aware of needs and disadvantage and to narrow inequalities, but emphasising assets gives a better balance and generates confid ence and aspiration. Tackling mens health from a strengths perspective is also emphasized in the National Mens Health Policy (Richardson et al, 2008). Travellers demonstrated initiative and resilience in the areas of finding occasional labour, beliefs, c hanging attitudes to education, fitness, accessing primary care and a willingness both to advise and engage in this study. \"Community development emphasises the communitys perspective, because this is usually less visible and less powerful than that of th e public agencies, especially in disadvantaged areas or situations. Community development will also show that (153) even very disadvantaged communities have abundant assets as well as needs\" (ONeill , 2012, p.4). Overall 9 (45%) replied t hat they would normally be self - employed , but not within a steady business and usually in occasional labour. The most common experience of trades were scrap dealing 17 (85%), power -washing 16 (80%), market trading 14 (70%) and door to door sales 11 (55%). It is interesting to not e Travellers have adapted to todays economic climate with traditional trades like tinsmithing substituted by power -washing , although buying and selling has remained. One man was proud of his ability to survive despite poor educational outcomes : \"We didnt have to go take GCSEs - we know our own trades\" . Although there was evidence of this changing : \"Making sure the children are well educated - education is important in our culture and it wasnt always that way\" . Travellers remain strongly connected to traditional beliefs and values. The men interviewed had strongly held family values . The information on 18(90%) believing in traditional cures, 13 (65%) having sought a cure and 12(60%) reporting improved health as a result is interesting , even if one focus group member advised caution in terms of potential risk. Parry et al (2001) viewed Travellers health beliefs as cultural pride in self -reliance. As regards fitness , 7 (35%) walked , of whom 2 al so hunted , and 1 played golf. 5 (25%) showed hig h levels of fitness and attended the gym : (154) \"I am an All - Ireland Champion Boxer\" ; \"I am a member of the certified Training Academy and Leisure Centre \". Focus group members picked up on the interest in handball , asking if the GAA or Council could take this forward. One person remarked: \"Examples of Travellers in Coalisland doing marathons for charities. They arent members of running groups and decided to do it themselves .\" The boxing/ alcohol drugs initiative set up by a male health promotion student for a disengaged youth group was successful. However comments from one focus group member about not stereotyping opportunities offered is noted, and underlined by the golfer. Community Infrastructure was viewed by focus group members (and acknowledged by Traveller Advisors) as an essential pre - requisite for engagement in this research, provision of essential front line support to Travellers and future development of services including provision of one to one healt h information, promotion of additional activities for men and facilitation of access to services. Without TSGs, integrated interagency locality planning across education, health, accommodation and the community/ voluntary sector would not be possible nor would there be the means to take holistic he alth action . Empowerment is at the centre of community development, action research and health promotion. 32 Travellers , of whom 28 were (155) men, engaged at the advisory and implementation stages of this research despite literature on lack of engagement in hea lth services by nomadic/ indigenous people and men in general (Westerman, 2004; Vicary & Andrews, 2001; McLennan & Khavarpour, 2004, Parry et al, 2001). Reconstructing male empowerment and self -determination are key building blocks in the Australian National Framework to improve the health of Aboriginal and Torres Islander males (Adams, 2011) who have early mortality rates comparable to Irish Traveller men ( Figure 1 ). From a deficit perspective the 35% illiteracy rate , similar to that reported in the AITHS , would be viewed as high: \"As a key outcome of education and an instrument for further learning, literacy is part of the right to education and it facilitates the achievement of other rights. Equitable opportunities to acquire and use literacy are not ava ilable to certain groups, such as indigenous populations and nomadic communities\" (Richmond et al, 2008, p.7). However, it is easy to overlook the 65% literacy rate, experienced by the researcher when some respondents completed structured interviews unaide d, and the qualifications attained by a small number. The young man who expressed an interest in learning ICT skills to aid buying and selling on e -bay provoked responses from 5 focus group members who asked could ICT be a driver for change? Two saw this as a culturally relevant opportunity to introduce ICT : (156) \"Opportunity for education to use the computer as a hook to wider education\"; \"Influences of IT - logical for Travellers. Buying/selling important and reflects on culture\" . Figure 20 What would make the biggest different to health? (AITHS 2010, p151 ) (157) In the AITHS respondents were asked what 3 factors would most improve the health and wellbeing of the Traveller community (Figure 20) . Frequency of mention was presented in rank order. Better education was ranked by far the highest , followed by better accommodation, better uptake of preventive services, better provision for those with literacy problems and more culturally appropriate services (AITHS, p.151) , although it would be interesting to see the gender breakdown of these respondents. The success of the SAW towing course attended by 17 men demonstrates the appetite for attending relevant courses addressing self-identified need. Employment of more Traveller men and women across agencies , the development of new Traveller role models like those envisaged by CAWT, SRC and Safe and Well to train other Travellers in literacy and numeracy skills , and the acquisition of new skills like ICT and HGV licences , which may be possible through training c ourses offered by WADE training , will all play important roles in future asset building. However very real barriers have been highlighted by the SRC in relation to time commitment, literacy and economic imperatives that prevent Traveller men undertaking a 3 year course to gain a trade qualification, with shorter courses like towing, driving and security proving more feasible. Empowerment was demonstrated by four Traveller Advisors and three Traveller musicians who came forward to make a DVD to disseminate findings in this research . Other opportunities need to (158) be created by agencies and taken up by Traveller men in the future. Few Traveller men are involved in championing Travellers issues at a policy level , with some exceptions in the Traveller Education Task Force . Travellers will need to become directly involved in the refreshed Racial Equality Strategy , if the issue of discrimination is to be effectively tackled. Some focus group member s referred to the need for a long term integrated strategy to address the early mortality rate with the Equality Commission recomm ending OFMDFM to take the lead. 5.6. Adopting a health promotion /preventative approach The growth in recent years in the fields of preventative medicine and health promotion bears testimony to the contention that health behaviours are critically important in terms of influencing health outcomes. Epidemiological studies implicate particular lifestyle patterns as a major factor in p remature death rates among men (WHO, 2002; White & Holmes, 2006). This has been confirmed by a growing shift in healthcare policy, both internationally (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 1996) and nationally (Department of Health and Children, 2001) to wards the importance of individual health behaviours, disease prevention and lifestyle in determining health outcomes. Policy statements clearly implicate cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, raised total cholesterol, (159) hypertension and poor diet in the aetiology of many of the principal causes of mortality and morbidity, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and some cancers. Although some of these health behaviours have already been examined within the context of racism and discrimination, Travellers and agencies acknowledged their im portance in reducing mortality. Lifestyle factors including drugs and alcohol, nutrition and obesity, smoking, exercise and sleep deprivation were all cited by Travellers amongst the reasons for dying early. The Promoting Wellbeing Department in the SHSCT provides an interesting model of service delivery employing community development and health promotion specialists enabling both engagement, volunteering, capacity building, partn ership approaches and empowerment and also preventative mental health work , carers work, sexual health, drugs and alcohol and smoking cessation. This prompted one focus group member to proclaim : \"Our integrated Promoting Wellbeing Department\" in respons e to a slide advocating health improvement and community development as wa ys forward for mens health. 5.7. Primary care The most surprising findings related to primary care usage. In relation to Traveller mens access to their GP , 13 (65%) visited their GP within the last month, 18 (90%) had seen them in their GP surgery, 19 (95%) made an appointment and 17 (85%) did not feel they were treated differently by staff and patients. (160) It has been consistently shown that men of different ages, ethnicities and soc ial backgrounds access health services less frequently than do women for both physical and mental health problems (Addis et al, 2003; Cohen et al, 1995; Tudiver & Talbot, 1999; Parslow et al, 2004). When men do avail of primary care services, their consult ation times tend to be shorter than those of women and they ask fewer questions (Courtenay, 2000). Mens underutilisation of the health services is likely to be associated with their higher levels of potentially preventable health problems and, on average, lower life expectancies at any point throughout the lifespan (White & Johnson, 2000). Some of the responses from Travellers to the question why do you think Traveller men are dying so you ng? supported this contention. \"They don't have an awareness of b lood pressure, cholesterol\"; \"Not seeing a doctor when you should.\"; \"not taking medication\". Respondents were asked to rate doctors and nurses on a scale of 1-5 where 1 was dont trust at all and 5 was trust a lot . 18(90%) generally trusted , trusted or trusted doctors and nurses a lot. Reasons included their professional values and non - racist attitudes, respect for family doctor, and expertise. Those who did not trust their doctor cited poor diagnosis or just lack of trust. This result was further backed up by findings in the rating for sources of health info rmation. 19(95%) rated health professionals good to very good ;18 (90%) rated one to one methods good to very (161) good as opposed to 12 (60%) for group education methods. One focus group member highlighted that TSGs/ workers also provide one to one supp ort and health information. Focus group members felt this was a positive finding although caution was advised in relation to a winter survey, a potentially skewed sample (60%, NIHE) with access to family doctors and the possibility that their wives had fac ed problems at reception/appointment stage. Nonetheless the finding that 90% of respondents generally trust ed doctors and nurses is encouraging . The most important characteristics valued by men during a medical encounter are a professional attitude and app roach on the part of the physician; a relationship built on trust, confidentiality and respect; courtesy during a physical examination; time for meaningful information exchange; and the opportunity to discuss health -related concerns with a non - judgemental, competent and respectful healthcare provider (Dub\u00e9 et al, 2005). In response to the question do you have high blood pressure and cholesterol ? 8 (40%) reported high blood pressure and 7 (35%) high cholesterol. Focus group members reacted to the high prevalence, awareness level s and primary care implications: \"Means theyve been to have a test, usually age -related - opportunity for outreach service\"; \"Referred to Pharmacist and GP outreach initiatives\"; \"Health checks for men in the evenings (for those who work on sites or wherever\" . (162) It is well established that men also tend not to use pharmacies despite their potential as a source of advice, information and self - treatment (Baker, 2004). Therefore the responses by Travellers and focus group members in re lation to GP and pharmacy outreach programmes indicate excellent practice in the Southern Trust area. Four focus group member s referred to the current and future potential of a primary care initiative known as the Travell er Local Enhanced Service (LES) : \"LES is being provided by 8 GP practices in the Southern Area. This offers a potential for specialised services to Travellers e.g. longer appointment times, walk in appointments, greater integration with Trust to ensure screening...provision of health informat ion, cultural awareness training and provision of outreach with Trust staff\". Focus group member s recommended this is rolled out to more practices locally and regionally. With on -going improvements in cancer treatment, procedures and screening technologies , secondary prevention and prompt presentation to health services are increasingly playing a key role in reducing mortality from the disease (Evans et al, 2005). One initiative targeting mal e Travellers , referred to by focus group members , was the Man Aliv e programme , provided by Cancer Focus N.I. and delivered by community nurses. McKinlay (2005) stresses the important role that community nurses can serve in delivering outreach services to men and in supporting community - based mens health initiatives. (163) Ethnic monitoring (also referred to in the AITHS as a unique identifier) was recommended by focus group members as essential to track improvements in services for Travellers and other groups. There are some initiatives currently underway in three areas of the Southern Trust and within other agencies but the need was acknowledged for it to be higher on the political agenda and driven from the OFMDFM as a cross cutting interdepartmental initiative. The AITHS (2010, p.171) identified potential drawbacks to ethnic monitoring as a result of Traveller fears that disclosing ones identity might lead to discrimination, compounded by a fear of written information which many, for literacy reasons, cannot verify. The study recommends providing reassurance to Travell ers that the overall result will be positive and raising healthcare professionals awareness of the issue. The Australian Royal College of General Practitioners (2006) recommended that practices routinely record ethnic identification of Aboriginal and Torr es Straight Islanders to improve patient care. (164) Chapter 6 CONCLUSION (165) Conclusion This study began with a literature review that uncovered worldwide inequalities in mens health . These deepen considerably for indigenous and nomadic men. It also explored cultural and service barriers to accessing services and identified models of best practice. The All Ireland Traveller Health Study (2010) highlighted Irish Traveller men were dying (aged 61.7 ) 15.1 years earlier than Irish men in general. This life expectancy is better than Aboriginal men who are dying 20.3 years earlier (aged 56.3 years) than non - indigenous me n, but worse than Mori and First Nations men in the USA and Canada (Adams 2011). It has been evident that Traveller mens health has been neglected in Ireland with a concomitant striking shortened life expectancy . Health studies which have engaged Traveller men have been rare. Action research methodology enabled exploratory intensive research, innovative engagement and an opportunity to influence relevant agency policy and practice. Structured interviews co -designed by Traveller Advisors elicited qualitative and quantitative data on demography, lifestyle, mental health, mortality, access to services, health information and groups that would interest men. Findings were presented to two focus groups , internal and external to the health sector , to explore actions relevant agencies could take to improve the mens health status. (166) Findings highli ghted the complexity of the problem with no single reason emerging for dying 15 years early, but many interrelated factors requiring multi -faceted solutions. This study concludes that a multi -agency long term strategy will be required to tackle the issue o f Traveller mens life expectancy, with Traveller male engagement at its heart. The National Mens Health Policy (2008 -2013) (Richardson and Carroll, 2008) contains a useful framework for future development with its focus on social determinants of health , male engagement, masculinity and gender, community development, health promotion/ prevention, primary care, interagency work, tackling mens health from a strengths perspective, and supporting men to become more active citizens and advocates. However the p olicy needs to be adapted to a Northern Ireland context , as issues of sectarianism, racism and discrimination need to be tackled within the context of NI legislation and governmental structures. A shift in attitudes is also required by the general population. (167) CHAPTER 7 RECOMMENDATIONS (168) Recommendations 1. Policies to tackle 15 year gap in life expectancy (including racism and discrimination) 1.1. DHSSPS should resource a long term interagency Traveller mens health strategy to tackle the shortened Traveller male life expectancy and other health findings from the AITHS , building on the principles of social dete rminants of health, male engagement, masculinity and gender, community development, health promotion/ prevention, primary care, interagency work, tackling mens health from a strengths perspe ctive, and supporting men to become more active agents and advoca tes. This could be incorporated into a wider mens health strategy incorporating specific elements to tackle racism and discrimination. A Traveller champion is needed in the Assembly. 1.2. The researcher endorses ECNIs recommendations to strengthen racial discrimination laws to bring them into line with the Equality Act 2010, a refreshed racial equality strategy led by OFMDFM and the Executive to address negative public attitudes through the Cohesion and Social Integration (CSI) Strate gy. Travellers have also raised concerns about their community portrayal in programmes like My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding and there is a need for alternative programmes to represent diversity within Traveller culture. (169) 1.3. The Department of Justice (DOJ) needs to finalise its strategy on hate crime. This should include capacity building of vulnerable groups such as Travellers so that they are aware of their rights and the supports available, and know how to report hate crime. 1.4. ECNI should increase the capacity of Traveller men to tackle discrimination through Citizenship training with TSGs and increase the number of Traveller men taking discrimination cases to the courts, through increased opportunities for engagement. 1.5. Local statutory and voluntary agencies should use the PHA/ HSCB Community Development Strategy (2012) to encourage Traveller men to come forward and become more involved in their own community and engage with agencies who work to improve Travellers qualit y of life . 1.6. The Traveller Education Task Force needs to address bullying in its forthcoming action plan. 1.7. More support is needed for the integration of Travellers into communities, jobs and agencies by statutory, voluntary and community agencies. Employers should be encoura ged to use the equality laws to increase the employ ment of Travellers. 1.8. Young Traveller males need to be supported to report alleged discrimination in schools, colleges or workplaces (170) and to atten d capacity building courses on citizenship, when available. 2. Community infrastructure 2.1. Integrated planning across agencies and government departments at area and regional level is critical. Continued financial support for the existing community infrastructure is a pre -requisite for future work with Travellers due to the se groups knowledge of the local Traveller community and their trusted relationships. 3. Male Engagement 3.1. Employment of male workers (preferably Traveller) by statutory or voluntary organisations to work with Traveller men on the social determinants of health including education, employment, training, lifestyle, discrimination, recreation and access to services is recommended. 3.2 Volunteering opportunities should be explored for Traveller men to increase their employment prospects. 3.3 Developing projects such as Mens Sheds as a method of increasing male engagement should be actively explored by TSGs and other relevant agencies. (171) 4. Education and Training 4.1. Travellers need to be able to see the tangible benefits of remaining in Further Education and Training and to recognise that qualifications in trades can take up to 3 years to complete . The existing trend in short term courses leading to qualifications is welcomed and should be built on. 4.2. The All Ireland Travelle r Health Study identified education as the single biggest factor that Travellers felt would improve their health. Literacy and IT are essential skills which some Travellers would prefer to be delivered on a one to one basis. IT training would also help men with entrepreneurial skills of buying and selling e.g. learning about e -bay. It is also relevant for many other areas e.g. driving t heory exam . 4.3. Educational and training providers should work with TSGs and local Travellers to develop new courses at times and in venues which would suit Traveller men. Small group training sessions at various locations throughout the region , tailored to mens needs , should be provided where possible, preferably during the winter to maximize Traveller participation acknowledg ing seasonal work/ travel patterns. 4.4 Ultimately Traveller men should be trained and employed to deliver courses as there is a need to develop role models. (172) 4.5 The TETF in partnership with DE has a key role in developing an agreed action plan to improve educa tional outcomes for Traveller children . 4.6 Belong should continue to be resourced to provide support for 7-12 year old children in order to tackle anti -bullying, cultural competence and educational support. 5. Hazardous substances . 5.1. Health and Safety courses relevant to Travellers should continue to be delivered by the Southern Regional College. 5.2. Travellers should be encouraged to take part in the Steps to Work Programme organized by agencies like Wade Training . One of the be nefits of participation is that expenses can be paid towards health and safety equipment. Another benefit is to gain a route t o HGV training. 5.3 It is recommended that CCEA examines its health and safety programmes to explore opportunities to address Traveller cultural needs. (173) 6. Fitness 6.1. It is recognised that some Traveller men already engage in activities which increase their fitness including walking, hunting and training horses. 6.2. Work is needed with local Councils and GAA clubs to improve Traveller mens access to facilities , including handball. 6.3 Sports clubs need to be more proactive in welcoming Traveller men into a wider range of facilities . 7. Blood pressure and cholesterol checks 7.1. Doctors, nurses and pharmacists should continue to offer blood pressure and cholesterol checks to Traveller men in locations and at times that suit them. Strokes and heart disease were cited as the cause of 25% of T raveller deaths in the AITHS. 7.2. There will be other opportunities in 2012 -2013 for ma le health screening utilising a British Heart Foundation Programme. This will be delivered by Craigavon Traveller Support Committee. (174) 8. Diet 8.1. Despite the fact that most Traveller men had good awareness of healthy and unhealthy food , some still chose unhealthy options such as fries and carry outs. Traveller women have an important role in selecting food for the family meal. It is recommended that more training is offered such as Cook It Programmes. 9. Drugs and Alcohol 9.1. It is recommended that more Drugs and Alcohol awareness programmes be offered to Travellers in school and in the community. 9.2. Action is needed by the justice system to enforce stiffer penalties and reduce availability of drugs . 10. Smoking 10.1. Reducing the high smoking rates could prevent respiratory infections and lung cancer (the second highest cause of death in the AITHS). Smoking Cessation Services should work more closely with TSGs and Travellers to promote their services, with more outreach to be considered . (175) 10.2. Targets to reduce smoking amongst Travellers need to be included in Tobacco Action plans. 10.3. Opportunities for the Man Alive Programme to provide cancer screening should be maximised by TSWs. 11. Traveller culture 11.1. TSGs and training providers should offer cultural awareness training to the public and relevant agencies. This should include information about Traveller family values, nomadism, religion, trades, equality and discrimination. 12. Stress and depression 12.1. In common with men in general, some Traveller men dont talk about their personal problems, stress and hardship and need encouragement to do so. Travellers expressed a preference to do this on a one to one or small grou p basis. 12.2. Revision of the HSCBs LES and TSG work should take this into consideration. (176) 13. Domestic violence 13.1. Domestic violence was perceived as being high amongst Travelle rs and has a negative impact on mental health. Support services are sometimes needed and should be better promoted and easy to access when required. 14. Suicide 14.1. Suicide support services are not well known amongst Travellers across the southern area and awareness needs to be better promoted. 15. Access to primary care and people with cures 15.1. The positive regard in which 90% of the men held their GPs and nurses was seen by focus group members as one of the most encouraging results of the research. 95% turned to health professionals for information. Focus group member s were also surprised by the high number who had been to the GP surgery within the last month. At the moment there are 8 GP Practices taking part in a \"Locally Enhanced Scheme\" which encourages GPs to pay special attentio n to the health n eeds of the Traveller Commu nity. (177) It is recommended that this scheme be reviewed and disseminated to more GP practices in the Southern area and regionally. 15.2 It is recommended by the agencies that folk medicine is acknowledged and further exp lored. Benefits and risks for health and safety should be identified. 16 Health Information 16.1. Family members Given that 75% said that they received health information from family members it is recommended that more Lay Health workers, male and female , are employed. 16.2. Ethnic monitoring (Unique identifiers) Ethnic monitoring within the health service needs to be improved and extended in order to assess the take -up and use of agency services. Given Traveller fears in the AITHS that disclosing identity might lead to discrimination, the study recommends providing reassurance to Travellers that ethnic monitoring is a positive step in improving health outcomes. Healthcare professionals need awarene ss of Traveller fears. (178) 16.3. TV Given that 70% received health information from TV it is recommended that agencies use TV when possible to convey health messages. 16.4. Culturally relevant information More Traveller friendly literature needs to be developed i n partnership with Travellers . Alternative methods such as DVDs may also be considered. 17 Groups that would interest men 17.1. Enterprises Given the history of Traveller mens preference for self - employment, social enterprises should be explored. 17.2. Venue There was a mixed response from relevant agencies . Some recommend ed more outreach services to Travellers . On the other hand , Southern Regional College classes have now moved from community venues to the c ollege campus . A pragmatic approach , based on availability of venue and suitable times for Traveller men , is recommended. (179) 18 Future research 18.1. Future research should continue to employ action research principles to engage Traveller men. 18.2. Employing Traveller men to conduct research with adequate training to overcome issues of confidentiality and validity should be considered. 18.3. Research into the impact of sectarianism on attitudes towards Travellers within NI is recommended . 18.4. M ore research on the prevalence of suicide amongst NI Traveller men is required. 18.5. The benefits and risks of folk medicine should be explored . 18.6. There is a need for further research into Traveller male engagement , exploring models of intervention such as Mens Sheds .

Demonstrate a substantially enhanced and sustained level of competence in a defined area of work, takin g a leading role in developing and promoting good practice, drawing on international perspectives to inform this This was achieved through a literature review comparing adult Irish Traveller males with nomadic/ indigenous males including Gypsy, Roma, Abori ginal, and First Nations from Canada and USA, and generic mens health literature from Canada, Australia, Europe, Republic of Ireland and the Southern Trust area. The author took a lead role in developing good practice in the area with minimal qualitative N.I. research available and traditionally very low levels of Traveller male engagement. The All Ireland Traveller Health Study (2010, p.174) recommended - \"adoption of a gendered strategy \" with \" mens health issues ... addressed specifically \", and \"An emphas is on empowerment and promotion of self - esteem for young Travellers of both sexes to improve mental health and wellbeing, but particularly drawing in the engagement of men - this requires a comprehensive cross - sectorial approach to facilitate work opportuni ty, break down the substance misuse problems and engage men in health service participation\". (201) Utilising action research methodology, 12 Traveller Advisors (n= 8 male, 4 female) and 20 Traveller men participated at advisory and implementation stages. A fur ther 14 focus group members represented a cross section of agencies including the Public Health Agency, Health and Social Care Board, Southern Health and Social Care Trust, Southern Regional College, Equality Commission NI, Wade Training, Cooperation and W orking Together and Safe and Well. The research covered an extensive range of topics including demography, lifestyle, mental health and mortality, access to services, health information and groups that would interest men. 5. Work creatively, innovatively and effectively, taking a leading role in the context of risk, uncertainty, conflict and contradiction, or where there are complex challenges and a need to make informed, independent and balanced judgements Literature on adult Irish Traveller male health is scant and, as female Travellers take traditional roles within the family with health matters, this research was complex and challenging from the onset. Innovative, creative methods of engagement were required, attention paid to low levels of literacy, f amily dynamics and a high risk that the target group would not choose to engage. In relation to risk, Traveller men have a suicide rate that is 6.6 times higher than the general population (AITHS, 2010) and with a mortality rate 15.1 years earlier than Iri sh men, they are a clearly a group with significant risk factors. (202) Following action research principles the researcher consulted with Traveller advisors about terms of reference and content of structured interviews prior to ethical consent. This caused nervousness from one academic in case it would be perceived by OREC that the research had commenced prior to approval. The researcher presented evidence to ORECNI that the Tripartite Council of Policy on Ethics in Canada established the principles of ownership , control, access, and possession (OCAP) when doing research with Aboriginal communities and within this context prior consultation was considered best practice. This was referenced by OREC when granting approval. The researcher was advised by Traveller A dvisors not to use focus groups with Travellers if he wished to achieve maximum honesty and to conduct the research before the brighter evenings in March to avoid potential loss of interviewees due to patterns of travelling and seasonal work. He had to wor k flexibly and efficiently to meet his target of 20 men from 5 towns, different family groups and different ages. He also secured resources from Safe and Well for the production of a DVD and launch of research to disseminate results and overcome the 35% il literacy rate in the sample. 7 Travellers including 4 Advisors and 3 musicians took part in the DVD along with 5 Agency representatives. 9. Use critical knowledge and comprehensive understanding of service users and carers issues to actively promote, deve lop and implement service - user and where appropriate, carers rights (203) and participation, in line with the goals of choice, independence and empowerment An action research approach was used which involved Traveller men from the beginning in designing all re search questions and advising on the direction of this research. A summary of the All Ireland Traveller Health Study results relevant to Traveller men was taken to the first Traveller advisor and questions formulated. These were subsequently refined throug h input from an additional 11 Travellers. Input on content ensured cultural relevance, participation, choice and empowerment and helped to overcome literacy issues. This was evidenced through the researchers subsequent ability to access the research samp le, which were mostly obtained through Advisors, with additional men recommended from Traveller Support Groups. Critical knowledge of service users issues was gained from a comprehensive literature review. This ensured that from the onset a social determi nants/ community development perspective incorporating social justice, anti -discriminatory and anti -racist values combined with health promotion/ prevention approaches was employed. These principles proved critical in achieving maximum engagement. (204) Appendix 2 Key terms and concepts Key terms Definition of \"relevant agencies\" \"Relevant agencies\" will be defined in this study as statutory, voluntary and community sector agencies that provide services to Travellers in the Southern Trust area of Northern I reland. Definition of Mens Health The World Health Organization (1946, p.2) defines a healthy man as one who is empowered to experience optimum \" physical, mental and social well -being and not merely the absence of illness\" and who experiences health as a resource for everyday living. Key concepts Health inequality and inequity Health inequalities can be defined as \"differences in health status or in the distribution of health determinants between different population groups\" (WHO, 2012, p.2). It is importa nt to distinguish between inequality in health and inequity. Some health inequalities are attributable to biological variations or free choice and others are attributable to the external environment and conditions mainly outside the control of the individu als, concerned (leading to health inequities). Both concepts are relevant to this research as it will deal with lifestyle and social determinants perspectives. (205) Social determinants of health Social determinants of health are the economic and social conditions under which people live which determine their health. They are societal risk conditions, rather than individual risk factors that either increase or decrease the risk for a disease, for example for cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes. According to Wilkinson and Marmot (2003, p.7) health policy was once thought to be about little more than the provision and funding of medical care: the social determinants of health were discussed only among academics. This is now changing. While medical ca re can prolong survival and improve prognosis after some serious diseases, more important for the health of the population as a whole are the social and economic conditions that make people ill and in need of medical care in the first place. Nevertheless, universal access to medical care is clearly one of the social determinants of health. Primary care The concept of Primary Health Care was established at the joint WHO / UNICEF conference in Alma Ata in 1975. Primary Care \" is the first level of contact of individuals, the family and community with the national health system bringing health care as close as possible to where people live and work, and constitutes the first element of a continuing health care process (WHO, 1975: VI). Primary Health Care has be en identified and used as an innovative approach to health care in the developing world. According to The Department of Health and Children (2002) there has been a growing interest and demand for such a service in the (206) developed world as evidence from studi es indicates that marginalised populations are suffering disproportionately from poor health and have less access to health care services. Community development Community development is defined as: \"Enabling people to organise and work together to identif y their own needs and aspirations; take action to exert influence on the decisions which affect their lives; improve the quality of their own lives, the communities in which they live, and societies of which they are a part. It is a long term value based p rocess which aims to address imbalances in power and bring about change founded on social justice, equality and inclusion\" (ONeill, 2012, p.8). Community development practitioners work alongside people in communities to help build relationships with key p eople and organisations and to identify common concerns. They create opportunities for the community to learn new skills and, by enabling people to act together, community development practitioners help to foster social inclusion and equality. As Action Research is founded on community development principles this concept is relevant to the research methodology. Asset based approaches An asset -based approach to community development has gained ground in recent years as a corrective to the more familiar d eficit approach, which focuses on the problems, needs and deficiencies in a community such as deprivation, exclusion, crime, anti-social behaviour, illness and health -damaging behaviours. (207) (ONeill, 2012, p.5). Focusing entirely on deficits can create a sense of hopelessness amongst communities and resignation amongst professionals. As a result, a community can feel disempowered and dependent; people can become passive recipients of services rather than active in their own and their families lives. Cle arly it remains important to be aware of needs and disadvantage and to narrow inequalities, but emphasising assets gives a better balance and generates confidence and aspiration. In the context of health and social care, an asset is any factor or resource which enhances the ability of individuals, communities and populations to maintain and sustain health and wellbeing and meet identified needs. These assets can operate at the level of the individual, family or community as protective and promoting factors to buffer against lifes stresses. Health Promotion Health promotion has been defined as \"the process of enabling people to increase control over their health and its determinants, and thereby improve their health\" (Health Promotion International, 2006, p .10). Health promotion and community development approaches have many common threads and The Promoting Wellbeing Department within which this research has taken place has amalgamated staff from both traditions. Racism, sectarianism and discrimination Racis m refers to the institutional and individual practices that create and reinforce oppressive systems of race relations whereby people and institutions engaging in discrimination (208) adversely restrict by judgement and action, the lives of those against whom the y discriminate (Berkman et al, 2000, pp.36 -75). Discrimination refers to \"the process by which a member, or members, of a socially defined group is, or are, treated differently (especially unfairly) because of his/her/their membership of that group \" (Jary &Jary, 1995 p. 169). This unfair treatment arises from \"socially derived beliefs each [group] holds about the other\" and \"patterns of dominance and oppression, viewed as expressions of a struggle for power and privilege\" (Marshall G, 1994, pp.125 -6). Secta rianism is \"bigotry, discrimination or hatred arising from attaching importance to perceived differences between subdivisions within a group, such as between different denominations of a religion, class, regional or factions of a political movement \"(Wikip edia 2012).

My name is Fergal OBrien and I work as a manager in the Health Service in a team that delivers Health Promo tion and Community Development services in the Newry and Mourne area. I am also involved in groups that plan services with Travellers in Armagh, Dungannon, Craigavon, Newry and Coalisland. I am undertaking research as part of an educational degree called a Masters to help improve the service I can provide. What is the purpose of the research? Research called the All Ireland Traveller Health Study was completed in 2010. It showed that Travel ler men were dying 15 years earlier than country men. I want to find out what Traveller men and relevant services can do to improve this. Why have I been invited? I need to get 20 Traveller men from different families, accommodation types, ages and areas to take part. You have been recommended by: 1. ................................. (Name of Traveller) who advised me on what questions to ask in this interview (244) or 2. ........................ (Name of staff member) from........................... (Name of Traveller Support Group) Do I have to take part? It is up to you do decide if you want to take part in this research. Your taking part is voluntary and you are free to withdraw at any time, without giving a reason and it will not affect any of the support you receive. What will happen to me if I take part? I will meet with you at a time and place that suits you. I will go through this information sheet with you and you can ask me about anything that is unclear. If you agree to take part I will ask you to sign a Consent Form. I will provide you with you info rmation regarding useful services and then begin an interview with you. Our discussion may last one to one and half hours. I hope to have all my research finished by September 2012. What do I have to do? I will ask you a list of questions and write do wn your answers. The questions have been prepared by Traveller Advisors. If you want to know their names, just ask. What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part? There is a risk that you might tell me something that relates to child pr otection or a vulnerable adult. I would be duty bound to report an issue like this to the relevant authorities to ensure that the child or vulnerable adult is protected from any harm. I would (245) have to report an instance of professional misconduct for the same reason. In the instance of illegal behaviour I must also report this to relevant authorities. For example if you told me you were dealing with illegal drugs I would have to report this to the PSNI. What are the possible benefits of taking part? You will learn more about how to stay healthy. You will get a chance to make some suggestions about how services for Traveller men can be improved. Will I be out of pocket for taking part in the research? No you will not be out of pocket. The Trust has a policy w hich covers your expenses if you incur meal costs, childcare or travel expenses. What happens when the research study stops? Once I have seen 20 Traveller men I will discuss the results and recommendations with staff within the Health Service and other support services to see what decisions can be made. If you tell me something very important I may want to use your comments in the report I will be writing up. I will only do this if I have already received your consent to do so. The report may be shared by others in the Trust and at University. What if there is a problem? If you have a problem with the way I have conducted the interview please let me know and we can try and sort it out. If you are still (246) unhappy you can contact my supervisor, Mark Irwin at 028 3741 2642 and he will assist you to make a complaint. Will my taking part in the study be kept confidential? Your taking part in the study is totally confidential. I will use a code number on any inf ormation you provide instead of your name. Only I will know that information. All information you give me will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in my office that only I have access to therefore you cannot be identified in reports by anything you say u nless you have given me permission to do so. This information has to be held securely for 5 years and then destroyed by confidential means. The only limitation to confidentiality would be as described above that if a child protection, vulnerable adult, pro fessional misconduct or illegal issue became evident in the course of the interview I would have to report this to the relevant authorities. You would be fully consulted and informed about any action that is required to be taken. What will happen if I don t want to carry on with the study? You are free to withdraw at any time during our conversation. You will let me know at that time if I can use the information you have already given me. Who is organising and funding the research? The research is being fu nded by the Social Services Training Unit. (247) Who has reviewed the study? All research in the NHS is looked at by an independent group of people called a Research Ethics Committee to protect your interests. This study has been reviewed and given favourable opinion by the Office for Research Ethics Committees Northern Ireland (NI). The study has also been approved by the Research Governance Committee of the Southern Health and Social Care Trust (the Trust) and the University of Ulster Ethics Committee.

(Date) Participant Information Sheet Title of Study: Dying fifteen years early: what can Traveller men and relevant agencies do? Introduction: My name is Fergal OBrien and I work as a manager in Promoting Wellbeing Team in the Southern Health and Socia l Care Trust. Our team delivers Health Promotion and Community Development services in the Newry and Mourne area. I am also involved in groups that plan services with Travellers in Armagh, Dungannon, Craigavon, Newry and Coalisland. (258) I am undertaking this r esearch as part of an Application of Research Methods in Social Work Module at the University of Ulster leading to an MSC Professional Development in Social Work. The principal researcher is Dr Anne Campbell from the University of Ulster. What is the purpo se of the research? The All Ireland Traveller Health Study was completed in 2010. It highlighted that Traveller men were dying 15.1 years earlier than men in the general population. I want to find out what Traveller men and relevant services can do to imp rove this. I have already completed interviews with 20 Traveller men to find out their views on what they feel can be done to improve their lifestyles and I am using a summary of these findings to meet with relevant agencies to establish if there is anyth ing we can do to support improvements. I now need to complete discussions with 2 Focus Groups. In one Focus Group I have selected 10 professionals from the Trust Traveller Action Group and in another I have selected 10 members of the Southern Area Action with Travellers group. All participants were selected according to their relevance to findings from the structured interviews with Travellers. Why have I been invited? You have been invited as a result of your expertise and the relevance of you and your gr oup/ agency/ department to the findings from the interviews that were held with the 20 Traveller men in the first stage of this research. (259) Do I have to take part? It is up to you do decide if you want to take part in this research. Your taking part is volu ntary and you are free to withdraw at any time, without giving a reason What will happen to me if I take part? If, after reading this information you agree to take part I will ask you to sign a Consent Form to take part in a Focus Group. At the Focus Group , I will present an overview of the research to date including aims and objectives, lessons from the literature review and preliminary results and recommendations from interviews with Traveller men. You will be asked to answer seven questions in relation to findings from the interviews with the Traveller men in the first stage of this research. Our discussion may last up to one and half hours. With your consent, the Focus Group will be audiotaped and later transcribed. You will receive a copy of the t ranscription to enable you to verify the content. You may say something that is of importance and which I may wish to quote in my final report. Again, this will only be with your consent. You will not be identified personally but reference will be made to your group/agency/department. My research must be concluded by September 2012. (260) What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part? I do not foresee any disadvantages and risks to you of taking part. The only burden will be on the time needed for you to participate in the research. What are the possible benefits of taking part? You will get a chance to make some suggestions about how services (including your own) can be improved for Traveller men to hopefully increase their life span. What happens when the research study stops? Responses from todays focus group will be audiotaped and transcribed for analysis. Once I have analysed the findings from 2 focus groups I will give you the chance to check the accuracy of quotations and recommendations. To enable achievement of the tight timescale for the report I would ask you to confirm your own and your group/ agency/ managers endorsement w ithin two weeks of receipt of my findings. You will receive a final copy of my report. The results will be published in a user friendly format for Traveller men and in an International Journal. What if there is a problem? If you have a problem with the wa y I have conducted the focus group please let me know and we can try and sort it out. If you are still unhappy you can contact my supervisor, Mark Irwin at 028 3741 2642 and he will assist you to make a complaint. (261) Will my taking part in the study be kept confidential? Although no one will be identified personally job roles, groups, departments and agencies will be identifiable. There will be a series of recommendations to Traveller men and relevant departments and agencies within health, housing, education, local government and the voluntary/ community sector. What will happen if I don't want to carry on with the study? You are free to withdraw at any time during our conversation. You will let me know at that time if I can use the information you have already given me. Who is organising and funding the research? The research is being funded by the Southern Health & Social Care Trust Social Services Training Unit. Who has reviewed the study? All research in the NHS is looked at by an independent gro up of people called a Research Ethics Committee to protect your interests. This study has been reviewed and given favourable opinion by the Office for Research Ethics Committees Northern Ireland (NI). The study has also been approved by the Southern Healt h and Social Care Trust Research Governance Committee and the University of Ulster Ethics Committee. The conduct of the study will be monitored by the Southern HSC Trust Research Governance Committee.

One member of staff had a greater awareness of the scale of inequalities the group faced due to having worked with the community in the voluntary sector for nineteen years. This person indicated that he was not surprised at the findings in the \"Dying 15 Years Early Research\" and made the following observations - The impetus generated by the Promoting Social In clusion Working Group on Travellers had dissipated and there was a need now to look to a revised racial equality strategy to address issues identified. The situation was not helped by the difficult funding climate for remaining Traveller Support groups and There was not enough work supporting capacity building to enable Travellers to have a more effective role in determining their own future. The Commission would expect that Public Authorities under Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act would address Tra veller issues (where relevant to their functions) when completing their audit of inequalities and, in drawing up an action plan. (334) Action taken to date A summary of some of the Commissions work in progressing Travellers equality is as follows - The Comm ission has called for a strengthening of the racial discrimination laws to bring them into line with the Equality Act 2010 (21/3/2012) In the Shadow report (July 2011) to UN CERD Committee regarding the UK Governments 18th Periodic Report - the Commission has called for Increased legislative protection Development of targeted action plans A refreshed racial equality strategy Raised concerns regarding failure of Government to provide sufficient, adequate, or appropriate accommodation for Travellers Drew attention to the longstanding and unparalleled educational disadvantage for Traveller children Raised concerns regarding the decrease in life expectancy of Traveller men since 1987 and the suicide rate for Traveller men being almost seven times higher tha n the general population Called for Department of Education to progress an action plan arising from the Report of the Taskforce on Traveller Education Highlighted higher mortality rates for Traveller men and women (335) Noted negative attitudes towards Trave llers amongst sample of public via equality awareness survey and called for the Executive to address this through CSI strategy and to ensure that the promotion of good relations and combating prejudice are targeted and funded. In the Commissions submissi on to the Framework Convention for the protection of National Minorities Advisory Committee on the UKs third monitoring report (June 201), the Commission Called for the reform of the racial equality legislation Highlighted the gaps between the protection s provided in the NI Race Relations legislation and the GB Equality Act 2010 In the Commissions ECNI response to the Governments Draft Race Equality Strategy (May 2005), it called on The strategy to provide better equality outcomes in key impact areas such as health and education Recognition of sedentarism as defined by PSI Working Group on Travellers in 2000 The Commission made representations to DOE on HS3 of PPS12 which allows for temporary accommodation in the countryside for Travellers but does not allow planning permission to be granted for a permanent serviced site for a Traveller family even where they have purchased the relevant land. The Commission undertook research on Trav eller accommodation and published \"Outlining Minimum Standards for Traveller Accommodation\" (2009). It also engaged with relevant stakeholders in this area. (336) The Commission produced a Good practice guide to promote racial equality in planning for Travelle rs (October 2004) It responded to a consultation on unauthorised encampments legislation and made subsequent recommendations to the Minister on delaying the use of the powers in the Order until sufficient and culturally appropriate accommodation provision was progressed. The Chief Commissioner, Bob Collins was a member of the Task Force on Traveller Education and staff were involved in the different sub groups. Staff worked closely with the Department of Education on the revision of the Departments Trave ller education circular. Contributed to a Transnational project - ROMA EDEM Project and held Roundtables on Education and Employment. Produced two reports (2005 -2006) Recommendations made to improve access formed the basis for the Chief Commissioners engagement with the Permanent Secretary and Department of Education. Section 75 To date the Commission has responded to Public Authoritys consultation on equality impact assessment on the following policies - o Unauthorised encampments o In the education fie ld to identify the needs of Travellers o DOE planning reform (337) The Commission has also highlighted key inequalities experienced by Travellers in its responses to draft Section 75 audits of inequalities and action plans of a range of public authorities; includ ing those of OFMDFM, Department of Education, Department of Employment and Learning, the Staff Commission for Education and Library Boards, Department of Health and Social Services and Dep artment for Social Development. Communications and Promotional Work The Promotion and Education Division co -ordinated a Traveller stakeholder engagement campaign, Traveller Focus Week for four years (2007 - 2010). The campaign drew on the \"Citizen Traveller\" Campaign in the south and was a call to action that engaged key stakeholders and involved partnership work within the community. It was successful in terms of providing platforms for the Commission and stakeholder partners to highlight continuing issues of discrimination for Travellers and in promoting good race relat ions A media training event organised in 2011 by Communications and Promotions for internal staff was attended by a young Traveller woman who settled a discrimination case. Materials produced at this event were subsequently used in a successful informati on event held on 16th September 2011on Traveller Rights at Farset International Belfast. Attendees at this event were mainly female. Along with other contributors Commission staff provided inputs to the Traveller Equality and Human Rights training program me developed by Geraldine Scullion Consulting for An Munia Tober. (338) This course consisted of eleven 2 hour sessions that ran for 12 weeks during the period September - December 2009 The Commission has a representative on SAAT, a strategic alliance of organi sations in the southern area working collectively for appropriate actions to improve health, education, accommodation and quality of life outcomes for Travellers. Individual Cases of Discrimination Currently Funded Traveller Cases Of the 33 Race cases currently assisted by the Commission, 24 are brought by Irish Travellers and 1 other person because of their association with Irish Travellers. In terms of gender breakdown of the currently funded Race cases only 2 of the 24 cases are from men. In both of these cases there are other female Travellers who have brought related cases and so the men are part of a wider litigation group. In terms of the nature of the currently funded cases, all involve provision of goods, facilities and services. None involve employment matters. This would be a very different profile of funded cases compared with other Race cases and other discrimination areas. The nature of the services primarily relate to bars and clubs (14) and shops (13). In addition, the vast majority of cases come to us in groups rather than 1 individual seeking assistance for an individual case. Again this would be a particularly distinct factor for Traveller cases. (339) The funded Traveller cases are solely related to the individuals Racial group. We do not have any other hybrid or inter -sectional discrimination cases from Travellers which is a distinct factor for Traveller cases. For example we have seen an increasing trend of cases brought by female migrant workers alleging sex and race discrimination which indicates their awareness. Specific Needs for Travellers in Litigation The Legal Team has attempted to meet the needs of Travellers in providing our services. This has involved more targeted training of Traveller groups, direct outreach work, remova l of form filling requirements and adjustments for literacy needs, meeting Travellers in their homes, arranging consultations with barristers in their homes, collecting Travellers to bring them to meetings, more frequent telephone communication and more fo cus on hearing preparation to ensure consistent telling of their experiences. In our experience, Traveller women have been much more likely to attend outreach events and to bring forward cases. In particular we have found that Traveller women take on a le ad role in any litigation and they are the main point of contact for the group. This certainly improves the quality of communication with the legal team and assists in the progress of the case where a central person will take lead responsibility for gathe ring the required information for the legal case. Case Outcomes In the Annual Report year of 2011/12 there were 8 Race settlements of the total 50 settlements. Of the 8 race cases, 4 (340) were brought by Travellers. 2 of these involved Travellers complainin g about service in a shop (1 male, 1 female); 1 involved a male Traveller not being allowed to rent a private house, and 1 involved a female Irish Traveller who was harassed at work because she was a Traveller and a woman (hybrid case). Total compensation recovered for these Travellers was \u00a321,900. There was 1 Traveller case which went to hearing in the County Court and this was unsuccessful - it was brought by Traveller woman regarding allegedly racist comments made in a shop. In the Annual Report year o f 2010/11 there were 12 Race settlements of which 5 were brought by Irish Travellers. 3 of these cases were brought by 3 sisters regarding allegations of shoplifting and 2 were brought by women regarding treatment in a shop. Total compensation recovered was \u00a35,500. There were no Court/Tribunal decisions concerning Travellers in this reporting year. One of the difficulties in gathering information relating to Travellers is that there is no central database concerning County Court decisions which deal with goods, facilities and services cases. In the Tribunal system which deals with employment matters, the Tribunal itself produces statistics and records of decisions by area of discrimination and it would be possible to gather data specifically on Traveller decisions. There is no such central database in the County Court system. This means that the Commission does not know how many cases were brought by (341) Travellers and the success rates. Legal ai d for these cases is available.

Traveller Health Cases One Traveller health case was brought by a male Traveller concerning his alleged treatment by doctors at a hospital following a road traffic accident. He alleged that the medical staff had been unsympathetic to him because he was a Traveller. The Commission had assisted the case but withdrew following a negative opinion on the merits of the case. The Commission has not received any other cases regarding services provided by GPs or health professionals.
