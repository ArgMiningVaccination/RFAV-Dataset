In an age when the speed of information can often outstrip the speed of verification, the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us that it is crucial to cut through the noise and focus on facts, a lesson that we must heed in order to protect societies from the impact of drugs. Drug use killed almost half a million people in 2019, while drug use disorders resulted in 18 million years of healthy life lost, mostly due to opioids. Serious and often lethal illnesses are more common among drug users, particularly those who inject drugs, many of whom are living with HIV and Hepatitis C. The illicit drug trade also continues to hold back economic and social development, while disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable and marginalized, and it constitutes a fun - damental threat to security and stability in some parts of the world. Despite the proven dangers, drug use persists and, in some contexts, proliferates. Over the past year, around 275 million people have used drugs, up by 22 per cent from 2010. By 2030, demographic factors project the number of people using drugs to rise by 11 per cent around the world, and as much as 40 per cent in Africa alone. There is often a substantial disconnect between real risks and public perception. In some parts of the world for example, can - nabis products have almost quadrupled in potency, and yet the percentage of adolescents who perceive cannabis as harmful has dropped by as much as 40 per cent, despite the evidence linking regular use to health problems, particularly in young people, and despite the correlation between potency and harm. New psychoactive substances also continue to be a challenge, as markets witness the introduction of new drugs that are unpre - dictable and poorly understood. Regulatory and legislative steps have been successful in stemming the tide globally, but in low-income countries the problem is on the rise; between 2015 and 2019, South and Central America recorded a fivefold rise in the amount of new synthetic psychoactive substances seized, while seizures in Africa increased from minor to sub - stantial amounts. Strong increases were also reported in South and Southwest Asia as well as the Near and Middle East. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 crisis has pushed more than 100 million people into extreme poverty, and has greatly exacerbated unemployment and inequalities, as the world lost 114 million jobs in 2020. In doing, so it has created conditions that leave more people susceptible to drug use and to engaging in illicit crop cultivation. Furthermore, disparities in access to essential controlled med - icines around the world continue to deny relief to patients in severe pain. In 2019, four standard doses of controlled pain medication were available every day for every one million inhab - itants in West and Central Africa, in comparison to 32,000 doses in North America. In parallel, drug traffickers have quickly recovered from the initial setback caused by lockdown restrictions and are oper - ating at pre-pandemic levels once again. Access to drugs has also become simpler than ever with online sales, and major drug markets on the dark web are now worth some $315 mil - lion annually. Contactless drug transactions, such as through the mail, are also on the rise, a trend possibly accelerated by the pandemic. Communicating facts about drugs and promoting science-based interventions is an absolute necessity if we are to reduce demand and supply of drugs, while also facilitating access to controlled medicines for those in need. It is also the surest path to eliminating stigmatization and discrimination and providing adequate treatment, as seven in eight people who suffer from drug use disorders remain without appropriate care. At the UN Office on Drugs and Crime we are dedicated to pursu - ing and promoting fact-driven, human rights-based approaches to drug control and treatment. I am proud to present to you this World Drug Report, which embodies our commitment to raising awareness and combat - ing misinformation. It is my hope that this report will inform policymakers, practi - tioners, and the general public on the facts of the world drug problem, and provide them with a powerful tool to share evi - dence and information, and in doing so help save and preserve lives.

Countries and areas are referred to by the names that were in official use at the time the relevant data were collected. Since there is some scientific and legal ambiguity about the distinctions between \"drug use\" , \"drug use\" is used in the World Drug Report. The term \"misuse\" is used only to denote the non-medical use of prescription drugs. All uses of the word \"drug\" and the term \"drug use\" in the World Drug Report refer to substances controlled under the international drug control conventions, and their non-medical use. All analysis contained in the World Drug Report is based on the official data submitted by Member States to the UNODC through the annual report questionnaire unless indicated otherwise. The data on population used in the World Drug Report are taken from: World Population Prospects: The 2019 Revision (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division).

It contains the latest estimates of and trends in cannabis use, including an analysis of changes over time in cannabis use and risk perceptions. The booklet also includes an overview of the latest devel - opments in measures regulating the non-medical use of cannabis in Canada, Uruguay and some jurisdictions in the United States of America.With respect to opioids, the booklet discusses the over - laps between the various opioids, mostly in terms of demand dynamics. It also contains the latest estimates of and trends in opioid use at the global and regional levels, including an update on the availability of pharmaceuti- cal opioids for medical consumption. That is followed by an overview of the latest estimates of and trends in the supply of opiates, from the cultivation of opium poppy and production of opium to trafficking trends and routes, on the basis of seizures made in the subregions in which opiates are produced and along the routes to the main opiate markets. The booklet concludes with a review of the supply of other opioids, in particular the trafficking trends and routes for fentanyls and tramadol both at the global level and in the subregions most affected.SCOPE OF THE BOOKLET PERCEPTION AMONG ADOLESCENTS CANNABIS IS MORE POTENT BUT FEWER YOUNG PEOPLE SEE IT AS HARMFUL /eight.lf/zero.lf 9CANNABIS Cannabis supply Cannabis cultivation and production affects all regions Unlike other plant-based drugs, for which cultivation and production are concentrated in only a few countries, can - nabis is produced in almost all countries worldwide. In the period 2010-2019, the cultivation of cannabis plant was reported to UNODC either through direct indicators (such as the cultivation or eradication of cannabis plants and the dismantlement of cannabis-producing sites) or indirect indicators (such as the seizure of cannabis plants and the origin of cannabis seizures as reported by other Member States) by 151 countries, covering 97 per cent of the global population. Qualitative information on trends reported by Member States suggests that there was an expansion in global can - nabis cultivation over the period 2010-2017, followed by a decline in 2018 and then a moderate increase in 2019. Outdoor cultivation of cannabis continues to be more widespread than indoor cultiva- tion, but the increase in indoor cultivation is larger Available data suggest that outdoor cannabis cultiva - tion continues to be more widespread at the global level than indoor cannabis cultivation, a situation that did not change between the periods 2010-2014 and 2015-2019. Overall, 89 countries reported outdoor cannabis cultiva - tion and/or law enforcement activities linked to outdoor cannabis cultivation (such as eradication, seizures of can - nabis plants and seizures of cannabis-producing sites) in the period 2010-2019, while 65 countries reported data in relation to indoor cultivation. Some countries reported both indoor and outdoor cannabis cultivation. Whereas outdoor cannabis production is found around the globe, most reported indoor cultivation of cannabis continues to be concentrated in countries of Europe and North America (most notably the United States, followed by Canada) and, to a lesser extent, in countries of Central GLOBAL SEIZURES /two.lf/zero.lf/one.lf/nine.lf -/one.lf/two.lf% herb+/seven.lf% resin /two.lf/zero.lf/zero.lf million Change supply3 11and South America (including Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Uruguay). Beyond those regions, indoor cannabis cultivation is found in Oceania (Australia and New Zea- land) as well as in a number of countries and territories in Asia, including in the Near and Middle East/South-West Asia (Iran (Islamic Republic of), Israel and the State of Palestine), in East and South-East Asia (China, including Hong Kong, China, Japan and Mongolia), in Central Asia (Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan) and Transcaucasia (Armenia and Georgia). To date, no indoor cannabis cultivation has been reported to UNODC by countries in Africa. Qualitative information on trends reported by Member States also suggests that over the period 2012- 2019, the increase in indoor cannabis cultivation was larger than the increase in outdoor cultivation. In that period, 49 coun- tries (43 per cent of the countries that reported trends in indoor cultivation) reported an increase in indoor cultiva - tion, while 23 countries (20 per cent) reported a decrease, resulting in overall \"net growth\" of 23 per cent among all countries that reported indoor cannabis cultivation trends. That is more than three times the corresponding \"net growth\" in the proportion of countries that reported outdoor cannabis cultivation trends (7 per cent). Most of the increases in indoor cannabis cultivation were reported by countries in Europe and, to a lesser extent, by coun- tries in the Americas. Source countries for cannabis As most countries do not have systems in place to systematically monitor the area under cannabis cul- tivation, estimating the global area under cannabis cultivation is challenging. On the one hand, some countries report the total area under cannabis cul- tivation, but such estimates have severe limitations; on the other hand, existing indicators on seizures and eradication are widely available. Any indicator as it relates to a single country is insufficient to provide insight into the extent of cannabis cultivation and pro - duction, but when the indicators for various countries are analysed together, they can point to those coun- tries where the most significant cannabis cultivation is likely to exist.a Analysis of the various indicators over the period 2010-2019 suggests that the following countries are likely to have a significant area under cannabis cultivation in comparison with other coun- tries in the same region or subregion (given in order of importance, for each subregion): >Americas North America: Mexico, the United States of America and Canada South America: Paraguay, Brazil and Colombia Central America: Guatemala, Costa Rica and Honduras Caribbean: Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago >Africa Morocco, Egypt, South Africa, Nigeria, Eswatini and Ghana >Europe Western and Central Europe: the Netherlands, Spain, Czechia and Switzerland South-Eastern Europe: Albania, Turkey and Romania Eastern Europe: the Russian Federation and Ukraine >Asia Near and Middle East/South-West Asia: Afghanistan, Lebanon and Pakistan Central Asia: Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan Transcaucasia: Azerbaijan and Armenia South Asia: India and Nepal South-East Asia: the Philippines, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Thailand and Indonesia >Oceania Australia and New Zealand a Data for a number of direct indicators (e.g., \"area under cannabis cultivation\") and for indirect indicators cannabis herb and resin\") are available and have been combined to identify those countries likely to have a significant area under cannabis cultivation. 12 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2021Fig. 1 Qualitative information on trends in cannabis cultivation as reported by national experts, 2010-2019 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.

The global quanti - ties of cannabis (herb and resin) seized, excluding those reported in North America, were 44 per cent larger in 2019 than in 2009. In contrast to the decline in the quantities of cannabis (herb and resin) seized, qualitative information on trends reported by Member States (38 countries on average per year) suggests an upward trend in cannabis trafficking over the past decade, most notably after 2015, and the upward trend continued in 2019. This discrepancy could be the result of the set of countries reporting seizures being to some degree different from the set of countries reporting trends by means of qualitative information. It may also be an indication that the overall decline in the quantities of cannabis seized may be a result of the inter - diction of cannabis possibly becoming less of a priority for law enforcement agencies in a number of jurisdictions Quantities of cannabis seized continue to decline, although probably not due to reduced supply The reported numbers of seizures of cannabis (herb and resin) showed an upward trend over the first decade of the new millenium, albeit with annual fluctuations, fol- lowed in recent years by a more stable trend. By contrast, the quantities of cannabis (herb and resin) seized at the global level, fell by 8 per cent in 2019 to 5,174 tons, the fifth consecutive yearly decline. The quantities seized declined in all regions except Africa, and in all subre - gions except West and Central Africa, North Africa, the Caribbean, Central America and Eastern Europe; however, some of this decline may have been partially due to the non-reporting of some countries in 2019. The overall decrease in the quantities of cannabis (herb and resin) seized in the last decade reflects a 56 per cent Fig. 5 global cannabis seizures: quantities and seizure cases, 1998-2019 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire. Note: A total of 121 countries reported seizure cases of cannabis herb or resin in the period 2009-2019, with an average of 62 countries per year (57 in 2019). This compares with a total of 166 countries reporting quantities of cannabis herb or resin seized in the period 2009-2019, with an average of 127 countries per year (120 in 2019). The estimates for 2019 are based on the assumption that the quantities of cannabis (herb and resin) seized and the number of cannabis (herb and resin) seizure cases remained unchanged in non-reporting countries in 2019 as compared with the previous year.0150,000300,000450,000600,000750,000900,0001,050,0001,200,0001,350,000 01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,0009,000 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Number of seizure casesQuantities seized (tons) Estimated additional quantities of cannabis herb and resin seized by non-reporting countries in 2019 Quantities of cannabis herb seized (as reported) Quantities of cannabis resin seized (as reported) Estimated additional quantities of cannabis herb and resin seized by non-reporting countries, excluding North America, in 2019 Quantities of cannabis herb and resin seized, excluding North America (as reported) Seizure cases of cannabis herb and resin (as reported) Estimated global cannabis seizure cases in 2019 (including estimated additional seizure cases) 14 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2021Americas (60 per cent of the global total), with South America accounting for 34 per cent of the global total and North America for 17 per cent. In previous years, the largest proportion of cannabis herb seized was reported by countries in North America, which accounted for an average of 50 per cent of the global total in the period 2008-2018. The next largest proportions of global quan - tities seized in 2019 were those of Africa (21 per cent) and Asia (13 per cent), followed by Europe (6 per cent). The total quantity of cannabis herb seized worldwide in 2019 was 40 per cent less than in 2009. That decline was mainly driven by the decreases in the reported seizure quantities in North America (decrease of 86 per cent), as there were marked declines reported by the United States (decrease of 82 per cent), Mexico (decrease of 90 per cent) and Canada (decrease of 91 per cent). As mentioned above, the decline in reported quantities seized most likely reflects the changing legal framework concerning cannabis, as Canada legalized cannabis for non-medical purposes in 2018 and some jurisdictions in the United States have done so since 2014.2 2 See the below chapter of the present booklet, \"Developments in measures regulating the non-medical use of cannabis\" .in the Americas because of the decriminalization and legalization of cannabis for non-medical use in these jurisdictions,1 rather than an indication of a decline in the supply of cannabis at the global level. Decline in quantities of cannabis herb seized in North America may be partly linked to the legalization of some cannabis markets in that subregion The total global quantity of cannabis herb seized in 2019 declined by 12 per cent compared with the previous year, falling to 3,779 tons, the lowest figure since 1998. The largest proportion of that amount was seized in the 1 United States Government Accountability Office, \"State marijuana legalization: DOJ should document its approach to monitoring the effects of legalization\" , Report to Congressional Requesters, GAO-16-1 (December 2015).Fig. 6 Quantities of cannabis herb seized and reported trends in cannabis herb trafficking, 2009-2019 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.

Of the 10 countries worldwide reporting the seizure of the largest quantities of canna- bis herb, 7 were located in the Americas. The countries reporting the seizure of the largest quantities of canna- bis herb in 2019 in regions other than the Americas were India, Nigeria and Morocco. When considering a larger timespan, the period 2009- 2019, the countries seizing the largest total amounts of cannabis herb worldwide were, in order of the amounts seized, the United States, Mexico, Paraguay, Colombia, Nigeria, Morocco, Brazil, India and Egypt. Trafficking in cannabis herb continues to be mostly intraregional Most trafficking in cannabis herb continues to be intra- regional. In Africa, the Americas and Europe, countries report that seized cannabis herb primarily comes from or is destined for countries of the same region. By con- trast, the most frequently mentioned countries of origin, departure and transit for cannabis herb seized in Oceania in the period 2015-2019 were countries in other regions (primarily the United States, followed by the Netherlands and Canada). Similarly, in Asia, two countries from North America (Canada and the United States) were among the six most frequently mentioned countries of origin, departure and transit of cannabis herb; those two coun - tries were mostly mentioned by countries or territories in East and South-East Asia, most notably by Hong Kong, China, followed by the Republic of Korea, Japan, China, Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as by Kuwait in the Near and Middle East. Reported increase in cannabis resin trafficking In contrast to the decrease in the quantity of cannabis herb seized, the global quantity of cannabis resin seized has shown a long-term upward trend, and qualitative information from Member States points to an increase in cannabis resin trafficking, especially since 2015. 3 UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire. 16 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2021Trafficking in cannabis resin continues to be more geographically concentrated than trafficking in cannabis herb More than a third of the global quantity of cannabis resin seized was intercepted in Western and Central Europe (34 per cent) in 2019, followed by the Near and Middle East/South-West Asia (33 per cent) and North Africa (30 per cent). These subregions accounted for close to 97 per cent of all cannabis resin seized worldwide in 2019. The largest quantities of cannabis resin were seized by Spain, followed by Morocco, Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Cannabis resin trafficked worldwide origi- nates mainly in Morocco and Afghanistan Morocco, which accounted for more than a fifth of all mentions of the main \"country of origin\" in responses to the annual report questionnaire worldwide in the period 2015-2019, continues to be the most frequently mentioned source country of cannabis resin intercepted worldwide. Authorities reported some 21,000 ha under cannabis cultivation in 2019 (mostly grown in the Rif area), down from 25,000 ha in 2018.4 4 Response submitted by Morocco to the annual report questionnaire for 2019.

Some of it is also trafficked to Eastern Europe and South-Eastern Europe. Most of the Moroccan cannabis resin destined for countries in Europe is shipped to Spain and then on to France, the Netherlands and other countries in the region. For years, including over the period 2015-2019, Spain has been identified by other European countries as the principal country of departure and transit of cannabis resin, followed by the Netherlands and France. Afghanistan appears to be the second most important source country of cannabis resin worldwide, accounting for 18 per cent of all mentions of the main \"country of origin\" in responses to the annual report questionnaire in the period 2015-2019. The two other most frequently mentioned countries of origin of cannabis resin seized were Pakistan and Lebanon. Those three countries have been reported as source or transit countries of canna - bis resin intercepted in other countries in the Near and Middle East/South-West Asia, most notably countries of the Arabian peninsula. Cannabis resin originating in Afghanistan has also been identified by countries in Cen - tral Asia, Eastern Europe and, to a lesser extent, Western and Central Europe. The Islamic Republic of Iran reported that the cannabis resin seized on its territory in the period 2015-2019 origi - nated mainly in Afghanistan and was trafficked either via Pakistan or directly from Afghanistan. In 2018, roughly 65 per cent of the cannabis resin seized in the Islamic Republic of Iran was destined for countries of the Arabian peninsula, 15 per cent for the Caucasus and 20 per cent for domestic consumption; in 2019, however, most cannabis resin seized in the Islamic Republic of Iran was destined for the country's domestic market, the Caucasus coun- tries, Turkey and, to a lesser extent, the European Union. Cannabis resin seized in the Near and Middle East in the period 2015-2019 was reported to have originated mainly in Lebanon, as reported by Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, the State of Palestine and the Syrian Arab Republic. Some of the cannabis resin seized in Lebanon was also destined for markets outside the subregion, most notably Italy and, to a lesser extent, Brazil in 2018; also, most of the cannabis resin seized in Cyprus in the period 2015-2019, including some 60 per cent of all cannabis resin seized in 2019, which was mostly destined for the local market in Cyprus, originated in Lebanon.

UNODC estimates that almost 4 per cent (range: 2.8-5.1 per cent) of the global population aged 15-64 years used cannabis at least once in 2019, the equivalent of some 200 million people (range: 141 mil - lion-256 million). The overall number of people who used cannabis in the past year is estimated to have increased by nearly 18 per cent over the past 10 years (2010-2019), reflecting in part an increase in the global population of 10 per cent over the same period. Since 2010, the past-year prevalence Notwithstanding the ongoing debate as to whether the genus cannabis comprises one or more species, the cannabis plant is currently considered to be monospe - cific (Cannabis sativa L.) by the scientific community.5, 6 There are two subspecies of the plant (sativa and indica) and four varieties. To date, 120 phytocannabinoids have been recorded for Cannabis sativa, the main species of the cannabis plant.7 The intoxicating or psychoac- tive constituent is 9-THC, while CBD is the principal cannabinoid, for which there is no substantive evidence that it is likely to cause THC-like psychoactive effects.8, 9, 10 Produced in almost every country, cannabis herb con - sists of the dried and crumbled leaves and flowering tops of the cannabis plant, which are generally smoked. By contrast, cannabis resin, which is the concentrated extract of cannabis flower and plant, is produced mainly in a few countries in North Africa, the Middle East and South-West Asia. Hash oil is a cannabis product that can be extracted from any part of the plant. An increasing variety of other extract-based cannabis products is also used, including edibles, vapes and dabs. In the past two decades, there have been rapid advances in cannabis plant cultivation techniques, in particular in Europe and North America, which are mainly focused on achieving a high 9-THC content. In addition to the major transformation of cannabis culti- vation in recent years, the cannabis market has diversified to the extent that it now comprises a broad range of prod - ucts with varying means of ingestion, potency and effects. 5 WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, Critical Review: Cannabis Plant and Cannabis Resin (Geneva, 2018), sect. 1. 6 The letter \"L\" denotes Carl Linnaeus, who, in 1753, gave the botanical name to the plant. 7 WHO, Critical Review: Cannabis Plant and Cannabis Resin. 8 Ibid. 9 WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, \"Critical review report: Cannabidiol (CBD)\" (Geneva, 2018). 10 WHO, Critical Review: Cannabis Plant and Cannabis Resin.FiG. 11 Trends in the global number of people who use cannabis and reported trends in cannabis use, 2010-2019 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.

In India, in 2018, more than 3 per cent of the population aged 18 and older, and less than 1 per cent of adolescents (aged 10-17) - nearly 31 million people in total - had used a cannabis product in the past year.16 In Thailand, an estimated 1.3 per cent of the adult population were past-year cannabis users in 2019; in Indo - nesia, the figure was 1.4 per cent.17, 18 Although up-to-date surveys among the general population have not yet been conducted in the region, surveys of young people were conducted in both Afghanistan and Kazakhstan in 2018.

This increase in the number of people who use cannabis and the prevalence of cannabis use should be interpreted with caution, however, because of the wide margins of error with respect to the estimates. Notwithstanding these limitations, qualitative information on trends in cannabis use, as reported by an average of 67 Member States per year, confirm the increase in cannabis use over the period 2010-2019. Cannabis use in Africa and Asia In Africa, the annual prevalence of cannabis use in 2019 is estimated at 6.4 per cent of the population aged 15-64 (range 3.8-8.8 per cent), corresponding to 47 million past-year users (range 28 million-64 million). Within the region, the subregion constituted by West and Central Africa has the highest prevalence of use, at 9.4 per cent, or an estimated 27 million past-year users, largely reflect - ing past-year use of cannabis in Nigeria, where people who use cannabis were estimated to comprise 10.8 per cent of the adult population, or 10.6 million people in 2018.11 Recent estimates of cannabis use are not available for any other country in the region. People in treatment for cannabis use disorders are com - monly reported in Africa, where half of those in drug treatment in 2019 were reported as being treated for cannabis use. On the basis of drug treatment data from West Africa covering the period 2014-2017, the majority of people (73 per cent) who were treated for drug use dis - orders in the subregion were treated for cannabis as the primary drug, which corresponds to a rate of almost 2 per 100,000 adult population being treated for cannabis use disorders in each reporting year.12 Similarly, among people in South Africa who attended specialist drug treatment services in 2019, cannabis was reported as the primary or secondary drug for the majority of people who were treated for drug use disorders, in particular among those aged 20 or less.13 Among students aged 15-17 in countries in North Africa, the past-year prevalence of cannabis use 11 UNODC and Nigeria, Drug Use in Nigeria 2018 (Vienna, 2019). 12 UNODC and ECOWAS, West African Epidemiology Network on Drug Use (WENDU) Report: Statistics and Trends on Illicit Drug Use and Supply 2014-2017 (2019). 13 Siphokazi Dada and others, \"Monitoring tobacco and other drug abuse treatment admission in South Africa: July-December 2019, phase 47\" , South African Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use (SACENDU) updates (Cape Town, South Africa, Alcohol, Tobacco and other Drug Research Unit, South African Medical Research Coun- cil, 2020).FiG. 12 Cannabis use among students aged 15-17, North Africa Sources: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire; and reports of the Mediterranean School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs for Algeria (2016), Egypt (2016), Morocco (2017) and Tunisia (2016).0123456 Algeria (2016)Egypt (2016)Morocco (2017)Tunisia (2016)Prevalence (percentage) Lifetime use Past-year use Past-month use 20 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2021Among young people out of school, mainly in Kabul, 7.3 per cent (range 5.5-9.0 per cent) reported past-year use of cannabis,19 whereas in Kazakhstan, between 1.2 and 2.3 per cent of students aged 13-18 reported past-year use of cannabis.20 In the absence of survey data, the cannabis use percep- tion index indicates that cannabis use increased in Africa and Asia over the period 2010-2019. More recently, an increase in cannabis use was reported, as based on expert perceptions, by more than half of the countries in Africa and Asia that submitted responses to the annual report questionnaire in 2018 and 2019. Cannabis use in Central and South America and the Caribbean The past-year prevalence of cannabis use in the Carib - bean, Central America and South America is lower than the global average, at 3.4 per cent, 3.1 per cent and 3.5 per cent, respectively, of the adult population, correspond- ing to over 12 million people who used cannabis in the past year in those subregions.

Prior to that, between 2002 and 2009, the prevalence of cannabis use in the past month had increased by 10 per cent among the adult population. In 2019, over 29 million people aged 18 and older were estimated to be past-month users of cannabis, of whom 45 per cent, or 13.8 million people, were daily or near-daily23 users of cannabis.24 In 2018 and 2019, in the United States, past-month can- nabis use among people aged 18 and older was higher among men than among women, and more so among people who were socially disadvantaged (e.g., without completed college education, unemployed).25 Compared with cannabis use among the adult population in the United States, the levels of past-year and past- month use of cannabis among high-school students have remained stable over the past 10 years (2011-2020); in 23 Daily or near-daily use is defined as use of a substance for 20 days or more in the past month. 24 United States, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Admin- istration, Key Substance Use and Mental Health Indicators in the United States: Results from the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, HHS Publication, No. SMA 18-5068, NSDUH Series H-53 (Rockville, Maryland, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2020). 25 Based on data from United States, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Results from the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Detailed Tables (Rockville, Maryland, 2020).in South America with data for multiple years, cannabis use in Argentina and Chile nearly doubled from 2008 to 2017/18, while the trend in cannabis use remained generally stable in Bolivia (Plurinational State of) and Colombia. In Central America, recent information on the extent of drug use among secondary school students showed that the past-year prevalence of cannabis use in Costa Rica was 5.1 per cent (2018) and in El Salvador was 6.6 per cent (2018). Cannabis use in the past year among the adult popula- tion in Caribbean countries is estimated at 3.4 per cent in 2019, whereas a survey among students aged 14-17 in 13 Caribbean countries in 2016 showed that the average past-year prevalence of cannabis use was 17.5 per cent among boys and 10.3 per cent among girls. The average past-month prevalence among boys (11.6 per cent) in the 13 countries surveyed was nearly double that of girls.21 Cannabis use is still on the increase in North America Past-year cannabis use in the Americas increased from an estimated 6.6 per cent (40 million past-year users) in 2010 to 8.8 per cent of the adult population (59 million past-years users) in 2019. Within the Americas, cannabis use is much higher in North America (14.5 per cent, or 47 million users) than in other subregions. Cannabis use continues to increase in the United States Change in the cannabis market in the United States in the past decade has resulted in a larger number of users of the drug and, more dramatically, in a higher fre - quency of cannabis consumption and in larger quantities of cannabis being consumed.22 While the past-year and past-month prevalence of cannabis use among the adult population (aged 18 and older) in the United States have increased by 60 per cent and 75 per cent, respectively, the prevalence of daily or near-daily use increased almost 21 Organization of American States, Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission, A Report on Students' Drug Use in 13 Caribbean Countries: Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Gre- nada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago (OEA/Ser.L/XIV.6.46) (2016). 22 See, for instance, Miles K. Light and others, \"Market size and demand for marijuana in Colorado\" (Colorado, United States, Colorado Department of Revenue, 2016), which argues that the amount of cannabis used per day is strongly correlated with the number of days of use per month, and that 80 per cent of the cannabis consumed in Colorado was consumed by daily users, who comprised 20 per cent of the past-year cannabis users in Colorado.FiG. 15 Trends in cannabis use among the population aged 18 and older, United States, 2010-2019 Source: United States, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Results from the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Detailed Tables (Rockville, Maryland, 2020).75100125150175200 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019Index: 100 = 2010 Lifetime use Past-year use Past-month use Daily or near-daily use 22 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2021However, the trends in cannabis use among high-school students are in stark contrast to the decline in tobacco and alcohol use, the two most commonly used substances by adolescents. The past-month prevalence of tobacco use among high-school students declined from nearly 12 per cent in 2011 to 5 per cent in 2020, while the past- month prevalence of alcohol use declined from 26 per cent to 21 per cent over the same period.29 Cannabis use in Canada also continues to increase In North America, comparatively high levels of cannabis use have also been reported in Canada.

Since cannabis users are oversampled in the cannabis survey, its results are not com- parable with the general population surveys such as the Canadian Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey, the most recent of which was conducted in 2017. 31 According to the most recent Canadian Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey in 2017, for comparison, 15 per cent of Canadians aged 15 and older (or 4.4 million) had used cannabis in the past 12 months (19 per 2020, 14.6 per cent of high-school students reported past-month use of cannabis.26 However, there has been a significant increase in daily or near-daily use of canna - bis in the past two years (2019 and 2020). In 2020, the daily or near-daily use of cannabis was estimated at 4.1 per cent among high-school students compared with nearly 1 per cent in 1991. The increase in daily or near- daily use of cannabis is more significant among 8th and 10th grade students, and in 2020 was at its highest level among all high-school students since 1991.27 Cannabis use among adolescents is found to be related to impaired cognition - showing lagged effects on inhibitory control (e.g., self-control) and working memory, and concurrent effects on delayed memory recall and perceptual reason - ing (ability to think and reason using pictures or visual information).28 26 United States, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Monitoring the Future, \"2020 data from in-school surveys of 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade students\" (December 2020). 27 Lloyd D.

In both countries, past-year cannabis use has remained stable over the past 10 years, with some increase in 2019. In Australia,35 the highest past-year prevalence of canna - bis use was reported among young people aged 20-29, although over the period 2016-2019, past-year use of can - nabis increased significantly among older people (aged 50 and older), essentially indicating an ageing cohort of cannabis users in Australia. The older age group is also more likely to report regular cannabis use than other age groups, with nearly half of past-year users aged 50 and older using cannabis once a week or more.

Data suggest an increase since 2018 in past year use across both sexes, and among those aged 25 and older.32 During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, more than half (56 per cent) of people who had used cannabis in the past 12 months reported that they had used the same amount of cannabis as they had prior to the pandemic, while those reporting using less cannabis than prior to the pandemic and those reporting using more cannabis were less than a quarter each (22 per cent). Nearly one third (31 per cent) of cannabis users aged 24 and younger reported using more cannabis, a higher proportion than among those aged 25 and older (19 per cent).33 While cannabis users reported using more than one method of cannabis consumption (non-medical use), smoking was the most common method (79 per cent) reported in Canada in 2020.

In 2019, 7.8 per cent of the population aged 15-64 (25 million people) had used cannabis in the past year. Can- nabis use in the past year among young people aged 15-34 is particularly high, at an estimated 15 per cent (18 million people). Past-month use of cannabis in 2019 was estimated at about 3.0 per cent of the adult popu- lation. Moreover, it is estimated that about 1 per cent of adults in that subregion (mainly States members of the European Union) are daily or near-daily cannabis users. That is, they have used the drug on 20 days or more in the past month. The majority of them (60 per cent) are under 35, and around three quarters are male.36 According to the latest survey, in 2019, of secondary school students aged 15-16 in 34 countries in Europe, cannabis is the most widely used drug, with an average past-year prevalence of 13 per cent: 15 per cent among 36 EMCDDA, European Drug Report 2020: Trends and Developments (Luxembourg, Publications Office of the European Union, 2020).cannabis use also increased significantly over the period 2016-2019 among those who had completed 12 years or less of education and those who were living in the most disadvantaged socioeconomic areas.

It is clear, however, that there is an association between a lower perception of risk and higher use of cannabis, as observed in the United States, Europe and Latin America and the Carib- bean, although the strength of the association, at least in the case of United States, may no longer be as strong as it used to be. The strength of this association may vary but, in both the United States and Europe, it is character - ized by a steady decline in the risk perception of cannabis among adolescents and a long-term increase in regular cannabis use, with some irregular annual fluctuations. Among 10th grade students in the United States, there is a clear association between the past-month prevalence of cannabis use and the perception of risk (from either occasional or regular use of cannabis), but the strength of this association has weakened in the past 20 years. In the period 1992-2000, the lower the perception of risk or harm arising from cannabis use was, the higher the past-month cannabis use among students (Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.98). However, over the period 2001-2020, the inverse associa - tion between risk perception and current use of cannabis frequency of use among friends), as well as injunctive norms (how much others approve of use) and expec - tancies (expected outcomes from use, including the perception of risk of harm) have been strongly associ- ated with cannabis use by adolescents.38, 39, 40, 41 In recent years, the debate about medical use of canna- bis and measures allowing non-medical use of cannabis in the United States and elsewhere have led adolescents to perceive cannabis as less harmful than they previously had.42 How much this reduced perception of harmfulness 38 Julia D.

In the United States, the perceived availability has declined by 28 per cent over the past 20 years among 10th grade students. In other words, fewer adolescents think it is easier to obtain can - nabis than in the past. In the United States, the decreasing perception of risk from occasional or regular use of cannabis is considered to be a spillover effect as debates over measures allowing the medical and non-medical use of cannabis in the states considering those measures extend to other states, and the result of an increase in regular cannabis use, which comes to be perceived as less risky among users, as well as media coverage of the medical use of various cannabis products in many states containing claims of the medical benefits of cannabis products, including those of CBD.46, 47, 48 Nevertheless, further research is required to determine 46 UNODC, World Drug Report for the years 2016-2019. 47 Wayne Hall and Megan Weier, \"Has 48 Sarvet and others, \"Recent rapid decrease in adolescents' perception that marijuana is harmful, but no concurrent increase in use\" . was not as strong as in the previous decade - the Pearson correlation coefficient43 was -29 for past-month cannabis use and perception of risk or harm from occasional can- nabis use, and -16 between regular cannabis use and the perception of harm from regular cannabis use. Between 1992 and 2000, past-month cannabis use more than doubled at the same time as the perception of risk or harm from occasional cannabis use declined by one third and perception of risk or harm from regular use declined by 20 per cent. From 2001 to 2020, past-month cannabis use increased by 16 per cent as the perception of risk or harm from occasional cannabis use declined by 39 per cent and the perception of risk or harm from regular cannabis use declined by 42 per cent. Similar find - ings were reported in another study that looked at data for 12th grade students in a national school survey and for those in the corresponding age group in the national survey among the general population.44 Similarly, in Europe the perception of risk or harm from trying cannabis once or twice among students aged 15-16 declined by nearly half, and the perception of risk or harm from smoking cannabis regularly declined by a quarter over the period 1995-2019, in parallel with an overall increase in past-month cannabis use. Also, a study among adolescents aged 15-17 in Latin American and Caribbean countries in 2016 concluded that there was a significant association between a low perception of harm, a strong perception of the benefits of using cannabis and the use of cannabis (odds ratio of 1.61 for lifetime use, 1.62 for past-year use and 1.66 for past-month use). However, there was a much stron- ger association between friends' use of cannabis and self-reported past-year or past-month use of the drug (odds ratio of 8.5 and 8.9, respectively). It was also noted in this study that, despite favourable perceptions, the majority of the respondents (55 per cent) nevertheless reported no intention of using cannabis even if it were legally available. 45 The different grades of association between risk per - ceptions and regular cannabis use could be explained by other factors that have determined the trends in use, 43 The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of linear correlation between two sets of data. 44 Sarvet and others, \"Recent rapid decrease in adolescents' perception that marijuana is harmful, but no concurrent increase in use\" . 45 Maria In\u00eas Gandolfo Concei\u00e7\u00e3o and others, \"Perception of harm and benefits of cannabis use among adolescents from Latin America and Caribe\" , Texto and Contexto - Enfermagem, vol. 28 (2019).

However, the decline in cigarette smoking among adolescents in the United States is offset by the increase in vaping, which increased from a past- month prevalence of 14.2 per cent in 201550 to 23.5 per cent in 2020.51 By contrast, 14 per cent of students in Europe in 2019 reported using e-cigarettes in the past month.52 Cannabis has become more potent in the United States and Europe, but adolescents perceive cannabis as less harmful than before There is clear discordance between the risk of harm per - ceived by adolescents in using cannabis and the potential risk that cannabis products of increasingly greater potency could pose to their health.

The trends for Europe and the United States are similar although the levels of use are quite dissimilar: more adolescents use cannabis in the United States than in Europe (the past- month prevalence of cannabis use in 2019 was 18 per cent among 10th grade students in the United States compared with 7 per cent among adolescents in Europe), but fewer adolescents use cigarettes in the United States than in Europe: nearly 4 per cent of 10th grade students in the United States in 2019 had smoked cigarettes in 49 Ibid.

As the scientific literature suggests, daily cannabis use has been associated with a greater likelihood of psychotic disorders among users than among people who have never used cannabis, and the likelihood of such disor - ders is nearly five times greater among those who, on a daily basis, use cannabis with a high -9-THC content (-9-THC 10 per cent).54, 55 54 Marta Di Forti and others, \"The contribution of cannabis use to vari- ation in the incidence of psychotic disorder across Europe (EU-GEI): a multicentre case-control study\" , The Lancet Psychiatry, vol. 6, No. 5 (May 2019). 55 Rebecca Keupper and others, \"Continued cannabis use and risk of incidence and persistence of psychotic symptoms: 10 year follow-up cohort study\" , BMJ , vol. 342 (2011). 9-THC in cannabis herb seized increased fourfold in the United States between 1995 and 2018 and almost doubled in Europe between 2002 and 2018. Moreover, in some jurisdictions in Canada and the United States, other cannabis products, such as cannabis concentrates and edibles, may have a potency of 70 per cent or more,53 making the substance more potent and its users more prone to health consequences. Despite that trend, over that same period of time, the percentage of adolescents who consider regular use of cannabis to be harmful has significantly declined. 53 See, for instance, UNODC, World Drug Report 2019, booklet 5, Canna- bis and Hallucinogens (United Nations publication, 2019).01020304050607080 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019Percentage Perception among adolescents of risk/harm of smoking cannabis regularly Europe United States Linear (Europe) Linear (United States)0246810121416 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019PercentageCannabis potency ( 9-THC content) in cannabis herb Europe United States Linear (Europe) Linear (United States)0246810121416 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019PercentageCannabis potency ( 9-THC content) in cannabis herb Europe United States Linear (Europe) Linear (United States)01020304050607080 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019Percentage Perception among adolescents of risk/harm of smoking cannabis regularly Europe United States Linear (Europe) Linear (United States)Linear trend (Europe) Linear Trend (United States)01020304050607080 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019Percentage Perception among adolescents of risk/harm of smoking cannabis regularly Europe United States Linear (Europe) Linear (United States)Europe United states 30 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2021CANNABISlegislation permits adults (aged 18 and over) to legally access a range of cannabis products, including edibles, extracts and topicals, which regulation came into force a year after the Act, in October 2019. The Cannabis Act establishes a cooperative framework for regulating cannabis between the federal, provincial and territorial governments. The federal government is responsible for regulating cannabis production and has implemented a series of measures to help ensure that the risks and harms of cannabis are appropriately addressed, including licences, permits and authoriza- tions, security clearances, a cannabis tracking system, advertising and promotion rules, and packaging and label - ling requirements. The provinces and territories regulate the distribution and retail sale of cannabis, subject to minimum federal conditions. Provinces and territories also have the ability to establish stricter rules for public possession, personal cultivation of cannabis plants, and minimum age; they are responsible for establishing local rules related to where cannabis may be consumed.Developments in measures regulating the non-medical use of cannabis As of April 2021, legal provisions allowing the non-med- ical use of cannabis have been approved in Canada and Uruguay, as well as in 20 jurisdictions (17 states, 2 terri- tories and the District of Columbia) of the United States. The common feature of the legislation in Canada and most jurisdictions in the United States is that it generally allows for the production and sale by for-profit industry of cannabis products for non-medical use in the relevant jurisdictions. There are differences in the level of reg - ulation and control between the non-medical and the medical use of cannabis,56 and the regulations are being implemented in different local contexts and dynamics, which is likely to have a different impact on the devel - opment of cannabis markets in each jurisdiction, on the extent of non-medical use of cannabis and on other public health and safety and criminal justice outcomes. Legalization of non-medical use of cannabis in Canada The use of cannabis for medical purposes has been permitted in Canada since 1999 through exemptions granted by the Minister of Health for medical and sci - entific purposes or in the public interest and according to its domestic law. In July 2018, the Canadian Parlia - ment passed the Cannabis Act, which establishes a legal framework that provides regulated access for medical and non-medical cannabis, setting out a series of con - trols governing the production, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis. The objectives of the legisla - tion are, among others, \"to protect public health and public safety\" and, in particular, to keep cannabis away from young people (minors under 18 years of age) and \"to reduce illicit activities in relation to cannabis\" .57 The 56 For more information on cannabis regulations in each jurisdiction in Canada, the United States and Uruguay, see the summary table at the end of the present chapter. 57 Canada, Department of Justice, \"Cannabis legalization and regula- tion\" .

Available at www.justice.gc.ca/eng/cj-jp/cannabis/). 3 31 CANNABIS | Developments in measures regulating the non-medical use of cannabisProvinces and territories have each adopted a slightly different approach to how they license and operate their distribution and retail systems, in recognition of the unique circumstances of each jurisdiction.58 In most provinces, the retail licensing regime is similar to that which regulates the sale of alcohol, and cannabis is sold through licensed retailers (private sector), provincial retail stores (public sector) and online. Some provinces have established government-run monopolies at both the distribution and retail level, others have adopted a hybrid model with a mix of private and public retailers and/or distributors, while others have both private dis - tributors and retailers. To monitor the outcome of the Cannabis Act and reg - ulations, the Government of Canada has invested in monitoring and surveillance activities; principal among those is a cannabis survey that established a baseline in 2017 and is repeated annually in order to provide objec- tive information on knowledge, attitudes and behaviours around cannabis, and the regular collection of data on the cannabis market. Use of cannabis is on the increase in Canada In 2020, 27 per cent of people (31 per cent of men and 23 per cent of women) aged 16 and older reported that they had used cannabis in the past 12 months and 18 per cent in the past month, showing increases since 2018. Those reporting having used cannabis in the last 30 days did so on an average of 14.4 days. Also, 36 per cent of past-month users reported that they would be \"stoned\" or \"high\" on a typical use day for three or four hours. Smoking was the most common method of using can - nabis; dried cannabis flower and edible products, which have been allowed since 2019, were the main cannabis products used in the past 12 months.59 An analysis of changes over time - before the Act was passed, just after it was passed and one year after it was passed - shows increases in recent and regular use of can - nabis. By the end of 2020, 7.9 per cent of people who had used cannabis in the past three months reported daily or near-daily use of the drug; the prevalence was similar for men and women but was higher among adults under 45 than among older ones.60 58 See https:/ /www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs- back from 2020, how cannabis use and related behaviours changed in Canada\" IN CANNABIS USE on a typical use day for three or four hours (among past-month users):PAST/hyphen.caseYEAR USE /one.lf/eight.lf/percent.lf /one.lf/five.lf/percent.lf /one.lf/seven.lf/percent.lf ... source.61 It would seem that the cannabis products in the legal market captured the share of the cannabis market in the first year after legalization to the extent that those products were available, accessible and low-priced for the consumers.62 In 2020, those who reported cannabis use in the past 12 months also indicated that they typically spent close to 67 Canadian dollars on cannabis products each month. On average, women reported spending less on cannabis than men. Cannabis users who reported cannabis use in the past 30 days spent more, approximately 49 Canadian dollars in the past 30 days, to obtain cannabis from legal sources in addition to a similar amount spent to obtain cannabis from illegal sources.63 61 Health Canada, \"Canadian cannabis summary\" .

Moreover, 41 per cent reported a legal storefront as their usual source of purchasing cannabis, a significantly higher proportion than in 2019 when just under a quarter of past-year cannabis users reported legal storefronts as their usual source for obtaining cannabis. Among the 45 per cent of people who had used cannabis in the past 12 months and had obtained it from illegal or unlicensed sources, most had bought the drug from someone they knew (58 per cent). Past-year cannabis users also reported obtaining cannabis from an unreg - ulated or unauthorized online retailer (22 per cent), a dealer (20 per cent) or an unregulated or unauthorized storefront (19 per cent). Prices, safe supply and qual - ity of cannabis products were the three main reasons mentioned for obtaining cannabis from the respondents' and related behaviours changed in Canada\" , Health Reports (Statistics Canada, April 2021).Fig. 28 Cannabis products used by people who reported use in the past 12 months, Canada, 2019 and 2020 Source: Health Canada, \"Canadian cannabis survey 2020: summary\" .

The criteria for obtaining a retail licence differs by jurisdiction. For example, Ontario, the most populous province in Canada, with a population of 14.7 million, began using a retail system in which licences were issued to operators by means of a lottery, but the province has since abandoned that approach and removed the cap on retail licences in favour of an open market for private can - nabis retail in 2020. Another example is Alberta, which, by the end of 2020, accounted for 40 per cent of all retail outlets in Canada, and where, in September 2020, the provincial government amended the Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Regulation65 to remove a restriction that had previously prevented any one person or group from con - trolling more than 15 per cent of cannabis licences issued 64 Business of Cannabis, \"A look at cannabis store counts by province\" , 11 January 2021. 65 Province of Alberta, Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Act, Alberta Regulation 143/1996 with amendments up to and including Alberta Regulation 176/202, Current as of November 1, 2020, Office Consolidation.Fig. 30 Household expenditure on cannabis products for non-medical use, Canada, 2014-2020 Source: Statistics Canada, Table 36-10-0124-01.

The retail cannabis market in Canada is likely to con - tinue to evolve as jurisdictions adapt their regulatory approaches, as supply chains develop and as cannabis product offerings are diversified. Overall, the implemen - tation of laws permitting the non-medical use of cannabis in Canada is still in its nascent stages, and it may take several years of monitoring to clarify how the cannabis market has evolved and to identify its dynamics and the impact of legalization on public health and safety, among other outcome measures. Differences in the implementa - tion of the legislation in the provinces and territories may also vary in impact and thus require contextual analysis at the provincial and territorial levels. Developments in cannabis regulation in Uruguay In 2013, the Government of Uruguay approved legislation (Law No. 19.172) regulating the cultivation, production, dispensing and use of cannabis for non-medical pur - poses. In accordance with the legislation, cannabis can be obtained by individuals aged 18 and older for non-medical purposes through registration with the national Insti - tute for the Regulation and Control of Cannabis and by choosing one of three options: (a) purchase in authorized pharmacies; (b) membership of a club; or (c) domestic cultivation.86 The total quantity of cannabis permitted per person, as obtained through any of the three mechanisms, cannot 83 Robert West and Theresa Marteau, \"Commentary on Casswell (2013): the commercial determinants of health\" Addiction, vol.

CANNABIS | Developments in measures regulating the non-medical use of cannabis3 35 CANNABIS | Developments in measures regulating the non-medical use of cannabisIn 2019, the Government of Uruguay also established the National Fund for Research on Cannabis, which is aimed at financing scientific research on cannabis use in the country. In addition, in 2019, the Senate passed a law to promote and allow access to cannabis for medical pur - poses. As a result, the National Programme for Access to Medicinal and Therapeutic Cannabis was created within the Ministry of Public Health.93 Finally, on 1 February 2021, the price of a 5-g package of dried cannabis flower dispensed by participating pharmacies was set at 350 Uruguayan pesos (approximately $8.20).94 In the 2018 survey on drug use in Uruguay, it was esti - mated that about 12 per cent of men and 5.8 per cent of women had used cannabis in the past month, with a total past-month prevalence of 8.9 per cent among the population aged 15-65, or about 158,000 users.95 This reflects an increase in past-month use of more than one third since 2014 (when measures allowing non-medical use of cannabis were introduced in Uruguay), while past- year cannabis use increased by more than 50 per cent over the same period. 93 Uruguay, Institute for the Regulation and Control of Cannabis, \"Memoria Institucional 2019\" , approved by the Institute Board of Directors on 27 February 2020. 94 Uruguay, Institute for the Regulation and Control of Cannabis (www.ircca.gub.uy/). 95 Uruguay, VII de Drogas, 2019). exceed 480 g per year. Initially, the Government of Uru- guay set a limit of -9-THC content at 2 per cent and CBD content at 6-7 per cent. In 2017, the Government introduced two varieties, with a -9-THC content of 9 per cent or less and CBD content of almost 3 per cent.87 Overall, the implementation of the regulations has been slow and gradual; as at January 2021, five companies had been granted licences to cultivate, produce and distribute cannabis products for non-medical use. However, those products include only dried cannabis flower because psychoactive edibles and extracts are not allowed in Uruguay.88 By April 2021, 16 pharmacies had been licensed to dis - pense cannabis for non-medical use, and 45,129 people had registered in order to acquire cannabis from those pharmacies.89 Over the period July 2017-May 2020, over 833,000 cannabis transactions (packages of 5 g each) took place in pharmacies, totalling 4,166 kg of cannabis products sold. Of those sales, 59 per cent were made in the capital city. It is estimated that out of the total number of cannabis users registered with pharmacies, 4 out of 10 people bought between 5 and 15 g of cannabis products, averaging at 16.6 g of monthly cannabis pur - chases in May 2020.90 However, the supply of cannabis products to pharmacies is still limited, with the result that pharmacies currently do not cover the demand of regis - tered users, especially in parts of the country where there is a greater concentration of registered cannabis users.91 By April 2021, an additional 12,386 people had registered for domestic cultivation of cannabis and 171 cannabis clubs, with a total membership of 5,152 people, had been registered. Thus, more than 62,000 people in total - more than one third of the estimated number of past-month cannabis users in 2018 - had access to the regulated can - nabis market in Uruguay at that time,92 which is still a relatively small share of the overall population of can - nabis users in the country. 87 John Hudak, Geoff Ramsey and John Walsh, \"Uruguay's cannabis law: pioneering a new paradigm\" (Washington D.C., Centre for Effective Public Management, Brookings Institution, 2018). 88 Uruguay, Institute for the Regulation and Control of Cannabis website (www.ircca.gub.uy/). 89 Ibid. 90 Uruguay, Institute for the Regulation and of Cannabis, \"Mercado regulado del cannabis: informe X\" , 31 May 2020. 91 Uruguay, Institute for the Regulation and Control of Cannabis, \"Mer - cado regulado del cannabis: informe VIII\" , 31 October 2019. 92 Uruguay, Institute for the Regulation and Control of Cannabis web- site (www.ircca.gub.uy/).

Over the years, there has also been a narrowing of the gap in the past-year use of boys and girls. The impact of the provisions regulating the non-medical use of cannabis in Uruguay will only become evident in the coming years, once more information on the outcome measures related to public health and public safety is made available. Cannabis regulations and their implementation in the United States In the United States, a total of 47 states had allowed the medical use of cannabis by the end of 2020, 36 states, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, had approved or had in place a comprehensive programme for the broad medical use of cannabis, and 11 states had allowed a more limited medical use of cannabis purely for specific disorders and only of specific, low -9-THC potency products.99 A medical cannabis programme is considered by the National Conference of State Legislatures to be com - prehensive if the programme: (a) provides for protection from criminal penalties for using cannabis for a medi - cal purpose; (b) provides for access to cannabis through home cultivation, dispensaries or some other system that is likely to be implemented; (c) allows a variety of strains or products, including those with more than a \"low -9- THC\" content; (d) allows either smoking or vaporization of some cannabis products, plant material or extract; and (e) is not a limited trial programme, that is, allowed as a trial for a limited period and not open to the public. The 11 states that have limited measures on the medical use of cannabis may allow the use of cannabis products with low -9-THC and high CBD content for a set of defined medical conditions (although in limited situa - tions and for varying medical conditions) or as a legal 98 Uruguay, VIII Encuesta Nacional de Drogas, 2020). 99 United States, National Conference of State Legislatures, \"State Medical Marijuana Laws\" , April 2021.In 2018, the highest past-month prevalence of cannabis use was reported among young people aged 19-25 (20.8 per cent), followed by those aged 26-35 (16.4 per cent). According to the survey, about 25,500 people were esti - mated to be daily or near-daily users of cannabis, or 9.9 per cent of those who reported cannabis use in the past year (13.1 per cent of males and 5.2 per cent of females). Around 16 per cent of those who reported cannabis use in the past year and more than one third of regular can- nabis users (those who consumed cannabis products daily or weekly) were considered to have a harmful pattern of cannabis use.96, 97 Another survey on drug use among secondary school students aged 13-17 in Uruguay revealed that, in 2018, 19.7 per cent of adolescents had used cannabis in the past year, while 11.1 per cent had used it in the past month. The highest prevalence of past-year cannabis use in that overall age group was among 17-year-olds (34.1 per cent) followed by those aged 15-16 (20.9 per cent). Moreover, 96 The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (eleventh revision) defines harmful (patterns of) use of substances as a pattern of substance use that has caused damage to a person's physical or mental health or has resulted in behaviour leading to harm to the health of others. 97 Uruguay, VII Encuesta Nacional Sobre Fig. 34 Trend in cannabis use among second- ary school students aged 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2016 2018Annual prevalence (percentage) Overall Boys Girls2014 CANNABIS | Developments in measures regulating the non-medical use of cannabis3 37 CANNABIS | Developments in measures regulating the non-medical use of cannabistheir states. Moreover, by April 2021 the state legisla - tures in New Mexico, New York and Virginia had also passed legislation allowing non-medical use of canna - bis by the adult population in those states. As a result, by April 2021, 17 state-level jurisdictions in the United States,102 plus the District of Columbia, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, had allowed the non-medical use of cannabis, and most had also allowed commercial production by for-profit industry.103, 104 It is worth noting that all the states that have legalized the non-medical use of cannabis previously had measures in place permitting the medical use of cannabis. Among the states that have approved measures that allow the non-medical use of cannabis, in Virginia, while the bill for legalizing the non-medical use of cannabis will be effective as of July 2021, the actual provisions of the bill are subject to re-enactment by the 2022 session of the state General Assembly. In Montana, the applica- tion for issuing licensing for commercial production of cannabis products will begin in January 2022. 102 In the United States, cannabis is federally prohibited as a substance listed in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. 103 Home cultivation is not allowed in the State of Washington. The number of plants allowed in each State varies. 104 United States, National Conference of State Legislatures, \"Cannabis overview\" , 8 April 2021. defence as protection from criminal penalties for using cannabis for a medical purpose. For example, Alabama allows the use of cannabis products for \"debilitating epileptic conditions, life-threatening seizures, wasting syndrome, chronic pain, etc., and any other severe con- dition resistant to conventional medicine\" . In its similar programme, by comparison, the State of Georgia allows the use of cannabis products with low -9-THC content and high CBD content for medical conditions such as end-stage cancer, sclerosis (amyotrophic lateral scle - rosis and multiple sclerosis), seizure disorders, Crohn's disease, mitochondrial diseases, Parkinson's disease and sickle cell disease.100 Other states, for example, South Dakota (prior to legal- izing non-medical use of cannabis) and Nebraska, have limited trial programmes on medical use of cannabis that are not open to the public. In the 2020 presidential elections, voters in four states, Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dako - ta,101 approved or voted for measures that allowed the non-medical use of cannabis by the adult population in 100 Ibid. 101 On February 8, 2021, a circuit judge in South Dakota ruled that the measure was unconstitutional, finding that it violated the state's sin- gle-subject rule and that it constituted a revision of the constitution rather than an amendment.MaP 1 Jurisdictions in the United States that allow non-medical use of cannabis or medical use of cannabis and those that do not allow access to cannabis, a pril 2021 Source: National Conference of State Legislatures, April 2021. * Limited adult possession and growing allowed.

Such restrictions may include capping the number of licences or banning the commercial production and sale of cannabis for non-medical use altogether. Residents can also petition their town for such ordinances. Cannabis market is regulated similarly to the alcohol market and is overseen by a variety of regulatory bodies In the United States, cannabis remains a controlled sub - stance at the federal level. As with other subject matters, such as regulating the production or sale of alcohol or gun control, each state has its own measures and control mechanisms that differ considerably across the country. For instance, while the federal Government regulates the production of alcoholic beverages, taxes alcohol sales and requires a health warning by the Surgeon General on alcoholic products, alcohol sales are regulated primarily by state and local governments. Notwithstanding the different context and ethos, states that have measures allowing the non-medical use of cannabis regulate the cannabis market in a manner similar to that of the alcohol market, for example, by prohibiting the sale of cannabis to people under 21 years of age, as in the case of alcohol, for which the legal drinking age in all states is 21 years, or by licensing commercial enterprises to produce, market and sell for profit a wide range of cannabis products. In states such as California, Colorado and Massachusetts, specialized cannabis regulatory bodies have been estab - lished, whereas in Nevada and Michigan, the cannabis market is regulated by the departments of revenue or of taxation. Some states, such as Alaska, Oregon and Washington, have tasked the existing alcohol or liquor boards with cannabis market regulation. In Washington and Oregon, the legalization initiatives were written to mirror state alcohol control laws, designating state liquor control boards as the lead regulatory agency. In Colorado, the Task Force on the Implementation of Amendment 64, which was charged with developing recommendations to the state legislature for the state's cannabis regulatory framework, included members from the cannabis and alcohol industries. In general, the role of health agencies 106 Patrick McGreevy, \"Court dismisses cities' lawsuit challenging canna- bis deliveries in California\" , Los Angeles Times, 18 November 2020. 107 Patrick McGreevy, \"Legal pot sales fall short of expectations in California\" Los Angeles Times, 3 January 2019.Cannabis regulations allowing the non-medical use of cannabis are not implemented uniformly in each state where cannabis has been legalized The level of implementation of the legislation permit - ting the non-medical use of cannabis varies across state jurisdictions and may even include different approaches within the same jurisdiction. For example, some states that have legalized the non-medical use of cannabis allow city administrations to formulate their own cannabis reg - ulations and give options within those cities to not permit the sale of cannabis. In Colorado, 67 per cent of the state jurisdictions (216 jurisdictions) do not allow medical and non-medical retail of cannabis products, while only 25 per cent of jurisdictions (81) allow both medical and retail licences for the non-medical use of cannabis. In Oregon, of the state's 36 counties and 241 cities, 17 counties and 81 cities have prohibited either the estab- lishment of licensed producers, processors, wholesalers and/or retailers of cannabis products for non-medical use.105 In California, the largest state to legalize the non-medical use of cannabis, only about 20 per cent of cities, that is, 89 out of 481 cities, allow retail shops 105 Oregon Liquor Control Commission, Record of Cities/Counties Prohibiting Licensed Recreational Marijuana Facilities, February 2021.Both medical and retail (non- medical) sale of cannabis is banned 67% Only medical cannabis licences are allowed 4%Only retail (non - medical) cannabis licences are allowed 4%Both medical and retail (non- medical) cannabis licences are allowed 25%Fig. 35 Share of county jurisdictions in Colorado, United States, according to licensing status for the medical and non-medical use of cannabis, January 2019 Source: Marijuana Enforcement Division of Colorado. CANNABIS | Developments in measures regulating the non-medical use of cannabis3 39 CANNABIS | Developments in measures regulating the non-medical use of cannabistaxes must be low enough to compete with the illegal cannabis market but not so low as to encourage frequent use, whereas public health-oriented price strategies recommend keeping prices high enough to discourage consumption and cover the external costs of commer - cial sector activity. In many states, rather than public health-oriented strategies, tax rates have been set to compete with the illicit market and to generate reve - nue.109 However, part of the revenue from taxing cannabis is utilized for implementing the regulatory framework and investing, among other things, in the state educa - tion system and public health initiatives for preventing the harm caused by the non-medical use of cannabis.110 In Colorado, for example, the first $40 million of excise tax revenue raised from wholesale cannabis products is transferred to the Public School Capital Construction Assistance Fund for public school construction projects, and a portion of the tax revenue is used to support cer - tified addiction counsellors at mental health institutes or community-based mental health and substance use disorders providers.111 109 Ibid. 110 See, for example, United States, Colorado State, Joint Budget Committee, Appropriations Report Fiscal Year 2019-20 (June 2019); Northwest High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, Washington State: Marijuana Impact Report, vol. 2 (August 2017). 111 United States, State of Colorado, Joint Budget Committee, Appropria- tions Report Fiscal Year 2019-20.to include public health best practices, as in the case of tobacco control framework, in regulatory debates or frameworks for non-medical use of cannabis in those states has remained limited, if any.108 Different limits for possession and home cultivation of cannabis With the exception of the District of Columbia (56 g or less) and Maine (71 g or less), which permit the pos - session of larger quantities, most states allow for the possession of up to 28.5 g of cannabis. In addition, all states permit the home cultivation of around six plants, with a varying number of plants that can be flowering; Michigan and Colorado (as of 2018), which allow for the home cultivation of up to 12 plants, are exceptions. The conditions allowing home cultivation of cannabis vary but may include measures such as plants having to be grown out of public view or cultivation being subject to the permission of the house owners or other tenants in the building, or subject to neighbourhood zoning laws. Taxes levied on cannabis differ considerably One consideration in determining the taxes to be applied to cannabis products is that the total price including 108 Rachel A. Barry and Stanton A.

The potency of those products varies across states, and while many states have facilities for monitor - ing potency, the increasing potency of cannabis products, in particular products other than those made from can- nabis flower, may be a public health concern. A public health-oriented best practices approach would include measures for limiting the potency of products in the interest of public health. For example, in Colorado, the average percentage of -9-THC in cannabis concentrates in 2017 was 69 per cent, with some stores advertising up to 95 per cent of -9-THC content in some products. In 2017, cannabis flower had an average of 19.6 per cent -9-THC content per gram, while overall, 92.9 per cent of all products sold in retail cannabis stores in Colorado had more than 15 per cent of -9-THC content.116 In California, the state has neither limited the potency of cannabis products, as products with -9-THC content of up to 90 per cent or more are allowed, nor limited the manufacturing or sale of flavoured products, such as flavoured vaping liquids, pre-rolled cigarettes or canna- bis-infused sodas that mimic \"alcopops\" , although state regulations have put in place restrictions on products resembling existing foods or with characteristics that are particularly attractive to children.117 However, in Sep - tember 2020, the State Governor signed a bill by which a certificate of analysis will be required for edible canna - bis products to guarantee that the number of milligrams of -9-THC per serving does not exceed 10 mg, plus or minus 12 per cent until 1 January 2022 and plus or minus 10 per cent after January 2022.118 116 United States, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environ- ment, THC Concentration in Colorado Marijuana: Health Effects and Public Health Concerns (July 2020). 117 Lynn D. Silver, Amanda Z. Naprawa and Alisa A.

On the basis of these considerations, all states have put together a structure of taxation and revenue collection from the cultivation, production and sale of cannabis. Current ad valorem state tax rates for cannabis range from about 10 to 37 per cent across states.112 Local juris - dictions can also impose their own local taxes on the sale of cannabis. California has two sets of excise taxes: the first is a cultivation tax of $9.65 per ounce of dried cannabis flower, $2.87 per ounce of dried cannabis leaves and $1.35 per ounce of fresh cannabis plant; the second is a 15 per cent retail excise tax on any cannabis product sold.113 Paradoxically, illicit sales of cannabis currently play a much bigger role in the cannabis market of Cal - ifornia than is the case with typical tobacco markets. As research shows, tobacco taxes raise tobacco prices and, notwithstanding illicit tobacco trafficking, thereby reduce the affordability of, access to and use of tobacco among adolescents and youth. By contrast, in the case of cannabis, despite relatively high tax rates on the legal market, it is likely that cannabis products on the illicit market will remain accessible to adolescents and youth in California.114 advertising of cannabis products All states in which the use of cannabis is legalized have some degree of restriction on the advertising of can - nabis products. For example, in California, advertising can be directed only at people aged 21 and older, there are restrictions on false claims of health benefits, and product labels cannot be appealing to children. In Colo- rado, advertising is restricted to media with audiences of which no more than 30 per cent are under the age of 21. In some states, such as Washington, advertisements cannot depict cartoon characters or contain pictures that could be appealing to children. Moreover, public education messages about cannabis in many states seem to mirror alcohol and tobacco control programmes that are primarily aimed at reducing risky and harmful or abu - sive use among vulnerable populations, such as children, pregnant women and problematic users.115 112 See table at the end of this chapter for details of taxation in each state. 113 Gabriel Petek, \"How high?

TABLE 3 Regulations for the legalization of the non-medical use of cannabis in Uruguay 56 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2021OPIOIDS synthetic opioids that are analogues of fentanyl are considered to be 50-100 times more potent than mor - phine.121, 122, 123 Research or (isotonitazene)124 and the more recent brorphine,125 to name but a few, have added to the ever-increasing complexity of opioids, both in terms of controlling the misuse of these substances and their public health implications. Many of the research opioids, such as U-47700 or butyrylfentanyl, have been put under international control in recent years, how - ever. Moreover, some of the substances, such as W-15 and W-18, were initially introduced as potent opioids but were later found to have no activity on the opioid receptors, although they were put under national con - trol in some countries.126 Nevertheless, research opioids are among the fastest increasing group among the wider new psychoactive substances identified or reported each year.127, 128 Opioids act on three types of opioid receptors - mu (), delta () and kappa () - in the human body, through which they mediate their effects by: (a) depressing 121 Gabriella Roda and others, fentanyl-like drugs: a techni- cal-analytical review\" , Sciences, vol.

Opiates are the naturally occurring alkaloids found in the opium poppy and include morphine, codeine and the - baine. Their semi-synthetic derivatives include heroin, hydrocodone, oxycodone and buprenorphine. Opioids also include a range of synthetic or pharmaceutical opioids, such as methadone, pethidine, tramadol and fentanyl.119 The group also comprises a diverse group of chemicals - opioid receptor agonists - that were initially developed by pharmaceutical companies with the aim of produc - ing more effective opioids for pain management, but were later discarded or considered unsuitable for further development.120 Many of those substances, also known as research opioids, novel synthetic opioids or NPS opi- oids, are considered to be more potent than morphine; 119 WHO, Lexicon of Alcohol and Drug Terms (Geneva, 1994). 120 See also UNODC, World Drug Report 2019, booklet 3, Depressants (United Nations publication, 2019).Fig. 37 Opioids for medical and its analogues heroin, morphine, opium OPIOIDS | Overlap between the use of opioids3 57of heroin, there was significant substitution with phar - maceutical opioids and, to a lesser extent, substitution with benzodiazepines and methamphetamine.134 Estonia and Finland are two countries where, owing to a short - age in the availability of heroin, two synthetic opioids, fentanyl (in the case of Estonia) and buprenorphine (in the case of Finland) have completely replaced heroin and established themselves on the opioid market.135, 136 There are essentially three different scenarios in the interplay of the use of different opioids: (a) typically used opioids are substituted with other opioids, or new opioids are experimented with, depending on their price, purity, availability and control measures; (b) different opioids are used consecutively or sequentially to self-medicate or manage withdrawal, including during opioid agonist137 or antagonist138 therapy; and (c) opioid users (novice or even regular users) are inadvertently exposed to other opioids used as adulterants or cutting agents for sub - stances already established in the market. Switching between opioid use in response to market dynamics The first pattern of use that involves an overlap, or rather substitution, between different opioids is the most common pattern of use of different opioids and has been observed for decades in different regions. Although pharmaceutical opioids and heroin have the potential to induce similar pharmacological mechanisms, as described earlier, some of their properties may differ. Thus, the choice of opioid is likely to be influenced by, among other factors, the balance between the subjective positive and negative effects produced by a specific opioid. For exam - ple, a study of heroin users in the United States showed 134 Jenny Chalmers, Deborah Bradford and Craig Jones, \"The effect of methamphetamine and heroin price on poly drug use: a behavioural economics analysis in Sydney, Australia\" , International Journal of Drug Policy, vol. 21, No. 5 (September 2010), pp. 381-389. 135 EMCDDA, \"Finland: Finland drug report 2018\" (Helsinki, 2018). 136 Ilkka Ojanper\u00e4 and others, \"An epidemic of fatal 3-methylyfentanyl poisoning in Estonia\" , International Journal of Legal Medicine, vol. 122, No. 5 (September 2008), pp. 395-400. 137 According to the WHO Lexicon of Alcohol and Drugs Terms, an agonist is a substance that acts on neuronal receptors to produce effects similar to those of a reference drug. For example, methadone is an agonist of morphine at the opioid receptors. 138 According to the WHO Lexicon of Alcohol and Drugs Terms, an antago- nist is a substance that counteracts the effects of another substance or agent. Pharmacologically, an antagonist interacts with a receptor to inhibit (counter or stop) the action of the substance that produces specific effects mediated by that receptor. Methadone is an opioid agonist, whereas buprenorphine is an partial antagonist of opioid receptors.breathing through the neurochemical activity in the brain stem where automotive body functions such as breathing and heart rate are controlled; (b) increasing feelings of pleasure by altering activity in the limbic system, which controls behavioural and emotional responses, such as the regulation of stress responses, feeding, mood, learn - ing, memory and immune functions; and (c) blocking pain messages transmitted through the spinal cord from other parts of the body.129 The abuse liability of an opioid is essentially determined by many factors, including the ease with which the opioid can cross the blood-brain barrier (lipophilicity of the drug), its binding affinity to opioid (mainly mu) receptors, and various pharmacoki- netic characteristics such as the ease with which it can be injected or used with other means of administration (smoking or insufflation).130 Studies have shown that, in response to market dynam- ics, drug users may substitute different drugs, transition to alternative routes of drug administration, decrease consumption or enter treatment. Overlap between or substitution of different opioids is not a new phenome- non and has been observed in different settings. Findings from different studies have consistently shown a positive association between the non-medical use of pharma - ceutical opioids and the use of opiates (heroin), given the common pharmacological principles and actions of opioid substances.131 Along with the availability of the drugs, economic factors and cross-price elasticity can affect the use of different opioids.132 An increase in the price of one drug may result in the consumption of another (substitute) or an increase in the price of one drug may decrease the consumption of another, even though its price remains the same (complement).133 In one study in Australia, for example, a cross-price elasticity analysis showed that, in the case 129 WHO, Neuroscience of Psychoactive Substance Use and Dependence (Geneva, 2004). 130 Wilson M.

Between the periods 2002-2004 and 2011-2013, heroin use increased by 139 per cent among those who self-reported the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opi - oids.143 A study from 2007 among a sample of opioid users aged 16 and older in Maine, United States, concluded that the use of multiple pharmaceutical opioids within the first year of initiation of opioid use was associated with a more rapid progression to heroin and injecting drug use than among those who were not misusing multiple pharmaceutical opioids.144 Another study that looked at national data for 2002-2004 found that, among the population aged 18 and older, heroin users were 3.9 times more likely to report the non-medical use of opioids in the previous year and 2.9 times more likely to meet the criteria for abuse or dependence on opioids than people who did not use heroin.145 In 2019, about 10 million people in the United States self-reported the non-medical use of opioids in the past year: 9.3 million self-reported the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids and 745,000 self-reported the use of heroin. About 400,000 people self-reported the use of both heroin and non-medical pharmaceutical opi - oids.146 It should be noted that the national survey does 142 Compton, Jones and Baldwin, \"Relationship between nonmedical prescription-opioid use and heroin use\" . 143 Christopher Jones and others, \"Vital signs: demographic and sub- stance use trends among heroin users - United States, 2002-2013\" , Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, vol. 64, No. 26 (July 2015). 144 Lauretta E.

In the United States, the opioid market has fluctuated from the use of heroin to the non-medical use of phar - maceutical opioids, and currently to a dual epidemic of heroin use and non-medical use of pharmaceutical opi- oids. The non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids in the country began to increase from 1997, at the same time as an increasing number of opioid prescriptions were being given for pain management, in particular chronic non-cancer pain management. Over the period 1997- 2005, there was a more than 500 per cent increase in the number of opioid prescriptions given, which resulted in easy access to diverted supplies of opioids, the use of which was less stigmatized than of heroin.140 Pharmaceu - tical opioids were considered safer than heroin, as they did not carry the stigma of using an \"illicit\" drug and were less affected by fluctuations in quality or dosage. A study of opioid users in treatment (2010-2013) reported that respondents who began using heroin in the 1960s were predominantly young men (83 per cent) and, in the majority (80 per cent) of cases, the first opioid they had used was heroin. By contrast, opioid users in treatment who began using more opioids recently were older and were men and women living in less urbanized areas (75 per cent) who were introduced, in the majority of cases (75 per cent), to opioids through pharmaceutical drugs .141 Beginning in 2006, a gradual increase in heroin use was observed in parts of the United States, which was attributed mainly to the availability of heroin that had a higher purity and was cheaper than in the past on the market and a change in the formulation of pharmaceu- tical opioids to make them crushproof and less liable to misuse. It has been hypothesized that the transition from the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids to the use of heroin, especially among young people, could 139 Sandra D.

Moreover, although tramadol was the most commonly misused opioid in 2013, its pattern of misuse changed in sub - sequent years. When tramadol was put under national control in 2014, the use of opiates became more common among opioid users in drug treatment. 147 Similar overlaps and switches between opioids have been observed in Europe. In Sweden, the opioid market was dominated by heroin until 2014, with a relatively limited share of the market for other opioids, such as diverted fentanyl patches that appeared in the drug market in 2006.148 In 2014, fentanyl analogues were introduced onto the illegal drug market in Sweden through online sales of fentanyl analogues, mainly in the form of nasal sprays but also as tablets, powder and capsules, and have dom - inated the market ever since.149 In Estonia and Finland, it is also well documented that two synthetic opioids, fen - tanyl (in the case of Estonia) and buprenorphine (in the case of Finland), have completely replaced heroin and established themselves on the opioid market.150 147 Abuelgasim Elrasheed A.

Moreover, once opioid users are enrolled in a treat - ment programme, they typically decrease their misuse of buprenorphine obtained on the illicit market.161, 162 It 154 Lofwall and Walsh, \"A review of buprenorphine diversion and misuse: the current evidence base and experiences from around the world\" . 155 Balasingam Vicknasingam and buprenorphine/naloxone tablets in Malaysia\" , Drug and Alcohol Dependence, vol. 111, Nos. 1 and 2 (September 2010), pp. 44-49. 156 Ibid. 157 To prevent misuse of buprenorphine, as naloxone precipitates acute withdrawal if it is crushed and injected. 158 Vicknasingam and others, \"Injection of buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone use by opioid-dependent treatment seekers\" , Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, vol. 39, No. 1 (July 2010), pp. 41-50. 160 Alexander R.

One review showed that between 18 and 28 per cent of patients enrolled in outpatient opioid agonist pro - grammes (methadone or buprenorphine) across different geographical regions with widely varying treatment structures had sold, given away or removed their medi- cation while under supervision, or shared it with others who had been prescribed medication.152 In a study among clients in opioid agonist treatment across five sites in Sweden, the majority reported prior use of non-prescribed methadone (88 per cent), buprenor - phine (80 per cent) and a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone (as partial agonist and antagonist) (50 per cent). Most respondents had bought or received the substances from other patients in opioid agonist maintenance programmes, but drug dealers were also a significant source of non-prescribed opioid agonists and antagonists. Buprenorphine appeared on the illegal drug market in Sweden in the 1980s in the form of Temgesic painkillers and it was launched as a medication (Subu - tex) for treatment of opioid use disorders in the 1990s.153 Issues: Evolving Trends and New Challenges (United Nations publica- tion, 2020). 151 Methadone is an opioid agonist. It is known to produce minimal tolerance and alleviates craving and compulsive use. As a long-act - ing agonist, buprenorphine prevents withdrawal and craving and stabilizes opioid receptors. As a high-affinity agonist, buprenorphine blocks other opioids from binding, preventing misuse of other opi- oids. Naloxone in combination with buprenorphine prevents misuse of buprenorphine because naloxone precipitates acute withdrawal if it is crushed and injected. See, Thomas R. Kosten and Tony P.

One study in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, that looked at medication purportedly sold to treat opioid use disorders found that the most common substances present in the samples collected were diphenoxylate, tramadol, other opioids (morphine, codeine) and acet - aminophen.170 These falsified medicines are purportedly sold by herbalists in that country to people seeking self-treatment for opioid use disorders. Supply of opiates versus supply of synthetic opioids The point of origin of opiates and synthetic opioids differs greatly. Opiates found on illicit markets originate primar - ily in or close to the few areas where opium is produced, namely, South-West Asia (notably Afghanistan), South- East Asia (notably Myanmar) and Latin America (notably Mexico).171 By contrast, the origin of synthetic opioids is far less limited, although in recent years, depending on the specific substance, manufacture has been concen - trated in just a few subregions: East and South-East Asia, South Asia and, to a lesser extent, North America and Europe.172 While many synthetic opioids found on illicit markets are legally manufactured before being diverted into illicit channels (mainly within national borders),173 some are also illegally manufactured and subsequently trafficked. Other than from a few reports published in some coun- tries or regions, which show a rather mixed picture, it is difficult to assess in a systematic way whether opiates and synthetic opioids are trafficked by the same or different organized crime groups. Data from the United States, for example, suggest that many of the groups involved in trafficking in heroin are now also involved in trafficking in synthetic opioids. Mexican organized crime groups are involved in the export not only of heroin from Mexico to the United States, but also of fentanyl and its analogues. 170 Hamid Reza Khoddami-Vishteh and others, \"Component analysis of the illegal handmade pills and capsules for self-medicating substance dependence in Tehran, Iran\" , Addiction and Health, vol. 10, No. 1 (January 2018), pp. 17-23. 171 See booklet 3, Drug Market Trends: Cannabis and Opioids, of the present report. 172 INCB, Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2020 - Statistics for 2018 (E/INCB/2019/2), (New York 2020) and previous years. 173 Ibid.seems that both inadequate and stringently controlled access to opioid maintenance treatment may be a poten - tial risk factor for the continued diversion and misuse of opioid agonist therapeutic agents.163 Beyond the misuse of opioid agonists, there is a niche for the use of NPS opioids among some segments of recent NPS users who may also have used opioids in the past, or currently use them. The use of NPS opioids among this group is also seen in the context of self-medication, in particular for coping with everyday life situations and physical or emotional issues such as pain, stress, anxiety and sometimes drug withdrawal and addiction.164 inadvertent exposure to or use of opioids The third pattern of use of multiple opioids, inadvertent exposure to or use of opioids, is common as part of the current opioid crisis in North America and also in the context of NPS opioids emerging on different markets. It is more of a supply-driven dynamic. In such contexts, fentanyls are used as an adulterant of heroin or are used to manufacture falsified pharmaceutical opioids, such as falsified oxycodone or hydrocodone and even falsified benzodiazepines, which are then usually sold to a large and unsuspecting population of users of not only opioids but also cocaine and other stimulants.165, 166 The inadver - tent use of fentanyls in the United States is clear: only 0.1 per cent of the population aged 12 and older self-reported the non-medical use of fentanyls in 2019, yet they account for the majority of the overdose deaths recorded in the country.167 Fentanyls and NPS opioids have also been sold on illegal markets in Western and Central Europe, both on online platforms and the streets, as, or mixed with, heroin and falsified opioids.168, 169 163 Lofwall and Walsh, \"A review of buprenorphine diversion and misuse: the current evidence base and experiences from around the world\" . 164 Christophe Soussan, Martin Andersson and diverse reasons for using novel psychoactive substances: a qualitative study of the users' own perspectives\" , International Journal of Drug Policy, vol. 52 (2018), pp. 71-78. 165 Patil Armenian and others, \"Fentanyl, synthetic opioids: a comprehensive Neuropharmacology, vol. 134, part A (2018), pp. 121-132. 166 United States, Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administra- tion, 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment (October 2018). 167 See also booklet 3, Drug Market Trends: Cannabis and Opioids, of the present report. 168 EMCDDA, European Drug Report 2017: Trends and Developments (Luxembourg, Publications Office of the European Union, 2017). 169 Jolanta B.

In a number of cases, fentan - yl-laced heroin, namely, mixtures of heroin with fentanyl analogues, originating in Mexico have been found in the United States. Mexican organized crime groups, in particular the Sinaloa Cartel, were also identified as suppliers of Dominican organized crime groups operating in the United States that are involved in the sale of heroin and fentanyl in the north-east of the country, most notably in New England. Some of the fentanyl sold by Dominican organized crime groups operating in the United States is also shipped from fentanyl-milling operations in the Dominican Republic. By contrast, Colombian organized crime groups oper - ating in the United States that are involved in cocaine and heroin trafficking do not yet appear to have taken up trafficking in fentanyl and its analogues. Street gangs, prison gangs and outlaw motorcycle gangs have been found to be involved in trafficking a number of drugs, including methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin and, to a lesser extent, prescription and counterfeit pills.174 In Europe, on the other hand, information suggests that the markets for opiates and synthetic opioids are more separated than in the United States. There is one very large and distinct market for heroin and, depending on the country, quite large markets for diverted opioid pharmaceuticals such as buprenorphine, methadone and tramadol, and a small, although potentially highly prob- lematic, market for fentanyl and its analogues. Heroin is mainly trafficked to Western and Central Europe overland along the Balkan route and partly by sea along the southern route, with the subsequent redistribution of heroin from trafficking hubs, such as the ports of Rot - terdam in the Netherlands and Antwerp in Belgium, to major consumer markets in Western and Central Europe. By contrast, synthetic opioids are increasingly traded online and dispatched to countries in the subregion by post from legal or quasi-legal sources, including in China and India and, to a far lesser extent, in Europe: a few illicit laboratories have been detected in France, Estonia, Latvia and Ukraine in recent years.175 174 United States, Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administra- tion, 2019 National Drug Threat Assessment (December 2019). 175 EMCDDA and European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol), EU Drug Markets Report 2019 (Luxembourg, Publications Office of the European Union, 2019). 3 OPIOIDS | Overlap between the use of opioids 6364 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2021OPIOIDSCommon characteristics of the opioid crises in Africa and North America >The ease and low cost of manufacture and easy accessibility of tramadol and fentanyls make the illicit markets for those substances substantially more profitable for traffickers than the markets for other opioids, such as heroin. >The large-scale manufacture of tramadol and fentanyls for the illicit market emerged in the context of an absence of international regulations on tramadol and many fentanyl analogues and their precursors. >The fact that the substances available on pharmaceutical markets can be misused interchangeably with those on the illicit market makes it increasingly difficult to prevent their misuse, especially when their use is seen in the context of medical use and is thus perceived to carry less stigma or is subject to less severe legal sanctions than other controlled drugs. In North America, the introduction of fentanyl and its analogues (fentanyls) into the drug market has resulted in an unprecedented increase in opioid overdoses attributed to synthetic opioids. Earlier, the opioid epidemic in North America was characterized by cyclical waves of heroin use and non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids although in recent years, the non-medical use of opioids and use of heroin has stabilized (in the United States). Fentanyls found on the illicit market are mainly used as adulterants in heroin or other drugs or sold as falsified pharmaceu- tical drugs, with the result that users are often unaware that they are consuming them. As a result, due to the unpredictability of the potency of the different fentan- yls, many users end up with non-fatal or fatal overdose. In West, Central and North Africa and the Middle East, tramadol, a pharmaceutical opioid not under interna - tional control, has emerged as a major opioid of concern. The drug, in addition to being diverted from the legal market, is mainly trafficked into those subregions in Demand for opioids Among people who use drugs, the non-medical use of opioids has always been associated with more negative health consequences than the use of any other drug type. The non-medical use of opioids is attributed to 12.9 mil- lion DALYs (healthy years of life lost due to disability and premature death), or 70 per cent of the total 18 million DALYs attributed to drug use disorders. The use of opioids also contributes to the majority of deaths attributed to drug use disorders and contributes significantly to the number of deaths attributed to liver cancer, cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases resulting from hepatitis C, as well as to those attributed to HIV and AIDS.178 Heroin remains the opioid of major concern for the great major - ity of countries, but in some countries and subregions, the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids has trig - gered new health threats in the last few years and has come to be known as an opioid crisis. The non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids is not a new phenomenon, however. It has been observed for decades as part of the polydrug use pattern seen among high-risk or regular opioid users. What characterizes the most recent opioid epidemic in North America is the alarming rate of opioid overdose deaths that are attributed mainly to synthetic opioids (fentanyls), while in West, Central and North Africa, the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids such as tramadol is of con - cern. The health impacts of the surge in the markets for fentanyls and tramadol appear to be different: the emergence of fentanyls has not increased the number of people who use opioids, but it has driven up the number of overdose cases mainly among existing opioid users. Tramadol, on the other hand, seems to have driven up use among a wider segment of the population and has led to an increasing number of people in treatment rather than driving up the number of deaths, although reliable information on overdoses is not available for Africa. 178 See also booklet 2, Global Overview of Drug Demand and Drug Supply, of the present report. OPIOIDS | Demand for opioids3 65dosages higher than those prescribed for pain man - agement, resulting in an increasing number of people with tramadol use disorder entering treatment in recent years.179, 180 While the rapid spread of the non-medical use of tramadol is evident, in general there are serious infor - mation gaps with respect to its market, and measurable information on its impact on health (or on drug-related deaths and overdoses) is limited. Another key difference in the spread of the non-medical use of tramadol and fentanyls is that the use of fentan- yls is mainly supply driven. In the case of tramadol, this is less clear. Although in some areas the market for the non-medical use of tramadol may have emerged as a result of easy access in unregulated pharmaceutical mar - kets, there are indications that it may have been mainly demand driven, at least until 2017. In addition, the use of use a drug is to a large extent related to the availability of the drug more than to an individual's preference to use or misuse a particular substance.181 Number of opioid users worldwide has nearly doubled since 2010 In 2019, nearly 62 million people were estimated to be past-year users of opioids, including people who use opiates and people who use pharmaceutical opioids for non-medical purposes; this corresponds to 1.2 per cent of the global population aged 15-64. Among opioid users, about half (31 million) had used opiates (heroin and opium) in the past year (0.6 per cent of the popula- tion aged 15-64). Between 2010 and 2019, the estimated number of opioid users worldwide nearly doubled, from just over 31 million to just under 62 million estimated past-year users. Over the same period, the prevalence of opioid use increased by 76 per cent, whereas the global population increased by 10 per cent. The main increase in the global number of opioid users in recent years has been driven by a number of new esti - mates made available for Asia and Africa.

Opioid use in Asia increased in South-West and South Asia but declined in East and South-East Asia Although the prevalence of opioid use in Asia is compa- rable to the global average, more than half of the global estimated number of opioid users reside in the region. High levels of opioid use are estimated in South-West Asia (Afghanistan, Iran (Islamic Republic of) and Paki - stan), where the past-year prevalence is estimated at 3.2 per cent of the adult population, or 6.8 million esti- mated past-year users of opioids. In both South-West Asia and South Asia, opiates (heroin in the case of Paki- stan and India and opium in the case of Afghanistan and Iran (Islamic Republic of)) are the predominant opioids that are misused. The non-medical use of pharmaceuti- cal opioids is, however, at a comparable level to that of opiates in those subregions. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the non-medical use of tramadol is also reported; a systematic review estimated the pooled past-year preva - lence among the general population as ranging between 3.7 and 6.0 per cent among men and 0.1 and 3.3 per cent 66 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2021among women, based on studies conducted between 2006 and 2018.182 In India, 2.1 per cent of the population aged 10-75, a total of 23 million people, were estimated to be past-year opioid users in 2018. The opioid with the highest preva- lence of use was heroin, with a past-year prevalence of 1.1 per cent among the population aged 10-75, followed by the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids, the prevalence of which reached almost 1 per cent of the general population, and opium, the prevalence of which was almost 0.5 per cent.183 Among the 23 million past- year opioid users, 7.7 million were estimated to suffer from opioid use disorders. Although no recent survey estimates are available from individual countries in East and South-East Asia, based on UNODC estimates, opioid use in the subregion appears to have declined over the period 2010-2019.

With a past-year prevalence of 1 per cent of the adult population (more than half a million users), opioid use in Central Asia and Transcaucasia is also high. Although heroin has been the predominant opioid used in the sub - region, in recent years there has been a reported decline in the official numbers of registered opioid users and of those in drug treatment. An increasing number of syn - thetic drugs, such as amphetamines, mephedrone and alpha -PVP , have also appeared on the market, although it remains to be seen whether they have substituted opiates or attracted new users. It seems that, rather than sub - stituting opiates, the consumption of these stimulants is often combined with cannabis and opioids, result - ing in polydrug use patterns. Regular opioid users, as reported by Uzbekistan, for example, may substitute opiates with pharmaceutical opioids such as tramadol or other pharmaceutical drugs with sedative effects, such as pregabalin, zaleplon and tropicamide.186 In Kazakhstan, 120,500 people (about 1 per cent of the adult population) were estimated to be injecting drugs in 186 Tomas Zabransky and Viktor Mravcik, eds, The 2019 Regional Report on the Drug Situation in Central Asia (Prague, 2019). per cent of the population, were estimated to have used opioids in the past year. In China, notwithstanding the limitations of data on registered drug users and in the absence of data on the prevalence of opioid use among the general population, the absolute number of heroin users registered declined by a quarter over the period 2010-2019; the number of opioid users declined by 50 per cent as a proportion of the total number of drug users registered in the country.184 Wastewater analysis undertaken in 2018 and 2019 in 25 cities across China showed an average drug consumption of 56.7 mg per day per 1,000 inhabitants (56.7 \u00b1 56.8 mg per day per 1,000 inhabitants), with heroin consumption second after methamphetamine.185 The consumption of heroin was higher in south-west China (108 \u00b1 147 mg per day per 1,000 inhabitants), central China (59.2 \u00b1 48.0 mg per day per 1,000 inhabitants) and in north-west China (51.5 \u00b1 50.3 mg per day per 1,000 inhabitants) than in other parts of the country.

In addition, 2.3 per cent of the population (an equal proportion of men and women) reported the misuse of codeine-based cough syrups in Nigeria in 2018.189 In North Africa, the non-medical use of tramadol is also a major issue in Egypt, where an estimated 3 per cent of the adult population misused tramadol in 2016, the latest year for which data are available. Similarly, in 2016, 1.4 per cent of secondary school students in Egypt reported the non-medical use of tramadol in the past year.190 Among other countries in the subregion, for which recent infor - mation is available from school surveys, the pattern of opioid use differs, with heroin reportedly used by adoles - cents in Algeria and Morocco and buprenorphine misused in Tunisia.191 189 UNODC and Nigeria, Drug use in Nigeria 2018 (Vienna, 2019). 190 Menan Rabie and others, \"Prevalence updates of substance use among Egyptian adolescents\" , Middle East Current Psychiatry, vol. 27, No. 4 (February 2020). 191 Council of Europe, Pompidou Group, Mediterranean School Survey Project on Alcohol and other drugs (MedSPAD) reports for Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia.2016. This estimate has remained more or less unchanged over the past 10 years.

While the population aged 15-64 in the region grew by 10 per cent over the period 2010-2019, the estimated number of past-year opioid users increased fourfold and the prevalence of opioid use increased threefold. Although heroin use is commonly reported by many countries in the region, the non-med - ical use of tramadol has emerged as a major problem, especially in West and Central Africa and in North Africa. 187 Ganina L.

The only recent surveys were conducted in Chile (2018), which reported a prevalence of non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids of 1.1 per cent and negligi - ble use of opiates (heroin or opium), in Uruguay (2018), 196 Ibid.Among people in treatment, heroin remained one of the main problem drugs across most sites reporting treat - ment data for 2019 in South Africa.192 Across different reporting sites, between 2 and 40 per cent of people attending specialized drug treatment services reported heroin as their primary or secondary substance of con- cern. The use of heroin also includes the local variants of heroin known as nyaope and whoonga.193 In addition, about 3 per cent of people accessing drug treatment services in South Africa reported the non-medical use of codeine.194 Opioid use declining in Australia The past-year prevalence of opioid use in the subregion of Australia and New Zealand (3.3 per cent) was higher than the global average in 2019, although it only reflects the situation in Australia because recent estimates of opioid use are available only for that country. The non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids and the frequency thereof have decreased since 2016 in Australia. In 2019, 2.7 per cent of the population aged 14 and older misused pharma - ceutical opioids in Australia, a decline from 3.6 per cent in 2016; among those who had misused the substances in the past 12 months, the proportion of people misusing them at least weekly declined from 29 per cent in 2016 to 19.5 per cent in 2019, although the proportion of those misusing them just once or twice a year increased from 28 per cent in 2016 to 43 per cent in 2019.195 In February 2018, medications containing codeine were reclassified as schedule 4 drugs in Australia, meaning that they could no longer be purchased from a pharmacy or chemist without a prescription. The reduced ease of access to these substances resulting from the schedul - ing change may account for some of the reductions in the non-medical use of painkillers and opioids. In 2019, although the majority of people misusing pharmaceu - tical opioids continued to misuse codeine, there was 192 Siphokazi Dada and others, \"Monitoring alcohol, tobacco and other drug use trends in South Africa: July-December 2019 - Phase 47\" , Research Brief (Cape Town, South Africa, South African Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use, 2020). 193 These are street names for heroin that is often mixed with other regulated and unregulated substances.

Although the number of overdose deaths attributed to the misuse of pharmaceutical opioids and the use of heroin has stabilized in recent years, this gain is offset which reported that 4.9 per cent of the adult population had misused pharmaceutical opioids in the past year,197, 198 and in Colombia (2019), which reported a prevalence of 0.3 per cent of non-medical use of opioids.199 Opioid use in North America appears stable but number of overdose deaths continues to increase In North America, although the non-medical use of phar - maceutical opioids is a major issue, it appears to be stable and the opioid crisis is driven mainly by an increase in the number of opioid overdoses attributed to fentanyl and its analogues. Thus, one of the main adverse health outcomes of the opioid crisis in the United States is the unprecedented number of fatal overdose cases attributed to opioids. 197 Uruguay, VIII de Drogas, 2020). 198 Response submitted by Chile to the annual report questionnaire for 2019. 199 Colombia, Encuesta Nacional de Consumo de Sustancias Psicoactivas, Trends in opioid overdose deaths, United States, 2010-2019 Source: United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER), \"Multiple cause of death 1999-2019\" .

In 2019, of the 8,196 samples that were identified as tramadol, 44 per cent (3,961 samples) contained at least one other drug, the majority (85 per cent) being fentanyl, while more than half (57 per cent) contained heroin, 10 per cent contained acetylfentanyl and 7 per cent contained cocaine.205 In contrast to the increase in the number of opioid over - dose deaths, the misuse of pharmaceutical opioids and use of heroin in the United States appears to be stabi - lizing, especially since 2017. In 2019, 3.7 per cent of the population (10.2 million people) aged 12 and older in the United States had misused opioids in the past year, 3.6 per cent of the population aged 12 and older (97 per cent of all opioid users) had misused pharmaceutical opioids and 0.3 per cent had used heroin. However, as in any other country, estimates of heroin users based on household surveys are considered as underestimates as they are based on self-reporting and 205 United States, Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Adminis - tration, Diversion Control Division, \"National Forensic Laboratory Information System: drug special report - tramadol reported in NFLIS, 2010-2019\" (Springfield, Virginia, 2020).by the continuing increase in the number of deaths attributed to synthetic opioids (mainly fentanyls). It is important to keep in mind that most fatal overdose cases involve more than one type of drug. Even in the case of deaths attributed to opioids, the mixing of dif - ferent opioids along with other drugs is common. A large proportion of overdose deaths attributed to heroin (62 per cent of the total 14,000 deaths attributed to heroin) and pharmaceutical opioids (42 per cent of the total 14,000 deaths attributed to pharmaceutical opioids) also involved synthetic opioids (fentanyls). Fentanyls also contribute significantly to the increased number of overdose deaths attributed to the use of cocaine and other psychostimulants such as methamphetamine.200, 201 Among the reasons for the large number of overdose deaths attributed to fentanyls is that their lethal doses are often small in relation to those of other opioids: fentanyl, for example, is approximately 100 times more potent than morphine, and carfentanil may be as much as 10,000 times more potent than morphine for an aver - age user. A lethal dose of carfentanil for a human can be as low as 20 micrograms.202, 203 The spread of fentanyls in the United States continues to be visible in the analysis of drug samples from seizures, which shows the gradual diversification of synthetic opi - oids on the market, with a considerable increase since 2014 in the number of samples identified as fentanyl. Furthermore, while fentanyl has been the predominant substance seized over the years, its analogues have rap - idly proliferated in the United States. As a percentage of all pharmaceutical opioid samples seized and identified in 2019, among notable fentanyl analogues, acetylfentanyl accounted for 6 per cent of identified samples, followed by carfentanil (1.6 per cent), valeryl fentanyl (1.0 per cent) and fluoroisobutyrylfentanyl (0.2 per cent).204 Tramadol has also been increasingly identified in sei - zure samples: over the period 2010-2019, there was an 200 Calculated from the overdose deaths reported by the Centers for Dis - ease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, in the Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER), \"Multiple cause of death 1999-2019\" . 201 See also, \"Cocaine use\" in booklet 4 of the present report. 202 EMCDDA, \"Fentanyl drug profile\" . 203 United States, Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administra- tion, 2019 National Drug Threat Assessment, December 2019. 204 United States, Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Adminis - tration, Diversion Control Division, \"National Forensic Laboratory Information System: drug 2019 annual report\" (Springfield, Virginia, 2020).Fig. 49 Substances submitted to and analysed by forensic laborato- ries, by type of drug identified, United States, 2009-2019 Source: United States, Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, Diversion Control Division, National Forensic Laboratory Information System reports for different years. 020,00040,00060,00080,000100,000120,000140,000160,000180,000200,000 020,00040,00060,00080,000100,000120,000 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Number of heroin samplesNumber of pharmaceutical opioid samples Oxycodone Hydrocodone Tramadol Fentanyl Heroin 72 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2021do not cover the homeless or the institutionalized popu - lations, which tend to have higher rates of opioid use in the United States. For example, in 2016, based on another study, 2.3 million people were estimated to be chronic heroin users in the United States, while the National Survey on Drug Use and Health conducted the same year estimated the number of past-year heroin users to be about 950,000 and the number of past-month heroin users to be just under half a million.206 Although 2.3 times higher, the estimates of chronic heroin users in the 2016 study show a similar trend over time to the estimates of past-year use of heroin based on the household survey. The extent of the non-medical use of opioids varies con - siderably across sociodemographic characteristics in the United States. For example, more men than women use opioids for non-medical purposes, as do American Indian/ Alaska Natives when compared with other ethnic groups. People who are unemployed also report a higher rate of misuse than people who are employed; also, the rate of opioid use among those who did not attend or complete a college degree was higher than among those who were college graduates. 206 Gregory Midgette and others, What America's Users Spend on Illegal Drugs, 2006-2016 (Santa Monica, California, RAND Corporation, 2019).1234567 Male Female White Hispanic or Latino American Indian or Alaska Native African American Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander Asian Less than high school High-school graduate Some College/Associate's degree College graduate Full time Part time Unemployed Sex Ethnicity Education EmploymentAnnual prevalence (percentage)Fig. 50 Trends in past-year use of heroin and non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids, as reported in household surveys, United States, 2010-2019 Source: United States, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Results from the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH): Detailed Tables (Rockville, Maryland, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2020).00.40.81.21.62 02468101214 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Heroin: number of users (millions)Pharmaceutical opioids: number of users (millions) Pharmaceutical opioids Heroin0.00.51.01.52.02.5 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016Number (millions) Chronic heroin users (RAND Corporation) Past-year heroin users (National Survey) Past-month heroin users (National Survey)Fig. 51 Trends in the use of heroin in the United States, based on different studies, 2006-2016 Sources: Gregory Midgette and others, What America's Users Spend on Illegal Drugs, 2006-2016 (Santa Monica, California, RAND Corporation, 2019); and United States, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Results from the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH): Detailed Tables (Rockville, Maryland, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2020).

The majority of the opioid overdose deaths in 2019 were attributed to fentanyl and/or fen - tanyl analogues. The geographical spread of opioid overdose deaths is uneven in Canada. Most opioid overdose deaths are seen in the western parts of the country: British Columbia (19.9 opioid overdose deaths per 100,000 (14.6 opioid per 100,000 pop- ulation); and Ontario (10.4 opioid overdose deaths per 100,00 population). In the north, Yukon saw 10.2 opioid overdose deaths per 100,000 population in 2019.211 Opioid use in the past year in Mexico was estimated at 0.1 per cent of the adult population in 2016.212 More recently, wastewater analysis of samples collected between November 2017 and February 2018 in 15 cities across Mexico indicated the emergence of fentanyl use, at least in the northern parts of the country.213 This anal - ysis showed heroin metabolites in six sites and none, that is below-detection levels, in seven others; fentanyl metabolites above the detection and quantifiable levels were found only in two cities, Monterrey and San Luis R\u00edo Colorado, which are respectively in the north-east and north-west of the country. The levels of heroin metabo- lites in Monterrey were the highest, at 15.8 mg per day per 1,000 population. Low levels of fentanyl metabolites were found in Monterrey (1.1 mg per day per 1,000 population) and in San Luis R\u00edo Colorado, which borders California, United States (0.99 mg per day per 1,000 population). Such levels suggest that, although fentanyl consump - tion does exist in Mexico, it remains low compared with that in the neighbouring country of the United States. In Eastern Kentucky in the United States, for example, the level of fentanyl metabolites found in wastewater anal- ysis in 2018 was 169 mg per day per 1,000 population.214 Opioid use in Europe has remained generally stable since 2016 The past-year prevalence of opioid use in Europe in 2019 is estimated at 0.7 per cent of the population aged 15-64, or 3.6 million people. Heroin remains the most commonly used opioid in the region. 211 Ibid. 212 Response submitted by Mexico to the annual report questionnaire. 213 Copytzy Cruz-Cruz and others, \"Opioids, stimulants, and depressant Mexican cities: a wastewater-based epidemiological study\" , International Journal of Drug Policy, vol. 88 (2021). 214 Ibid.In Canada, the opioid crisis is also driven by the use of pharmaceutical opioids, both diverted from licit channels and originating in the illicit market, and an increasing number of opioid overdose deaths have been attributed to fentanyls since 2016.207, 208 In 2017, an estimated 12 per cent of the population aged 15 and older in Canada (3.5 million people) had used pharmaceutical opioids in the past year, of whom about 2 per cent reported the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids.209 Following an almost 50 per cent increase between 2016 and 2018, from 3,023 deaths (age-adjusted rate of 8.4 deaths per 100,000 population) in 2016 to 4,383 deaths (age-adjusted rate of 11.8 deaths per 100,000 population) in 2018, the reported number of opioid overdose deaths in Canada declined in 2019 (3,811 deaths, or age-adjusted rate of 10.1 per 100,000 population). However, by Sep- tember 2020, the rate of overdose deaths rebounded, to 16.0 deaths per 100,000 population (4,395 deaths). 210 The majority (72 per cent) of the deaths reported in 2019 207 Opioid overdose data for Canada are available from 2016. 208 Lisa Belzak and Jessica Halverson, \"The opioid crisis in Canada: a national perspective,\" Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Preven- tion in Canada, vol. 38, No. 6 (June 2018). 209 Health Canada, \"Canadian Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CTADS): summary of results for 2017\" , 4 January 2019. 210 Canada, Special Advisory Committee on the Epidemic of Opioid Overdoses, Apparent Opioid and Stimulant Toxicity Deaths: Surveillance of Opioid and Stimulant-related Harms in Canada, (Ottawa, Public Health Agency, 2021).

On the basis of law enforcement data, it is considered that the drug market in the Russian Federation has diversified in the last few years, with an increasing number of synthetic drugs, such as the cathi - nones alpha-PVP and mephedrone, and amphetamine, having rapidly gained a share of the market; however, it remains to be seen whether they have substituted opiates or have attracted new users. Nevertheless, notwith - standing the limitations of the data on drug treatment provision, there are indications of a substantial decline over the past 10 years or more in the rate of people enter - ing treatment for the first time for any drug or for opioid use disorders in the Russian Federation, as well as in the number of drug users and opioid users registered in the country. In Ukraine, the only available estimates of opioid use are indirect: in 2018, 350,000 people (1.1 per cent of the adult population) were estimated to be injecting drugs, mostly opiates, including heroin and methadone sold on illicit 16.718.316.1 15.2 14.512.210.5 7.7 7.26.14.2 3.6 2.8 2.7 0.02.04.06.08.010.012.014.016.018.020.022.0 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019Number of persons per 100,000 population Opioids Cannabinoids Cocaine Psychostimulants Other drugs and combinationsFig. 54 First-time entrants in drug treatment, Russian Federation, 2006-2019 Source: Russian Federation, Ministry of Health.Fig. 55 Trends in registered drug users, Russian Federation, 2010-2019 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire for different years.0100,000200,000300,000400,000500,000600,000700,000 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019Number Total drug users Opioid users Fig. 56 Opioid use in Western and Central Europe, 2010-2019 Source: UNODC estimates, based on responses to the annual report questionnaire.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019Annual prevalence (percentage) 3 OPIOIDS | Demand for opioids 75and reported in the European Union. They are available on the clear web, the dark web and street drug markets, are used to manufacture falsified medicines and are sold as legal replacements for opioids under international control. In the European Union, cyclopropylfentanyl, carfentanil and acrylfentanyl in particular were associ - ated with a number of fentanyl-related deaths reported in 2018.220 However, attempts to gain a share of the illicit opioid market with those drugs have been detected and suppressed in Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, for example.221 Data on opioid overdose deaths over the period 2016-2019 in Sweden clearly show a sudden reduction in the markets for fentanyls. To date, there is no indication of an established market for fentanyls as an adulterant or as a main substance of use in Europe, other than in Estonia, where an isolated niche market for fentanyl has developed since 2013.222 There are, however, indications that other opioids, such as buprenorphine, fentanyl, codeine, mor - being misused in 220 EMCDDA, Drug-related Deaths and Mortality in Europe: Update from the EMCDDA Expert Network, July 2019 (Luxembourg, Publications Office of the European Union, 2019). 221 See, for instance, UNODC, World Drug Report 2020, booklet 4, Cross-Cutting Issues: Evolving Trends and New Challenges. 222 Ibid.In Western and Central Europe (mainly the States mem - bers of the European Union) heroin also remains the main opioid used. Between 2010 and 2019, the estimated number of people who use opioids and the past-year prevalence of opioid use (essentially heroin use) in West - ern and Central Europe increased by about 65 per cent. However, since 2016, opioid use in the subregion has remained generally stable. Nonetheless, recent estimates in Austria, Germany and Italy suggest an increase in the use of heroin. In the Euro - pean Union, there are an estimated 1.3 million high-risk opioid users218 (0.4 per cent of the population aged 15-64 in 2018); they use mainly heroin. Heroin availability in the European Union appears to be stable; the purity of heroin, which increased between 2008 and 2014, and its price, which declined, have both remained stable since then.219 In the European market, fentanyls have begun to be detected in seizures and overdose deaths. Since 2012, more than 30 fentanyl analogues have been detected 218 As defined by EMCDDA, \"high-risk opioid use\" is the recurrent use of opioids or other drugs that causes actual harm (negative conse- quences, including dependence, but also other health, psychological or social problems) to the person, or places the person at a high probability or risk of suffering from such harm. 219 EMCDDA, European Drug Report 2020: Trends and Developments (Lux - embourg, Publications Office of the European Union, 2020).Fig. 57 Trends in high-risk opioid use, selected countries in Western and Central EMCDDA as the recurrent use of opioids or other drugs that causes actual harm (negative consequences, including dependence, but also other health, psychological or social problems) to the person, or places the person at a high probability or risk of suffering from such harm. 01234567 2010 2011 2012 2013 2015 2017 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2014 2015 2017 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2017 2018 Austria Cyprus Czechia France Germany Greece ItalyRate per 1,000 population 76 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2021ageing of a large proportion of the opioid-using popu - lation, who remain at the greatest risk of drug overdose death.225 The trend in opioid-related deaths in Northern Ireland, where the rate of drug-related deaths is high (10.0 per 100,000 population) and has more than doubled over the past decade, provides an example of the diversifica- tion and spread of the different opioids on the market.226 225 EMCDDA, European Drug Report 2020: Trends and Developments. 226 Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, \"Drug-related and drug misuse deaths 2008-2018\" , 16 January 2020.the European Union. For instance, 16 per cent of clients entering drug treatment for an opioid-related problem in 2019 reported a synthetic opioid as their main problem drug.223 By comparison, nearly 10 per cent of all opioid users entering treatment in 2013 did so for disorders related to the use of opioids other than heroin.224 Over the past five years, in particular, there has also been an increase in the number of drug overdose deaths, with 8 or 9 overdose deaths out of every 10 such deaths in the European Union involving heroin. In 2018, 8,300 over - dose deaths (22.3 deaths per million population aged 15-64), primarily involving opioids, were reported in the European Union, as compared with about 6,000 such deaths reported in 2013. Overdose deaths in Germany and the United Kingdom together accounted for half of overdose deaths in the European Union, where the mean age of those who died from a drug overdose continued to increase, reaching 42 years in 2018.

In other regions and subregions, the trend was stable, notably in Africa, or even declining, such as in South America, Central Amer - ica and the Caribbean (particularly after 2017) and in East and South-East Asia. Access to pharmaceutical opioids for pain management Access to and availability of pharmaceutical opioids are highly unequal across regions and subregions Access to and availability of pharmaceutical opioids for pain medication and/or opioid -substitution treatment remain highly unequal across geographical regions and subregions and show diverging trends.227, 228 In 2019, on a per capita basis, the availability of pharmaceutical opi - oids for medical consumption in Africa as a whole and for Melanesia, Polynesia, Micronesia, the Caribbean, South Asia, Central America and South America was less than 1 per cent of the availability in North America. Low- and middle-income countries, which are home to 84 per cent of the global population, had the lowest avail- ability, equivalent to less than 1 per cent of the per capita amount of pharmaceutical opioids available for medical consumption in high-income countries in 2019. Nevertheless, between 2015 and 2019, the amount of opi - oids controlled under the international drug conventions available for medical consumption increased by 48 per cent in low- and middle-income countries and declined by 11 per cent in high-income countries. These trends were not uniform across subregions, how- ever. The decline in the medical use of such opioids in the subregions where availability is high over the period 2015- 2019 occurred mainly in North America (even though data show an increase between 2017 and 2019) and in Western and Central Europe, while the increase in medical use in the subregions where availability is low was observed mainly in the Near and Middle East/South-West Asia, 227 INCB, Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for - Statistics for 2019 (E/INCB/2020/2). 228 INCB, Psychotropic Substances: Statistics for 2019 - Assessments of Annual Medical and Scientific Requirements for Substances in Sched- ules II, III and IV of the Convention on Psychotropic Substance of 1971 (E/INCB/2020/3).Fig. 60 Amounts of opioids under international control (excluding preparations) available for medical consumption, by sub\u00ad region, 2019 Sources: UNODC calculations based on the following INCB reports: Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2021 - Statistics for 2019 (E/INCB/2020/2); and Psychotropic Substances: Statistics for 2019 - Assessments of Annual Medical and Scientific Requirements for Substances in Schedules II, III and IV of the Convention on Psychotropic Substance of 1971 (E/INCB/2020/3).

The avail - ability of buprenorphine for medical consumption, on the other hand, is widespread in South Asia and, to a lesser extent, in West and Central Africa, while morphine is more readily available, in relative terms, in Africa, most notably in Southern Africa, West and Central Africa and East Africa. The data and trends displayed in the figures should, however, be interpreted with caution as they exclude tramadol, an opioid that is not under international con- trol and is widely used in some regions.

The availability of methadone and buprenorphine, the opioids used in the medically assisted treatment of opioid use disorders, also saw marked increases, as did the availability of fentanyl (for medical use). Following the introduction of stricter rules to reduce diver - sion to markets for non-medical use in North America, the decline in availability since 2014 has been particu - larly marked in the case of oxycodone, hydrocodone and hydromorphone. Nonetheless, in 2019, the subregion continued to account for the main share of the global Availability of methadone and buprenorphine for medical consumption on the increase at the global level in the last decade, despite diverging trends in recent years Following a rapid expansion over the period 1998-2010, the amount of pharmaceutical opioids (expressed in S-DDD) available for medical consumption declined at the global level over the period 2014-2018 and stabi - lized in 2019.235 235 INCB, Narcotic Drugs 2020: Estimated World Requirements for 2021 - Statistics for 2019 (E/INCB/2020/2), and previous years.

This results in varying coverage of opioid agonist treat - ment for opioid use disorders. The availability of methadone for medical consumption is generally high in North America, Western and Cen - tral Europe and in the most developed parts of Oceania. Nonetheless, the individual countries with the highest availability of methadone for medical consumption on a per capita basis were widely dispersed across continents, with the highest levels reported in the Seychelles, fol - lowed by the United States, Canada, Australia, Mauritius and the Islamic Republic of Iran over the period 2017- 2019.237 A total of 88 countries reported the availability 236 UNODC, World Drug Report 2020, booklet 6, Other Drug Policy Issues (United Nations publication, 2020). 237 INCB, Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2021 - Statistics for 2019 (E/INCB/2020/2).amounts of oxycodone (65 per cent), hydromorphone (83 per cent) and hydrocodone (99 per cent) available for medical consumption. By contrast, the amounts of buprenorphine and meth - adone available for medical consumption have clearly increased since the late 1980s. Between 2009 and 2019, the amount of buprenorphine available for medical con - sumption rose by 89 per cent, while that of methadone rose by 42 per cent at the global level, although in recent years availability of buprenorphine for medical consump - tion showed a decline, while that of methadone continued increasing. The overall availability for medical consump - tion of methadone and that of buprenorphine globally remained at similar levels in 2018 and 2019.

However, data available for the period 1 July 2018-30 June 2019 show a decline of 23 per cent in the area under opium poppy cultivation compared with the same period a year earlier, to 21,500 ha, the smallest area since 2014. At the same time, most of the opium poppy continues to be grown in six states located along or close to the Pacific coast, most notably the states of Sinaloa and Chihuahua, in the north, and the state of Guerrero, in the south .244 Data show that, in 2019, the last year for which com - prehensive cultivation data are available, 69 per cent of the global area under opium poppy cultivation was located in Afghanistan, 14 per cent in Myanmar and 9 per cent in Mexico, suggesting that these three countries accounted for 92 per cent of global illicit cultivation of opium poppy that year. Global opium production stabilized in 2020 Global opium production, which has shown a long-term upward trend, remained largely stable in 2020 compared with the previous year. Nonetheless, at 7,410 tons, it was almost 60 per cent higher than a decade earlier, although it remained below the peak reported for 2017 (10,240 tons). The stabilization of opium production in 2020 was the result of a decline of 20 per cent in opium production in Myanmar245 and the stabilization of opium production in Afghanistan.246 This occurred despite the increase in the area under opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan and was the result of a lower yield than in the previous year. Estimated yields ranged from about 18 kg per ha in western Afghanistan to 41 kg of opium per ha in eastern Afghanistan, with about 29 kg per ha in south-western Afghanistan, which accounted for 71 per cent of total opium production in the country in 2020. Opium yields in Afghanistan thus continued to exceed those in Mexico (around 21 kg per ha in 2018/19)247 and were double those in Myanmar (around 14 kg per ha in 2020).248 244 UNODC and M\u00e9xico, 245 UNODC, Myanmar Opium Survey 2020: Cultivation, Production, and Implications. 246 UNODC and Afghanistan, \"Afghanistan opium survey 2020: cultivation and production executive Opium Survey 2020: Cultivation, Production, and Implications.Opium produced in countries in South-East Asia, mostly Myanmar (accounting for 7 per cent of global opium production) and, to a lesser extent, the Lao People's Democratic Republic (about 1 per cent of global opium production), supplies markets in East and South-East Asia and in Oceania. Opium produced in countries in Latin America, mostly Mexico (6 per cent of global opium production) and, to a far lesser extent, Colombia and Guatemala (less than 1 per cent of the global total each), accounts for most of the heroin supplied to the United States and the relatively limited heroin markets of South America. Estimated area under opium poppy cultivation grew in 2020 The global area under opium poppy cultivation increased by 24 per cent in 2020 to about 294,000 ha, primarily owing to increases in Afghanistan, where the area under opium poppy cultivation increased by 37 per cent, to 224,000 ha, the third highest level ever reported in the country, and more than 80 per cent higher than a decade earlier.240 Increases were reported in most parts of the country, with the exception of the eastern region, where cultivation declined by 28 per cent, and two provinces in northern Afghanistan (Balkh and Jawzjan). In Helmand province, which accounts for more than 50 per cent of total area under opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, opium poppy cultivation rose by 27 per cent in 2020. In a number of other provinces, including Badghis and Faryab, bordering Turkmenistan, and Ghazni and Zabul, close to Pakistan, the areas under opium poppy cultiva- tion doubled.241 By contrast, the area under opium poppy cultivation con - tinued to decline in Myanmar and fell by 11 per cent, to 29,500 ha in 2020. Since 2013, the area under opium poppy cultivation in Myanmar has shrunk by almost 50 per cent.242 Opium poppy cultivation in Myanmar con - tinues to take place mainly in Shan State (bordering China, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Thai - land), which accounted for 84 per cent of the total area under opium poppy cultivation in that country in 2020.243 240 UNODC and Afghanistan, \"Afghanistan opium survey 2020: cultivation and production - executive summary\" (April 2020), and previous years. 241 Ibid. 242 UNODC, Myanmar Opium Survey 2020: Cultivation, Production, and Implications (January 2021), and previous years. 243 Ibid. 86 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2021during the first few months of 2020, reflected in a short- lived peak in its price,251 could have played a role.

The decline in the quantity of opiates intercepted in 2019 was mostly due to smaller quantities of morphine being seized (41 per cent less than a year earlier). The quantities of opium and heroin seized, by contrast, remained quite stable (3 per cent more opium and 1 per cent more heroin com - pared with a year earlier). On the basis of the number of countries reporting sei - zures of opiates, trafficking in heroin continued to be more widespread in 2019 (102 countries) in geographical terms than trafficking in opium or morphine (52 and 36 countries, respectively). In parallel, seizures of opium and morphine continued to be concentrated in a few countries, with just three countries accounting for close to 98 per cent of the total global quantities of the two substances seized. By contrast, the three countries where most heroin was seized (Turkey, Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan) accounted for 48 per cent of the global total in 2019. heroin seized,252 and probably also the amount trafficked, seem to have declined in Europe in 2020.253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258 Trafficking in opiates Global quantities of opiates seized have increased steadily over the past two decades despite marked annual fluctuations in opium production The quantities of both opium produced and opiates seized have shown an upward trend over the past two decades, although the increase has been more pronounced in the amount of opiates seized, suggesting that law enforce- ment authorities may have become more efficient in intercepting trafficked opiates worldwide. At the same time, the quantity of opium produced annually has been fluctuating more than the quantity of opiates seized and even more so than the quantity of heroin seized annually. This suggests the existence of opiate inventories to offset fluctuations in opium pro - duction, whereby opium may be temporarily stocked along the supply chain, thus ensuring a smooth supply of heroin to the main consumer markets. Global quantities of opium and heroin seized remained stable in 2019 In terms of weight, opium continued to be the most inter - cepted opiate in 2019 (726 tons), followed by heroin (96 tons) and morphine (26 tons), although when expressed in heroin equivalents, heroin continued to dominate sei - zures of opiates.

Thus, Asia, where more than 90 per cent of global illicit opium production takes places, accounted for 76 per cent of all the quantities of opi - ates (opium, morphine and heroin) seized worldwide (expressed in heroin equivalents) in 2019. Expressed in heroin equivalents, the country reporting the largest quantity of opiates seized in 2019 continued to be the Islamic Republic of Iran, which accounted for more than half (52 per cent) of the global total, followed by Turkey (10 per cent), Pakistan (9 per cent), the United States (4 per cent), China (3 per cent) and Afghanistan (3 per cent).

This was likely a direct result of the increase in trafficking stemming from the record peak in opium pro- duction in Afghanistan two years prior to that. Although the quantities seized were still increasing in 2019, the rate of increase slowed, from 116 per cent in 2017 to 22 per cent in 2018 and 9 per cent in 2019. The largest increase in the quantities of heroin and morphine seized in Europe in 2019 was reported in South-Eastern Europe, which also accounted for the bulk (66 per cent) of all such amounts seized in Europe in 2019, followed by Western and Central Europe (close to 28 per cent) and Eastern Europe (6.5 per cent). The largest quantities of heroin and morphine seized in Europe were reported in South-Eastern Europe by Turkey (62 per cent of the European total), followed by Bulgaria, reflecting the ongoing use of the Balkan route; the largest quanti- ties seized in Western and Central Europe were reported by Belgium, followed by the Netherlands, France, Ger - many, the United Kingdom, Slovenia and Italy; and the largest quantities seized in Eastern Europe were reported by Ukraine, followed by Belarus and the Russian Feder - ation. In all the subregions of Europe, more countries reported increases than decreases in the quantities of heroin and morphine seized in 2019. Quantities of opiates seized stabilized in the Americas in 2019 The quantities of heroin and morphine seized in the Americas remained stable in 2019, although they were more than double those seized a decade earlier. Opiate trafficking remained concentrated in North America, with the quantities of heroin and morphine seized in the subregion accounting for 92 per cent of the total quan- tity seized in the Americas in 2019. Seizures made in the United States alone accounted for 83 per cent of the total quantity seized in the region that year. This was followed, in descending order of quantities seized, by Mexico (the country where most opium is produced in the region), Ecuador, Colombia, Canada and Guatemala. Decline in quantities of heroin and morphine seized in the main opium-producing areas continued in 2019 The Near and Middle East/South-West Asia continued to report the largest quantities of heroin and morphine seized at the global level. Those subregions together accounted for almost half (45 per cent) of the global quantities of heroin and morphine seized in 2019, with the largest quantities reported by the Islamic Republic of Iran, followed by Pakistan and Afghanistan, account - ing for 99 per cent of all such quantities seized in these subregions. Parallel to the decline in opium production in Afghanistan from a peak in 2017, the quantities of heroin and morphine seized in the Near and Middle East/South- West Asia also declined from a peak in 2017 (60 per cent decline between 2017 and 2019). Preliminary data sug - gest, however, that in parallel with the stabilization in opium production in Afghanistan in 2020, the downward trend in the quantities seized came to a halt in 2020.259, 260 Accounting for 9 per cent of the global total in 2019, the quantities of heroin and morphine seized in East and South-East Asia also continued to decline, in parallel with ongoing declines in opium and heroin production in the subregion. The largest quantities of heroin and morphine intercepted in East and South-East Asia in 2019 were again reported by China, which accounted for more than half (59 per cent), followed by Viet Nam, Thailand, Malaysia and Myanmar. The decline in the quantities of heroin seized is also in line with reports of persistent decreases in the demand for opiates in East and South- East Asia, including in China, as reflected in the number of registered drug users in that country.261 By contrast, the amount of opiates seized in other subre - gions of Asia (8 per cent of the global total) increased in 2019, reflecting increases in South Asia (notably India), Central Asia (notably Kazakhstan) and Transcaucasia (notably Azerbaijan). Preliminary data based on indi - vidual drug seizures suggest that the upward trend in the quantities of heroin and morphine seized may have continued in South Asia in 2020.262 259 Information made available to the Subcommission on Illicit Drug Traffic and Related Matters in the Near and Middle East at its meet - ings during the extraordinary sessions of the subsidiary bodies of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, held online on 1 and 2 October 2020. 260 UNODC, Drugs Monitoring Platform. 261 See the chapter, \"Demand for opioids\" , in the present booklet. 262 UNODC, Drugs Monitoring Platform. 90 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2021Tanzania). The largest quantities of heroin and morphine seized in West Africa (7 per cent of the African total) were reported by Nigeria, followed by Benin. Despite the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, traffick - ing continued in 2020, and large quantities of heroin were reported seized by the United Republic of Tanzania, including a seizure of 270 kg of heroin from traffickers from Nigeria and the United Republic of Tanzania in Dar es Salaam in April 2020, and 342 kg of heroin from a truck that had travelled from Mozambique to South Africa in September 2020.263 Seizures of smaller amounts were reported by other countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Benin, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Nigeria and Uganda) and in North Africa (Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia).264 Continuous decline in quantities of opiates seized in Oceania In 2019, the quantities of heroin and morphine seized in Oceania decreased for the fourth year in a row and reached their lowest level since 2009. Australia accounts for more than 99 per cent of all the heroin and morphine intercepted in the region. 263 UNODC, Drugs Monitoring Platform. 264 UNODC, Drugs Monitoring Platform; and information provided by the UNODC Regional Office for West and Central Africa.Quantities of opiates intercepted in Africa are not large but have increased in recent years At close to 4 tons in 2019, the quantities of heroin and morphine intercepted in Africa accounted for about 3 per cent of the global quantities of heroin and mor - phine seized. This was double the quantities seized a year earlier and represented a sevenfold increase over those seized in 2009; more than 99 per cent was in the form of heroin. The vast majority of the heroin and morphine seized in Africa in 2019 was reported in North Africa (91 per cent of the total quantity seized in the region), most notably in Egypt, which accounted for 83 per cent of all heroin and morphine seized in Africa in 2019, followed by South - ern Africa (6 per cent of the regional total, most notably Mozambique). The largest quantity of heroin seized in East Africa (1 per cent of the regional total) was reported by Kenya. Over the period 2009-2019, the largest quantities of heroin and morphine seized in Africa were seized in North Africa (52 per cent of the total, most notably in Egypt), followed by East Africa (37 per cent of the total, most notably in Kenya, followed by the United Republic of FiG. 73 Quantities of heroin and morphine seized, by region, 2009-2019 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.05,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,00035,000 020,00040,00060,00080,000100,000120,000140,000 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Asia Europe, Americas, Africa and Oceania Seizures in Europe, Americas, Africa and Oceania (kilograms)Seizures in Asia (kilograms) Near and Middle East/South-West Asia Europe East and South-East Asia Americas Other Asia Africa Oceania 3 91 OPIOIDS | Supply of opiatesMAP 4 Main countries identified as source and destination of heroin shipments, as described by reported seizures, 2015-2019 * A darker shade indicates a larger amount of heroin being seized with the country as source/destination of the shipment, according to the information on trafficking routes provided by Member States in the annual report questionnaire, individual drug seizures and other official documents, over the 2015-2019 period.

These flows supply markets in neighbouring countries, most notably Iran (Islamic Republic of), Pakistan, countries in Central Asia and India, as well as countries in Europe, the Near and Middle East, South Asia and Africa. Small proportions are smuggled to South-East Asia and Oceania. Some 83 per cent of the total global quantities of heroin and mor - phine seized in 2019 were related to opiates produced in Afghanistan. Most opiates are trafficked along the Balkan route and its various branches The world's single largest heroin trafficking route con - tinues to be the Balkan route, along which opiates are smuggled from Afghanistan to the Islamic Republic of Iran, Turkey, the Balkan countries and various destina - tions in Western and Central Europe. Excluding seizures made in Afghanistan, countries along the Balkan route accounted for 50 per cent of the total global quantities of heroin and morphine seized in 2019, with a further 7 per cent reported by countries in Western and Central Europe, of which a significant proportion was trafficked along the Balkan route. Based on mentions of countries of origin, departure and transit by countries in Western and Central Europe, more than 70 per cent of the heroin in Western and Central Europe seems to have transited the Balkan route over the period 2015-2019, some 18 per cent transited the southern route and 7 per cent the northern route, while 3 per cent may have originated in South-East Asia.265, 266 In 2019, the largest quantities of heroin and morphine intercepted along the Balkan route were, as in previous years, reported by the Islamic Republic of Iran (36 tons). Turkey reported seizing 20 tons and the Balkan countries 265 UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire. 266 This finding should be treated with caution as some countries report the occurrence of \"white heroin\" , which they assume must have originated in South-East Asia, although there is evidence that in the past two decades \"white heroin\" has also been manufactured in Afghanistan for export purposes. Sources: U. Zerell, B. Ahrens and P. Gerz, \"Documentation of a heroin manufacturing process in Afghan- istan\" , in Bulletin on Narcotics, vol. LVII, Nos. 1 and 2 (United Nations publication, 2005); and UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.a total of 1 ton. By comparison, countries in Western and Central Europe seized a total of 9 tons in 2019. According to the authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran, most of the heroin and morphine trafficked from Afghanistan transits Pakistan before reaching the Islamic Republic of Iran. In 2018, 90 per cent of the morphine and 85 per cent of heroin seized in the Islamic Republic of Iran had transited Pakistan and only a small proportion had been smuggled directly from Afghanistan. Heroin is mostly trafficked by land into and out of the Islamic Republic of Iran (95 and 97 per cent, respectively, in 2019). Typically, heroin is then smuggled to Turkey or to coun- tries in the Caucasus (75 per cent of all heroin seized in the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2018) and, to a far lesser extent, to Gulf countries (5 per cent of seizures in 2018). The remainder is used domestically (20 per cent in 2018). These patterns seem to have remained the same in 2019 and 2020.267 In Turkey, heroin is mainly trafficked from the east to the west of the country.268 On the basis of preliminary data on individual drug seizures, it appears that, in addition to ongoing heroin seizures in the east of the country, around Istanbul and near the border with Bulgaria, some signif - icant seizures of heroin were also made near the border with the Syrian Arab Republic in 2020,269 suggesting that some heroin is also trafficked through that country in order to avoid controls along the border between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey. From Turkey, heroin is then typically trafficked along the Balkan route to Western and Central Europe, either along the western branch of the route via Bulgaria to various western Balkan countries and then to markets in West - ern and Central Europe or, to a lesser extent, along the eastern branch of the route, which goes via Bulgaria and then to Romania, Hungary and other markets in Western and Central Europe. Heroin trafficking across the Caucasus gained in importance prior to 2019 Heroin and morphine seized in the three Caucasus coun - tries rose from 0.3 tons in 2017 to 1.9 tons in 2019, with most of it reported by Azerbaijan, close to the coun - try's borders with the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Examples of this trafficking pattern include: 670 kg of heroin originating in Afghanistan, which was seized in May 2019 in Frankfurt an der Oder, Germany, on a truck on the way from Kyrgyzstan to Belgium driven by a Turkish national living in Kyrgyzstan; 1.1 tons of heroin seized in Kazakhstan on a truck that had departed the Islamic Republic of Iran for a final destination in Germany, which involved nationals from Germany, Iran (Islamic Republic of), the Netherlands, Poland, Serbia and Turkey; and the seizure of 550 kg of heroin in Minsk, Belarus, in November 2019 that had been trafficked via the north- ern route for onward trafficking to the European Union, again involving a number of foreign nationals.274 Seizures along the northern route of large heroin shipments des - tined for Western and Central Europe were not reported in 2020, however. increasing quantities of opiates are being trafficked along the southern route, including to South Asia and Europe The southern route includes an array of other trafficking routes running mostly south from Afghanistan. Opiates are mainly trafficked along the route via Pakistan and/ or via the Islamic Republic of Iran to India, for domestic consumption and re-export to countries in the region, and to Africa, for local markets and re-export to Europe. Seizures of heroin and morphine reported by countries along the southern route (excluding Pakistan) rose from 2.7 tons in 2015 to 9.4 tons in 2019; their overall share of the global quantities of seized opiates that resulted from opium produced in Afghanistan rose from 3 per cent in 2015 to 8 per cent in 2019. Some of this increase has been linked to an increase in opiate shipments from South-West Asia to South Asia. Data on the prevalence of the use of opiates suggest that South Asia (most notably India) may be home to the larg - est number of opiate users worldwide (17 million people, 273 UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire. 274 UNODC, Drugs Monitoring Platform. Azerbaijan, heroin is typically either trafficked to mar - kets in the Russian Federation or to Georgia, and then across the Black Sea to markets in Western and Central Europe. Georgia reported that 70 per cent of the heroin that entered the country in 2018 had transited Azerbaijan and 20 per cent had transited Armenia. Georgia reported that 90 per cent of the heroin that entered the country in 2019 did so by land, and the rest by air. A temporary increased importance of the Caucasus region as a trafficking route for supplying opiates to mar - kets in the Russian Federation was identified in 2018, when 40 per cent of the heroin found on the Russian market was reported to have transited Azerbaijan, up from 30 per cent in the previous year.270 In 2019, however, the Russian Federation no longer identified Azerbaijan among the three main departure countries of heroin found on its territory. Instead, those three countries were Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan. Moreover, the primary destination for heroin seized in Azerbaijan in both 2019 and 2020 was Ukraine, followed by Georgia and a number of countries in Western and Central Europe, not the Russian Federation.271 Nonetheless, while the importance of the Caucasus route for supplying heroin to the Russian Federation may have declined, a number of heroin seizures made in 2019 and 2020 in the North Caucasian Federal District of the Russian Federation, in particular close to seaports, suggest that heroin contin- ues to be trafficked through the Caucasus, albeit in small quantities, or is trafficked via either the Caspian Sea or the Black Sea to the Russian Federation.272 Trafficking in heroin along the northern route may have increased in 2019 while decreasing to final destinations in the Russian Federation Trafficking in heroin along the northern route, which goes from Afghanistan, through Central Asia mainly to markets located in the Russian Federation, has decreased substantially compared with two decades ago, when the heroin and morphine seized in countries along the route amounted to more than 10 tons and represented more than 10 per cent of global seizures of those opiates traf - ficked from Afghanistan. The proportion was 4 per cent in 2019, up from just 1 per cent in 2018, reflecting an increase in the quantities of heroin seized along the northern 270 UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire. 271 UNODC, Drugs Monitoring Platform. 272 Ibid. 94 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2021Although to a far lesser extent, South Asia continues to receive heroin shipments from neighbouring Myan - mar (less than 1 per cent of total heroin seized in India and 5 per cent of the total heroin seized in Bangladesh in 2019 originated in Myanmar). However, while Ban- gladesh reported that 95 per cent of the heroin seized in the country in 2019 originated in India, the origin of significant amounts of heroin seized in India remains unknown. Some of the opiates seized in India may be of domestic origin, either from diversion from the country's licit opium production or from illicit opium poppy cul - tivation in the hilly and largely inaccessible areas in the north (Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Manipur, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh), where the authorities eradicated more than 10,000 acres (slightly more than 4,000 ha) of opium poppy in 2019.277 Although countries in Western and Central Europe are mostly supplied by heroin trafficked via the Balkan route, the use of the southern route is not uncommon. Of all reported mentions of origin, departure and transit by countries in Western and Central Europe in relation to heroin, 18 per cent referred to trafficking along the southern route over the period 2015-2019, mainly via Southern and East Africa (notably South Africa, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Kenya, Uganda, Madagascar and United Republic of Tanzania), the Gulf countries (notably Qatar and United Arab Emirates) and India. The two European countries reporting seizing the largest quantities of heroin that had been trafficked along the southern route in the period 2015-2019 were Belgium (via Burundi, Ethiopia, South Africa, Uganda, Kenya, Tan - zania and Rwanda) and Italy (mostly by air via Pakistan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Ethiopia, Madagascar and Oman). In 2019, most (98 per cent) of the heroin seized in Belgium arrived by ship from the Islamic Republic of Iran. By contrast, most (84 per cent) of the heroin seized in Italy in 2019 arrived by air, mainly via Ethiopia, Oman, Pakistan, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates; this stands in contrast to the previous year, when most (60 per cent) of the heroin seized in Italy arrived by sea, mostly from the Islamic Republic of Iran. The single largest seizure linked to trafficking along the southern route in 2020 appears to have been a ship - ment of 1.1 tons of heroin, found in a container on a ship docked at the port of Felixstowe, United Kingdom, in 277 Ibid.or 39 per cent of the global estimate in 2019, i.e., far more than in any other subregion) and may have experienced very strong increases in opiate use over the past two decades.275 Significant quantities of the opiates needed to meet domestic demand in South Asia are likely to be smuggled from South-West Asia; for example, 40 per cent of the total quantity of heroin seized in India in 2019 came from South-West Asia.276 In 2019, India reported a particularly strong increase (157 per cent) in heroin ship - ments from South-West Asia by sea. 275 Opioid use among men in India was reported to have increased from a rate of 0.7 per cent in 2004 to 3.97 per cent in 2018; much of this increase resulted from an increase in the use of heroin (Source: Atul Ambekar and others, Magnitude of Substance Use in India 2019 (New Delhi, Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, 2019)). 276 UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.FiG. 74 Distribution of quantities of heroin and morphine seized, by main trafficking routes, 2009-2019 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.

Heroin originating in those countries accounts for most of the heroin supplied to the United States and also supplies the still-small heroin markets of South America. Canada, by contrast, continues to be supplied mainly by heroin from South-West Asia.282 Most heroin (and morphine) trafficking in the Americas takes place within North America, from Mexico to the United States and, to a far lesser extent, from Colombia and Guatemala, typically via Mexico, to the United States. Most of the samples of heroin analysed in the United States in 2018 originated in Mexico (93 per cent), while a small proportion originated in South America (2 per cent) or was classified as of \"inconclusive South Ameri- can\" origin (4 per cent). There has thus been a substantial increase over the last decade in the share of the heroin samples in the United States originating in Mexico (38 per cent in 2008) at the expense of those originating in South America (59 per cent in 2008).283 On the basis of the quantities seized, heroin traffick - ing within the Americas, including in North America, remained stable in 2019 compared with the previous year, at about 10 tons, although that is more than double the quantity seized a decade earlier. Expressed as a per - centage of the global quantities of heroin and morphine seized, the share seized in the Americas increased from 4 per cent in 2009 to 8 per cent in 2019. 282 UNODC, Drugs Monitoring Platform. 283 United States, Drug Enforcement Administration and Office of Foren- sic Sciences, \"The 2018 Heroin Signature Program\" , Joint Intelligence Report (April 2020).September 2020, which had been en route to Antwerp, Belgium, with the final destination being a warehouse in the Hague, the Netherlands.278 A year prior to that, in September 2019, a similar seizure had also been made in Felixstowe, when 1.3 tons of heroin were discovered in a container on a ship from Pakistan that was destined for a warehouse in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.279 Heroin trafficking is on the decline in East and South-East Asia, although the subregion still supplies Oceania The main trafficking activities related to opiates from South-East Asia concern opiates produced within the subregion itself (mostly in Myanmar and, to a lesser extent, the Lao People's Democratic Republic), which are trafficked to other markets in East and South-East Asia (mostly China and Thailand) and Oceania (mostly Australia). The quantities of drugs reported seized by countries in East and South-East Asia and Oceania fell, from 13.3 tons in 2015 to 11 tons in 2019, pointing to a possible decline in heroin trafficking in that part of the world. That decline went in parallel with a reduction of more than 20 per cent in opium production in Myanmar over the period 2015-2019.280 The main embarkation point for heroin seized at the Aus - tralian border in the fiscal year 2018/19, measured by weight, was Malaysia, followed by (in descending order of the weight seized) Thailand, the Lao People's Demo- cratic Republic, Singapore, Iraq, South Africa, Pakistan, Mozambique, Indonesia and India, pointing to South- East Asia as the origin of most of the heroin in Australia. This is in contrast to the situation a decade ago, when the proportion of heroin trafficked from South-East Asia was much smaller, accounting for 26 per cent of the total quantity seized at the Australian border in 2008. It has risen since then, to almost 100 per cent in 2018 and 92.5 per cent over the first two quarters of 2019 when, for the second time in the past decade, heroin from South America (7 per cent) was reported to have been seized at the Australian border.281 278 National Crime Agency, \"NCA investigation keeps 120-m Class A drugs haul off UK streets\" , 18 September 2020. 279 BBC News, \"Heroin worth \u00a3120m found at Felixstowe in 'UK's biggest haul'\" , 4 September 2019. 280 UNODC, Myanmar Opium Survey 2020: Cultivation, Production, and Implications, and previous years. 281 Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, Illicit Drug Data Report 2018-19 (Canberra 2020), and previous years. 96 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2021OPIOIDSreached a peak in recent years, first in 2014 and again in 2019, when they tripled compared with the previous year. With a total amount of 228 tons of pharmaceuti - cal opioids seized, an all-time high was reached in 2019, exceeding the quantities of opiates seized if converted into heroin equivalents: 96 tons of heroin, 26 tons of morphine and 73 tons of opium expressed in heroin equivalents. In the past five years, tramadol, an opioid not under inter - national control, has accounted for nearly two thirds of the global quantities of pharmaceutical opioids seized. Codeine accounted for a third and fentanyls for less than 2 per cent. In 2019, however, one year after India had put tramadol under national control, the largest quanti- ties of pharmaceutical opioids seized worldwide were of codeine (65 per cent of the total), followed by tramadol (26 per cent) and fentanyl (2 per cent). A number of other opioids were seized in 2019, including methadone, vari- ous addition to a number of substances seized in previous years, increases in the quantities of pharmaceutical opioids seized compared with 2018 were reported not only for codeine but also for a number of other opioids, in particular fentanyl and several of its analogues (including and hydrocodone. The quantities of tramadol, by contrast, continued declining in 2019 and were less than half those seized in 2017. in veterinary medicine. Among the fentanyl analogues approved as pharmaceutical drugs for human use are alfentanil, fentanyl, remifen- tanil and sufentanil. One (carfentanil) is approved for veterinary use. Under this category, some Member States also report substances (such as furanylfentanyl) that are, in general, not approved for med- ical use.Supply of other opioids The majority of the opioids in terms of quantities seized that are not opiates that end up on illegal drug markets continue to be licitly manufactured opioids that have been diverted from licit to illicit channels. Nowadays, diversions at the international level are limited, how - ever.284 The diversion of pharmaceutical opioids is more common at the national level; they are either sold on the street or are obtained through doctor shopping or falsified prescriptions for the acquisition of opioids from the legal supply chain, in particular from pharmacies. The pharmaceutical opioids reported to have been diverted most frequently over the period 2015-2019 were tra - madol in Africa; codeine in Asia (mostly in the form of cough syrups), followed by tramadol; oxycodone in the Americas, followed by hydrocodone; buprenorphine in Europe, followed by methadone and tramadol; and mor - phine in Oceania, followed by oxycodone and codeine.285 Some opioids, such as fentanyl and its analogues, and also tramadol and methadone, are not only diverted from licit sources but also manufactured for the illicit drug market in semi-legal laboratories or fully clandes - tine laboratories. The largest numbers of clandestine synthetic opioid laboratories reported to have been dis - mantled over the period 2015-2019 were manufacturing fentanyl (20 laboratories, mostly in North America and, to a lesser extent in Europe and Oceania), methadone (7 laboratories, mostly in Eastern Europe) and carfentanil (3 laboratories, all in North America).286 Global quantities of pharmaceutical opioids seized have reached a record high The quantities of pharmaceutical opioids287 seized have 284 INCB, Report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 2019 (E/INCB/2019/1). 285 UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire. 286 Ibid. 287 Substances reported by Member States in their responses to the UNODC annual report questionnaire under the category \"phar - maceutical opioids\" .

The proportions seized in Europe (1.3 per cent, mostly in Eastern Europe) and Asia (0.4 per cent, mostly in East and South-East Asia) were comparatively very small. Although most of the increase in the amounts of fentanyls seized over the period 2010-2019 was reported in North Amer - ica, the quantities of fentanyls seized in Europe and Asia also increased. In all regions, the quantities of fentanyl seized were larger than those of any fentanyl analogue. At the same time, the sizeable amounts of mixtures of fentanyl seized in 2019 suggest that the market may be increasingly diversifying in terms of fentanyl products. Most trafficking in fentanyls takes place from East and South-East Asia to North America, including via Mexico Given the predominance of seizures in North America and according to United States authorities, international trafficking in fentanyls over the period 2015-2019 took place mainly from East and South-East Asia (notably China) to North America, either directly, in small quanti - ties, to the United States or to Mexico, in large quantities, and from there to the United States or to Canada for the domestic market and/or for onward shipment to the United States.291, 292, 293 These trafficking patterns seem to have changed, how- ever, since the class scheduling of fentanyls in China in May 2019,294, 295 which went hand in hand with a major crackdown on illicit fentanyl laboratories and sales sites in China, together with improved training for law 289 The fentanyl analogues 3-methylfentanyl, acetyl-alpha-methylfenta- nyl, ocfentanil and furanylfentanyl are not pharmaceutical drugs. 290 WHO, \"Carfentanil: critical review report - agenda item 4.8\" , Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, thirty-ninth meeting, 6-10 November 2017 (Geneva, 2017). 291 UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire. 292 United States, Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Adminis - tration, 2019 National Drug Threat Assessment (December 2019), and previous years. 293 United States, Department of State, Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, 2020 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, vols.

Compared with the previous year, the global quantities of fentanyls seized increased by more than 30 per cent in 2018 and more than 60 per cent in 2019. Moreover, the quantities of fentantyls seized in 2019 were almost 50 times larger than those seized in 2015 and more than 6,000 times larger than those seized in 2000.

In September 2018, the Indian authorities reported a relatively large seizure of fentanyl destined for organized crime groups in Mexico that involved the arrest of a Mexican citizen.304, 305, 306, 307 Moreover, United States authorities have reported the interception of mail shipments containing illicitly 296 Ibid. 297 United States, Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administra- tion, 2019 National Drug Threat Assessment (and previous years). 298 United States, Department of State, Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, 2020 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report. 299 United States, Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administra- tion, 2019 National Drug Threat Assessment. 300 UNODC, Laboratory and Scientific Section Portals, \"China: carfent - control\" , February 2017. 301 United States, Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Adminis - tration, \"China announces scheduling controls of new psychoactive substances/fentanyl-class substances\" (19 June 2017). 302 UNODC, Laboratory and Scientific Section Portals, \"China places additional 32 new psychoactive substances under national control\" , August 2018. 303 United States, Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administra- tion, 2019 National Drug Threat Assessment. 304 India, Narcotics Control Bureau, \"Drug situation report/significant event report for India for the month of September 2018\" (New Delhi, September 2018). 305 United States, Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administra- tion, 2019 National Drug Threat Assessment. 306 United States, Department of State, Bureau for International Narcot - ics and Law Enforcement Affairs, 2019 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report. 307 UNODC, Drugs Monitoring Platform.FiG. 78 Global quantities of fentanyls seized, 2010-2019 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.By substance 01,0002,0003,0004,0005,000 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019Kilograms Other 05001,0001,5002,0002,5003,0003,5004,0004,5005,000 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019Kilograms Americas Europe Asia OceaniaBy region 100 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2021with the Arellano F\u00e9lix Organization (also known as the Tijuana Cartel) for such trafficking activities,310 and the Sinaloa Cartel. The Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel have previously been identified as the primary groups involved in trafficking fentanyls into the United States across the country's south-western border311 but, according to United States authorities, both cartels are also heavily involved in the smuggling of a number of other drugs into the United States.312 To enable the import of fentanyl and/or of fentanyl precursors from Asia into Mexico, the control of the coun - try's Pacific ports is of key importance to traffickers. The Sinaloa Cartel is active in many of the country's northern Pacific ports, while the Jalisco New Generation Cartel is active in several of the country's southern Pacific ports.313 This is of importance because Mexico continues to be a major transit country for fentanyls, as well as a source country for illicit fentanyl and fentanyl-laced falsified tablets destined for the United States market, according to United States authorities.314 In addition to seizures of fentanyl in territories under the control of the Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco New Gener - ation Cartel, seizures of fentanyl are also concentrated along the border between Mexico and the United States, in particular along the stretch between Mexico and the states of California and Arizona that is controlled by the Sinaloa Cartel and the Arellano-F\u00e9lix Organization, which has an alliance with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, as well as on the east coast of the United States, most nota - bly in the north-eastern states, around the Great Lakes and in some parts of the Midwest. The number of opi - oid-related deaths in the United States involving fentanyl is also highest around the Great Lakes, the north-east and parts of the Midwest.315 Role of domestic groups in the trafficking of fentanyl within the United States While Mexican organized crime groups serve as suppliers 310 UNODC, annual report questionnaire. 311 United States, Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administra- tion, 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment.

First illicit fentanyl laboratory dismantled in i ndia According to authorities in the United States, in September 2018, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence of India, in cooperation with the Drug Enforcement Agency of the United States, disman - tled the first known illicit fentanyl laboratory in India and seized several kilograms of fentanyl.a A close partnership was identified between an Indian and a Chinese national who worked in concert to obtain fentanyl precursor chemicals and manufac - ture fentanyl.b The operation had begun in China but later moved to India after the actors involved encoun - tered difficulties obtaining precursor chemicals in China, possibly as a consequence of the previ - ous announcement by China of the regulation of fentanyl precursors 4-anilino-N -phenethyl-4-piper - idone (4-ANPP) and N -phenethyl-4-piperidone (NPP). Subsequent investigations also indicated that, in the meantime, chemists in India had devel - oped the expertise to illicitly manufacture fentanyl without NPP and 4-ANPP .b a United States, Department of State, Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, 2020 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, vol.

In addition, Dominican organized crime groups based in the United States, which typically source fentanyl from Mexican organized crime groups, are heavily involved in fentanyl trafficking in the country's north-eastern states.316 316 Ibid. The Sinaloa Cartel, a major player in illicit fentanyl manufacture in Mexico According to authorities in the United States, most of the fentanyl synthesis and fentanyl tablet production operations dismantled in Mexico to date have occurred in territories controlled by the Sinaloa Cartel.a For example, in November 2017, Mexican authorities seized a fentanyl laboratory in Culiac\u00e1n, the state capital of Sinaloa and the home base of the Sinaloa Cartel.b In September 2018, counter-narcotics authorities of Mexico and the United States seized a laboratory in Baja California, Mexico, that was man - ufacturing fentanyl and carfentanil,c arresting two suspected associates of the Sinaloa Cartel. In September 2018, police in the border city of Mexicali raided a clandestine fentanyl laboratory and detained two suspects, including a Russian passport holder, underlining the international dimension of such activities.d In December 2018, the Office of the Attorney General of Mexico reported the dismantling of a clandestine fentanyl laboratory in Mexico City,b which was also equipped with an automated pill press.d Mexican law enforcement authorities also seized and dismantled clandestine fentanyl pill-milling operations in 2018, one of which was responsible for producing carfentanil-laced tablets. Another laboratory, dismantled in December 2018 by Mexican law enforcement agencies in Azcapotzalco, Mexico City, apparently produced fentanyl-laced oxycodone tablets.a In April 2019, Mexican authorities reported the dismantling of a clandestine fentanyl laboratory in Culiac\u00e1n,e seizing not only fentanyl tablets but also several containers that contained heroin.f In June 2019, authorities reported the dismantling of a clandestine laboratory in Nuevo Le\u00f3n that had been used for the manufacture of chemical precursors of fentanyl and possibly also the manufacture of fentanyl itself.g At the same time, significant quantities of fentanyl continue to be smuggled into Mexico for re-export to the United States.h In January 2019, the Ministry of Public Security reported the interception of shipments of fentanyl from China and Hong Kong, China, at Mexico City International Airport.i In August 2019, the Ministry of Naval Affairs announced a major sei - zure of powdered fentanyl, which had originated in Shanghai, China, and was headed to Culiac\u00e1n, by the Mexican navy and customs enforcement personnel at the L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas sea - port.j The latest significant seizure was in February 2021, when the Mexican military seized over 100,000 fentanyl tablets (together with over 2.5 tons of methamphetamine) from a vessel near the coast of the north-western state of Sinaloa.i a United States, Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, 2019 National Drug Threat Assessment (December 2019). b Steven Dudley and others, \"Mexico's role in the deadly rise of fentanyl\" (Washington D.C., Wilson Center Mexico Institute and InSight Crime, 2019). c United States, Department of State, Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, 2020 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, vol.

Reports from Member States reveal a total of 44 coun- tries identified as countries of origin, departure and transit of tramadol over the period 2015-2019,322 with India being the most frequently mentioned, followed by Nigeria, Egypt and the Russian Federation; among the 27 countries identified as countries of origin, the most frequently mentioned was India, followed by China. Reported destination countries included countries in Africa (mostly in West, Central and North Africa), Asia (mostly in the Near and Middle East), Europe and the Americas. Over the period 2015-2019, the largest quantities of tra - madol seized were reported in West and Central Africa, which accounted for 88 per cent of the global total. The predominance of West and Central Africa in the global quantities of tramadol seized increased to 98 per cent in 2019. The largest quantities seized in 2019 were reported in Benin, followed by Egypt and India, although the latter reported major decreases in 2019 compared with the previous year, while Egypt reported major decreases com - pared with 2017 and 2016. The global quantities of tramadol seized have increased markedly over the last decade, from less than 1 kg per year prior to 2010 and 7 kg in 2010 to a peak of 122 tons in 2017, with most of the quantities seized in that year being reported (in descending order of the amount seized) by Nigeria, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. In 2018, the year that India put tramadol under national control, the quantities of the drug seized declined in all subre - gions other than South Asia to a global total of 76 tons. In parallel, the number of countries reporting India as the main source country for tramadol also declined in 2018. In 2019, the amount of tramadol seized globally continued declining and reached a total of some 60 tons; that was only because some 59 tons were reported to have been seized by authorities in Benin during the first five months of that year.323 According to United States authorities, 321 For more details on the demand for tramadol, see the chapter \"Demand for opioids\" in the present booklet. 322 UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire. 323 Conference room paper entitled \"Country report: Benin\" (UNODC/In 2018, 94 per cent of the fentanyl seized and analysed in the United States had been synthesized using the more sophisticated \"Janssen method\" and 6 per cent using the less sophisticated \"Siegfried method\" , suggesting that the manufacture of fentanyl, at least until 2018, was done by highly trained and qualified chemists.318 Trafficking in tramadol appears to have declined in 2019 and trafficking in the drug remains concentrated in Africa Tramadol, an opioid medication used to treat moderate to (moderately) severe pain,319 is not under international control but is under national control in a number of coun - tries in all regions.

Fentanyl data 3 103 OPIOIDS | Supply of other opioidsTrafficking in tramadol also continued in Africa in 2020, although there may have been some changes regarding its country of origin and the routes used. For example, in August 2020, three containers loaded with a total of 15 million tramadol tablets were intercepted by the seaport police in Lagos, Nigeria. The tablets had allegedly been produced in Pakistan and had transited Germany, before reaching Nigeria as the final destination, according to the Nigerian authorities.327 Trafficking in pharmaceuti - cal products, including tramadol, was also increasingly detected by West African joint airport interdiction task forces in 2020, including in the case of a Nigerian national arriving in Abuja on a flight from Istanbul, Turkey.328 327 Information made available to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies, Africa, at its meetings during the extraordinary sessions of the subsidiary bodies of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, held online on 1 and 2 October. 328 Regional Office of West and Central Africa. most of the tramadol imported into Benin in recent years originated in India and was used for re-export to other countries in West Africa and for domestic use.324 In three tramadol seizure cases in February 2019 (273 kg, 330 kg and 105 kg) effected by authorities in Cotonou, the ship carrying the tramadol had departed from Singapore (although it is unlikely that the tramadol originated there) and the final destination of the container holding the tramadol was the Niger.325 In two subsequent tramadol seizures from containers at the seaport in Cotonou, made in February 2019 (3,750 kg and 8,904 kg), the ship had departed Singapore, with the origin identified as India and the final destination as Nigeria.326 HONLAF/29/CRP.3), submitted to the Twenty-ninth Meeting of Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies, Africa. 324 United States, Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administra- tion, 2019 National Drug Threat Assessment. 325 UNODC, Drugs Monitoring Platform. 326 Individual drug seizures reported to UNODC by Member States.

Estimates for 2014, 2015, 2018 included area estimates for Kayah and Chin states. In the absence of information on Kayah and Chin, the 2019, 2020 national area estimate uses latest available cultivation estimates (2018) for Chin and Kayah states. National estimates for 2014, 2015, 2018, 2019, 2020 are therefore not directly comparable with other years. d) Up to 2014, the estimates for Mexico are sourced from the Department of State of the United States. The Government of Mexico does not validate the estimates provided by the United States as they are not part of its official figures and it does not have information on the methodology used to calculate them. e) The figures for 2015, as published in the World Drug Report 2016 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.16.XI.7), have been revised owing to a statistical adjustment processed by UNODC.

The joint Mexico/UNODC project \"Monitoring of the illicit cultivation on Mexican territory\" collected yield data for the first time in the 2017/2018 period. The production figures presented are based on: (1) annual estimates of area under cultivation, established by the joint project of the Government of Mexico and UNODC; (2) yield data collected in an initial survey in the 2017/2018 period. UNODC and Mexico are jointly working on continuously expanding the scope and quality of yield data collected. For methodological reasons, the figures shown for 2015-2018 are not comparable with the figures over the period 1998-2014. f) Production estimates for the period 2016- 2019 are based on cultivation estimates for the period 2016- 2019 and average yields per ha reported over the 2012- 2014 period.g) Bound of the statistically derived confidence interval, with the exception of 2015. The figures for 2015 represent independently derived upper and lower estimates; the midpoint was used for the calculation of the global total. h) Estimates for 2014, 2015, 2018 include estimates for Kayah and Chin states. In the absence of information on Kayah and Chin, the 2019 national potential production estimate uses latest available (2018) cultivation estimates for Kayah and Chin states and the 2019 weighted national average yield (15.4 kg/ha). National estimates for 2014, 2015, 2018 and 2019 are therefore not directly comparable with other years. i) The figures for 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 are based on the estimation periods July 2014- June 2015, July 2015- June 2016, July 2016- June 2017, July 2017- June 2018, and July 2018- June 2019 respectively. j) Data on the potential opium production for 2019 and 2020 was obtained brom the UNODC Illicit Crop Monitoring Programme. The same methodology was used as in previous years for yield measurement and estimation of potential opium production. The results for the year 2019 were not validated by the Government of Afghanistan and are not recognized by the Government as its official estimate. k) Production estimates for 2018 based on cultivation estimates by the U.S. State Department International Narcotics Control Strategy Report 2020 and average yields reported for the years 2015- 2017. 3 107 ANNEX | OpiumNotes: The calculation shows the potential amount of heroin that could have been manufactured out of the opium produced in a given year; it does not take into account changes in opium inventories, which may add to or reduce the amount of heroin entering the market in that year. Afghanistan and Myanmar are the only countries for which the proportion of potential opium production not converted into heroin within the country is estimated. For Myanmar, these estimates were available only for 2018, 2019 and 2020. For all other countries, for the purposes of this table, it is assumed that all opium produced is converted into heroin. The amount of heroin produced from Afghan opium is calculated using two parameters that may change: (a) the amounts of opium consumed as raw opium in the region; and (b) the conversion ratio into heroin. The first parameter's estimate is based on consumption data in Afghanistan and neighbouring countries. For the second parameter, from 2005 to 2013, a conversion ratio of opium to morphine/heroin of 7:1 was used, based on interviews conducted with Afghan morphine/heroin \"cooks\" , on an actual heroin production exercise conducted by two (illiterate) Afghan heroin \"cooks\" , documented by the German Bundeskrimi- nalamt in Afghanistan in 2003 (published in Bulletin on Narcotics, vol. LVII, Nos. 1 and 2, 2005, pp. 11-31), and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) studies on the morphine content of Afghan opium (12.3 per cent over the period 2010-2012, down from 15 per cent over the period 2000-2003). Starting from 2014, a different approach to the conversion was adopted, reflecting updated information on morphine content and a different method for taking purity into account. The revised approach uses a ratio of 18.5 (range: 17.5-19.6) kg of opium for 1 kg of 100 per cent pure heroin base (see Afghanistan Opium Survey 2014, UNODC, November 2014). In addition, the conversion into export-quality heroin assumes purity to be between 50 and 70 per cent. For more details, see \"Afghanistan Opium Survey 2017 - Challenges to sustainable development, peace and security\" (UNODC, May 2018). The amount of heroin produced in Myanmar in 2018 , 2019 and 2020 was calculated by subtracting the estimated unprocessed opium for consumption from the total opium production and using a conversion factor of 10:1. The unprocessed opium in Myanmar was based on the total unprocessed opium in East Asia and the relative cultivation levels of Lao PDR and Myanmar (see Transnational Organized Crime in East Asia and the Pacific - A Threat Assessment, UNODC, 2013 and Transnational Organized Crime in Southeast Asia: Evolution, Growth and Impact 2019, UNODC, 2019). For further information, please refer to the Methodology chapter (section 4.3) of the Myanmar Opium Survey 2018 (UNODC, January 2019) and the Myanmar Opium Survey 2019 (UNODC, February 2020). For countries other than Afghanistan, a \"traditional\" conversion ratio of opium to heroin of 10:1 is used. The ratios will be adjusted when improved information becomes available. Figures in italics are preliminary and may be revised when updated information becomes available.TABLE 7 Global manufacture of heroin from global illicit opium production, 2009-2020 (tons) 2009 2010

Booklet 1 summarizes the four subsequent booklets by reviewing their key findings and highlighting their policy implications. Booklet 2 offers a projection of the impact of popu - lation growth on drug use by 2030 and gives a global overview of the supply of and demand for drugs, including their health impact and the trafficking of substances over the Internet. Booklet 3 provides an analysis of the global markets for cannabis and opioids, both in terms of supply and use, and includes an overview of the latest developments in countries with measures regulating the non-medical use of cannabis; it also discusses the overlaps between the various opioids and looks at access to pharmaceutical opioids for medical use. Booklet 4 contains the latest trends in and estimates of the markets for stimulants - cocaine, meth - amphetamine, amphetamine and \"ecstasy\" - both at the global level and in the most affected subregions. Booklet 5 presents an early assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on drug markets by looking at how it has affected drug supply and demand dynamics, including in terms of health consequences and how drug service provision has adapted to the new situation in many countries; the booklet closes with a look at how the pandemic may influence long-term changes in the drug markets. The World Drug Report 2021 is aimed not only at fostering greater international cooperation to counter the impact of the world drug problem on health, governance and security, but also, with its special focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, at assisting Member States in anticipating and addressing challenges that may arise in the near future.
