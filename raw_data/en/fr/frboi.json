The concentrations of ozone depleting substances in the atmosphere are now decreasing. Outside Polar Regions, the decline of ozone seen in the 1980s and 1990s has not continued. In Polar Regions, there is much higher va riability. Each spring, large ozone holes continue to develop in Antarctica and less severe regions of depleted ozone continue to develop in the Arctic. There is eviden ce that some of thes e changes are driven by changes in atmospheric circulation rather than being solely attributable to reductions in ozone-depleting substances, which may indicate a linkage to climate change. Global ozone is still less than in the 1970s. Ch anges in ozone directly influenc e UV-B radiation, so elevated UV-B radiation due to reduced oz one is expected to continue. The future evolution of atmospheric ozone remains uncertain. It is expected to increase slowly in the decades ahead, but it is not known whether it will return to higher, similar, or lower levels than those pr ior to the onset of ozone depletion. Current chemical models are unable to reproduce accurately all of the observed ozone variability, the rates of future increases in greenhouse gases are not ye t established, and inter actions between ozone depletion and climate change are not yet fully understood. Current models predict that ozone will have recovered from the effects of man- made ozone-depleting gases by mid-century at mid-latitudes, and about 1-2 decad es later at polar latitudes. Long term responses in UV-B radiation caused by ozone changes have been observed. Increases in UV-B irradiance have occurred over the period of ozone depletion. At unpolluted sites in the Southern Hemisphere, there is some evidence that UV-B irradiance has diminished since the late 1990s. Because of improvements in the availability and temporal extent of UV data we are now able to evaluate the changes in recent times compared with those estimated since the late 1920s, when ozone measurements first became available. The increases in UV-B radiat ion from about 1980 to the end of the 20th century have been larger than the long-term natural variability. The effects of aerosols and air pollutants on long-term variatio ns in UV-B irradiance may be comparable with those due to changes in ozone. At some sites in the Northern Hemisphere, UV-B radiation may continue increasing because of the continuing reductions in the attenuation by aerosols since the 1990s despite the cessati on of ozone depletion. Interactions between ozone depletion and climate change are complex and can be mediated through changes in chemistry, radiation, and atmospheric circulation patterns. The changes are in both directions: ozone changes affect climate, and climate changes affect ozone. Contrary to what was predicted from some models in previous xvi The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 assessments, more recent models and the obser vational evidence suggest that stratospheric ozone (and therefore UV-B radiation) has respon ded relatively quickly to changes in ozone depleting substances, implying th at climate interactions have not delayed these responses. There is greater uncertainty about future su rface UV-B radiation than future ozone, since UV-B radiation will be additionally influenced by climate change. Climate change can also affect UV-B radiation through changes in cloudiness, aerosols and surface reflectivity, without involving oz one. The rate of climate change is accelerating. Temperature changes over the 21st century are likely to be about 5 tim es greater than in the past century. This will affect future cloud, aerosol and surface reflectivit y. Consequently, unless strong mitigation measures are undertaken with resp ect to climate change, profound effects on the biosphere and on the solar UV radiation received at the Earth's surf ace can be anticipated. Health In addition to cortical cataract, nuclear cata ract has been found to be associated with polar UV radiation. Numerous studies have im plicated exposure to so lar UV radiation as a causative factor in the development of corti cal cataract. Several reports now confirm an association between nuclear cataract and UV exposur e. In addition, higher ambient temperatures may increase the risk of nuclear cataract development. In cont rast, there is insu fficient evidence to infer a causative role for solar UV radiation in the induction of posterio r subcapsular cataract. Exposure to sunlight is a significant risk fact or for pterygium on the surface of the eye. Pterygium is an inflammatory, proliferative a nd invasive lesion of the human cornea that can severely impair vision. It is induced, in part, by the intracellular damage caused by UV-B exposure. Genetic factors and the degree of l ong-term exposure to su nlight are important parameters for the development of pterygi a in populations of all skin colours. Adverse photobiological effect s of UV radiation on the ey e can be enhanced by the presence of clouds and are thus affected by climate change. Although direct sunlight does not play a major role in ac ute solar photokerati tis, sunburn of the eye, or in cataract formation, scattered and reflected UV-B radiat ion contribute to thes e disorders. Under conditions of cloud cover and with lower light le vels, the natural defence mechanisms of the eye are relaxed, permitting greater exposure of the anterior surface of the eye and its internal structures. At the same time, the effective UV-B exposure of the eye can be increased during cloud cover due to scatter. The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and melanoma continues to rise. Approximate doublings in the inci dence of all three types of skin cancer have been projected in the Ne therlands for the years 2000 to 2015 and in many other countries with predominantly fair-s kinned populations. The major increase in melanoma incidence has been for thin (early) me lanomas that have high survival rates. In children, the incidence of melanoma is still rising and has been positively correlated with environmental UV radiation exposure. Susceptibility to skin cancer is increasingly reco gnised as being li nked with subtle variations in genes that code for proteins involved in prevention and repair of DNA The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 xviidamage. Such proteins function in defensive mechan isms that are crucial to the prevention of skin cancers. The relevance of certain gene variations differ between skin cancer types and these variations provide clues regarding the types of DNA damage and repair that are important in each of the skin cancer types. Thus, there is a wide range in the occult genetically determined susceptibility in a population. In the future, gene profiling may accurately identify high-risk individuals. UV-induced immunosuppression is a crucial factor in the generation of skin cancers. In some subjects, this immunomodulation may le ad to viral reactivatio n and a reduction in vaccine efficacy. The lack of repair of UV-induced DNA changes decreases the resistance to skin cancers and is a significant factor in the generation of such tumours. By effects both on the virus itself and on suppression of i mmunity, solar UVR exposure can induce the reactivation of latent herpes simplex virus leading to the re -emergence of cold sores. The virus is a co-factor in the de velopment of some skin cancers and conjunctival squamous cell carcinomas in association with human papillom avirus infection. Limited evidence indicates that UV radiation exposure can reduce the effi cacy of vaccination, at least in genetically predisposed individuals. Vitamin D, formed by ex posure of the skin to UV-B (wit h subsequent hydroxylation to the active vitamin), may play a pr otective role agains t the development of several internal cancers, autoimmune and some other diseases. A number of studies link low solar UV exposure with a higher risk of some internal ca ncers, such as colore ctal and prostate, and autoimmune disease, such as multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes. As lack of exposure to the UV-B in sunlight leads to suboptimal vita min D levels, vitamin D has been proposed as the protective factor in helping to prevent these diseases. The evidence to support the protective role of sola r UV-B exposure and whether this is mediated through vitamin D is not definitive. Personal strategies to protect the eye and skin from the adverse eff ects of high solar UVR exposure are being adopted increa singly by the ge neral public. Health campaigns in several countries such as Australia, Canada, UK, and USA have raised the awareness of the general public regarding protection from the sun. Broad-spectrum sunscreens, in widespread use in mid-latitudes by fair-skinned individuals , minimise the erythemal effects of high sun exposure. UV-absorbing soft contact lenses covering the entire co rnea provide excellent protection from solar UV-B for the eye, and are s uperior to some tinted sunglasses as the soft contact lenses shield against UV radiati on entering from the side or below. It is not feasible to give a single recommend ation for optimal solar UV -B exposure to allow sufficient vitamin D synthesis while not in creasing the risk of skin cancer. The solar UV-B dose experienced by an individual varies grea tly depending on time of the day, latitude, altitude, season of the year, cloud cover, activity and type of clothing worn. Skin colour, age and genetic background are other critical factors in determin ing the positiv e or negative outcome of the exposure. Therefore the messa ge regarding \"safe\" sun exposure depends on the individual and place of residence. The interaction between ozone depletion and global climate change may adversely affect human health. At present, it is impossible to pred ict how global warming might alter the xviii The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 behaviour of people, especially those living in mid-latitudes, with re spect to the amount of time spent outdoors in sunlight. If temperat ures rise, then pers onal solar UV radiation exposure might be greater than at present. Th is would then have detrimental effects on the incidence of skin cancer and cataract and on the immune system, although benefiting vitamin D status. Terrestrial Ecosystems Field studies, in which solar UV-B radiation is either augmented or attenuated, report many effects on higher plants and on bacteria, fungi and other microbes. Although photosynthesis of higher plants and mosses is seldom affected in fi eld studies by UV-B radiation, growth and morphology (form) of high er plants and mosses are often changed. This can lead to small reductions in shoot growth and changes in the compe titive balance among species. Fungi and bacteria are generally more sensitiv e to damage by UV-B radiation than are higher plants. However, the species differ in thei r UV-B sensitivity to dama ge. This can lead to changes in species composition of microbial communities with subseq uent influences on processes such as litter decomp osition. Changes in plant chemical composition are commonly reported from experiments using enhancement or attenuation of UV-B radiation in sunlight. Enhanced UV-B often leads to substantial reductions in consumption of plant tissues by insects. In some cases this is because of altered inse ct behaviour, but chan ges in plant chemical and physical characteristics induced by UV-B ra diation usually account for the reduced herbivory. Such modifications a ffect many interactions of plan ts with other organisms, both above and below ground. More is now understood about the mechanisms of th ese interactions. Although sunlight does not penetrate signific antly into soils, the biomass and morphology of plant root systems can be affected to a much greater degree than pl ant shoots. Root mass can exhibit large declines with enhanced UV- B radiation. Also, UV -B-induced changes in soil microbial communities and biom ass, as well as altered popu lations of small invertebrates have been reported and these changes have impo rtant implications for processing of mineral nutrients in the soil. Many of these ecosystem -level phenomena appear to be the result of systemic changes in chemical and physical properties of plants and in the nature of root exudates. UV-B radiation and other environmental fact ors that are undergoing changes such as temperature, CO 2, moisture and available nitrogen ov er large areas may interact to produce a complex plant response. In several studies, plant grow th was augmente d by higher CO2 levels, while on the other ha nd many of the effects of UV -B radiation were usually not ameliorated by th e elevated CO 2. UV-B radiation often increase s both plant frost tolerance and survival under extrem e high temperature cond itions. Conversely, ex treme temperatures sometimes influence the UV-B sensitivity of plants. Plants that are drough t tolerant are likely to be more tolerant of high UV-B flux. Furthermore, UV-B radiatio n has been reported to alleviate some symptoms of water stress. Biologically available nitrogen is exceeding historical levels in many regions due to human activities. Studies show that plants well supplied with nitrogen are generally more sensitive to UV-B radiation. The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 xix Many new developments in un derstanding the underlying mechanisms mediating plant response to UV-B radiation have emerged. UV-B radiation results in an activation of as yet uncharacterised receptor molecules. These initial events engage signallin g pathways that result in altered plant gene expression and response. Exposure to UV-B induces some signals that are UV-B-specific and some that have elements in common with those elicited by other environmental factors. The use of shared signalling el ements generates overlapping patterns of gene expression and functional re sponses. This new informatio n is helpful in understanding common responses of plants to UV-B radiation, such as di minished growth, acclimation to elevated UV radiation, and interactions of plants with plant consumer orga nisms. It also helps in interpreting the inte raction of various environmental stre sses on plant growth and function. Technical issues concerning the use of biol ogical spectral weight ing functions (BSWFs) have been further elucidated. The BSWFs are multiplication fa ctors assigned to different wavelengths giving an indication of their relative biological effec tiveness. They are critical to the proper conduct and interpre tation of experiments in which organisms are exposed to UV radiation, both in the field an d in controlled envir onment facilities. Th e characteristics of BSWFs vary considerably among different plan t processes, such as growth, DNA damage, oxidative damage and induction of changes in secondary chemicals. Thus, use of a single BSWF for plant or ecosystem responses is not appropriate. Aquatic Ecosystems Recent field studies continue to show th at even current sola r UV-B radiation can adversely affect a quatic organisms. Reductions in productivity and impaired reproduction and development have been shown for phytoplan kton, fish eggs and larvae, zooplankton and other primary and secondary consumers exposed to UV-B radiation. UV-B-related decreases in biomass productivity can be transferred through all levels of the food web, as well as cause changes in species composition and structure and function of ecosystems. Decreases in primary production would result in reduced si nk capacity for atmospheric carbon dioxide, with its related effect on climate change. Experiments in large en closures show that changes in community structure may be more ecologically important than effects of enha nced UV-B on overall algal biomass. These mesocosm experiments allow the experimenter to control the level of UV radiation on plankton communities to simulate various levels of ozone depletion. Growth was inhibited by ambient UV radiation in fixe d-depth experiments but not in mesocosms where vertical mixing exposed planktonic organisms to vari able radiation regimes. A synthesis model simulating mesocosm experiments suggests that enhanced UV-B could cause a shift from primary producers to bacteria at the community level. Shifts in community structure could have important consequences for carbon dioxi de concentration in oceanic surface waters. Recent studies have expanded our understanding of UV-B protection mechanisms for aquatic organisms. UV radiation impairs photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation and damage DNA, but most phytoplankton have developed mitigating measures including UV-absorbing substances, repair enzymes and reactive oxyge n species scavenging systems. However, protection is not complete. Picoplankton cya nobacteria do not produce absorbing substances but rely on fast cell division; these organisms have recently been found to be ubiquitous and xx The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 to contribute more than 50 % to the productiv ity in aquatic habitats . Solar UV controls the vertical position of macroalgae in the tidal zone. Organisms in the upper tidal zone have developed effective screening and repair mechanisms. UV-B-related decreases in primary-producer biomass have a negative effect on the growth and survival of consumers, which form the hi gher levels in the aquatic food web. Specific, direct UV B effects have been identified in a wide variety of consumers, including copepods and other zooplankton, corals and sea urchins. In their natural habitat, zooplankton face conflicting selection pressures, including exposure to UV-B radi ation and factors of global climate change. Invertebrate predators cause an upward movement of the zooplankton during daylight hours, exposing them to high levels of UV radiation at the surface. Be sides vertical migration and UV screening, zooplankton rely on photorepair of UV-B- induced DNA damage. Increases in water temperature resulting from climate change are expected to increase enzymatic activity, which would enhance photorepair. Primary causes for a decline in fish populations are predatio n and poor food supply for larvae; however, exposure of the larvae to enhanced UV-B radiation may further contribute to this decline. Other major factors are overfishi ng, increased water temperature due to global climate change, pollution, a nd disease. Imprecisely defined habitat characteristics and the naturally high mortal ity rates of fish larvae render quantitative assessment of specific UV-B effects difficult. The concentration and chemical composition of dissolved organic matter in aquatic ecosystems govern the penetration of UV radiation in the water column. UV radiation affects the species composition of plankton co mmunities and thus the concentration of DOM. There is a strong link between early succession of zooplankton communities and terrestrial plant communities within watersheds, which in turn are affected by climate change. Consequently, climate change and UV radiati on have the potential to affect species composition in lakes and also to incr ease the invasion potential by imported species. Biogeochemical Cycles Climate-related changes can alter the transf er of organic matter from terrestrial to freshwater and coastal ecosystems and thereby influence UV radiation penetration into water bodies, with major consequences fo r aquatic biogeochem ical processes. These changes are particularly prevalent in high latitude systems. Dissolved organic matter leaching from or running off terrestrial ecosystems ente rs streams, rivers, lakes and, ultimately the oceans. The coloured part of dissolved organic matter controls the penetration of UV radiation into water bodies, but is also photodegraded by solar UV to release small inorganic molecules, mainly CO 2. Future increases in the temperature of surface waters will enhance st ratification of lakes and the ocean, which w ill intensify effects of UV-B radi ation on biogeoch emistry in the surface layer. This important effect is manifested by th e extensive increase in transparency of the water to UV-B radiation in the upper layer of stratified aquatic environments. These effects The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 xxiof climate change increase the impacts of UV-B radiation on biogeochemica l cycles in the upper layer of aquatic systems, thus partially offsetting the beneficial effects of an ozone recovery. Climate change and changes in UV-B radiat ion influence the concentration of halogen- containing compounds that are involved in ozone chemistry in the atmosphere. Emissions of halogen-containing compounds, for example, methyl bromide from higher plants, increase with increasing air temperature. Recent observations indicate that methyl bromide concentrations in the atmosphere are decreasing at a rate of 2.5 - 3.0 % per y ear but future global warming may reduce the current rate of decline. Br omine and other halogen radicals are also generated in UV-B radiation induced reactions of ha logen-containing compounds both in atmospheric aerosols present in the marine bo undary layer and in surface waters. These halogen-containing compounds may be transported by convection to the upper troposphere where the bromine radical participates in ozone destruction. UV-B can alter the biolog ical availability and toxicity of metals in aquatic envi ronments. Although many trace metals are essential trace nutrien ts, all metals are t oxic above a certain concentration. In sunlit surface waters, however, they often exist in form s that are biologically not available. Increased UV-B can alter the chemical form of me tals to produce forms that are available to aquatic organisms. For example, the UV-induced oxidation of elemental mercury results in the formation of precursors to methyl mercury that can adversely affect human health through bioaccumulation in aquatic food webs. UV radiation drives photoreactions involved in cycling of marine sulphur, leading to the production of atmospheric aerosols and cloud formation. Oceanic emissions of dimethylsulphide (DMS) produce atmospheric aero sols that influence atmospheric radiation and temperature. UV radiation induced transfor mation is an important sink of DMS in the upper ocean. Carbonyl sulphide, another importa nt sulphur compound in the upper ocean, is produced in UV-B radiation induced reactions involving chromophoric DOM. In terrestrial systems UV-B ra diation can affect cycling of carbon and nutrients through changes in decomposition and soil biology. Exposure to solar UV-B radiation causes direct photodegradation of dead plant mate rial, especially in arid climat es. When plants are exposed to UV-B radiation, changes in plant root exudatio n and/or the chemistry of dead plant material influence soil organisms and biogeochemistry. Changes in carbon and nu trient cycling induced by UV-B radiation can interact with responses to climate chan ge and so may influence long- term ecosystem carbon budgets. Air Quality Models and measurements suggest that ozon e transport from the stratosphere to the troposphere may have decreased by approximately 30% in the last 30 years. Ozone concentrations near the gr ound are a key indicator of ai r quality. Tropospheric ozone concentrations are affected by UV-B radia tion, local weather systems, and pollutant concentrations. Stratospheric ozone depletion has increased th e rate of ozone production in the troposphere due to enhanced UV-B radi ation but reduced the amount of ozone transported from the stratosphere to the troposphere. xxii The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 The predicted future increase in stratos pheric ozone may increase tropospheric temperature and concentrations of ozon e in the atmospheric boundary layer. Models predict that ozone concentrations in the at mospheric boundary layer wi ll increase globally by 33 to 100% during the period 2000 to 2100 due to the combined effects of climate change, atmospheric pollution, and increases in stratosphe ric ozone. The impact of this increase on climate is difficult to quantify as tropospheric oz one concentrations are very variable, both in space and time. Changes in the concentration of tropospheri c hydroxyl radical caused by changes in UV-B radiation are now much better quantified . Tropospheric hydroxyl radical (OH) is one of the major oxidizing agents in the atmos phere, destroying trace gases that are involved in ozone depletion, climate change, and urban air pollution. The globally averaged OH has been observed to change on short time scales (months - years) but not in the longer term. Recent measurements in a relatively clean location over 5 years showed that OH concentrations can be predicted by the intensity of solar ultraviolet radiation. If this relationship is confirmed by further observations, this approach could be used to characterize the oxidation efficiency of the troposphere in different chemi cal regimes using UV radiation measurements, thus simplifying assessment of air quality. Confidence in models estimating the impact of ozone change on the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere has impr oved for unpolluted locations . Measurements of UV radiation and chemical composition, including OH in the lower atmosphere, now normally agree with chemical models to within the measurement accuracy in unpolluted air both for clear skies and uniform cloud cover. However, in modera tely and heavily polluted urban regions or forested environments, models and measurem ents disagree. These model uncertainties underline the importance of local measurements of tropospheric ozone, especially in areas where air may be polluted. An analysis of surface-level ozone measurem ents in Antarctica suggests that there has been a significant change in the chemistry of the atmosp heric boundary layer in this region as a result of stratospheric ozone depletion . Measurements of ozone concentrations in the atmospheric boundary layer show a recent (s ince 1990) increase in surface ozone concentrations consistent with more UV radiation reaching the earth's surface during ozone hole episodes, and the enhanced production of nitrogen oxides from the ice. Thus, the Antarctic lower atmosphere is estima ted to be more oxidizing now than before the development of the ozone hole, which may have adverse consequences through changing bioavailability of metals. The tropospheric concentration of HFC-134a, a potent greenhouse gas and the main known anthropogenic source of trifluor oacetic acid, is increasing rapidly . The increase is in agreement with the known usage and atmospheric loss proce sses. Observations in both hemispheres between 1998 and 2002 show that the concentration of HFC-134a has been increasing by up to 12% per year. The good agreement between observations and known sources and sinks gives increased confidence in predictions of the environmental build-up of trifluoroacetic acid. The increasing concen tration of HFC-134a may contribute to an acceleration of climate change. The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 xxiii Risks to humans and the environment from substances produced by atmospheric degradation of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are considered minimal . These include trifluoroacetic ac id (TFA) and chlorodifluoroacetic acid. Recent studies reinforce the conclusion of small environmental and human health risks from current environmental loadings in fresh- and salt-water. Although the amounts of these compounds are expected to continue to increase in the future because of climate change and continued use of HCFCs and HFCs, current inform ation suggests that this is not an issue of great importance. Perfluoropolyethers, substances proposed as HCFC substitutes, have very large global warming potential and show great stability to chemical degradation in the atmosphere . These compounds are commonly used as industria l heat transfer fluids. It is not known whether these substances will contribute significantly to global warming and its interaction with ozone depletion. Their ri sks should be further evaluated. Materials Damage Plastics and wood exposed to solar UV radiation undergo degradation losing their useful properties over a period of time. This damage is dose-depend ent and limits the outdoor lifetimes of most materials. The damage is ex acerbated by higher ambien t temperatures, higher humidity levels, an d atmospheric pollutants. Light stabilizer s and surface coatings are generally used to control the sola r-UV induced damage to materials. Higher UV le vels will require higher levels of stabilizers resulting in higher cost of materials used outdoors. Several novel UV stabilizers and product fabrication techniques that improve UV- resistance have been reported. New variants of effective light stabilizers, such as stabilizer compounds that bind to the polym er and are therefore less likely to be lost by leaching, have been reported recently. Me chanisms of synergistic effects of stabilizer blends have been further elucidated and will contri bute to the design of new light-stab ilizer blends. Conti nued research on this topic will facilitate the deve lopment of strategies that are better able to protect materials exposed to solar UV-B radiation. An emerging trend towards the use of nanoscale fillers may improve the UV stability of plastics formulations. These nanoscale fillers have smaller average particle sizes and often yield better mechanical properties than conventional fillers. Init ial data suggest some of the nanoscale fillers may also act as good light stab ilizers and extend the se rvice life of products exposed to outdoor UV radiation. However, poten tial interference of th ese fillers with the effects of conventional light stabilizers or ot her additives such as antioxidants or flame retardants has not yet been fully evaluated. xxiv The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 Using powdered wood as a filler in plastics is conti nuing to be explored , and the effect of these fillers on UV-stability de pends on the type of wood. Powdered wood and other plant materials are used as low-cost natural fillers in some plas tics products intended for outdoor use. Recent research indicates that several of these plant-derived fillers can either enhance the photodamage or act as a photostabilizer for the plastic material, depending on the source of the natural filler material and processing method used with the material. However, the lignin content in wood filler absorbs solar UV- B radiation and promotes photodamage of the polymer component. Identifying sources and pr ocessing technologies for these bio-based fillers without compromising light stability of f illed polymers can lead to low-cost UV-stable plastics products for ce rtain outdoor applications.

Summary The Montreal Protocol is working. Concentrations of major ozone-depleting substances in the atmosphere are now decreasing, and the decline in total column amounts seen in the 1980s and 1990s at mid-latitudes has not continued. In polar regions, there is much greater natural variability. Each spring, large ozone hol es continue to occur in Antarctica and less severe regions of depleted ozone continue to occur in the Arctic. There is evidence that some of these changes are driven by changes in atmo spheric circulation rather than being solely attributable to reductions in ozone-depleting substances, which may indicate a linkage to cli- mate change. Global ozone is still lower than in the 1970s and a return to that state is not ex- pected for several decades. As changes in ozone impinge directly on UV radiation, elevated UV radiation due to reduced ozone is expected to continue over that period. Long-term changes in UV-B due to ozone depletion are difficult to verify through direct measurement, but there is strong evidence that UV-B irradiance increased over the period of ozone depletion. At unpolluted sites in the southern hemisphere, there is some evidence that UV-B irradiance has diminished since the late 1 990s. The availability and temporal extent of UV data have improved, and we are now able to evaluate the changes in recent times com- pared with those estimated si nce the late 1920s, when ozon e measurements first became available. The increases in UV-B irradiance over the latter part of the 20 th century have been larger than the natural variability. There is increased evidence that aerosols have a larger effect on surface UV-B radiation than previously thought. At some sites in the No rthern Hemisphere, UV-B irradiance may con- tinue to increase because of continuing reductions in aerosol extinctions since the 1990s. Interactions between ozone depletion and climate change are complex and can be mediated through changes in chemistry, radiation, and at mospheric circulation patterns. The changes can be in both directions: ozone changes can a ffect climate, and climate change can affect ozone. The observational evidence suggests that stratospheric ozone (and therefore UV-B) has responded relatively quickly to changes in ozone depleting substances, implying that cli-mate interactions have not delayed this process. Model calculations predict that at mid- latitudes a return of ozone to pre-1980 levels is expected by mid 21 st century. However, it may take a decade or two longer in polar regions . Climate change can also affect UV radia- tion through changes in cloudiness and albedo, without involving ozone and since tempera-Changes in biologically active ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth's surface 2 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 ture changes over the 21st century are likely to be about 5 times greater than in the past cen- tury. This is likely to have significant effects on future cloud, aerosol and surface reflectivity. Consequently, unless strong mitigation measures are undertaken with respect to climate ch- ange, profound effects on the biosphere and on the solar UV radiation received at the Earth's surface can be anticipated. The future remains uncertain. Ozone is expected to increase slowly over the decades ahead, but it is not known whether ozone will return to higher levels, or lower levels, than those pre- sent prior to the onset of ozone depletion in the 1970s. There is even greater uncertainty about future UV radiation, since it will be addi tionally influenced by changes in aerosols and clouds. Introduction UV-B radiation (280-315 nm) has important infl uences on biological processes, and is strongly absorbed by atmospheric ozone (in both the stratosphere and the lower atmosphere). Reductions in stratospheric ozone are theref ore important because of the corresponding in- creases in UV-B radiation reaching the Earth's surface. While some UV radiation is needed to synthesize vitamin D, which is necessary for human health, increases in UV-B radiation are also harmful for human health, for example, for melanoma and othe r health effects (see Chapter 2). Increases in UV-B radiation also increase damage to a wide range of organic molecules, including DNA molecules, and generally lead to increased harm to a diverse range of biological (see Chapters 3-5), and physical (s ee Chapters 6-7) processes. UV-B radiation is influenced by many factors other than ozone. These include changes in clouds, aerosols, air pollution, and surface reflection, all of which are influenced by climate change. Since the publication of the 2002 UNEP Effects Panel Assessment 1, 2 there has been continuing pro- gress in research to understand the causes and effects of ozone change. There have been no changes in our understanding of basic principles since the previous assessment, but there have been significant improvements in our knowle dge of past ozone and UV radiation, which put recent changes into a better historical context. Here we assess this new knowledge of ozone changes, their effects on UV radiation, and the interactions between ozone depletion and climate change. Generally, the damaging effect of UV radia tion increases towards shorter wavelengths. In this paper we focus on the erythemally-weighted UV radiation (UV Ery),3 for which a 1% re- duction in ozone leads to a 1.2% increase in damaging radiation at high sun elevations.4 However, other weighting functions with different sensitivities to ozone are more appropriate for other processes.4 In some cases, the wavelength dependence of the effects is not yet well quantified. The continued availability of spectral measurements of solar radiation will there- fore be crucial to quantifying these effects. Ozone changes The science of ozone depletion has recently b een assessed by the WMO Scientific Assess- ment Panel.5 In recent years, the geographic and seasonal extent of Antarctic ozone depletion has varied greatly from year to year (Figure 1-1), depending on the prevailing meteorological conditions. The springtime stratospheric ozone \" hole\" is expected to recur over the next dec- ades, and there will continue to be a large year-to-year variability in its severity and environ-mental impact. Ozone depletion is less severe in the Arctic, where there is also very large year-to-year vari- ability (Figure 1-1), which is expected to continue, depending on the minimum temperatures reached. With global climate change, temperatures in the Arctic stratosphere are expected to Changes in biologically active ultraviole t radiation reaching the Earth's surface The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 3 continue to decrease, increasing the likelihood of severe ozone depletion due to heterogene- ous chemistry on the surfaces of polar stratosphe ric clouds. For every de gree of stratospheric cooling, a reduction in ozone of 15 Dobson Units can be expected.6 This sensitivity is three times larger than had been estimated previously from model calculations. Therefore, future polar ozone depletion may be more susceptible to climate change than previous models had suggested. Ozone depletion in polar regions has an impact on the ozone deple-tion at mid latitudes. 7-9 For exam- ple, it has been shown that ap-proximately 50% of the ozone de-pletion at mid-southern latitudes is attributable to the export of ozone- poor air from Antarctica. 8 Since the previous assessment,1, 2 there has been increased evidence for a cessation of ozone reductions at mid-latitudes. A statistical analysis of satellite-derived ozone profiles indicated that the rate of ozone loss in the upper strato-sphere (at 35-45 km altitude) has diminished globally, and that these changes are consistent with changes in total stratospheric chlo- rine. 11 In a follow-up study it was shown that the slow-down ex- tended to the lower stratosphere.12 It had been predicted that detection of any recovery in the total column of ozone, which is most relevant for environmental impacts of UV radiation at the Earth's surface, would not be expected for several years, 13, 14 because of the natural inter-annual variation in several con- tributing dynamical factors,15-17 which recent studies have shown may be larger than previ- ously assumed.18-20 Statistical trend analyses have demonstrated that the total column amount of ozone at mid-latitudes reached a minimum in the late 1990s, and since then may have started to increase. 21 At mid-latitudes, the column amount of ozone in the 2002-2005 period was approximately 3% below 1980 levels in the Northern Hemisphere, and 6% below 1980 levels in the South- ern Hemisphere, 5 which is similar to that in the period ending 1998-2001.10, 22 The observed changes in ozone are broadly consistent with those expected from changes in atmospheric chemistry that would result from the actions mandated by the Montreal Protocol. Changes in observed ozone are compared with estimated changes in effective equivalent stratospheric chlorine in Figure 1-2. However, changes in atmospheric circulation were also found to have a substantial influence on ozone variability, especially in the lower strato- sphere,23, 24 and have contributed to a significant portion of the observed increase in ozone in the Northern Hemisphere in recent years. These dynamical changes may be a consequence of climate change. If that is the case, these interactions may be important considerations for predicting future changes in ozone. Figure 1-1.

A full recovery to ozone amounts present in the 1970s prior to the onset of ozone depletion is not expected for several decades at best. Factors affecting UV ra- diation received at the Earth's surface Solar ultraviolet radiation is at- tenuated by interaction with at- mospheric constituents in the Earth's atmosphere through ab- sorption and scattering processes. Furthermore, its variability is controlled by astronomical fac- tors, including those that deter- mine the angle at which solar ra- diation arrives at the Earth's at- mosphere and the irradiance that is distributed per unit area at the top of the atmosphere. These astronomical factors and their roles are known very accurately. Absorption in the UV-B region is due to ozone primarily, to a lesser extent to SO 2, NO 2 and other minor species, and also to aerosols. Scattering occurs on molecules, aerosols, and clouds. Solar UV radiation is reflected by th e clouds and the Earth's surface (land and wa- ter). All these processes have been extensiv ely investigated. Although the physical interac- tions are well understood, the quantitative description is incomplete. Because of their com- plexity, the effects of clouds in particular remain difficult to calculate. As discussed later, clouds, aerosols, and surface albedo are factors th at are likely to be affected by climate change, and may therefore impact the long-term variability of surface UV radiation. The ef-fects of ozone on UV radiation are well understood. Since the previous assessment, 1, 2 new studies have quantified the effects of other f actors on UV radiation and the related uncertain- ties, as discussed below. Clouds constitute by far the most important fact or controlling UV radiation for any given so- lar elevation angle, (e.g., 26) and introduce a high variability in surface UV irradiance that limits the detection of influences from ozone.27 Although clouds mainly attenuate radiation, new experimental data have confirmed results from previous studies by reporting large en- hancements of UV radiation under partly cloudy skies.28-31 Enhancements up to 40% have been observed at 420 nm (blue light) when the solar disk is visible, but are smaller in the UV- B region.32, 33 The biological importance of enhancements of UV radiation under broken clouds, which may at times be sustained for hours, must be taken into consideration. The most relevant radiation quantity for atmospheric chemistry is the actinic flux, which is the omni-directional flux passing through a sphere, rather than the cosine-weighted irradiance on a horizontal surface (see Chapter 6, Figure 6- 2). Above clouds, local ised increases of the UV actinic flux of between 60-100% have been observed.34 Below the clouds, the actinic flux was found to be 55-65% smaller compared to cl ear skies. In both cases there is a direct Figure 1-2. Area-weighted total ozone deviations for 60\u00b0S-60\u00b0N, estimated from ground-based measurements. Data have been deseasonalised and adjusted to remove the effects of solar-cycle and the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The thick line represents the effective equivalent stratospheric ch lorine (EESC), scaled to fit the ozone data from 1964-2005 (scale on right). Adapted from Fig 3-1 in. 5 Changes in biologically active ultraviole t radiation reaching the Earth's surface The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 5 influence on photochemistry, with consequences on tropospheric atmospheric composition. Although these effects can be adequately modelled for homogeneous and stratified clouds, it is extremely difficult to simulate broken cloud conditions adequately. The interaction of clouds with other processes produces significant effects on radiation that either reaches the surface or is reflected to space. Increased scattering within the clouds in- teracts with molecular scattering, producing complex wavelength dependencies in the radia- tion scattered towards space and detected by satellite instruments.35 Similarly, increased scat- tering by cloud droplets increases the possibility that these photons are absorbed by atmos- pheric constituents that are inside the cloud (e.g., ozone, NO 2, aerosols).36, 37 A cloud layer over snow or ice covered surfaces may substantially increase the UV dose at the surface, through strengthening of multiple scattering. A twofold increase in UV radiance from the overhead sky has been observed under cloudy conditions compared with the clear sky in Ant- arctica, whereas the increases in the visible and in the infrared were much larger, with en- hancements of up to factor of 100 in the near infrared. 38 Aerosols and trace gases emitted near the surface of the Earth can also have large impacts on UV radiation. 39-41 Several studies have quantified aero sol radiative properties - particularly their UV absorbing efficiency - from ground based measurements of solar UV radiation.42-48 Some satellite retrievals (e.g., TOMS) overestimate surface UV radiation by between 5 and 10% over areas with high aerosol load, especially in the presence of strongly absorbing aero- sols. By combining measurements and radiative transfer (RT) modelling, 47-50 methods have been suggested for applying correc tions to satellite retrievals.51 These corrections will enable more accurate satellite estimates of UV irradiance in the future. New evidence has shown that in urban areas, aerosols and air-pollutants such as ozone and nitrogen dioxide can significantly attenuate solar UV radiation.40, 52-54 Recent studies have shown that aerosols and trace gases from biomass burning can penetrate into the strato-sphere, 55 and consequently affect its chemistry. Increases in UV-B and UV-A solar radiation observed during the last two decades in Germany and Greece56, 57 cannot be explained by changes in ozone amounts alone, and thus it is necessary to include diminishing influences from other factors such as pollution at these sites. 58-60 Aerosols and trace gases that absorb UV radiation efficiently may provide protection to the ecosystem from UV radiation. On the contrary, aerosols that scatter UV radiation redistribute the incoming direct radiation to diffuse radia tion, and therefore have little effect on the UV dose received at the surface. In the presence of such scattering aerosols, the total exposure to UV radiation is increased in locations shaded from direct sunlight. Moreover, changes in the distribution of surface radiation have important effects on the penetrat ion of UV-B radiation into tree canopies (see Chapter 3) and aquatic environments (see Chapter 4). UV irradiance variations can be affected by ozone changes caused by weather patterns. At middle latitudes, ozone variations, at time scales of 1-3 days, depend primarily on the scales of atmospheric motions related to weather systems, while ozone sources and sinks play a mi- nor role. Several examples have been reporte d where dynamical mechanisms have led to the formation of short-lived episodes of extreme total ozone values. 61, 62 Limitations in modelling UV radiation The great complexity and heterogeneity of cloud structure cause difficulties for their accurate parameterization, despite the progress that has been recently achieved (e.g., 34, 63). Similarly, the effects from topography, surface albedo for snow- or ice-covered terrains, have also been investigated. However, accurate representation of the actual radiation fi eld is very difficult, requiring three-dimensional RT modelling, whic h is expensive and time consuming. Most Changes in biologically active ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth's surface 6 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 RT models do not yet account for polarization e ffects, which can be important for estimating the UV radiation, especially in unpolluted conditions. Influences on satellite-derived UV radiation of aerosols and trace gases in the lower tropo- sphere are well understood, but the implementation of procedures for eliminating these ef- fects depends on the availability and spatial extent of additional information gathered near the surface (e.g., aerosol optical properties from measurements or from climatology).48, 49 Infor- mation on aerosol optical properties is available at only a few sites and is derived either di-rectly from measurements or indirectly with the aid of radiation measurements and model calculations. There is usually no information available about aerosol extinctions in the UV-B region. Tropospheric NO 2 may also affect satellite UV retrievals and retrieval of aerosol properties from ground-based radiation measurements.64, 65 The variability of aerosol optical parameters (e.g., the single scattering albedo and phase function of the aerosols) with altitude, which are important in RT modelling, is known only from in situ measurements that are gen- erally rare. New methodologies are required to derive these parameters at different altitudes by remote sensing techniques (e.g., 45). Air pollutants are generally efficient absorbers of UV radiation. Because they are extremely variable in time and space, their influence on the UV radiation received at the surface is im- portant for determining the exposure of the bios phere in urban areas. Of particular impor- tance is the role of tropospheric ozone which ma y increase as a consequence of stratospheric ozone reduction, which leads to increased photochemical production in the troposphere (the so called \"self-healing\" effect). 60 The global distribution of UV radiation UV data are available from satellite-borne sensors such as the new Ozone Monitoring In-strument (OMI) on NASA's Aura satellite, wh ich supersedes the older Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometers (i.e., the TOMS instruments). 66 The retrievals of UV irradiances are from model calculations using derived ozone and cloud reflectances. Sample maps are shown in Figure 1-3, which show a strong peak in UV daily doses at the sub-solar latitudes, near 20\u00baN in June and near 20\u00baS in December. This is expected because solar elevation is a strong de- terminant of UV, and because ozone amounts are generally smaller in the tropics. Outside the tropics, the daily doses of UV radiation decrease markedly as one moves towards the poles, and there are large seasonal variations at mid to high latitudes. Although ozone deple-tion is most severe in Antarctica, the UV doses there are not particularly high during Decem- ber (though still elevated substantially compared w ith the Arctic in June). However, in late spring, the peak UV irradiance, as well as the daily doses, can exceed even the peaks of the corresponding values observed at mid-latitudes. For example, in the spring of 1998, the daily doses of erythemally weighted UV irradiance measured by the National Science Foundation (NSF) network of spectrometers at several Antarctic stations, including the South Pole (where there are 24 hours of daylight in summer), greatly exceeded those that occurred in the summer at San Diego (see chapter 5 from 10). The highest daily UV doses (and peak irradi- ance) occur in the tropics, and at high altitude sites, particularly when snow is present. Recent ground-based measurements have confirme d that, in rural locations, the peak erythe- mally-weighted UV irradiance (o r UVI values, where UVI = 40 x UV Ery in Wm-2)2, 22 are typically 40% greater in the southern hemisphere than at the corresponding latitude in the northern hemisphere.67 Similar differences are also appare nt in the mean summer UV irradi- ance from spectrometers. Such marked differences are not seen in UV data from satellite in- struments that utilize backscattered ultraviolet radiation (e.g., TOMS, OMI) because these sensors do not adequately probe the lowermost regions of the atmosphere where aerosol and Changes in biologically active ultraviole t radiation reaching the Earth's surface The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 7 cloud extinctions are most important.1 Previous studies have shown that altitudinal gradients in UV irradiance are largest in the lowest kilometer or two.67, 68, 69 Long-term changes in UV Measured changes The long-term variabil- ity of surface UV radia- tion has been studied using measurement re- cords and model simula- tions of past UV irradi- ance based on proxy data, which are available for several decades back in time. In most cases, these proxies include total ozone, shortwave solar radiation, and cloudiness. Depending on the location, sunshine duration, snow depth, and aerosols may also be included, as discussed below. Increases in surface UV irradiance in the 1990s have been observed from spectral measure- ments at a few stations in the northern hemi- sphere. This is evident, for example, in the up-dated record of Thessa- loniki, Greece (up to end of 2005), 70, 71 at Hohen- peissenberg, Germany72, and at Bilthoven, The Netherlands.73 The continuous increase in surface UV irradiance, even at longer wavele ngths, during the 1990s cannot be explained only by ozone depletion. It is attributed, in part, to reductions in atmospheric pollution lead- ing to less aerosol extinctions,74 and to decreases in cloudiness.72 The period since the ozone stabilised at mid-latitudes is too short to reveal unequivocal changes in UV radiation. How-ever, data since the late 1990s from one Southe rn Hemisphere site, where ozone does appear to have increased, indicate that surface UV radiation may be decreasing (see Figure 1-4). 75, 76 Note however that, in these data, there is an unexplained decrease around the turn of the cen-tury, which exaggerates the decreases in UVI since that time. At higher latitude southern hemisphere sites, the natural variability is generally much larger, masking any trends in UV. 77, 78 Figure 1-3.

The unshaded (white) areas are those with no UV data coverage. Changes in biologically active ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth's surface 8 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 Examples of long-term changes in UV irradiance from high quality spectrometers are illustrated in Figure 1-5. The summertime UV irradiance generally increased over the observation period, but in some cases, espe- cially in the Southern Hemisphere, there have been decreases in recent years. The larger gradient at Lauder can, in part, be attributed to the lower sam- pling frequency prior to 1994, when observations were made only during fair weather. Further, in the period between 1994 and September 1998, no data were taken during wet weather. Long-term measurements of UV radiation with broad- band radiometers were reported for Moscow, Russia (1968-2003) 53 and for Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden (1983- 2003),79 which show an overall increase towards the late 1990s. Some of this increase is due to ozone re- ductions. However, decreases in aerosol optical thick-ness and effective cloud amount during this period 80, 81 have also occurred, and have led to increases in irradi-ance at longer wavelengths which are unaffected by ozone. 79 Figure 1-4. Long term changes in summertime ozone (upper panel) and in peak summertime UVI (lower panel) at Lauder, New Zealand. The sym- bols show the average ozone and corresponding noontime UV Index for the 5 highest UVI days in December, January and February of each summer derived from UV spectral irradiance measure-ments.

Long-term changes in UV In-dex averaged over the three summer months for all weather conditions within \u00b11 hour around local noon measured at 11 sites distributed worldwide. Linear regres- sions on the data (straight lines) were used to estimate the corresponding linear trends. This figure was prepared using updated series of published UV datasets. The sig-nificance level (** for 99%, and * for 95%) was calculated from the data variability only, neglecting the uncertainties in the measurements. Note that periods for the trends differ from site to site. Adapted from 5 Changes in biologically active ultraviole t radiation reaching the Earth's surface The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 9 Reconstructed time series of UV irradiance, extending several decades back from the start of the ozone depletion, are now available.40, 73, 82, 83 For example, a method for estimating daily erythemal UV doses using total ozone, sunshine duration, and snow depth has been devel- oped and applied at Sodankyl\u00e4, Finland for the period 1950-1999.84 The longest recon- structed time series of UV irradiance to da te is from Davos, Switzerland, starting in 1920s when ozone measurements first became available.85 This series demonstrates fluctuations in surface erythemal dose of similar magnitude to those observed since the late 1970s when the problem of human-induced ozone depletion began, and satellite derived ozone data became available (see Figure 1-6). The changes deduced from reconstructed historical UV irradiance records, and from direct observations in recent decades, reflect those expected from changes in ozone and at-mospheric transmission (since ozone changes are an input to the retrieval). Measurements of UV ir- radiance at various loca-tions over northern mid- latitudes show that surface UV irradiance has in- creased in the 1980s and 1990s as a consequence of ozone depletion and in- creasing atmospheric transmission. 53, 58, 71, 73, 84-86 Radiative transfer calcula-tions have also been used to determine past UV irradiance from routine observations of total ozone, aerosol, albedo, and clouds at two locations in Central Europe, W\u00fcrzburg, and Hohenpeissenberg. 87 The results show that, at these sites, UV-B radiation has increased over the period 1968 to 2000. Be-cause there were supporting data records for cloud cover, aerosol and albedo in this study, the increase in UV-B irradiance could clearly be associated with a reduction in stratospheric ozone. Depending on the action spectra for specific effects, increases in the annual UV expo- sure are ~ +2 % to +5 % per decade. Regional differences have been found in the influence of clouds on UV radiation. For example, the UV-B irradiance increase due to ozone reduc- tion is enhanced by clouds by about 1% per decade for Hohenpeissenberg and reduced by nearly the same amount for W\u00fcrzburg. From the above discussion it appears that UV radiation at the surface has been changing in the last three decades at rates (and even signs) which vary over time and between sites. The changes have been attributed in part to decreases in total ozone column, but other factors such as changes in clouds and aerosol are also important. Since the beginning of the 1990s, there have been indications that atmospheric transmission in the northern hemisphere has been in-creasing following reductions in cloudiness 88 and aerosols86 which would have amplified any increases in UV irradiance attributable to ozone depletion.

For example, it has been speculated that ozone depletion has been one of the factors contrib- uting to large extinctions of organisms, such as that which took place 251 million years ago.89, 90 There have been speculations that damage to the ozone layer may have occurred 65 Myr ago, as a result of widespread combustion of biomass following a large meteoritic impact. 91 These authors estimate that the concentrations of or ganic chlorine and bromine may have been an order of magnitude greater than at present, re sulting in ozone loss and increased UV radiation which could have damaged life on Earth. However, there is no proof that this contributed to any biospheric extinctions. To assess possible changes, biological proxies for UV-B radiation have been considered us- ing lake sediments92, 93 (see Chapter 4). Analyses of plant pigments94 have had limited suc- cess so far. It has been suggested that change s in UV-B radiation due to ozone depletion may have been responsible for a departure in the relationship between tree rings and temperature over the period since the 1970s.95. However, the changing behaviour seems to precede the period of most significant ozone depletion, a nd may be due to other factors. One possible factor is the decreasing irradiance due to increasing cloud and aerosols that occurred over this period, sometimes called \"global dimming\",88 a trend which may have reversed to a \"global brightening\" since the late 1980s.86 Further work on biological proxies for past UV-B radia- tion is currently being conducted by several gro ups, and reliable results may eventually be produced. Promising attempts include the chemical composition and structure of pollen grains and spores.96, 97 The UV-B irradiance depends not only on the ozone layer and other atmospheric properties (clouds, aerosol), but also on the variable emission of the sun98 and the variable geometry of the solar system.99 Although several proxies for past solar emission exist, and though model- ling and comparison with other stars can provide further information, the uncertainties remain great, and published values must be used with caution. In a very long-term perspective, 100 calculations based on the oxygen content of the atmos- phere101 can give some information about the historical development of the ozone layer, as can measurements of the isotope composition of certain minerals (reviewed by Rumble102). In turn, these provide information about past UV radiation. Quantitative information about the ozone layer in the early 20th century can be obtained from the study of historic spectro- graphic plates used in astronomical studies.103 This offers the promise of more accurate esti- mation of UV radiation prior to the 1920s at a few sites. Interactions between oz one depletion, UV radiation , and climate change Interactions between ozone depletion and climate change have recently been assessed and summarized in the IPCC/TEAP report.25 Further details regarding these interactions are given in Chapter 1 of the full IPCC Report.104 A recent review has also been undertaken by the WMO.105 These interactions can be complex, and they can act either way, with ozone depletion impact-ing on climate change, or with climate change impacting on ozone depletion. The interac- tions can involve chemistry, radiation, and dynamics, as well as feedbacks between those three processes. Examples of climate change affecting ozone through dynamical feedbacks have been discussed already (see section on oz one changes). Some of these feedbacks are Changes in biologically active ultraviole t radiation reaching the Earth's surface The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 11 summarised in Figure 1-7. See Chapter 5 for further details on interactions that involve bio- geochemical feedbacks. Impacts of climate chan ge on ozone depletion Impacts of climate change on ozone depletion have been further explored, but there is not yet a consensus on whether the overall effect will be to delay or accelerate ozone recovery. Some processes would result in slowing of ozone recovery,6, 107 while others would result in an acceleration.108 Ozone-depleted air exported from polar latitudes comprises a significant portion of ozone losses at mid-latitudes7-9. This has negative implications for future ozone recovery at mid-latitudes: since further cooling of the polar stratosphere is expected as a con- sequence of global climate change, the cooling will be conducive to further rapid loss of ozone. Changes in atmospheric circulation (dynamics) seem increasingly important for ozone vari- ability.109-112 For example, strong links have been found between stratosphere/troposphere exchange and the El Nino Southern-Oscillation (ENSO) climate pattern.112 Model simula- tions show that much of the ozone increase seen in recent years at mid-northern latitudes can be explained by changes in dynamics, rather th an being caused solely by reductions in at- mospheric chlorine and bromine.23 This has important implications for our confidence about future ozone recovery. Ozone heats the stratosphere by absorbing in coming solar energy and outgoing infrared radia- tion from the Earth's surface. A significant component of the observed stratospheric cooling (-0.17 \u00b0C/decade) can be attributed to ozone depletion, rather than being solely a radiative effect of climate change. 113 Therefore, if ozone amounts were to increase in the future, this Figure 1-7. Update of ozone/climate feedback linkages. From 106.Changes in biologically active ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth's surface 12 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 would tend to warm the stratosphere, diminishi ng the future cooling there due to increasing greenhouse gases (GHG). The warm ing effect would aid further recovery of the ozone layer in polar regions where heterogeneous chemistr y on ice crystals dominates the ozone loss processes, but would have the opposite effect in other regions wher e gas-phase chemistry dominates. Consequently, the future impact of climate change may aid ozone recovery at mid-latitudes. An analysis of four decades of ozone sonde data in Antarctica conc luded that, while ozone depletion has been less severe in recent years, this cannot be necessarily linked to any recov- ery attributable to reductions in chlorine.114 That result supported an earlier study,115 which demonstrated that reduced Antarctic ozone loss during 2001 to 2004 is a consequence of warmer springtime temperatures at altitudes between 20 and 22 km in recent years. Recent model calculations that include climate feedbacks suggest that, because of these inter- actions, ozone is expected to re turn to pre-1980 levels somewhat later in polar regions than at mid-latitudes. However, the observational evidence available so far suggests that these inter- actions have not yet introduced la rge delays in ozone recovery (e.g., see Figure 1-1 and 1-2). As discussed above, there is evidence that ozone has already started to recover at mid lati- tudes. In recent years, springtime ozone losses in Antarctica have ge nerally been less se- vere,* but this has been attributed to increase d temperatures in the lo wer stratosphere, which in turn may be attributed to changes in circ ulation patterns that have resulted from global warming.114 In contrast, in the absence of changes in circulation patterns, climate change is expected to cause lower temperatures in the Arctic stratosphere, which will, in turn, lead to a greater probability of rapid ozone depl etion on the surfaces of ice crystals. The effects of climate change on ozone depl etion may be most pronounced - yet least under- stood - at high latitudes,116 where springtime ozone losses are expected to continue.117 In polar regions especially, interactions with glob al warming complicate the recovery. Increases in water vapour and cooling of th e stratosphere will be more im portant than elsewhere. Fur- ther, we have less confidence in the performa nce of models in this region, which tend to overestimate ozone concentrations and underestim ate the ozone loss. The ozone loss depends critically on temperature. In polar regions, ch anges in climate (surface temperature) can trig- ger changes in circulation which affect ozone. Conversely, changes in ozone lead to changes in stratospheric temperature, which, in turn, may lead to changes in circulation which can trigger changes in climate. Finally, one cannot simply assume that effect s of climate change on ozone and UV radiation will continue at the present rate. According to recent assessments of climate change,118 the average rate of surface temperature change over the 21st century is likely to be about 5 times that in the past century. Consequently, un less strong mitigation measures are undertaken with respect to climate change, profound effect s on the ecosystem and on the solar UV radia- tion received at the Earth's su rface could be anticipated. * The WMO reported that in 2006 the ozone deplet ion in Antarctica has been one of the most severe on record, with respect to the mass de ficit of ozone. See An tarctic Ozone Bulletin 2006, No 4 at http://www.wmo.ch/web/arep/ozone.html Changes in biologically active ultraviole t radiation reaching the Earth's surface The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 13 Impacts of ozone depletion on climate change Changes in ozone and UV radiation can potentially influence climate through impacts on tro- pospheric photochemistry, as discussed in Chapter 6. Observational data and a new model- ling study have both suggested that decreases in stratospheric ozone in Antarctica have led to climatic changes both in the stratosphere and at the Earth's surface. These changes in ozone have led to increased westerly winds at latitude s 50 to 60\u00baS. This, in turn, has resulted in a surface cooling in Antarctica and a warming at high latitudes outside the Antarctic conti- nent. 119 Changes in atmospheric temperatures lead to important changes in modes of atmospheric cir- culation, in particular the North Atlantic Osci llation (NAO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO). These are responsible for large scale redistri butions of atmospheric mass, which produce large scale variability in NH dynamics, and ha ve a profound effect on winter climate variabil- ity around the Atlantic basin. Temperature increases in the troposphere as well as tempera-ture decreases in the stratosphere both contribute to these changes. 110, 111 A potentially im- portant impact of changing ozone on climate has been proposed recently to explain the strengthening of the NAO in recent decades.120 This strengthening has altered the surface climate in these regions at a rate far in excess of global mean warming. Although weak NAO trends are reproduced in climate simulations of the 20 th century, the unexplained strengthen- ing of the NAO was fully simulated in a climate model by imposing observed ozone trends in the lower stratosphere. This implies that stratospheric variability needs to be reproduced in models to fully simulate surface climate variations in the North Atlantic sector. As discussed further in Chapter 5, climate change can also be mediated through UV-induced changes121 in dimethyl sulphide (DMS), a substance emitted from oceanic phytoplankton that can modify the reflectivity of the atmosphere. Other factors that may affect oz one depletion and climate change As discussed previously, volcanic eruptions, an d long-term periodic variations in planetary motions can directly affect UV radiation, ozone, and climate. Changes in solar activity may also be important. Solar UV radiation arriving outside the Earth's atmosphere follows an 11- year cycle. Counter-intuitively, when the sola r activity is highest, UV-B radiation at the sur- face has a minimum due to the increased production of ozone. Recent studies have demon- strated that the changes in solar UV radiation can also induce changes in some modes of at- mospheric dynamics (e.g., the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), and the AO). 122, 123 Interac- tions with solar activity may also be more important for ozone depletion and UV irradiance increases than previously thought. 71, 122, 124-129 Recent modelling studies have shown larger effects of increased CFCs, HCFCs and other halocarbons (and their effects on ozone) on tropi cal tropopause temperatures than had previ- ously been calculated.130 These temperatures are critical because they control the amount of water vapour entering the stratosphere, which in tu rn is converted to OH which then destroys ozone through catalytic cycles. The model indicates that the halocarbons have led to tem-perature increases in that region of about 0.4\u00baC over the last 50 years, which exceeds the cooling effect from the major GHGs. The fact that this region has actually cooled implies that other factors that are not included in the model must also be important. These could in- clude increases in cirrus cloud, increases in water vapour (both of which have been ob- served), or increases in the strength of the mean atmospheric circulation. The model also shows that the indirect effect of ozone depleti on in the stratosphere at mid to high latitudes has offset approximately half of the global surf ace warming to date. Consequently a slightly faster rate of surface warming is pred icted in the future as ozone recovers. Changes in biologically active ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth's surface 14 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 Interactions between diffe rent regions of the stratosphere may also be important. Even in the event of a complete recovery in chlorine, ozone in the lower tropical stratosphere will not re- cover before ~2050, because of a reduction in UV irradiance due to more-rapidly increasing ozone at higher altitudes131. This can be thought of as a reverse example of the well-known \"self-healing\" effect for ozone, whereby ozone losses at high altitudes are partially compen- sated by ozone production from increased UV irradi ance at lower altitudes. In some cases it is not obvious whether changes in ozone are driving changes in dynamics, or whether changes in dynamics are causing changes in ozone.112 Although there is speculation about the effects of climate change introducing lags to ozone recovery, the observational data so far suggests that global ozone may, in fact, be increasing faster than expected, given the estimated rate of decrease of Equiva lent Effective Strato- spheric Chlorine (EESC).5 Future changes in methyl bromide and methyl chloride emissions resulting from climate change may also be important. Methyl bromide constitutes the largest source of bromine at- oms entering the stratosphere and therefore plays an important role in the depletion of strato- spheric ozone,132 and thus on UV radiation. The major source of methyl bromide is natural, but a significant fraction (about 20%, and reducing) is man made.5 Methyl bromide emis- sions from rice paddies will increase appreciably with global warming,133 (see Chapter 5). Future expectations The future pathway for UV radiation is uncertain because the pathway for ozone recovery is uncertain. As reported in recent assessments, 5, 25 there are wide variations between models that predict future ozone, and there are large discrepancies between past measurements, and model simulations of the past (see Figure 1-8). A recent study of trends in total column ozone from several models and from satellite observations from the period 1979-2003 found large discrepancies between the models and measurements. 134 The observed positive trends in both hemispheres in the recent 7-year period are much larger than pre- dicted by the models. Most models underestimate the past trends at mid- and high latitudes. Quantita- tively, there is much disagreement among the models concerning fu- ture trends. However, the models agree that future ozone trends are expected to be positive and less than half the magnitude of the past downward trends. Substantial research efforts in the 1980s and 1990s have advanced our knowledge about solar UV radiation and its interactions with the atmo sphere and biosphere. In recent years, there have been significant improvements in instrumentation technology and radiative transfer modelling which have helped our understanding of the various processes relevant to UV ra-diation. There are still areas where further development is needed. Figure 1-8. The future outlook for ozone recovery is uncertain. Observed and modelled column ozone amounts (60\u00baS-60\u00baN) as percent deviations from the1980 values. From 25. Changes in biologically active ultraviole t radiation reaching the Earth's surface The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 15 Important effects on UV radiation may be expected from long-term changes in ozone, clouds, and aerosols. According to the predictions of climate models, column ozone is expected to increase during the next decades. The response of surface UV radiation solely due to changes in ozone can be estimated from RT model calculations. Such estimates are shown in Figure 1-9, where any direct or indirect effects from clouds and aerosols are neglected. The ozone losses calculated by this model are larger than observed, especially in the Southern Hemi-sphere. Therefore, the corresponding increases in the calculated UV irradiance are overesti- mated. At mid-latitudes surface UV irradiance is predicted to peak between about 2000 and 2010 and is expected to return to the pre- 1980 levels between 2040 and 2070, but the these phases occur later at the southern high latitudes. Figure 1-9 also shows that the predicted changes in UV irradiance are significantly larger in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere. Despite the great progress that has been made in the last decade in understanding the relations and interactions of surface UV radiation with atmospheric composition and structure, there are still areas where scientific research is not sufficiently advanced. There is lack of widespread observational evidence, espe- cially in the tropics and in urban environments, to quan- tify the influence of tropo- spheric ozone, aerosols, and other pollutants on surface UV radiation. Knowledge of interactions between climate change and UV radiation will improve as more modelling studies and observational evidence become available.

Solar UVR ha s many harmful and some benefici al effects on individuals and, in this review, information mainly pub lished since the previous report in 20031 is discussed. The eye is exposed directly to sun light and this can result in acute or long-term damage. Studying how UV-B interacts with the surface and internal structures of the eye has led to a further understanding of the location and pathogenesis of a number of ocular diseases, including pterygium and cataract. The skin is also exposed directly to solar UVR, and the development of skin cancer is the main adverse health outcome of excessive UVR exposure. Skin cancer is the most common form of malignancy amongst fair-ski nned people, and its incidence has increased markedly in recent decades. Projections consiste ntly indicate a further doubling in the next ten years. It is recognised that ge netic factors in addition to those controlling pigment variation can modulate the response of an individual to UVR . Several of the gene tic factors affecting susceptibility to the development of squa mous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and melanoma have been identified. Exposure to solar UVR down-regulates immune responses, in the skin and systemically, by a combination of mechanisms including the generation of particularly potent subsets of T regulatory cells. Such immuno suppression is known to be a crucial factor in the generation of skin cancers. Apart from a detrimental effect on infections caused by some members of the herpesvirus a nd papillomavirus families, the impact of UV-Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone dep letion and its interactions with climate change 26 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 induced immunosuppression on other microbial diseases and on vaccination efficacy is not clear. One important beneficial effect of solar UV-B is its contribution to the cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D, recognised to be a crucial hormone fo r bone health and for other aspects of general health. There is accumulating evidence that UVR e xposure, either directly or via stimulation of vitamin D production, has protective effects on the development of some autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes. Adequate vitamin D may also be protective for the development of several internal cancers and infections. Difficulties associated with balancing the positive effects of vitamin D with the negative e ffects of too much exposure to solar UV-B are considered. Various strategies th at can be adopted by the individual to protect against excessive exposure of the eye or the skin to sunlight are sugge sted. Finally, possible interactions between ozone depletion and climat e warming are outlined briefly, as well as how these might influence human behaviour with regard to sun exposure. Introduction There are many harmful and some beneficial e ffects of solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on human health. Skin cancer and cataract are exam ples of the former category while the synthesis of vitamin D is one example of the latter cate gory. With ozone deplet ion and the consequent increase in terrestrial UV-B, thes e effects may be enhanced. Vari ous models predict increases in the number of skin cancers and cataracts that can be attributed to ozone depletion over the baseline that occurred before ozone depletion.1, 2 However, as stated previously1, human choice in determining where, when, how and for how long an individual is exposed to solar radiation is a major, if not the principal, factor that esta blishes the health outcomes. Assuming the same human exposure habits, ozone depletion with resulting increase in UV-B will increase the numbers of skin cancers and cataracts, while a positive effect could be a general improvement in vitamin D status. In this report, discussion will centre first on interactions between solar UVR and the eye and, secondly, on interactions between solar UVR and the skin, concentrating on the risks of, and trends in, the incidence of skin cancers and the genetic factor s involved in their development. A section on the immune effects of UVR comes next, followed by another on the UV-induced synthesis of vitamin D and its relationship with a range of diseases. Finally, strategies for responding to the problem of ozone depletion are considered, esp ecially those that protect the individual. In most instances, only new informa tion available since the previous full report in 2003 is included although in certain instances reference is made to earlier key publications. It should be noted that the topic of air pollution relating to ozone depletion is addressed in Chapter 6 of this report, this includes refere nce to aspects concerning human health. The eye The eye and the skin are the only organs of the body that are exposed to solar UVR. The effects of sunlight on the eye may be acute (usually after a latent period of several hours), long-term after an acute exposure, or long-term following ch ronic exposure to levels of UVR below those required for acute effects (Table 1). In our la st report we focused on cataract, the UV-B related eye disease with the most serious public health implications.1 This section of the report concentrates first on how UV-B reaches and interact s with the surface and in ternal structures of the eye, and then provides an update on chronic effects that may impair vision. Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone depletion and its interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 27 Interaction of solar UV-B w ith target tissues in the eye At low solar zenith angles (high solar elevati on angles), the UV-B photons most likely to fall on the cornea and other ocular tissues are those fr om indirect sunlight, i.e., those scattered by atmospheric components or reflected from surfaces. In contrast to its effects on the skin, direct sunlight plays a minor role in UV-B-related ey e disorders due to a na tural aversion to looking directly at the sun, and shadowing by the brow s when the sun is high is the sky. Under conditions of cloud cover (with lower light levels), the natural defence mechanisms of the eye, for example squinting, are relaxed, permitting greate r exposure of the outer surface and internal structures of the eye, such as the lens. At the same time, scattering and reflection by clouds increases the diffuse radiation incident on the eye.3, 4 UV reflectance values vary considerably for different natural terrains and manufactured ma terials. Grass and other green vegetation are natural strong absorbers of UV- B and reflect this waveband poorly (2-3%), whereas fresh snow is an excellent reflector (more than 90%). Thes e variations can result in significant errors in estimating UV-B exposure based solely on lo cation, as was commonly done in early epidemiologic studies of the role of sunlight in eye disease. Table 1. Potential acute and chronic effects of exposure to UV-B on the eye and adjacent tissues Tissue Acute Effect Chronic Effect Lid and peri-ocular skin Sunburn: erythema (redness) Intraepithelial neoplasia Cornea Photokeratitis Endothelial (swelling) Reactivation Climatic droplet keratopathy (epithelial degeneration) (see text) Endothelial changes Lens Anterior subcapsular opacities Age-related cataract (see text) Peripheral light focussing by the eye (see Figure 2-1). A factor that must be considered when assessing exposure of the internal structures of the eye to UV- B is that the various zones of the cornea direct the radiation to different lo cations within the eye. Coroneo et al.5 suggested that Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone dep letion and its interactions with climate change 28 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 light and UVR incoming from the side is focussed on specific areas of the cornea, resulting in a twenty-fold increase in exposure that may be important in the i nduction of pterygia and cataract. They also proposed that UVR was similarly conc entrated in the lower nasal quadrant of the crystalline lens, the location where age-related co rtical cataract is co mmonly first detected. Human6 and mannequin7 studies have confirmed that inco ming temporal UVR from behind the coronal plane (100o to 135o to the sagittal plane, see Figure 2-1) was focussed into the anterior chamber angle. This is modified by corneal shape, anterior chamber depth, and location of the eye within the bony orbit, squinting, eyelashes, prominence of cheekbones and presence of lid skin folds on the temporal side of the eye. Transmittance of the ocular media. In order for UV-B incident on the surface of the eye to reach the crystalline lens, it must first pass through the cornea and the aqueous humour. Although the aqueous humour absorbs little environmental UV-B, the cornea has a significant role in preventing UV-B from reaching the lens, with some parts of the cornea being more effective than others. Kolozsvari et el. 8 have shown that UV-B absorption is about twice as high in the anterior layers (epithelium and Bowman layer) of the human cornea as in the posterior layers. Their data indicate that the whole cornea begins to transmit at 280 nm (<0.01%), increases to 1% at 295 nm and approaches 5% at 300 nm. Although the actual amount of UV-B transmitted is low, it should be noted that UV-B at 300 nm is about 600 times more biologically effective at damaging ocular tissue than UV- A at 325 nm. At birth the human le ns is colourless and allows both UV-B and UV-A to pass through to the retina. As the lens ages, ther e are significant changes in the lens proteins, including a decrease in their solubility, that re sult in increased, wavelength independent, scatter and consequent degradation of vi sion (clinically called nuclear sclerosis). Frequently there is also a yellowing which can eliminate the passage of UVR and limit the passage of light in the violet-blue end of the visible spectrum. Figure 2-1. Peripheral light focussing. Top: Photograph showing how a beam directed to wards the temporal side of the cornea is focussed into th e anterior chamber angle. Bottom: A beam of light (or UVR), from behind the coronal plane, directed onto the temporal periphery of the cornea is refracted and focussed into the nasal angle of the anterior chamber of the eye, as shown by arrows. If the incident beam originates in fr ont of the coronal plane, the focus shifts into the nasal part of the lens. Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone depletion and its interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 29 Chronic effects of UVR on the eye Pterygium. This wing-shaped, inflammatory, proliferat ive and invasive growth occurs on the conjunctiva and cornea of the huma n eye (Figure 2-2). It is in duced, in part, by intracellular damage caused by UV-B exposure9 and most commonly occurs in the superficial layers of the nasal cornea. Pterygia grow towards the centre of the cornea and can severely impair vision. In their early stages, they appear as small opacities at the nasal edge of the cornea and then spread to become a fleshy raised area. A number of cau sal factors, other than UVR, have been proposed as important to pterygium development including mechanical irritation, heredity, heat, cold, and wind. None of these adequately explains the pr edominately nasal locatio n of pterygia. This preferred location has b een explained, however, on the basis of the peripheral light focussing effect discussed above.10 Pterygia are more prevalent and progress more rapidly in individuals livi ng in regions near to the equator or at very high altitudes. Al Bdour and Latayfey 11 reported a strong correlation between pterygia and environmental UVR in Australian aborigines. In the more temperate climate of the northeastern U.S., a significant relationship was found between the cumulative dose of solar UV- A and UV-B and the prevalence of pterygium. 12 The higher prevalence of pterygium in outdoor occupations has been attributed to exposure to excessive amounts of sun light. In a population- based sample of residents of the Australian state of Victoria who were aged 40 years and older, statistical modelling revealed th at 43.6% of the risk of pter ygium could be attributed to cumulative dose of sunlight. 13 This result was the same when cumulative dose of ocular UV-B was substituted in the model for cumulative dos e of sunlight. Pterygi um continues to be considered a significant public health problem in ru ral areas and occurs primarily as a result of ocular sun exposure.13 In a study conducted in Perth, Western Australia14, there were strong positive associations between pterygium and measures of potential and actual sun exposure. The strongest associations were seen for the estimated daily ocular solar radiation dose at any age, which in those in the highest quartile of exposur e resulted in about a 7-fold greater risk. Although other agents may contri bute to pterygium development 15-17, in most epidemiological studies the common factor is UVR exposure, thereby indicating that UVR can be considered a causal agent. Thus, the implication for prevention of pterygium is that ocular protection from sunlight is beneficial at all ages. Cataract. Three main types of age-rela ted cataract can be distinguished, based on their location: cortical cataract involving the an terior (and posterior) co rtices of the lens; posterior subcapsular at the extreme posterior cortex lining the lens capsule1 and nuclear (sclerotic) cataract at the nucleus of the lens. However by the time the individual requires surgery, mixed categories are most commonly present. Cortical cataract ar ises from localised changes occurring in the cortex of the lens, where opaque radial spoke s begin to develop on th e periphery and extend towards the centre, eventually affecting vision.18, 19 The second form of cataract, posterior subcapsular cataract, is thought to develop when the lens epithelial cells migrate to form a plaque Figure 2-2. An early pterygium. Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone dep letion and its interactions with climate change 30 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 of opacities and cysts at the posterior surface of the lens. These lesions are particularly detrimental to vision when the pupil constricts due to sunlight or other br ight sources, or during near tasks. The third form of cat aract, nuclear cataract, occurs as the crystalline lens of the eye ages and the nucleus loses its transparency, becoming more opalescent and sometimes turning yellowish to brown in hue.20, 21 A number of publications has reviewed the ep idemiologic information linking UVR exposure to cataract.22-24 Although earlier reviews concluded that the range and vari ability of the study designs precluded definitive conclusions, most of the more recent analyses suggest a role for UV-B in some types of age-relate d cataract, particularly cortical cataract. A frequently cited early estimate of risk from personal ocular expo sure to solar UV-B is that of Taylor et al.25 in the Chesapeake Bay Waterman Study. Watermen in the highest quartile had a three-fold increased risk for cortical cataract. It is important to note that the subjects in this cohort were only exposed to levels of solar UV encountered in mixed, often overcast, climate at intermediate latitude. The same group26 that conducted the Chesapeake Bay Waterman Study also conducted a population- based epidemiologic study in Salisbury, Maryland. The increased risk of 10% of developing cortical cataract associated w ith UV exposure in this study (the Salisbury Eye Evaluation [SEE ] project27) was more modest, but the population was cons idered more representative of the U.S. as a whole. West and her colleagues subsequently used these data from the SEE project as the basis from which to develop risk estimates fo r the entire U.S. population under conditions of ozone depletion.26 These risk estimates, which were ca lculated for fixed levels of ozone depletion ranging between 5 and 20%, indicated that the number of cortical cataract cases seen by 2050 would increase between 1.3 a nd 6.9% respectively, with associ ated health costs for the U.S. of between about $0.6 and $3 billion respec tively. There are, in addition, important social costs associated with cataract development. A recent review found that there was insufficien t evidence to conclude that UVR exposure played a causal role in the developm ent of posterior subcapsular cataract.28 However, a recent study in Japan29 showed that the severity of nuclear cataract increased with UV-B exposure. Furthermore, lifetime cumulative UV-B exposure a nd particularly exposure in the teenage years correlated with the presence of nuc lear cataract in females. Anot her report indicated that the association between nuclear cata ract and occupational sun exposu re was significant for exposure between the ages of 20 and 29 years.30 Supporting evidence for such a difference in a period of age susceptibility is provided by an animal st udy in which the same dose of UVR induced more severe cataracts in young than in older animals.31 The skin Sunburn is the effect most frequently experi enced by the human populat ion due to excessive solar UV-B exposure. It is an inflammatory reaction to a toxic assault on the skin. Although human skin is adapted to the ambient UVR, th e sunburn reaction demonstr ates that excessive exposures can stretch defensive mechanisms to the limit, or even exceed them (pain and blister formation). Despite the remembered discomfort fro m past episodes, about a third of US residents report at least one sunburn per year.32 Fair-skinned people are most susceptible to sunburn, and they correspondingly run a higher ri sk of long term adverse effects, such as skin cancer. In the following sections, the relations hip between various types of skin cancer and solar UVR is outlined. Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone depletion and its interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 31 Skin cancer types and trends Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer among fair-skinned populations and its incidence has increased markedly over the last century. Many skin cancers are detected early, at a stage where they can be easily and effectively tr eated. This limits morbidity and mortality. In addition, for the majority of skin cancers, the 'non-melanoma' skin can cers (NMSC) consisting of and squamous ce ll carcinomas (SCC), the malignant potential is low which also reduces death from these diseases. This is not the case for the most malignant form of skin cancer, melanoma, that arises from pigment cells (melanocytes), and is responsible for most of the deaths from the skin cancer. Projections show an approximate doubling in all types of skin cancer from 2000 to 2015 in the Nether lands, but this is also due, in large part, to ageing of the population.33 Melanoma As found in earlier epidemiological studies, cuta neous malignant melanomas are related to sun exposure in early life, to episode s of severe sunburn, and to the number of moles (nevi), which in turn is related to sun exposure in early life. 34 In the last decade, much progress has been made in identifying genetic changes in melanoma cells, and the functional importa nce of these genetic changes for melanoma development has been de monstrated in genetically modified mice. However, the precise mechanisms underlying ne vus formation and progression to melanoma, and the role of solar UVR in this process, remain to be resolved.35, 36 Epidemiology of melanoma. Although rates of increase in me lanoma incidence appear to be levelling off in countries with the highest number of cases37-39, the absolute incidence is continuing to rise. Mortality, however, has risen much less or has even stabilized especially in females, and in younger age cohorts, although not in older males in countries such as the USA, Scotland and Australia. The major increase in inci dence recently has been attributed to the thin melanomas that have high survival rates.40 A thin melanoma is define d as being less than or equal to one mm thick. This predominance of the early stages of melanoma could be due to greater awareness in the general population regarding the dangers of suspicious-looking moles. Prompt diagnosis and treatment may th en limit any increa se in mortality.41, 42 Melanomas with an attached nevus from which they apparently originated are on average thinner, of the more superficial spreading type and o ccur more often in irregularly exposed skin than melanomas that show no remnants of a precursor nevus.43 Patients with the nevus -associated melanomas are younger and have more nevi. Strouse et al.44 found that the incidence of melanoma in children in th e USA is rising rapidly but survival is improving. They showed that th e incidence rate of me lanoma was positively correlated with environmental UVR exposure. The chance of surviving a melanoma decreases with age and is lower for boys compared with girls. It is also lower if the primary tumour occurs on body sites other than the extremities and the to rso (i.e., locations other than those exposed intermittently to the sun). The latter finding is in agreement with a study of adults by Berwick et al.45 who found that survival from melanoma wa s higher in individuals with a history of increased intermittent sun exposure and episodes of sunburn. However, these authors also found improved survival with a history of increased skin awareness and increased solar elastosis (i.e., a skin 'aged' by chronic sun exposure). Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone dep letion and its interactions with climate change 32 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 Earlier reports regarding a seasona l variation in the diagnosis of melanoma were confirmed in recent European and Australian studies. These revealed maximum incidence for thin melanomas on extremities in the summer in females.46, 47 This effect may be attributable to enhanced skin awareness in the hotter months or to stimulation of melanoma growth after (over-)exposure to the sun. Boniol et al.47 found that survival from melano mas diagnosed in the summer was higher, as might be expected from the higher numb er of thin melanomas diagnosed at that time of the year, but, after corre ction for tumour thickness, the effect was still significant. The authors therefore suggest that patients in whom melanom as are diagnosed after recent sun exposure may show better survival. Trends and changes in skin cancer incidence over recent decades clearly indicate the importance of human behaviour, particularly in relation to exposure to solar UVR.37 For example, Gandini et al.48 undertook a meta-analysis of 57 observational st udies which showed that intermittent sun exposure and sunburn history played considerable roles as risk factors for melanoma, and Agredano et al.49 found a very strong relationship between increasing access to air travel to leisure destinations and increasing melanoma in cidence. However, case-control studies generally find that genetic factors carry more ri sk than behavioural aspects, such as moderating UV exposure.50 It should be noted, however, that the genetic factors can be determined more accurately than personal UV exposure; the latter is assessed by very poor surrogates (e.g. recalled number of sunburns in youth or lifetim e hours of sun exposure). This inaccuracy in determining past UV exposure will tend to lead to lower estimates of relative risk. Moreover, an individual's behaviour with regard to UV exposure can be altered to reduce risk, very much in contrast to an indivi dual's genetic background. Latitudinal and temporal trends in skin cancer, notably in melanomas, underline the major importance of UV exposure as an environmental risk factor. The integrit y of the stratospheric ozone layer, as the prime atmospheric UV filter, therefore remains crucial in protection against melanoma. Genetic risk factors for melanoma. There are well-established genetic factors conferring susceptibility to melanoma - notably inherite d mutations in the cel l-cycle control gene, p16INK4a , and in the \"hair-colour\" gene which codes for the me lanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). The MC1R gene contributes to the cont rol of pigmentation in hair and skin51 and is an important risk factor for all types of skin cancer, including melanoma.52 Other additional genes are related to melanoma risk, e.g., the OCA2 gene wh ich also controls skin and eye colour53, and an as yet unknown gene located on chromosome 1.54 UVR causes DNA damage which can give rise to gene mutations which in turn can contribute to skin cancer formation (see below). Hence, repair of this damage is of crucial importance. The solar UV-B induced DNA damage (mainly cyclobut ane pyrimidine dimers, CPDs) is removed by a 'cut-and-paste' type of DNA re pair ('nucleotide excision repair '). A complete dysfunction in one of the enzymes in this repair system results in a dramatic increase in risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. More subtle genetic variati ons (polymorphisms) in the repair enzymes can modify the efficacy of DNA repair, and thus affect skin cancer risk. Certain genetic variations in repair enzymes were indeed found to be associated with melanoma risk.55-61 UVR can generate reactive oxygen species and thus inflict damage to cell components, particularly DNA. Although melanin pigment is generally protective, it may also contribute to oxidative damage under certain conditions62, especially its red variety, pheomelanin.63 Certain Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone depletion and its interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 33 inherited or acquired traits that increase oxidative stre ss appear to be associated with melanoma and its precursor lesion, dysplastic nevus.64-66 Genetic variation in a pr otein (APE1) involved in the repair of oxidized DNA modifies melanoma risk.67 These inherited predispositions to develop melanoma will help to identify high risk groups who may be particularly susceptible to increases in ambient UV-B radiation. Oncogenic alterations in melanomas. In terms of molecular mechanisms, melanomas from chronically exposed, from intermittently expos ed and unexposed skin sites have different molecular signatures.68 Notably, the melanomas from interm ittently exposed skin have a high frequency of activating mutations in a critical signalling molecule, B-RAF. MC1R variants, which are associated with enhanced risk of melanoma, are strongly associated with B-RAF mutations.51 Ten to 20% of melanomas from chronically exposed skin bear mutations in N-RAS, a protein preceding B-RAF in the si gnal cascade for cell proliferation.69 Mutations in B-RAF and N-RAS genes are already present in some cells in nevi70, but nevus cells do not proliferate and are kept in a 'senescent state'.71, 72 The mutations in the B-RAF oncogene are not typical of UV-B radiation, but could be due to UV-induced oxidative damage. The epidemiological finding that melanomas associated with intermittent sun exposure45 show better survival may be linked to the specific molecular changes found in these tumours. Animal experiments on UVR and melanoma. Because of the well-estab lished role of UVR in NMSC and the known mutagenic and carcinogenic properties of UV-B radi ation, it seems most likely that UV-B wavelengths are also contribu ting to the development of melanoma. However, human melanomas show no gene mutations that are typical of UV-B radi ation. Animal models may serve to elucidate whether, and if so, how UV -B radiation contributes to the development of melanoma. Experiments with transgenic mice confirmed the epidemiological finding that the neonatal period can be critical to the development of melanomas later in life.73, 74 More specifically, a study in transgenic mice showed neonatal UV-B exposure to be highly effective.75 These melanomas, which closely mimic the human disease, coul d not be evoked by neonatal UV-A exposure.75 The latter finding is in accordance with earlier experiments in opposums76, but differs from the results obtained with small Xiphophorus fish.77 In the fish, both UV-B and UV-A neonatal exposure proved to be very effective in causing melanomas, and the variation in effectiveness with wavelength was recently found to closely follow the variation in the UV induction of oxidant radicals from melanin in the skin of the fish.78 In the initial experiments with neonatal UV exposure, the HGF transgenic mice were albi no, but recent experiments showed that these mice crossed into a pigmented background were also susceptible to melanoma induction by neonatal UV-B exposure (Noonan and De Fabo, personal communication). Further experimentation with this model may shed more light on the wavelength dependency of melanoma induction in mammals. In another m odel, melanomas were induced by massive doses of UV-B radiation delivered to repair-deficient transgenic mice.79 However, the severe skin trauma inflicted may have cause d non-specific tumour promotion.80 In support of the epidemiological finding that in termittent sunburning exposures increase the risk of melanoma, experiments in hairless mice have shown this type of exposure regimen to be considerably more effective in inducing nevi (potential precursor s of melanoma) than a regimen in which the exposure was more evenly spread over time.81 Thus, sunburning UV-B exposure of Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone dep letion and its interactions with climate change 34 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 adults may indeed also contribute to melanoma development by stimulating the proliferation of melanocytes.82 Immunity and melanoma . There are indications that immu ne mechanisms against melanomas are present in humans as demonstrated by th e occasional spontaneous regression of some pigmented skin lesions. Further, immune res ponses against melanoma antigens are readily detectable in patients and immunotherapy is actively used for melanoma treatment.83, 84 As found earlier for BCC, melanoma risk appears to be related to the densit y of mast cells in unexposed skin85 so that the higher the number of mast cells, the greater the chance of developing melanoma. Interestingly, childre n with eczema (atopic dermatitis) develop fewer melanocytic nevi than children without eczema86, and the therapeutic effect of UV exposure on the eczema might be related to a possible effect of the radiation on the cytokine network in the skin, the products of which then stimulate melanocytic growth. Whereas there is substantial evidence for a ro le for UV-induced immunos uppression in NMSC, it is not known as yet if this mechanism is a factor in melanoma progression ; this is currently an area of intense investigation. Non-melanoma skin carcinomas (NMSCs) In epidemiological studies prior to 1980, th e skin carcinomas, SCC and BCC, were not considered separately, and were commonly f ound in people who had accumulated excessive hours of solar (UV) exposure. In more recent studies, important diffe rences between SCC and BCC have emerged. SCC is associated mainly with chronic and life-long accumulated sun exposure87 whereas BCC, similar to melanoma, is more closely associated with early-life and intermittent exposures resulting in episodes of se vere sunburn. In addition, while SCCs occur on body sites most regularly exposed to the sun such as the face, BCCs are also found frequently on sites exposed intermittently to sunlight. Also the genetic alterations identified in SCC and BCC show important differences. Epidemiology of NMSC. Studies continue to show increas es in the incidence of both SCC and BCC33, 88, 89, with disproportionately high increases in BCC in young females on the lower limbs.90, 91 Sunbathing is associated with a five-f old rise in the risk of BCC on the trunk.57 Although BCC is locally invasive, it is usually a slow growing and not very aggressive tumour; superficial BCC on the trunk is ofte n misdiagnosed and confused w ith eczematous skin lesions. Detailed skin examination of subjects in a Quee nsland community established that the incidence of BCC on sites other than head, neck, hands an d arms was 3-fold higher than actually treated92; a smaller study in Spain produced a similar result.93 Hence, the large majority of the BCC on irregularly exposed sites appear to remain 'sub-clinical', i.e ., cause no great discomfort, are never presented to a physician and remain essentially undetected. Death due to NMSC in the USA has declined, and when it occurs, is often related to an excessively long delay befo re seeking medical care.94 Genetic risk factors for NMSC. UV-B radiation inflicts highly characteristic DNA damage (mainly CPDs), and the repair of this da mage in human skin diminishes with age.95 This type of DNA damage causes specific 'point mutations' which are found in the P53 tumor suppressor gene in NMSC (see below). However, NMSC also show frequent crude chromosomal aberrations.96 Such aberrations are already abundantly pr esent in the benign precursor lesions of Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone depletion and its interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 35 SCC, the actinic keratoses (AKs). Complete doub le strand breaks (DSB) in the DNA cause these gross chromosomal losses and duplications. Inte restingly, variants in genes involved in the repair of DSB in DNA appear to be relate d to NMSC risk, but not to melanoma risk97 The association between NMSC and DSB repair ties in nicely with the recent finding that UV-B- exposed blood cells from patients with skin car cinomas are more prone to develop chromatid breaks than equivalent cells from me lanoma patients and control subjects.17 Genetic variations in specific antioxidant proteins are associated with NMSC risk.98 Variants of a repair enzyme, involved in excision of oxidized bases in DNA, affect SCC risk, but not the risk of BCC or melanoma.97 Hence, there appear to be cons iderable differences in how oxidative DNA damage (such as induced by UVR) and its repair are related to the va rious types of skin cancer. Oncogenic alterations in NMSC. Although considerably less effi cient than UV-B, long-wave UV-A radiation can cause the same type of DNA damage as UV-B radiation, and thus give rise to 'UV-B-like' mutations in the P53 tumor suppressor gene. However, oxidative damage contributes substantially at these longer wavelengths and causes different P53 mutations from those induced by UV-B.99, 100 Microscopic clusters of cell cl ones with strong expression of mutant-p53 protein in sun-exposed skin carry the same types of 'UV-B-like' P53 mutations as skin carcinomas.100, 101 Hence, all of these common microsc opic clusters of cells with mutant- p53 in human skin could be potential precursor s of skin carcinomas. In Swedish studies, microdissection of skin carcinomas showed consistent mutations in the P53 gene throughout the tumour masses, i.e., most tumours appeared to be a clonal expansion fr om a founder cell with a particular 'UV-B-like' P53 mutation.101, 102 This conclusion is in agreement with earlier studies that found dominant 'UV-B-like' mutations in SCCs and BCCs.103, 104 In contrast to these findings, a recent Australian study reported P53 mutations to be very diverse, heterogeneous and disjunctive in SCCs and adjacent skin, i.e., ev ery microdissected part of a tumour showed different P53 mutations without any suggestion of a founder mutation or any clear overall indication of UVR as the cause.105 By arguably separating out UV-B-like, UV-A-like, oxidative and 'other' P53 mutations, the authors found the UV-B-lik e mutations to be located in the shallow parts of the tumours and the UV-A-like mutati ons in the deeper parts. This issue clearly needs to be investigated further. Although both SCC and the precursor AK frequently carry various chromo somal aberration, the loss of a particular part of chromosome 18 appe ars to be related to the progression from AK to SCC. 96 The presence of multiple copies of parts of chromosomes may explain the amplification of the H-RAS oncogene frequently found in SCC.106 As reported in our previous review1 and confirmed recently107, nearly all BCCs display activation of the Hedgehog proliferative pathway, mostly through a defect in the PTCH protein in the cell membrane by mutations or loss of the coding gene. Some of these mutations are 'UV- B-like'. Further research has show n that certain va riations in the PTCH gene may predispose towards BCCs108, and that UV-B radiation can suppre ss PTCH function and thus potentially stimulate BCC development.109 Hence, the oncogenic alterations found in NMSC are attributable largely to UVR, and in some cases more specifically to UV-B radiation. Animal experiments on UV and NMSC. Experiments in transgenic mice have identified the type of UV-B-induced damage (CPDs) that caus es SCC and more immedi ate effects such as Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone dep letion and its interactions with climate change 36 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 sunburn and thickening of the outer viab le layer of skin (the epidermis).110 Clones of cells with mutations in the P53 gene - such as found in human skin - have been induced in well-controlled experiments in which mice were exposed to UV-B radiation.111 Here these p53-mutant clones were tightly linked to the subsequent occurrences of SCC. In mice, UV-B-induced DNA damage gives rise to DSBs and st rong signals for DSB repair.112 Thus, UV-B radiation may induce the chromosomal aberrations present in human NMSC. Immunity and NMSC. Organ transplant recipients (OTR) ha ve a dramatically increased risk of developing SCC and, until recently, this was considered to be solely the result of taking immunosuppressive medication to prevent reje ction of the transplant. Evidence is now accumulating to indicate that conventional immu nosuppressive drugs can also adversely affect UV-induced DNA damage and repair in skin cells113-115 and thus they may increase the risk of SCC. Immunosuppressed patients other than the OTR may be affected similarly.116 A new generation of immunosuppressive dr ugs with a different mode of action may substantially reduce the risk of SCC.117 Hence, the increased incidence of SCC in relation to immunosuppressive drugs may be due in large part to detrimental effects on UV defensive mechanisms in the skin, rather than to imm unosuppression per se. Immune effects of solar UVR Mechanisms of UV-induced immunosuppression When the skin is exposed to UVR, a complex cascade of events begins that ends in the suppression of certain types of immune responses, mainly th ose involving cell-mediated immunity. The main interactions affected ar e between three types of immunologically active white blood cells: antigen-presentin lymphocytes and T-regulatory (Treg) lymphocytes. The degree of suppression and the forms of cell- mediated immunity affected can vary depending on the quality, quantity and timing of the UVR, the frequency of the exposures, and the extent and location of the body surface irradiated. One distinction commonly made is between local and systemic immunosuppression. Local immunosuppression occurs when an antigen (a \"non-self\" molecule that the host recognises as foreign and makes an immune response to) is ap plied directly to the irradiated body site soon after the UV exposure, resulting in a down-regulati on of immunity to that antigen. In systemic immunosuppression, following UV e xposure of one part of the body, the antigen is applied to a distant unirradiated body site, ag ain leading to systemic down-re gulation of immunity to that antigen. Certain steps of the two pathways differ such as whether the APCs have been directly exposed to the UVR or not. The process for local immunosuppression is outlined in Figure 2-3, and details of both local and systemic mechanisms can be f ound in several excellent reviews.118-121 In brief, at least three photoreceptors located at or near th e skin surface are involved - DNA, trans- urocanic acid and membrane components. On absorption of photons , the respective structural changes include formation of thymine dimers in DNA, isomerisation of trans to cis-urocanic acid, and lipid peroxidation in membrane components. These al terations initiate the pathway and stimulate the local production of the large range of immune mediators shown in Figure 2-3. Such molecules have profound effects on various cell populations in the irradiated site an d possibly elsewhere in the body. In particular, there are changes in the numbers and function of th e APCs which lead to alterations in particular T lymphoc yte subsets. For example, inhi bition in the release of certain Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone depletion and its interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 37 (type 1) cytokines from T helper 1 (Th1) cells occurs. This is si gnificant as the type 1 cytokines are very important in the responses to simp le chemicals, such as nickel, and in the immunological control of tumours and intracellular infections, such as those caused by viruses. At the same time, T reg cells are stimulated to release immune mediators that are involved in the control of other T-cell subs ets. Upon activation by a specific antigen, these T reg cells are capable of down-regulating immunity by the production of immunosuppressi ve cytokines. There is much interest currently in trying to characterise populations of T reg cells, particularly as they may have therapeutic value in the treatment of autoimmune and other diseases.122 The majority of experimental systems to date have involved a single or a limited number of exposures to UVR, containing the UV-B waveband predominantly, and in doses sufficient to cause sunburn (erythema) followed by application of the test antigen. Under natural conditions, people are exposed to solar UVR in which the UVB represents less than 6% of the total UV spectrum 123 and they frequently receive suberythemal doses on a daily basis, especially during the summer months. Many respond to this chronic low level exposure by tanning and by skin thickening. These responses, which provide some protection against the burning effect of UVR, might lead to photoadaptation so that protection agai nst UV-induced immunosuppression could also develop. This possibility has been tested rece ntly in both mice and humans. For most immune responses, photoadaptation did not occur so th at the immunosuppressi on continued throughout a period of repeated daily e xposures to suberythemal solar simulated radiation. 124, 125 The impact of UVR on infectious dise ases and vaccination of human subjects The 2003 UNEP report1 summarized the evidence available at that time demonstrating that solar UVR exposure could adversely affect the pathogenes is of various infections. Information on this topic reported since 2003 is outlined below. Th e two cases in which UVR exposure definitely causes a detrimental change in the pathogenesi s are herpes simplex virus (HSV) which causes cold sores and human papillomavirus (HPV) which commonly causes warts. In both cases, UV appears to have dual effects - both on the immu ne response and on the virus itself, and these mechanisms are outlined below. The apparent in ability of UVR to alter the course of other human infections could be because the causati ve agents themselves do not contain any UV responsive elements, or that the human immune system is sufficiently robust so that if one aspect Figure 2-3. Outline of pathway l eading to local immunosuppression (antigen applied to the irradiated skin site) following UV irradiation. Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone dep letion and its interactions with climate change 38 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 of it is suppressed, another can compensate. It should be noted, however, that only a limited number of human infections have been investigated thus far in the context of solar UVR. Herpes simplex virus (HSV). Several epidemiological and experi mental studies have indicated that exposure to solar UVR exposure is a common stimulus for the reactivation of HSV type 1 from latency in the nerve tissue. The virus then travels down the sensory nerve and replicates in the skin to induce a recurrent le sion (cold sore) at the same site as the initial infection had occurred. A large-scale study of 3678 infected patients, 2656 of whom suffered HSV recurrent lesions, was undertaken recently in a Prefecture of Japan to further evaluate the role of solar UVR exposure.126 The self-reported cause of the recurr ence of cold sores was the sun in 10.4% of individuals. In the summer months, this rose to 19.7% over all, and to 40% in subjects younger than 30 years. One mechanism likely to be important here is the suppression of local immune responses as a result of UV exposure: the virus arriving at the cutaneous site from the nerve will have time to replicate and to i nduce the clinical symptoms before effective immunological control is regained.127, 128 Such a scenario has been shown to operate in mice infected cutaneously with HSV and then UV irradiated.129 New studies indi cate that a second mechanism involving a more direct interaction between HSV and UVR is probably required to reactivate the virus, in additi on to the immune effects of th e UVR. For example, UV-induced damage to nerve endings can lead to changes that result in the activation of HSV promoters, and hence to the reactivation of the virus from latency.130 Human papillomavirus (HPV). It has been recognised fo r several years that, in immunosuppressed subjects and those with epiderm odysplasia verruciformis (EV; a rare genetic disease in which APCs are defective), inf ections with certain cutaneous HPV types (EV- HPV) are associated with the development of SCCs but only on body sites most exposed naturally to sunlight, such as the face and backs of the hands. New information has now provided evidence that immunocompe tent individuals can be si milarly affected, i.e., UVR exposure and infection with certain cutanous HPV types can act as co-factors in the development of not only SCCs and but also of BCCs (reviewed in131). The interactions here are complex but, in brief, the HPV is able to stimulate cell pr oliferation and inhibit UV-induced programmed cell death (apoptosis) in the epidermis. These prope rties, together with the local immunosuppression and the additional genetic changes induced by the UVR exposure, may lead to tumour progression. Furthermore, on the basis of a lif etime-retrospective questionnaire on sun exposure, it has been suggested that sunburn ep isodes in the past lead to an in crease in the risk of infection with particular HPV t ypes in healthy subjects.132 The conjunctiva of the eye represents a further si te where an association between HPV, SCC and sun exposure is probable. Conjunctival SCCs from subjects in Uganda, where the sunlight exposure is very high, were analysed for particular P53 mutations (CC \u00c6TT) as a molecular signature of mutagenesis by solar UVR.133 The prevalence of CC \u00c6TT transition (56%) was the highest observed in any of the can cer types evaluated and matched that of skin cancers in XP patients (see section below, The impact of UVR on tumour immunity). In addition EV HPV types were found in 86% of cases of SCCs of the conjunctiva.134 It was suggested that these results confirm the causal role of solar UVR exposu re in SCC of the conjunctiva and lead to the conclusion that the HPV infection could act as a co-factor in the mutagenesis process. Recently an unexpected interaction between HPV types and solar UVR exposure has been revealed. Hrushesky and colleagues in the Nether lands observed a seasonal fluctuation in the frequency of cervical smears that were positive for the anogenital HPV types: it was twice as Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone depletion and its interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 39 high in the summer months with a peak in August.135, 136 There was a positive correlation between the monthly HPV detection rate and the monthly solar UVR exposure. Hrushesky et al. speculate that UV-induced systemic immunosup pression could be the main reason for the increase in active HPV infections in the cervix in the summer months. This finding could be of importance as the high-risk anogenital HPV type s are recognised to be the primary cause of carcinoma of the cervix, a tumour that is es timated to kill about 500,000 women annually worldwide. Vaccination. To date, only one large-scale experiment al study, carried out in the Netherlands, has evaluated whether solar UVR exposure can af fect the generation of immune responses to vaccines.137 In brief, subjects were vaccinated wi th recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen following whole-body UV irradiation on five consecutiv e days in half of the individuals. While natural killer cell activity and contact hypersen sitivity responses were suppressed in the irradiated subjects compared w ith the unirradiated subjects, th ere was no difference between the two groups in the hepatitis B-specific T cell or antibody responses. However, when the subjects were genotyped to characterise their cytokine polymorphisms (which can affect cytokine production or activity), it was found that indi viduals with a partic ular interleukin-1 polymorphism showed suppressed antibody responses to hepatitis B virus, if exposed to UVR prior to the vaccination.138 Furthermore when skin samples were assessed for cis-urocanic acid concentration (which acts as major photoreceptor for UVR in the skin and can initiate the cascade resulting in immunosuppression), UV- irradiated subjects with higher cis-urocanic acid levels had suppressed T cell responses to the vaccine.139 These results indicate that there are genetic and other differences in the way in which an individual might respond to vaccination in the context of UVR exposure. Th erefore, it may not be appropriate to put all the irradiated or unirradiated subjects into singl e groups in order to make valid comparisons regarding UV- induced effects on immune responses during vaccination. Three further studies are of interest. Sharma et al. 140 investigated an outbreak of measles in children in an Indian city and found that one-thi rd of the cases had occurred in individuals who had been vaccinated previously against measles a nd who should have been protected as a result. They suggested that the virus-specific immun ity could have waned due to solar UV-induced suppressive effects although experi mental evidence is required to substantiate this idea. Snopov et al.141 studied plasma cytokine levels following m easles and poliovirus vaccination in infants in St Petersburg, Russia, some of whom had received ten daily suberythemal whole-body exposures to UV lamps (emitting predominantly UV-B) prio r to the vaccination. This procedure was thought to improve the general heal th of such children. A shift towards a Th2 cytokine response occurred in the infants who had been UV exposed, but without the development of any clinical symptoms; antibody titres were not m easured. Finally Ghoreishi and Dutz142 demonstrated recently that if mice were immunised with a pr otein applied directly to UV-irradiated skin together with an adjuvant (the trancutaneous route), immune res ponses to that protein were not generated. This outcome was mediated by T reg cells that function thr ough the production of the immunosuppressive cytokine, inte rleukin-10. In the future, the trancutaneous route may become preferred to subcutaneous inocula tion as it avoids the use of needles; thus this result is of considerable interest. In conclusion, there is limited evidence th at UVR exposure can reduce the efficacy of vaccination, at least in some individuals. Clea rly, this issue requires further investigation, particularly with regard to the identification of UV-suscep tible groups within a population. Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone dep letion and its interactions with climate change 40 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 The impact of UVR on tumour immunity There is considerable evidence that UV-induced immunosuppression contribut es significantly to the progression of both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers.1 Recently Jans et al.110 demonstrated that prevention of the formation of the most common UV lesion in the skin, CPDs, also prevented the vast majority of the acute responses in UV-exposed skin and increased the resistance to UV-induced tumour developm ent. Furthermore, Kuchel et al.143 found that CPD development is the initiating ev ent for suppression of memory immune responses in human subjects. This study looked at the effect of UVR exposure on the memory immune response in individuals who were allergic to nickel. This means that they had alre ady shown a cell-mediated immune response to nickel in the past and w ould therefore have an immunological memory of nickel. When irradiated with solar-simulated UVR and then challenged on the skin with nickel, the normal cell-mediated response (seen as re ddening and inflammation of the skin) was suppressed. However, if liposomes containing a DNA repair enzyme were applied immediately after the exposure, the cell-medi ated response was not suppressed. Subjects with the genetic disease XP, in whom there are mutations affecting DNA repair, show enhanced UV-induced acute inflammation and a high incidence of UV-induced skin cancers, up to 5000 times that of the general population.144 Application of li posomes containing a DNA repair enzyme to the exposed skin leads to a decrease in the rate of newly occurring actinic keratoses (precursors of SCC) and skin cancers compared with placebo145 Mice with different genetic defects in nucleotide excision repair (use d as animal models of XP disease) have been investigated to determine further the e ffect of DNA repair on UV-induced local immunosuppression.146 In another example, transgenic mice with a defect in one form of nucleotide excision repair have been used to demonstrate that tumour cells, derived from a murine UV-B-induced SCC, first develop into tumours following subcutaneous injection, and then are subsequently rejected in exactly the same fashion as in the wild-type.147 However, if the transgenic and wild-type mice were UV-B expos ed prior to the tumour cell inoculation, the tumours were rejected in 40% of the transgenic mice, as compared to 96% rejection in the wild- type mice. It was concluded that this immune-m ediated impairment in tumour rejection, induced by the lack of repair of the DNA damage following the UV exposure, could contribute significantly to skin cancer development in XP pa tients. This work on XP represents further compelling evidence that the immunosuppression caused by UVR can be a crucial factor in the generation of skin cancers. Vitamin D Although exposure to solar UVR has many advers e health effects in human populations, one very beneficial effect is its contribution to vitamin D status. The vitamin D status of an individual is based on measuri ng the serum or plasma con centration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. The active form of v itamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH) 2D] is synthesised in the final step of the metabolic pathway. The levels of 1,25(OH) 2D are maintained even when 25(OH)D levels become sub-optimal . Currently the serum levels of 25(OH)D considered excessive, sufficient, insufficien t are >250, 50-250, 25-50 and <25 nmol/L respectively.148-150 These values are the topic of c ontinuing discussion. For example, a recent report indicates that the most advantage ous serum concentration of 25(OH)D for a number of health endpoints begins at 75 nmol/L with the optimum be tween 90-100 nmol/L.151 For most people, more than 90% of their vitamin D require ment is acquired from exposure to solar UVR. Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone depletion and its interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 41 An action spectrum for vitamin D formation in human skin indicates that synthesis occurs most effectively following exposure to the UV-B waveband.152 As solar UV-B is reduced to almost zero in the winter months at latitudes above 500 North or South153, vitamin D status can vary greatly with season and location. Various surveys have provided evidence that many individuals, even those living in countries with high solar UVR154, may have inadequate vitamin D status.155-159 Because of its ability to absorb UV-B, melanin in the skin can also decrease vitamin D status although, with sufficient UV-B, adequate vitamin D status can be achieved.160 As an example of the effect that skin pigm entation can have on vitamin D production, 42% of Black American women were considered 25(OH) D-deficient compared with 4.2% of white women in a recent survey.161 Vitamin D was identified almost one hundred year s ago, and the link between sunlight exposure and childhood rickets proposed about four hundred years ago. Vitamin D is a very important hormone for many aspects of general health. It plays a major role in the growth, development and maintenance of bone, with deficits leading to low bone mineral density resulting in an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures in ad ults and rickets in children. However adequate vitamin D status is now implicated in the prev ention of an increasing list of non-skeletal disorders including several inte rnal cancers and autoimmune diseases, and hypertension. 1,25(OH) 2D most commonly acts as a fact or that stimulates cell diffe rentiation and cell death. Immune effects Following the discovery of vitamin D receptors (VDRs) on several populations of immune cells, it is now known that vitamin D status can a ffect the immune system by suppressing T-cell proliferation, down-regulating antigen pres entation, stimulating the generation of T reg cells and Th2 cells, and activating macrophage f unction (reviewed in Mathieu et al.162 Indeed, once it became known that 1,25(OH) 2D3 can be synthesised in the skin following UVR, it has been suggested as a mediator of UV-induced immunosuppr ession. One illustration of this aspect is its inhibitory effects on the ability of Langerhans cells (which form a dendritic cell network in the outermost layers of the skin and survey the skin for any foreign challenges) to present antigens.163 Cancer The most persuasive evidence to date suggest ing a protective role for vitamin D in human disease relates to some internal cancers. Most information is available for colon, breast, prostate and ovarian tumours. Recently Garland et al. 164 undertook a review of re levant epidemiological studies and concluded that 20 out of 30 studies on colon cancer, 9 out of 13 on breast cancer, 13 out of 26 on prostate cancer and 5 out of 7 on ovarian cancer repor ted a significant benefit of vitamin D, its serum metabolites, sunlight exposu re or another marker of vitamin D status on cancer risk or mortality. Th e other studies demonstrated a favourable trend (of borderline significance) or no association with vitamin D or its markers. A second recent review found a significant inverse correlation be tween sunlight exposure and th e incidence or mortality of prostate, ovary and colon cancers with the da ta on non-Hodgkin lymphoma giving conflicting results.165 Vitamin D might provide a protective effect by controlli ng cell proliferation, inducing terminal differentiation of tumour cells and inhibiting angiogenesis. There are many VDR polymorphisms, and only particular genotypes of VDR in combination with low 25(OH)D levels may correlate with the increased risk of cancer or metastasis. Notably one large longitudinal Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone dep letion and its interactions with climate change 42 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 case-control study in the Nordic countries found that the risk of prostate cancer was greatest in two groups: those men with a low serum 25(OH) D (below 19 nmol/L) and those with a high serum 25(OH)D (above 80 nmol/L).166 In addition, the results of a very recent large randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial taking place in post-menopausal women showed that the incidence of colorectal cancer in the 18,176 individuals assigned to receive calcium carbonate plus vitamin D 3 (400 IU) daily was no different from the 18,106 individuals assigned to the placebo group.167 This finding has been criticised as the daily dose of vitamin D taken by the subjects was lower than that recommended by some experts.168, 169 Furthermore a meta-analysis of 44 observational studies of eith er prospective (cohort) or retr ospective (case-control) design concluded that individuals taking >1000 vitamin D or with >82 nmol/L serum 25(OH)D had 50% lower incidence of colorectal cancer compared with reference values.170 In addition to vitamin D status, cons ideration of calcium status may be of crucial importance in the prevention of internal cancers, as has been demonstrated for colorectal adenomas.171 The majority of the epidemiological studies linking low UV exposures to higher incidence of internal cancers used latitude as a surrogate for exposure rath er than measuring personal UV dose. However, several reports have now tried to include a personal estimation of sun exposure. In a case-control Australian survey, the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma fe ll with increasing solar irradiation, as assessed via a self-admin istered questionnaire a nd telephone interview.172 As already noted in a previous section, Berwick et al.45 reported that, following the diagnosis of early stage cutaneous melanoma, sun exposure was associated with increas ed survival rates over an average of a 5-year period. The irradiation was assessed by personal interview and a review of histopathological parameters, such as solar elastosis. Rukin et al.173 assessed various parameters regarding past sun exposure, via a qu estionnaire, that might affect susceptibility to prostate cancer: in men with ve ry low UV exposure, polymorphisms in particular subregions of the VDR gene were associated with risk. The difficulties of accurately estimating past personal UV exposure have already been indicated in this report. The finding of a significant protective effect is thus of some importance. Furthermor e the inclusion of objectiv e measures of past sun exposure such as solar elastosis pr ovides further weight to this c onclusion. No studies in animals have attempted to assess a protective ro le for solar UV exposure in internal cancer development, although several su ch studies have shown that vitamin D has activity against tumour proliferation and meta stasis (reviewed in Giovannucci174). Autoimmune diseases As discussed above for the internal cancers, a pr otective role for vitamin D status is postulated for some autoimmune diseases, namely multip le sclerosis (MS), diabetes mellitus type 1, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). A brief overview of each is given below. MS is an autoimmune disease in which an overa ctive Th1 cytokine response to an unidentified antigen stimulates an immune attack on mye lin in the central nervous system. Initial epidemiological studies in human populations us ing latitude as a surrogate for solar UV exposure175 and experimental studies in a mouse model of MS (experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, EAE)176 support the view that there is a link between poor vitamin D status, due to low sunlight exposure, and MS incidence. New evidence has indicated that increased sun exposure during ages 6-15 years is associ ated with a decreased risk of MS.177 In a prospective cohort study of almost 20,000 nurse s in the USA, Munger et al.178 revealed that vitamin D Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone depletion and its interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 43 supplements (>400IU/day vs. nil) after the age of 25 was inversely associated with MS onset (40% decrease in risk). Also a record linkage study of skin cancer and MS has revealed that skin cancer incidence is significantly less common in MS patients than in those patients with other autoimmune or neurological diseases.179 It is postulated that 1,25(OH) 2D could act by suppressing Th1 function while concurrently increasing T reg and Th2 activities, thus helping to reduce the risk of MS development. However, in one of the few animal model studies to date in which UVR was incorporated, UV exposure induced progressive disease in some mice that had already developed the relapsing-remitting form of EAE.180 It was shown that systemic immunosuppression had resulted from the UVR. These findings were explained by suggesting that Th1 responses contribute to disease onset while Th2 responses that are promoted by UVR may be more important in disease progression. It should be noted that in most of the mouse studies of EAE, 1,25(OH) 2D3 was added to the diet rather than vitamin D 3, the metabolite formed in the skin after UV exposure, and calcium suppl ementation was also provided. A recent paper reports that di etary vitamin D 3 provided protection from the de velopment of EAE in female mice, but not in ovariectomised female mice or in male mice.181 Thus a complex relationship between vitamin D and female hormones may be indicated. For type 1 diabetes, epidemiol ogical studies show increased in cidence at higher latitude, the converse to skin cancer incidence. Added to this, convincing evidence from models of non- obese diabetic mice demonstrates that vitami n D deficiency in early life accelerates the appearance of the disease.182 A birth-cohort study in Finland indicated that regular vitamin D intake in early childhood reduced the risk of type 1 diabetes development in later life.183 Two other reports show the protective effects of vitamin D or cod-liver oil (rich in vitamin D) in type 1 diabetes.184, 185 No studies have attempted to relate individual solar UVR dose with type 1 diabetes in humans or animal models thus far. Unlike MS and type 1 diabetes, the incidence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) does not correlate convincingly with latitude. 186 However, a prospective large-sc ale study has revealed an inverse association between vitamin D intake and RA.187 As the symptoms of RA are largely due to the overactivity of the Th1 cytokines, es low levels of 1,25(OH) 2D may not be sufficient to suppress this imbalance. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) have an unknown aetiology but ar e immune-mediated and consist of at least two forms, ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. A mouse model in which the VDRs are not expressed has been used to illu strate the importance of vitamin D for the maintenance of normal immune respons es in the gastro -intestinal tract.188 In another mouse model, 1,25(OH) 2D3 prevented and ameliorated the symptoms of IBD.189 Therefore it is possible that a vitamin D deficiency may lead to a lack of suppression of the enhanced Th1 cytokine responses that are typical of IBDs in humans. The role of su nlight in IBD has not been examined experimentally, although it is known that IBDs have a complex aetiology involving environmental factors and are most prevalent in higher latitudes where exposure to solar UVR is reduced compared with lower latitudes. In conclusion, for the human autoimmune diseases , MS, type 1 diabetes, RA and IBDs, there is growing, although still not definitive, evidence to associate low solar UVR exposure and/or vitamin D with occurrence. Recent cohort studies have indicated convincingly that poor vitamin D status can be prospectively associated with the onset of the first th ree of these diseases (reviewed in Ponsonby et al. 190). However, it is possible that another factor, apart from vitamin D, which is also linked with sun exposure, ma y be involved in modulating immune responses. Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone dep letion and its interactions with climate change 44 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 Suggested factors include the UV-indu ced release of the neuropeptides, -melanocytic- stimulating hormone and calcitoni n-gene related peptide, or th e light-induced suppression of melatonin levels.190 As a further indication of how complicated a nd confusing the links are between vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of certain au toimmune diseases, there appear to be certain subsets of patient populations in whom the production of 1,25(OH) 2D3 is increased.191-193 In those with Crohn disease, the elevated 1,25(OH) 2D3 is associated with low bone density and active disease which Abreu et al.193 suggest may arise from in flammation occurring in the intestinal tract. In patients with sarcoidosis, elevated vitamin D was seen more frequently in those with extrathoracic involvement, a more serious form of the disease.192 Infectious diseases Few studies to date have consid ered vitamin D in the context of infectious diseases, although Cantorna et al.189 found that the susceptibility of mice to infection with HSV or the yeast Candida albicans was not affected by 1,25(OH) 2D3 given in the diet. However, historically vitamin D has been used to treat tuberculosis and there is more recent evidence that 1,25(OH) 2D3 can activate anti-mycobacterial activity in a murine model194 and in cattle infected with Mycobacterium bovis.195 An explanation of how this mechanism might operate has been provided using a mycobacterial model system. It has been shown that the activation of Toll-like receptors on human macrophages by mycobacterial lipopeptides leads to the up-regulation of the VDRs and vitamin D hydroxylase genes, resulting in the activation of the macrophages and the killing of the intracellular bacteria.196 Several surveys have shown that, in temperate climates, the incidence of tuberculosis is higher in human subjects with low serum 25(OH)D levels197, and a recent study involving foreign-born people living in London concluded that 25(OH)D deficiency correlated with tuberculosis amongst all ethnic groups, excep t white Europeans and Chinese/South Asians.198 The lack of solar UVR exposure is likely to contribute to the low levels of vitamin D, but poor dietary inta ke may be important and particular VDR polymorphisms may provide a geneti c risk factor for some ethnic groups. An interesting recent review suggests the hypot hesis that the occurrence of epidem ic influenza predominantly in the winter months might be explained by the seas onal deficiency in vitamin D, leading to a significant reduction in several anti-viral immune mechanisms.199 Safety of response strategies Response strategies to deal with the problems ar ising from ozone depletion can be divided into those that are directed at restor ing the appropriate level of ozone in the stratosphere by replacing ozone depleting substances (ODSs) with alterna tive chemicals, and those that are directed at protecting individuals from the increased sola r UV-B arising from ozone depletion. Both strategies may have unintended consequences for human health. The sections below will summarize the safety aspects associated with the development and use of ODS replacement chemicals and then will discuss some of the issu es associated with various personal protection strategies for the eye and the skin. Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone depletion and its interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 45 ODS replacement chemicals Much of the safety testing of many of the substitutes for ODSs, for example HCFC-124, HFC- 134a and HFC-227, continues to find lo w toxicity in humans and animals.200, 201 However, there has been an increasing number of reports indi cating that use or expos ure to HCFC-123, in particular in occupationally exposed populatio ns, can be associated with liver toxicity.202-204 As the number of chemicals being proposed as replac ements for ODSs is steadily increasing (EPA 2004, available at www.epa.gov/ozone/snap), it w ill be important to monitor their use for adverse events. This is particular ly true for those chemicals that have seen limited use in the past and for which exposure and toxicity information is limited. Personal protection strategies Many of the protective strategies against excessi ve exposure to sunlight have been developed and advocated by those concerned about the effect s of UVR on the skin. The first step towards protection from any toxic agent is to be aware th at the hazard exists. The general advice to seek shade has become a keynote slogan for those involved in sun safety; this has been an effective addendum to the popular Australian slip, slap, slop campaign (now modified by New Zealand to be slip, slap, slop and wrap ). The equivalent programme in the USA is called SunWise and it seeks to teach the public, especially children, how to protect themselves from overexposure to the sun (http://epa.gov.sunwise/). Most public health pamphlets now include a referen ce to the need for hats and sunglasses. Wide brimmed (>10 cm) hats are recommended for head and eye protection and can reduce ocular exposure by up to 50%.205 Protection from side-angles of UVR is often provided by the hood of a jacket and similar headwear. Although, as discussed above, there have been concerns that under-exposure to UV-B may impair vitamin D st atus, one recommendati on suggests that 10-15 minutes per day in sunlight in the summer mont hs should be sufficient to maintain adequate vitamin D status for most individuals.164 This dose relates to wh ite-skinned people living in countries such as north-west Europe and the USA, with exposure on unprotec ted skin. It should be modified considerably for those living at high or low latitude, for the season of the year and for immigrants with darker skin colour. In addi tion age, type of clothing , diet, whether the work place is in- or out-doors and the social environm ent are all important va riables in determining how much ambient UVR exposure is optimal. On e recent study illustrates the complexity of estimating recommended UV exposure times for the Australian population, a nd concludes that a single simple message for the general public is not possible.206 The skin and eye normally have some defences against oxidative and photo-induced damage. These include pigments such as melanin, antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, and antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, lutein, -carotene and other carotenoids, and glutathione. Many of these defences begin to diminish after 40 years of age resulting in less protection from radiation-induced damage to various structures of the eye.207 The use of antioxidants, free radical scavenge rs and trace minerals, principally via the diet, appear to be effective in reducing the immunos uppressive effects of UVR as well as UV-B induced skin carcinogenesis208; no evidence was found of a similar eff ect for cataract or other UV-B-related ocular diseases. However, recent clinical a nd experimental data s uggest that modifying a person's antioxidant status via supplementation may require extreme caution as the antioxidant defence system is complex and intricately ba lanced, and altering it may actually make the carcinogenic impact of UV worse.208 Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone dep letion and its interactions with climate change 46 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 Protection specific to the eye. The eye is located in the bony orbit, and the forehead, eyebrows, lids and eyelashes provide c onsiderable protection from overhead solar irradiance.209 This explains why solar exposure at levels that shou ld produce corneal damage within minutes, if the exposure were directly onto the cornea, does not do so. The need to protect ocular tissues from excessive exposure to UVR using appropriate abso rptive glass and plastic materials is generally accepted and well understood.210, 211 Plastic lenses absorb up to about 350 nm and most high refractive index plastic (including polycarbonate) and glass lenses absorb even more UV-A. Thus, even clear spectacle lenses provide prot ection from UV-B. However, in the case of non- wrap around spectacles there is po tential for ambient UVR to enter the eye from the side. This effect can be exacerbated by tinted sunglass lenses , which provoke a wider opening of the eye. This is particularly significant for the potential exposure of the crystalline lens from peripheral rays. Dose estimate factors have been proposed fo r the efficacy of a wide range of forms of eye protection, i.e., from ordinary glass sp ectacles to highly protective ski goggles.210 Most early contact lens material s, other than fluorosilicone acr ylate, provided little protection from UVR. As a result, rigid and soft contact lenses have now been developed which offer various levels of protection from UVR. Consideration of the optic al absorption characteristics of a given lens and the related prot ection factors may be used to pr edict the protection afforded by a given lens. This has been confirmed by Walsh et al.212 using modelled and measured data under high levels of solar UVR in the summer months in Houston, Texas. Rigid contact lenses provide no protection for the peripheral cornea or from the effects of peripheral li ght focussing. On the other hand, soft contact lenses that cover the entire cornea will protect the eye from UVR entering from the side or below. Using m odel eye and mannequin studies, Kwok et al.7 have demonstrated that UVR-blocking soft contact lens es effectively shield against peripheral corneal focussing of obliquely incident UVR in the anterior segment of the eye. They also re-emphasise that many sunglasses do not protect against these rays and that contact lenses would provide protection when sunglasses are not worn. Sliney210 concluded that UVR-blocking soft contact lenses provide protection from UV-B equivalent to ski-goggles for the cornea and internal eye structures. Protection specific to the skin. Broad spectrum sunscreens are be ing used increasingly by the general population to minimise the erythemal eff ect of high sun exposure. They are generally effective for that end-point but concerns have been expressed that regul ar sunscreen usage may impair cutaneous vitamin D synthesis, if the cream is applied at the corre ct concentration. While some reports indicate that sunscreens signifi cantly decrease the production of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2D3 213, others found little effect on the levels of these two substances.214, 215 Farrerons et al.216 followed two groups of elderly subjects livi ng in Barcelona, one treated with sunscreen and the other without treatment. The sunscr een users showed a minor decrease in serum 25(OH)D levels in both the summer and winter months compared with the controls, but this reduction was not sufficient to induc e secondary hyperparathyroidism. It should be noted that, in practice, sunscreen application is frequently prob lematic with insufficient quantity being used to achieve the sun protection factor rated, or the spreading being non-uniform resulting in some skin sites getting little or no protection, or to some being washed or towelled off.217, 218 Efforts have been made to define sunscreens in terms of their ability to protect against UV- induced immunosuppression. The immune protection factor (IPF) has been developed in an attempt to compare one preparation with another219 The IPF is defined as the ratio of UV doses influencing a particular immunol ogical end-point in the presen ce or in the absence of the Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone depletion and its interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 47 sunscreen. Using delayed hypersensitivity as an example, several reports indicate that sunscreens that absorb the UV-A waveband offer the most effective immunoprotection (reviewed in 220). Of course, protection against the i mmune effects of sola r UVR might not be beneficial if consideration of protection against selected in ternal cancers, autoimmune and infectious diseases is taken into consideration. Apart from sunscreens, there is considerable interest currently in identifying dietary constituen ts that could protect the skin's immune system against UV damage.221, 222 Some concerns have arisen about unintended co nsequences from the increased use of sunscreens to protect against UV-B. A number of the UV- B absorbing components in sunscreens have been shown to have weak estrogenic activity so ma y have adverse consequences for reproductive function in human and animal populations in the environment, lending strength to the recommendation that protection from UV-B sh ould not rely solely on sunscreen use.223-230 As discussed above, there are many pr otective strategies for the skin that do not have unintended consequences for the environment. These include staying indoors, wearin g clothing that covers sun-exposed areas of the body during conditions of high ambient UVR or seeking shade during the middle hours of the day although this will provide partial protection only. Possible interactions between clim ate change and ozone depletion If the predicted higher ambient temperatures in summer due to global warming are combined with drier weather, peop le living in mid-latitudes may spend more time outdoors, thus increasing their solar UV exposure. Indeed, it has been sh own, at least in schoolchildren in the UK, that climate and ambient temperature influence behaviour and hence sun exposure more than ambient solar UV.217 While such behavioural adaptation may have benefits in terms of vitamin D synthesis, the impact on skin cancer inciden ce and other health aspects of solar UVR are predicted to be adverse. There is also the po ssibility that climate change may result in wetter weather with more individuals staying indoors. Also, there would be regional differences in behavioural responses to warming. In the previous Report (UNEP 2002, published in de Gruijl et al.1) the possibility that rising temperatures due to global warming might enha nce the induction of skin cancer by solar UVR was considered. This suggestion was based on experiments in mice performed many years ago.231, 232 As the process of UV-carcinogenesis is similar in mice and humans, rising temperatures could have a similar impact on sk in cancers in humans, but the effect might be quantitatively different. Data on the influen ce of temperature on UV- carcinogenesis in human populations are not available but it is possible to investigate skin cancer incidence in people of similar skin colour living at different altitudes.233 An attempt was made to find some indication from existing results: the incidence of NMSC in fair-skinned males and females in 10 different, well distributed regions of continental USA, collected in the Third National Cancer Survey234, has already been compared with UV-B measurements in the same region. In the new analysis, temperature data for these regions were added (v an der Leun et al. personal communication). It was discovered that there was a similar trend to that in the mouse experiments towards a higher incidence of NMSC at relatively high temperatures compared with relatively lower temperatures. These preliminary results on human skin cancer re inforce the suggestion that the interaction of temperature and solar UV radiation may become an important health effect due to climate change. In addition it should be noted th at, following the work of Sasaki et al.235, higher ambient Effects on human health from stratospheric ozone dep letion and its interactions with climate change 48 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 temperatures as a result of global climate cha nge may interact with UVR exposure to further increase the risk of nucle ar cataract development. As temperatures increase, changes in the quality and quantity of pest infe stations are likely to require the increased use of pesticides. Ther e are recent reports that exposure to certain pesticides can result in immunosuppression, and, in the case of permethrin, that such immunosuppression236 may be additive to that caused by exposure to UV-B.237 Conclusions and gaps in knowledge In the four years since our last report, consider able progress has taken place regarding the impact of ozone depletion, and hence of increased solar UV-B, on human health. The mechanisms whereby UVR interacts with structures in the ey e and causes a variety of ocular diseases are becoming clear, as are details regarding the gene tic basis of skin cancers and the pathways leading to UV-induced immunosuppression. The s uggested links between solar UVR exposure, vitamin D and protection against a variety of inte rnal cancers, autoimmune diseases and infection require further confirmation. In Table 2, we indi cate areas where crucia l knowledge is lacking. Despite the distinct possibility that the ozone la yer will repair itself in the coming decades, the general public will still require to maintain vigilance regarding th eir sunlight exposure. While it remains fashionable, for example, to have a tanne d skin, to wear minimal clothing in hot weather and to experience holidays in the sun, the risk of overexposure of the white population is high. The projection of a doubling in the incidence of all three types of skin cancer in the next ten years, plus a large increase in the number of cataracts, due partly to an ageing population, mean that health campaigns that stre ss the harmful effects of solar UVR are required and justified. However, to maintain sufficient vitamin D le vels, the protective measures employed by an individual should not go to th e extreme of minimal or no so lar UVR exposure in the summer months. Table 2.

A further area of highly interesting research emphasizes th e importance of indirect UV radiation effects on plants, pathogens, herbivores, soil microbes and ecosystem processes below the surface. Although photosynthesis of higher plants and mosses is seldom affected by enhanced or reduced UV-B radiation in most field st udies, effects on growth and mor phology (form) of higher plants and mosses are often manifested. This can l ead to small reductions in shoot production and changes in the competitive balance of different species. Fungi and bacteria are generally more sensitive to damage by UV-B radi ation than are higher plants. However, the species differ in their UV-B radiation sensitivity to damage, some being affected while others may be very tolerant. This can lead to changes in sp ecies composition of microbial communities with subsequent influences on processes such as litter decomposition. Changes in plant chemical composition are commonly reported due to UV- B manipulations (either enhancement or attenuation of UV-B in sunlight) and may lead to substantial reduc tions in consumption of plant tissues by insects. Although sunlight does not pe netrate significantly into soils, the biomass and morphology of plant root systems of plants can be modified to a much greater degree than plant shoots. Root mass can exhibit sizeable declines with more UV-B. Also, UV-B-induced changes in soil microbial communities and biomass, as we ll as altered populations of small invertebrates have been reported and these changes have important implications for mineral nutrient cycling in the soil. Many new developments in understand ing the underlying mechanisms mediating plant response to UV-B radiation have emerged. This new information is helpful in understanding common responses of plants to UV-B radiati on, such as diminished growth, acclimation responses of plants to UV-B radi ation and interactions of plants with consumer organisms such as insects and plant pathogens. The response to UV-B radiation involves bot h the initial stimulus by solar radiation and transmission of signals wi thin the plants. Resulting changes in gene Terrestrial ecosystems, in creased solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change 66 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 expression induced by these signals may have elem ents in common with t hose elicited by other environmental factors, and generate overlapping functional (including acc limation) responses. Concurrent responses of terrestr ial systems to the combination of enhanced UV-B radiation and other global change factors (increased temperature, CO 2, available nitrogen and altered precipitation) are less well understood. Studies of individual pl ant responses to combinations of factors indicate that plant grow th can be augmented by higher CO 2 levels, yet many of the effects of UV-B radiation are usually no t ameliorated by the elevated CO 2. UV-B radiation often increases both plant frost tolerance and surviv al under extreme high temperature conditions. Conversely, extreme temperatures sometimes influe nce the UV-B radiation sensitivity of plants directly. Plants that endure wate r deficit stress effectively are also likely to be tolerant of high UV-B flux. Biologically avai lable nitrogen is exceeding historic al levels in many regions due to human activities. Studies show that plants we ll supplied with nitrogen are generally more sensitive to UV-B radiation. Technical issues concerning th e use of biological spectral weighting functions (BSWF) ha ve been further elucidated. The BSWF, which are multiplication factors assigned to different wavelengths givi ng an indication of th eir relative biological effectiveness, are critical to the proper conduct a nd interpretation of experiments in which organisms are exposed to UV radiat ion, both in the field and in cont rolled environment facilities. The characteristics of BSWF vary considerably among different plan t processes, such as growth, DNA damage, oxidative damage and induction of changes in secondary chemicals. Thus, use of a single BSWF for plant or ecosystem response is not appropriate. This brief review emphasizes progress since the previous report toward the understand ing of solar ultraviolet radiation effects on terrestrial systems as it relates to ozone co lumn reduction and the interaction of climate change factors. Introduction Terrestrial ecosystems are undergoi ng transitions in our changing cl imate and are likely to be in flux in the coming decades and beyond. Much of th is may be attributed to direct and indirect effects of increasing temperature and CO 2. The influence of increased solar UV-B radiation is superimposed on these important drivers of our ch anging terrestrial ecosystems. Much has been learned about how plants and other organisms respond to UV radiation at the molecular and physiological levels and several studies have focused on the impli cations of inte ractions of vegetation with animals and microbes. Ecosystems are being confronted with several aspects of climate change simultaneously, resulting in intera ctive responses to environmental factors such as UV radiation, increasing temperature, CO 2, and changing precipitation patterns. Nitrogen is also considered, since biologically available nitrogen is increasing in more inhabited areas of the globe due to factors such as ai r pollution and agricultural appli cation of nitrogen. Experiments have been conducted on ag ricultural and non-agricultu ral plants in various settings (Figure 3-1). Ecosystem-level responses Predictions of ecosystem consequences of enha nced UV-B radiation are necessarily complicated because of species interactions and the way in which living organisms affect and are affected by the abiotic components of the eco system, e.g., soils, water, mineral elements, etc. Ecosystem- level effects can best be examined by direct, ma nipulative experiments c onducted in the field in intact ecosystems. Sometimes these experiments are confined to small sections of intact soil, vegetation and associated microorganisms, termed \"mesocosms\". These field studies have either Terrestrial ecosystems, increas ed solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 67 involved supplementation with UV-B-radiation-em itting lamps or attenuation of ambient solar UV-B radiation using special selective filters (Fi gure 3-1a and 3-1c). In both cases, there are appropriate control treatments to account for unintended side effect s of the structures used to effect the UV-B radiation manipulations. Global distribution of climate change factors Factors of climate change are being manifested acr oss the globe in different patterns. Elevated CO 2 is fairly evenly distributed. Significan t changes in the frequency and quantity of precipitation are also predicted at all latitudes because of climate change. With global warming the hydrological cycle will acceler ate and general increases in pr ecipitation are likely to occur.1 However, there are large departures at regional scales, such that some areas will receive considerably more and some mu ch less precipitation. Nitrogen deposition is increasingly a global issue and is particularly prominent in de nsely inhabited areas where agricultural nitrogen use and air pollution are the main contributors to the biologically available nitrogen in these ecosystems.2 The relative increases in solar UV-B radi ation and temperature are decidedly more pronounced at high latitudes a nd, accordingly, most of the mo re recent UV-B radiation experiments conducted at the ecosystem level have been at high latitudes. These have included locations in Antarctica and the southernmost tip of South America (Tierra del Fuego) and several Figure 3-1. Examples of studies of the impacts of UV-B radiation on terrestrial ecosystems. The work described in this report is based on studies that addressed the effect s of UV-B radiation manipulations on (a) intact natural ecosystems, (b) native plants, such as Gunnera magellanica and Blechnum penna-marina , (c) field crops, such as (d) soybean, (e) barley, (f) tomato, (g) the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana , and (h) several species of phytophagous as Manduca sexta . Terrestrial ecosystems, in creased solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change 68 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 Arctic and sub-Arctic locations including northern Sweden, Sval bard, and Greenland. A few of the ecosystem-level experiments have involved ma nipulation of other climate change factors in addition to UV-B radiati on, such as moisture. Direct effects on organisms Plants . Mosses, lichens, and higher plants have received most attention in assessing UV-B radiation effects on terrestrial syst ems. Photosynthesis of these pl ant groups at hi gh-latitude sites is generally unaffected, although aboveground biomass is often reduced to a small extent by UV- B radiation in various supplementa tion and attenuation experiments.3-6 Small effects on higher plant growth at high latitudes due to UV-B radiation concur with findings of many studies on plants at lower latitudes, e.g., Searls et al.7 Occasionally, large growth reductions have been reported. For example, UV radiation attenuatio n studies with potted plants in Antarctica indicated that ambient UV-B radiation caused sizeable growth reductions.8-11 Also, an endemic species of moss in Antarctica was found to have reduced levels of photoprotective pigments (compared to other widely dist ributed moss species), and curren t levels of UV radiation were reported to cause increased frequenc y of leaf morphological abnormalities.12 Among growth characteristics alte red by UV-B radiation, reductions in plant height are often reported. Even subtle decreases in plant height due to UV-B radiation might be of eventual significance if different species are affected to different degrees as was the case in ecosystem plots of a peat bog in Tierra del Fuego.5 In this study, when compared to the attenuated UV-B radiation treatment, higher plants were inhibi ted more by near-ambient solar UV-B radiation than was the moss layer. Thus, the moss could slowly engulf the higher plants; however, this would likely take several years to decades. Both supplementation and attenuation of UV-B radi ation in experimental studies may influence allocation of biomass to root systems. A fe w recent reports indicate large changes in root systems attributable to the UV-B radiation treatments aboveground, suggesting a systemic response to the radiation (Figure 3- 2). R oot mass increased with solar UV-B radiation attenuation in experime nts conducted in Greenland13 and Tierra del Fuego.14 In a similar vein, Ruhland et al.11 reported substantial increases in root mass with reduced UV-B radiation in solar UV-B radiation attenuation experime nts using potted plants in An tarctica. On the other hand, studies in Finland indicated an increase in root mass with UV-B radiation supplementation.15 The underlying mechanisms behind these seemingl y contradictory respon ses are not known but may be due in part to experimental differences. In all these cases, these were large relative changes \u2014 much larger than the relative changes in shoot mass generally reported as a result of UV-B radiation manipulations. Animals . Most vertebrate animals and insects are assumed to be well protected by body coverings (fur, feathers, etc.) and pigmentation. However, am phibians, such as frogs and salamandars are much less well protected than ot her vertebrates and considerable controversy exists regarding how much they might be aff ected by exposure to ambient UV-B radiation in their natural habitats 16-18, see Chapter 4. The UV-B radiation se nsitivity of soil insects such as the Arctic collembolan (springtail) speci es was investigated in laboratory tests.19 The species varied considerably in pigmentation which corresponded to the degree to which they are normally exposed to sunlight. These ranged fr om soil-living forms that lacked apparent pigmentation to heavily pigmented surface-dwelli ng species often exposed to the sun. The UV- B radiation sensitivity was inve rsely correlated with pigmentation and well pigmented species Terrestrial ecosystems, increas ed solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 69 were considered to be tolerant of UV-B radi ation corresponding to so lar UV-B radiation with substantially depleted ozone. Nevertheless, the author specula ted that solar UV-B radiation (especially with ozone reduction) might influence the distribution of spri ngtail species near the soil surface in heterogeneous environments. Beha vioral responses to solar UV-B radiation have been reported for thrips, a leaf-eating insect that can cause severe damage to a variety of commercially important crops. Fiel d studies demonstrated that thes e insects can detect and avoid exposure to the UV-B component of solar radiat ion, even though the natu ral background levels of solar UV-A and visible radiation contain much more energy, indicating that thrips have a sensory system with high UV-B radiation specificity.20, 21 Whether or not this sensitivity is widespread among herbivorous insects is not known, but strong effects of UV-B radiation manipulations on levels of ins ect herbivory have been documen ted in a variety of ecosystems22 and are described below. Figure 3-2. Ecosystem-level manifestations of changing the UV-B flux reaching above-ground vegetation and other surfaces. Above grou nd, higher plants are affected to a small de gree in morphology and growth, while fungi and other microbes exposed to sunlight are often affected to a greater extent. Many eff ects occur below the surface of soils or peat where no sunlight penetrates. Root mass and mycorrhizal abundance can either increase or decrease with more UV-B radiation and these changes can be much larger than changes in the plant shoot system. Alterations in microbial communities, nutrient levels and fluxes as well as microinvertebrates have also resulted from UV-B radiation changes above ground. These are probably mediated by systemic changes in higher plants and in the Sphagnum peat. Terrestrial ecosystems, in creased solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change 70 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 Microbes . Unlike most photosynthetic plants (flowe ring plants, mosses and lichens), microbes can be quite sensitive to the UV- B radiation in direct sunlight.23-26 However, this is usually not a uniform sensitivity among different species so that species composition changes are often observed on foliage and litter su rfaces where these microbes are di rectly exposed to sunlight.27-32 In the studies of Moody et al.27 and Pancotto et al.30, changes in microbial species composition were linked to differences in litter deco mposition rates resulting from UV-B radiation manipulations. Solar UV radiation can also have direct effects promoting plant litter decomposition. This process is know as photodegr adation and plays a significant role in carbon cycling in arid ecosystems33 as discussed in Chapter 5. Indirect effects of UV-B radiation Though less expected, indirect eff ects of solar UV-B radiation are usually much more important, intricate and, indeed, fascinating than the direct effects of solar UV radi ation. In addition, there is an increasing mechanistic understanding of these indirect effects that is developing as will be described later. In most cases, these effect s are mediated through the plants, but can be manifested below ground as well as above ground. Above ground As discussed in the last report22, UV irradiation of plants affect s plant disease sensitivity and development. Although few pheno menological studies of UV radi ation and plant disease have been published since the last report, there are important new developments in understanding the mechanisms of this action. In the field, plants exposed to ambient UV-B ra diation often suffer less herbivory by folivorous insects than plants cultivated under filters that specifically ex clude the UV-B component of solar radiation. This effect of solar UV-B radiation on insect herbivory was repor ted to be very large in a number of earlier studies.20, 34, 35 In some cases the negative influence of UV-B radiation on insect herbivory can be partiall y explained by direct effects of solar UV-B radiation on insect behavior.20, 21 In most cases, however, the anti-herbivor e effect of solar UV-B radiation appears to be indirect, i.e., mediated by UV-B-radiation- induced increases in plant defenses. Much has been learned concerning mechanisms of this indir ect influence on susceptibility to herbivory, as discussed later. Below ground Sunlight scarcely penetrates the soil surface, yet manipulation of UV-B radiation has been reported to have several consequences belowgrou nd in ecosystems (Figure 3- 2). In the soil, specific microbial communities live in close associ ation with roots. Rela tively few field studies have probed soil microbial changes, but recently , reports indicate severa l potentially important changes. With supplemental UV-B radiation above ground36 mycorrhizae, fungi that are associated with roots and important for plant mineral nutrition, were substantially decreased in quantity (by ca 20%). Zaller et al.14 reported a reduction in myco rrhizae in a sedge fen with solar UV-B radiation attenuation, even though root productio n had increased. Apart from mycorrhizae, other soil fungi, bacteria , and microfauna inhabit soils and participate in important ecosystem functions such as nut rient cycling (Chapter 5). UV-B radiation treatments above ground can be manifested in several changes in populations of these belowground organisms and also in some appare nt changes in the soil environment. For Terrestrial ecosystems, increas ed solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 71 example, in Greenland, although attenuating sola r UV-B radiation above ground did not affect total microbial biomass, it did result in qualitati ve changes (indicated by lipid biomarkers that reflect composition of microbial groups) in the soil microbial communities.13 In southern Finland, UV-B radiation supplementa tion led to changes in exudations from roots of two heath species growing in peatland microcosms. The two heath species reacted quite differently to the UV-B radiation supplementation treatment. The differences in root exudations were also reflected in the soil microbial biomass.15 Similar findings of alte red root exudations were reported from UV-B radiation supplementation experiments in a grassland in the United Kingdom, but only if the soil had been disturbed.37 In Antarctica, solar UV-B radiation attenuation led to an altered soil microbial comm unity and this was thought to be due to altered quantity and/or quality of root exudates.38 Root exudations are quite important, since these provide significant amounts of the energy and carbon for soil microbial communities.39 Changes in the quantity and quality of root exudations, if reflected in changes in the soil microbial function, can have important implications for so il nutrients and carbon (Chapter 5). In northern Sweden, UV-B radiation supplementation over a 5-year period with a nd without elevated CO 2 treatments were used to test soil mi crobial responses in field experiments.40 The aboveground sub-Arctic heath vegetation was not greatly affected by these treat ments. However, there were sizeable changes in bacterial community structur e due to the supplemental UV-B radiation, such as alterations in the nature of carbon use profiles, decreased microbial carbon and increased microbial nitrogen. Other studies also suggest that UV-B-radiation-indu ced changes in plant chemistry have the potential to affect the inte ractions between plants and N-fixing symbiotic bacteria, as will be discussed later. Convey et al.41 reported that near ambi ent solar UV-B radiation decreased the prevalence of a prominent soil-dwelling microarthropod species in Antarctic soils where these field studies were performed. This was more pronounced in the springt ails than the mites. Since these soil insects are not directly exposed to sola r radiation, the effect s were assumed to have been mediated by UV-B-induced changes in the vegetation. As with soil, sunlight penetrates no more th an a few millimeters into the surface of peat 42, yet many changes in the subsurface milieu of peatbogs have been found, including changes in the predominance of various microfauna (testate amoeba, rotifers, mites, and nematodes) and in the abundance and species diversity of microf ungi (Figure 3- 2). Testate amoebae consistently increased with near-ambient UV-B radiation compared to the attenuated UV-B radiation treatment, although fungal species di versity decreased only to a small degree.42-44 These changes were linked to increases in diss olved organic carbon and phosphates in the peat subsurface environment44 (Figure 3-2). Although the significan ce apparent root exudations, microbi ological and abiotic chemical changes is not known, there are important potential implications for carbon sequ estration and nutrient cycling in ecosystems (Chapter 5). Interactions between UV-B radiation and other climate change factors Several environmental factors have been shown to modify UV-B-induced responses of plants, either ameliorating or enhanci ng the UV-B radiation effect. Fu rthermore, UV-B radiation can alter the way in which plants respond to othe r factors such as temperature extremes. Terrestrial ecosystems, in creased solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change 72 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 On a global scale, CO 2 is clearly increasing rapidly and uni formly throughout the world. Other environmental variables such as temperature and UV-B radiation are increasing to various degrees at different latitudes, while water supp ly is changing in a less predictable manner. Additionally, biologically availa ble nitrogen is increasing su bstantially in many regions. Tropospheric ozone is also elevated in many regions , and some of this incr ease is the result of enhanced UV-B radiation resulting from stra tospheric ozone reduction (Chapter 6). A few studies of the interaction of elevated ozone and enhanced UV- B radiation have been conducted as discussed in the 2003 report,22 but newer studies are not available. Experiments designed to explore in teractions of these factors with UV-B radiation are useful to determine potential effects in the future. Ho wever, those experiments manipulating two or, sometimes more factors simultaneously are necessa rily more logistically difficult to conduct. Thus, most have been carried out under conditions that can depa rt from those in nature and therefore constrain how much they might represent plant responses in nature. Furthermore, most of these experiments have been co nducted with isolated plants or plots of plants rather than in intact ecosystems, and most only analyzed direct UV-B radiation effects on plants aboveground. Elevated CO 2, temperature and UV radiation One of the most interesting ques tions to be answered by interaction studies is whether increases in CO 2 and temperature can counteract negative effects of UV-B radiation, or whether synergistic or additive negative effects might occur. In our previous report, we found these synergistic effects to be rare.22 Several studies using sunlit co ntrolled environment chambers to manipulate UV-B radiation, temperature and CO 2 have been reported recently. The chambers were very useful in controlling these factors, but may have comp romised the realism in relation to field conditions due to the high UV levels employed and the removal of solar UV-A radiation by the chamber material. Koti et al.45 reported that higher temper atures and UV-B radiation, either singly or in combination, had detr imental effects on soybean flower and pollen characteristics. Elevated CO 2 by itself had a small beneficial e ffect in some s oybean varieties, but had no ameliorating effects on the decidedly detrimental effect of high temperature and high UV-B radiation on pollen morphol ogy, production, or germination. The results further suggest that these combinations of environmental factors ultimately would negatively affect fruit set and soybean yield.45 In the same type of sunlit chambers, other fact or interaction studies ha ve been conducted with cotton.46-49 Very high fluxes of UV-B radiation detrimentally a ffected leaf physiological activities such as photosynthesi s and foliage development, though this did not occur with moderate UV-B radiation levels. Elevated CO 2 enhanced growth, but did not counteract the detrimental effects of the high UV-B flux.47, 48 High temperature and UV-B radiation both reduced cotton fruit production.49 Higher temperatures increased the fraction of leaves abscising, while UV-B radiation only had an effect on absc ission in the high temperature treatment. Both higher temperatures and UV-B radi ation increased fruit fall, especially in combination. study involving the interaction of CO 2 and UV-B radiation conducted in conventional growth chambers, rather than sunlit chambers, tested potential ameliorating influence of elevated CO 2 on UV-B radiation effects for canola.50 Several physiological and morphological characteristics were assessed. For some traits such as plant height, elevated CO 2 did counteract the tendency of UV-B radiation to decrease plan t height. However, these stud ies were conducted in low-light Terrestrial ecosystems, increas ed solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 73 conditions compared with natural sunlight so their results may be difficult to extrapolate to nature. While in the above example higher temperatures could be considered detrimental, there are situations where higher temperatures facilitate physiological processes that are protective. Tropical legumes exposed to elevated UV-B radia tion were less detrimentally affected if they were simultaneously exposed to higher temperatur es. This has been a ttributed to the heat- stimulated synthesis of \"heat shock\" proteins by the plants.51 In another study, UV-B radiation increased heat tolerance considerably in cu cumber plants grown in growth chambers.52 In field studies, freezing tolerance in rhododendr on was increased by UV-B radiation exposure53 which corroborated earlier studies for this species.54 Freezing tolerance of jack pine was similarly increased by UV-B radiation and this was linked to induction of secondary compounds (phenolics) in plant tissues.55 This latter study was also conducted in growth chambers. The effect of UV-B radiation on fros t hardiness in seedlings of several conifer species from southwestern Canada was investigated under greenhouse conditions.56 Frost tolerance of four species decreased and the tolerance increased for another three species. Heat tolerance of two conifer species increased. These changes in frost and heat tolerance were only apparent if very high UV-B fluxes were employed so the applicability of these findings for conifer seedlings in nature may be limited. Drought and UV radiation In a controlled environment study, several clove r varieties were compared under combined treatments of drought and high UV-B fluxes.57 Drought and UV-B ra diation interacted a substantial compounds, including phenolics (flav onol glycosides), in drought-stressed plants. These changes were linked with somewhat improved water status of the plan ts. The authors suggested that clover varieties that are slow growing and adapte d to other stresses such as drought are more likely to be UV-B radiation tolerant. In contrast to the interactions reported by this study with clover, Turtola et al.58 conducted a greenhouse study with willows a nd found few significant interactions between water stress and UV-B radiation for various stress indicators. Howe ver, the visible light levels were exceedingly low in the greenhouse and may have compromised the realism of these results. Yang et al.59 conducted a greenhouse study using UV-B radiation s upplementation and water stress on two populations of an important shrub fr om the Tibetan Plateau of China used in land restoration efforts. The low elevation populatio n of this shrub was more sensitive to UV-B radiation than to drought and the high elevati on populations more sensitive to drought than UV- B radiation supplementation. There were also si gnificant interactions be tween these two stress factors. For example, in the high elevati on population, enhanced levels of UV-B radiation tended to somewhat alleviate the effects of dr ought on decreased plant dry mass, and increased the levels of a plant hormone (a bscisic acid) that is known to mediate plan t responses to water stress. In a field study60 in which solar UV radiation was manipulated by filters, productivity was decreased and forage quality (including nitrogen content and digestibility) increased with near- ambient UV radiation for the dominant grass spec ies in a dry, but not in a wet year. Since foliage with higher forage quality decomposes more readily, solar UV radiation and drought could reduce both grass biomass and soil organic matter for this dominant species. In another grass species, productivity decreased due to near ambient UV radiation, but only in wet years. Terrestrial ecosystems, in creased solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change 74 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 Forage quality of this species did not change. The variable responses observed among species grown under changing conditions of soil moisture av ailability and UV radiation suggest that with current solar UV radiation, as drought becomes mo re prevalent with gl obal change in the shortgrass-steppe ecosystem, the structure a nd function of this ecosystem may change substantially.60 This is one of the few studies of c limate change factors involving UV radiation that has been conducted in the field in an in tact ecosystem. However, the UV radiation manipulations included a sizeab le amount of UV-A as well as UV-B radiation removal, so the relevance for ozone depletion is limited. Current levels of solar UV radiation is playing an important role in this system, but it is not clear if an increas e in the UV-B component due to ozone depletion would enhance the UV radiation effects on grass growth and foliage quality. Nitrogen and UV-B radiation Increasing nitrogen supply to pl ants may result in additional sens itivity to UV-B radiation. The interaction of nitrogen and UV-B radiation is relevant to areas of nitrogen deposition from pollution and in agricultural areas wher e nitrogen is inte ntionally applied.2 In field experiments, supplemental UV-B radiation simulating ozone depl etion caused reduced tota l biomass, nitrogen content and specific pigment concentrati ons for a South African legume species ( Cyclopia maculata ), but the UV-B radiation effect was much more pronounced when the plants were supplied with supplemental nitrate.61 In another field study with enhanced UV-B radiation in Portugal, net photosynthesis of maize was less affected by UV-B radiation at low nitrogen supply than at high nitrogen levels. Furt hermore, with elevated UV-B radiation, the responsiveness to plant nitr ogen nutrition was decreased.62 However, shoot length of a freshwater higher plant species was reduced by hi gh fluxes of UV-B radiati on and this radiation effect was exacerbated by low nitrogen levels in the plant.63 A study with potted tree seedlings of two birch species conducted outdoors64 showed effects of different levels of UV-B radiation and nitrogen. There was no apparent growth response to supplemented UV-B radiation, but a positive growth response to greater nitrogen supp ly. Supplemental UV-B radiation did affect the phenolic constituents of the birch species, but not in a uniform manner for the two species tested. The different levels of nitrogen supply yielded a diversity of re sponses in the two birch species for both phenolics and tannins. However, there were no interactions between UV-B radiation and nitrogen levels in these responses. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation by micro-organisms in specialized nodules on plant roots is an important source of nitrogen for plants and al so for neighboring plants that do not have the capacity to form nodules. Nodulation of bean plant roots was found to be stimulated substantially by UV-B radiati on in outdoor experiments.65 This positive effect of UV-B radiation on nodulation was accomp anied by a large increase in UV-B-absorbing compounds in the root system. In contrast to the study of Pinto et al., elevated le vels of UV-B radiation decreased nodulation in some species of gr ain legumes in a study by Rajendiran et al..66 Additional studies by Chimphango et al.61, 67 did not find an effect of elevated UV-B radiation on nodulation; however, they specula ted that very high UV-B flux might inhibit nodulation. In summary, the available information suggests that increases in nitrogen supply can increase UV-B radiation sensitivity, at least in those species wh ere higher nitrogen levels result in a reduced synthesis of protective UV-absorbing compounds.61 On the other hand, moderate increases in UV-B radiation are likely to have only modest consequences on nitrogen fixation by symbiotic bacteria. Terrestrial ecosystems, increas ed solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 75 Where interactions between UV-B radiation and n itrogen supply occur, these can also modulate plant responses to other organisms. In a recent outdoor study usi ng potted grapevines, application of high levels of nitrogen together with below-am bient UV radiation modified the susceptibility of some grapevines to powdery mildew disease. This was evident in a high incidence of infection when UV-B radiation was attenuated that was related, among other plant physiological and anatomical features, to low concentrations of spec ific phenolic compounds (flavonol glycosides and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives) and less leaf wax.68 Mechanisms of plant responses to solar UV-B radiation Since our last report,22 there has been a substantial increase in understanding the mechanisms that mediate the responses of terrestrial plan ts to solar UV-B radia tion. This progress is important because it improves our ability to understand the effects of UV-B radiation on organisms and their ecological inte ractions and to devise strategi es for improving plant tolerance to UV-B radiation in species of economic interest. In addition, it also serves to highlight the importance of climate change interactions. Three generalizations about ec ophysiological impacts of UV-B ra diation have emerged from work carried out under field conditions mostly us ing natural or moderate ly-enhanced levels of UV-B radiation.3, 22 Firstly, solar UV-B radiation frequen tly has an inhibitory effect on plant growth, although this effect is generally small (<20%) and is more pronounced among herbaceous species than in woody perennials. Se condly, solar UV-B radiati on elicits a variety of acclimation responses, which typically include increased activity of antioxidant enzymes, increased DNA repair capacity, and accumula tion of phenolic compounds that serve as \"sunscreens\" or UV filters. Thirdly, plant exposure to solar UV-B radiation frequently has large effects on the interactions between plants and consumer organisms. In this section we will briefly describe some of the most recent a dvances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying some of these plant responses. Growth inhibition Growth inhibition at the whole-pl ant level often correlates with reduced leaf expansion, which appears to be more sensitive to UV-B radiat ion than photosynthesis per unit leaf area. 34, 69, 70 CO 2 assimilation (net photosynthesis) per unit leaf area is largely unaffected by solar UV-B radiation,7, 34, 70 and detailed studies have demonstrated that the integrity of part of the photosynthetic system (photosystem II) is not affect ed by ambient or moderately enhanced levels of UV-B radiation under field conditions.10, 71 In a model system, using the primary leaf of wheat to study growth reduction, Hopkins et al.72 found that leaves responded to UV-B radiation with changes in the rate and extent of cell divi sion and elongation. This resulted in a decreased and retarded elongation leading to the reduced growth observed. Reactive oxygen species . The inhibition of leaf growth by solar UV-B radiation may result from accumulation of UV-B-induced damage to ke y macromolecules and cellular structures. In living tissues, molecular oxygen may react to form reactive oxygen species (ROS), which include superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxi de, singlet oxygen and reactive nitrogen. All these molecules are potentially high ly destructive, since th ey participate in many chemical reactions with lipids, proteins and nuc leic acids resulting, for ex ample, in damage to cell membrances due to lipid peroxidation.73-75 However, recent evidence has indicated that in low concentrations they also f unction as signaling molecules (c.f. 75, 76, 77) implicated in Terrestrial ecosystems, in creased solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change 76 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 modulating normal plant development, incl uding senescence (ageing) and many other physiological processes.78 To date, much research has focu sed on these oxidant signals as well as their interrelationship with several key hor mones and stress-induced proteins. Disease and climate change factors such as increased levels of UV-B ra diation, temperature extremes, drought, and ozone can stimulate elevated amounts of ROS.79-83 UV-B radiation enhances the expression of seve ral genes involved in natural senescence phenomena84 where ROS are implicated.85, 86 Apart from their role in accelerated ageing and other developmental processes, ROS, including nitric oxide,87 also function in triggering defense mechanisms against a range of stress factors including UV-B radiation, temperature, drought, herbivore attack and disease.88-91 The increased ROS levels ar e thought to activ ate intricate signaling networks that eventua lly result in internal regulation and plant acclimation to the altered environmental conditions. In addition to ROS, the defense-rela ted growth regulators salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene have been implicated in the medi ation of plant stress to changes in UV-B radiation.92, 93 DNA damage . It is also possible that so lar UV-B radiation generates DNA damage at a rate that overburdens DNA repair mechanisms, leading to transient accumul ation of toxic DNA photoproducts. Two basic photoproducts result from the absorption of UV-B photons by DNA: the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD), which is thought to be quant itatively the most important (about 75% of the the pyrimidine ( 6-4)-pyrimidone (6-4 PP). these lesions can have toxi c and mutagenic effects and can impair DNA transcription and replication.94 Mutants that are de ficient in DNA repair mechanisms are more sensitive to UV-B radiati on than wild-type plants.95-97 The relative importance of DNA photodamage in UV-B-induced growth inhibition has been tested recently in develo ping plants. A native herb from southern Patagonia, Gunnera magellanica, was exposed to a gradient of UV-B radia tion from zero to moderate UV-B fluxes in a greenhouse study. Leaf expansion was measured as an indicator of plant growth and other techniques were used to detect damage to DNA (in the form of CPDs) and lipid peroxidation. Leaf expansion decreased and the CPD density increased with incr easing UV-B radiation, although the degree of lipid peroxidation remain ed unaffected. The highest UV-B flux induced only a transient oxidative stress. These results suggested that at UV-B fluxes within the range that G. magellanica plants experience in their natural environment, DNA damage may be a factor in growth inhibition.98 Field work in southern Patagoni a has shown that the rates of CPD repair in G. magellanica plants were modest in compar ison with other species and, under equivalent conditions, were about 50% lower than the repair rates of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana .99 This low DNA repair capacity may be one of the reasons why the midday CPD load in naturally occurring plants of G. magellanica was linearly correlated with UV-B fluxes in the hours before midday.100 Using relatively high UV-B radi ation, studies in rice add furthe r support to the idea that DNA damage in the form of CPDs may be one of the main determinants of UV-B-induced growth inhibition in plants grown under phy siologically meaningful conditions.101 This work demonstrated that there is natural variation am ong rice cultivars in DNA re pair capacity, and that slight variations in photolyase (the enzyme i nvolved in CPD repair) activity have consequences for the ability of rice plants to tolerate th e growth-inhibitory eff ects of UV-B radiation. Terrestrial ecosystems, increas ed solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 77 Growth-inhibitory effects of am bient UV-B radiation have been detected in herbaceous species of the Tierra del Fuego National Park,3 and also in the two species of vascular plants that occur in the Antarctic peninsula.9 Low DNA repair capacity may be a general feature of these species of this high-latitude region, which have evolve d under low levels of ambient UV-B radiation. Repair mechanisms may also be affected by othe r prevailing conditions when plants are exposed to UV-B radiation, for example by wa ter availability and temperature. This was demonstrated in a lichen species ( Cladonia arbuscula) , where exposure to UV-B radiation in a dried state resulted in deficient repair of DNA damage, evidenced by accumulation of CPDs. At low temperatures (2 oC) DNA damage was also not repaired even though the lichens were in a hydrated state.102 Acclimation response Under field conditions, plants generally adapt to changes in UV-B radi ation by activating an array of protective responses th at include morphological changes,34, 103 increased DNA repair capacity,97 induction of protectiv e compounds (sunscreens)7, 104-107 and increased levels of antioxidants.108 Of all the acclimation responses, the best ch aracterized is the accumulation of UV-absorbing sunscreens. These sunscreens include phenol ic compounds derived from (flavonoids and other phenylpropanoid derivatives, such as sinapate esters) that accumulate in large quantities in the vacuoles of epidermal ce lls and effectively attenua te the UV component of sunlight with minimal change in the visible region of the spectrum. Various studies have suggested that certain flavonoid compounds serv e not only a UV-screening/filtering function, but also an antioxidant function.109-111 This has been further supported by recent work.57, 112 Furthermore, those flavonoids with potential anti oxidant properties have also been reported to increase differentially in response to drought stress.113 UV-B perception and signaling in UV-B radiation acclimation . A considerable body of work has continued to reveal details of how these pr otective responses are activated when plants are exposed to UV-B radiation (Figur e 3- 3). However, our understanding of the mechanisms of UV-B response in higher plants is still fragmentary. Potential pathways of UV-B perception and signa ling have been partially characterized, largely under laboratory conditions.85, 93, 114-120 UV-B-induced patterns of gene expression have been characterized under controll ed environment conditions,121, 122 and also in field and greenhouse experiments.123-126 Changes in gene expression have b een observed in tissues not directly exposed to UV-B, implying transmission of a signa l from irradiated to non-irradiated tissues.125 One of the major gaps in our understanding of UV-B perception is that the nature of the primary UV-B photoreceptors is still not we ll defined. Data derived from the large number of research reports cited in this chapter, as well as work done in animal models, would indicate that DNA damage may act directly as a ma jor trigger of molecular UV-B ra diation response (Figure 3- 3). However, it has been known for some time that the action spectra for th e induction of several UV-B responses do not match the ac tion spectrum for DNA damage.127 In addition, several responses to UV-B radiation cannot be mitigat ed by treatments that ameliorate DNA damage117 and they are not exacerbated in mutant plants deficient in DNA damage repair.128 In a study where plants were pre-acclimated to UV-B radiation during growth,129 it was reported that the expression of a gene involved in UV screeni ng pigment induction (chalcone synthase) did not occur, although high levels of DNA damage were observed. However, without the acclimation Terrestrial ecosystems, in creased solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change 78 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 treatment, the chalcone synthase gene was st rongly activated with only low levels of DNA damage occurring. Therefore, in these cases , additional mechanisms of UV-B radiation perception and signaling have to be considered. There are several lines of evidence suggesting that plants have specific UV-B photoreceptors, analogous to the photoreceptors involved in the perception of visible light and far-red radiation (phyto-chromes, crypto-chromes, and photo-tropins) (Figure 3- 3, for a review, see Ulm and Nagy 130). How- ever, attempts to identify these receptors using photophysio-logical techniques and, more recently, genetic approaches with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana , have met with little success. A recent study 119 led to the characterization of the first UV-B-specific signaling pathway, which is regulated by the protein UVR8 and controls the expression of numerous genes involved in UV-B protection and acclimation. The list of genes regulated by UVR8 includes mo st of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids (protective pigments), the gene encoding CPD photol yase, PHR1 (which is essential for repair of UV-B-induced DNA damage), and genes concerned with protection against oxidative stress and photooxidative damage. A combin ation of molecular and genetic approaches has established that the transcription factor, HY5, is a key downstream effector of the UVR8 pathway. UVR8 regulates transcript leve ls of HY5 specifically in response to UV-B, and HY5 in turn regulates the expression of a substantial number of ge nes involved in UV protection. Previous work 122 has demonstrated that the effects of low levels of UV-B on the expression of a subset of genes Figure 3-3. Mechanisms of plant response to solar UV-B radiation. Three general effects of solar UV-B on plants have been documented in field experiments: Growth inhibition (e.g., reduced leaf area e xpansion), acclimation (e.g. increased accumulation of UV-absorbing sunscreens), an d alteration of plant interactions with organisms at other trophic levels (e.g., increased plant resistance to leaf-eating insects). Some of these responses can be di rectly linked to effects of solar UV-B on key cellular components (e.g., DNA lesions caused by UV-B photons may have inhibitory effects on plant growth). Other responses are triggered by the activation of intricate signaling networks that involve a number of signaling elements, in some instances including a UV-B-specific regula tory protein (UVR8), and in others, ROS and defense-related hormones, such as salicylic acid and jasmonic acid. Some of the signaling components appear to be shared by response circuits that are activated by a diverse group of environmental stressors (e.g., UV-B, drought, herbivory, etc.). Activation of overlapping signaling casca des by different stressors results in overlapping gene expression patterns and convergent physiological responses. Elucidation of these mechanisms will facili tate the understanding of the interactive effects of solar UV-B radiation and other environmental factors on plant growth and ecological relationships. Terrestrial ecosystems, increas ed solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 79 required HY5, but was independent of previously described photorec eptors. At present there is growing consensus that UVR8 HY5 orches trate specific acclimation responses to UV-B radiation; however, the photoreceptor and ear ly signaling components th at are activated by UV- B radiation and eventually engage the UVR8 pathway remain to be elucidated. For some effects of UV-B radiation on plants , a significant overlap has been documented between cellular responses activ ated by UV-B radiation and other environmental stress factors, such as tropospheric ozone, pathogen, and herbiv ore attack. This overlap has been evidenced by the occurrence of convergent patterns of gene expression (e.g.(Izagui rre, 2003 #68;S\u00e4venstrand, 2002 #139}) activating of common signaling components (e.g., Holley et al.131, reviewed in Stratmann115), and induction of similar defense molecules and secondary metabolites.132 A possible explanation for this overlap is based on the activation of common signaling intermediates, such as ROS and defense-related growth regulators, as indicated in Figure 3-3. Another possibility, at least in the case of overlaps between responses elicited by UV-B radiation and attack by herbivorous insects, could be the activation of common cell surface receptors by UV-B radiation and insect elicit ors, as hypothesized by Stratmann115(Figure 3-3). Current experiments directed to tes ting this hypothesis will impr ove our understanding of the mechanisms of UV-B radiation effects on plants, and provide novel insights into the problem of increasing UV-radiation tolerance and resistance to insect pests in cu ltivated species. The existence of overlapping signaling components leading to a response may have important functional implications, because environmental stre sses are seldom experienced by the plant in isolation. Plant interactions with consumer organisms UV-B rad iation and plant-animal interactions . Plant exposure to solar UV-B radiation frequently results in a reduction in the level of insect herbivory (Figure 3-4 and reviewed in22, 133, 134). Recent studies show that this anti-herbivore effect i nduced by UV-B radiation correlates with a significant overlap be tween gene expression patterns induced by UV-B radiation and wounding under controlled environmental conditions.121, 123 Components of signaling cascades that are activated by wounding and herbivor y are also activated by UV-B radiation.131 Furthermore, a number of plant products typicall y associated with anti-herbivore defenses, such as defense-related proteins (e.g., proteinase inhibitors), and phenolic compounds (e.g., chlorogenic acid), accumulate in la rger quantities in plants exposed to UV-B radiation than in plants receiving no UV-B radiation.118, 135 The increases in defense -related compounds in plants exposed to UV-B radiation correlate with a lower fo rage quality in tissues from these plants, as evaluated using insect growth bioassays (e.g.,123, 136). Behavioral bioassays have also shown that exposure to solar UV-B radiation can induce change s in the plants that reduce the attractiveness of the plants to female adu lts at the time of oviposition.137 This effect of solar UV-B radiation may have important effects on insect herbi vory under field conditions by controlling the distribution of plant-feed ing larvae within the canopy. UV-B radiation and pathogens . Severity of pathogen attack play s a determining role in plant productivity in the field and greenhouses, and studies have shown that many environmental factors modify both pathogen and plant response. Apart from precipitation patterns, temperature, and time of day, UV radiation can also be a modi fying factor. Recent work from a field study indicated that species diversity was affected by solar UV-B radiati on because of species-specific sensitivity to the radiation.31 Besides the potential damaging e ffects of UV radiation, it also may play a role as a light signal for many pro cesses of plant pathogen development (see 134). UV-Terrestrial ecosystems, in creased solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change 80 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 radiation effects may influence pathogen development either directly or indirectly, the latter as a consequence of UV-induced bioche mical changes, which are reflected in interactions between pathogen and host (for reviews see 138, 139). The initial events and signaling mechanisms underlying these interactions are complex, and will be briefly discussed below. There have been several reports showing that UV radiation may either decrease or increase fungal attack (see 138). These attacks depend on many interacting factors such as temperature, light, time of day and humidity as well as on plant morphology and genetic background. 31, 68, 134, 138 UV-B radiation and pathogen infection trigger both specifically targeted defense responses as well as initiating crosstalk between signaling pathways. 140, 141 For example, the pathogen defense may result in repression of the UV protective flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. 140 In the latter study it was shown that specific genes were activated by UV-B radiation and subsequently repressed by the pa thogen elicitor, demonstrating interaction between two specific signaling cascades, whereby the pathogen signal was perceived as the more important in plant defense and survival. 140 Thus, overlap between abiotic and biotic signaling suggests mutual interactions and response to different external pressures. Induction of the so-called pathogene sis-related proteins (PR protei ns) is another example of the complexity of plant response to UV-B radiation a nd other environmental fact ors. These proteins are found in many plants, not only in response to UV-B radiation117, 142, 143, but also after fungal, bacterial, or viral attack as we ll as after exposure to certain or ganic chemicals or heavy metals.144 The signal transduction pathway for the synthe sis of these PR proteins induced by UV-B radiation is not yet fully eluc idated and there appears to be crosstalk among different communication pathways when the plant is exposed to multiple stresses such as pathogens and UV-B radiation. A recent example of a PR pr otein induced by UV-B radi ation is the enzyme, - 1,3-glucanase I (\u00dfGlu I) 117, a protein widely found in seed plan ts, involved also in developmental plant processes.145 A laboratory study conducted with beans ( Phaseolus vulgaris ) indicated that the induction of the PR protein, Glu I, was correlated with photoreversible DNA damage, which has not been reported for other PR protein fam ilies. In addition, the results implicate the DNA damage (seen as CPD formation) as a key play er in the signaling pathway resulting in the induction of Glu I by UV-B radiation (Figure 3- 3). The plant response to UV-B radiation and subsequent induction of the PR protein, Glu I, were found to be local rather than systemic (the Figure 3-4. An example of effects of solar UV-B radiation on insect herbivory in the field. The graph shows the effect of attenuating the UV-B component of solar radiation on the intensity of insect herbivory by thrips (a piercing-sucking insect) in soybean crops, and leaf beetles (chewing insects) in plants of the common annual weed Datura ferox (original data in21, 36). The marked effects of solar UV- B radiation on leaf damage and insect population density are proportionally much larger than any reported effects of solar UV-B radiation on plant growth and morphology. Terrestrial ecosystems, increas ed solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 81 latter where the whole plant rather than a localized area would be affected by a stress). Studies concerned with unraveling the co mplex internal plant pathways of communication are important for our understanding of the consequences of interactions between UV- B radiation and other stress factors, especially thos e related to climate change a nd modern agricultural practices. Technical issues in conducting and evaluating UV-B radiation research Biologically effective UV radiation Biological spectral weighting functions (BSWFs) are factors assigned to different wavelengths indicating their relative biological effectiveness and these f unctions have been developed for a number of different plant pro cesses. BSWFs have played a prominent role in the ozone reduction issue. Their uses have included pred icting the relative increment of \"biologically effective\" UV radiation for a given increment in ozone depletion, evaluating latitudinal and elevational gradients of so lar UV radiation, and calculati ng how much supplemental UV radiation to supply in experime nts with UV-B-emitting lamps. A single BSWF cannot be expected to apply to multiple plant responses or to be necessarily appropriate for all plant species, much less to gene ralize to other trophic le vel effects. In our report four years ago22 we introduced new work showing a BSWF for plant growth / mass allocation effects which extended into the UV-A wa velengths with substantial effectiveness. This weighting function was developed in the la boratory with seedlings of cultivated oat146 and was subsequently validated in the field for this species.147 The importance of UV-A radiation in causing plant responses has been confirmed by other recent studies.82, 148-150 For example, the production of singlet oxygen, one of the two ma jor representatives of damaging ROS, is produced more effectively by UV-A than by UV-B radiation.82 Specifically, UV-A wavelengths were twice as effective as UV- B wavelengths for inducing singlet oxygen. This is unique as BSWFs for damage to other plant processes t ypically show a marked decline toward longer wavelengths. Evaluating weighting functions There have been only a few attempts during the 1980's and 1990's to evaluate alternative BSWFs under polychromatic radiation conditions.151 Many difficulties exist in evaluating BSWFs. In many locations, filtered-sunlight experiments produce insufficient effects to yield consistently measurable differences between different wavele ngth treatments. For example, even with the high UV fluxes of Arizona, USA (33 N), a dose of >70% of ambient UV-B radiation was typically needed before consis tent statistically significant e ffects were seen in cotton and sorghum.152 However, in most cases, it is likely that experiments combining modulated UV lamp supplementation with different treatments of UV-filtered sunlight will be necessary to continue testing BSWFs in th e field. The total UV radiant flux removed in UV radiation- attenuation studies is consider ably greater than the added UV radiation in lamp-supplementation studies. However, when treatments are weight ed using BSWFs, the changes in biologically effective radiation in the lamp-s upplementation studies may be grea ter or equal to that removed by the UV-B exclusion treatment. The relationship between filter and lamp treatments depends on the BSWF employed. Rousseaux et al. 106 compared treatments using filters and lamps for lettuce and oat in a field experiment where pa rticular care was taken to insure similar microenvironmental conditions among all treatm ents. Overall, when comparing the two treatment methods, plant growth and allocation changes followed a pattern similar to a plant Terrestrial ecosystems, in creased solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change 82 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 DNA damage spectrum,153 emphasizing the importance of ra diation in the UV-B to UV-A transition zone. Responses of UV-absorbing co mpounds suggested less of an effect of these longer wavelengths, approaching in stead a response predicted by the generalized plant response function.154 The spectral dependence for induction of UV-absorbing pigments was also examined in the cultivated oat in a lamp/filter experiment and sorghum, pepper and kochia in a UV-attenuation experiment.155 Despite the very different experiment al UV fluxes, a BSWF extending into the UV-A waveband with moderate effectiveness was mo st representative of the observed results for the four species. The plant DNA damage spectra153 and a new flavonol induction BSWF with similar spectral response148 were the most appropriate of the five BSWFs evaluated.155 Implications of using different BSWFs This increasing evidence that plant BSWFs in clude significant UV-A radiation responses has substantial implications for the design and inte rpretation of experiments investigating plant response to ozone depletion. Best known among the uses of BSWFs is the calculation of radiation amplification f actors (RAFs). They have been used to compare the effects of current levels of UV radiation with scenarios of ozone depletion. For small changes in ozone the RAF is the increment of effect (biological or chemical) resulting from a 1% ozone depletion increment. Thus a RAF of 1 would indicate a 1% increase in response. (Note in Chapter 1, only the erythemal spectrum is used as a weighting func tion. This spectrum has a RAF of 1.2 at high sun elevations. Erythema is the sunburn response of human skin.) The orig inal generalized plant response function154 has a RAF calculated at 1.6, while the RAF of the new growth / mass allocation BSWF is 0.2 for the same conditions.156 This means that, if we accept the new plant growth BSWF in place of the generalized plan t response, the effects anticipated under a given level of ozone reduction will be smaller than with the BSWF based on the generalized plant response. Spectra such as those of Quaite et al.153 and Ibdah et al.148 would be intermediate, as they have greater RAFs than the new plant growth / mass allocation BSWF but a lower RAF than the generalized plant response. Choice of BSWF will also have a bearing on expe rimental simulation of ozone depletion using UV emitting lamps. This stems from several factors, but is primarily due to the substantial effect of short wavelengths from the lamps in providi ng biologically effective irradiance when the original generalized plant response154 is used. The new BSWF weights these short-wavelength supplements proportionately less, and the lamps co mmonly used produce very little of the longer wavelengths in this BSWF. In fact, when simu lating ozone depletion in the field, the racks of lamps may result in more shading of these longer wavelengths from the sun than they generate.157 If we accept the new BSWF as appropriate, we have simulated a much lower level of ozone depletion in past experiments than was intended. These implications extend to controlled environments and greenhouses (or sunlit field chambers that do not transmit UV radiation). \"Controls\" in these situations, rather than receiv ing ambient UV radiation, often receive little UV, especially at shorter wavelengths. If the new BSWF is correct, these \"controls\" are even further removed from ambient UV radiati on levels than had been previously assumed. In fact, even \"treatment\" UV le vels, when weighted with this new BSWF in greenhouses or controlled environments, may be below ambient UV radiation levels! This issue is worthy of further quantitative evaluation. Terrestrial ecosystems, increas ed solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 83 The uncertainties in plant BSWFs remain significan t, but may be addressed by new experimental approaches. Values of RAF are sensitive to the range of wavelengths considered in their calculation, especially the longest wavelength where the weighting function terminates, which is usually in the UV-A region.158 It is often difficult to dete rmine biological response to longer wavelengths, thus adding additi onal uncertainty. Equipment such as the free electron laser (FEL), has considerable potential to enhance our ability to reso lve weighting functions in the UV-A waveband.159 In the field, plant characteristics that are infl uenced by UV-B radiation would be expected to change along latitudinal or eleva tion gradients in parallel with changes in biologically weighted irradiance. Theoretically, this would provide an opportunity to te st different spectral weighting functions. An elevation gradient of UV-ab sorbing compound concentration in beech was described by Neitzke and Therburg.160 There were higher concentrations with increasing elevation, and these concentra tions correlated significantly with erythemally weighted UV radiation. However, they did not compare the re lative increase in pigments with UV radiation weighted with other BSWFs. Als o, for a discriminating te st of BSWFs, it would be useful if the spectral distribution along the gr adient changed appreciably. These techniques provide routes to resolving plant BSWFs further. However, in the meantime, reporting of UV doses calculated from se veral different BSWFs is recommended.161 This permits retrospective evaluation of experiment s as more understanding of organism spectral responses develops. UV dose-response relationships above and below ambient solar flux A comparison of UV radiation-attenuation and supplementation approaches also begs the question of the nature of the plant response pa ttern to increasing UV-B radiation, i.e., the dose- response relationship. If biological responses exhibit an apparent saturation, the same increment of biologically effective UV radiation will exert less effect at higher UV fluxes, such as in supplementation experiments. Coleman and Day152 tested the dose-response relationship in their UV radiation-attenuation experiments and did not see evidence of saturation as the UV radiation approached ambient levels. Newsham et al.162 also did not find a saturation near ambient UV radiation in their Antarctic experiments. Ho wever, neither study combined the graded UV attenuation treatments with UV supplementation to test the dose-response relationship above ambient UV radiation. Thus, this issue remains to be resolved. Concluding remarks and gaps in knowledge Since our last report22, there have been substantial advanc es in our understanding of the effects of UV-B radiation on terrestrial ecosystems, especial ly in the elucidation of mechanisms of plant response. A further area of highly interesting research emphasizes the importance of indirect UV radiation effects on plants, pathogens, herbivores , soil microbes and ecosystem processes below the surface. What was once considered the essence of understanding terrestrial ecosystem responses to ozone column re duction, namely reductions in pl ant photosynthesis and production, is now superseded by a much more complex pict ure of indirect UV radi ation effects, trophic level interplay, and microbial part icipation in ecosystem function. Enticing questions remain regarding the extent to which systemic chemical and physical changes in vegetation induced by UV-B radiation affect belowground systems. This includes roots and closely associated microoranisms and micr obial communities beyond the immediate root Terrestrial ecosystems, in creased solar ultraviolet radiation, and interactions with climate change 84 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 microenvironment with ramifications for soil pro cesses such as nutrient cycling. These changes in the belowground system are apparently mediated by the vegetation. It is recognized that well replicated field studies are highly important to re alistically evaluate eff ects altered UV radiation. There is a particular paucity of field studies investigating the inte ractions of altered UV radiation combined with changes in other climate change f actors, at least in part owing to the technical difficulties in conducting such studies. Much has been learned about mechanisms of UV-B radiation action in plants and how resultant changes interact with ecologi cally important processes such acclimation, growth inhibition, plant-animal and interactions. A more detailed unders tanding of how UV-B radiation modifies gene expressi on and resultant systemic change s in plant characteristics is needed and will be useful in elucidating ecosystem -level changes. Research on the intricate and sometimes overlapping network of signaling pa thways induced by UV radiation and other stimuli, such as pathogen attack, is important to understand why these sometimes overlap and sometimes counteract one another. Seemingly arcane technical issues, such as whic h are the most relevant biological spectral weighting functions, count heavily in the conduc t and evaluation of experiments designed to assess plant and ecosystem response to UV radiat ion changes. Thus, further refinement and testing of BSWF are of considerable priority.

Solar UV radiati on penetrates to ecological significant depths in aquatic systems and can affect both marine and freshwater systems from major biomass producers (phytoplankton) to consumers (e.g., zoopl ankton, fish, etc.) higher in the food web. Many factors influence the depth of penetrati on of radiation into natural waters including dissolved organic compounds whose concentration and chemical composition are likely to be influenced by future climate and UV radiation variability. There is also considerable evidence that aquatic species utilize many mechanisms for photoprotection against excessive radiation. Often, these protective mechanisms pose conflicting selection pressures on species making UV radiation an additional stressor on the organism. It is at the ecosystem level where assessments of anthropogenic climate change and UV-related effects are interrelated and where much recent research as has been directed. Several studi es suggest that the influence of UV-B at the ecosystem level may be more pronounced on community and trophic level structure, and hence on subsequent biogeochemical cycles, than on biomass levels per se. Introduction Aquatic ecosystems are key components of the Earth's biosphere.1 They produce more than 50 % of the biomass on our planet (Figure 4-1) and incorporate at least the same amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide as terrestrial ecosystems (cf. Chapter 5). The primary producers in freshwater and marine ecosystems constitute th e basis of the intricate food webs, providing energy for the primary and secondary consumers and are thus important contributors for the production of the human staple diet in the form of crustaceans, fish, and mammals derived from the sea. Solar UV can negatively affect aquatic organisms. 2-4 The massive loss of stratospheric ozone over Antarctica over the past two decades as well as ozone depletion over the Arctic and high to mid latitudes have aroused concern about the effects of increased solar UV-B radiation on marine and freshwater ecosystems. 5 Clear lakes and oceans in alpine and polar regions, Effects of solar UV radiation on aquatic ecos ystems and interactions with climate change 96 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 where UV penetrates deep into the water column, may be particularly vulnerable. The biological organisms in polar waters are even more at risk because of the limited repair capabilities under the inhibitory effects of low temperatures. 6 Figure 4-1. This false-color map represents the Earth' s carbon \"metabolism\"\u2014 the rate at which plants absorbed carbon out of the atmosphere during the years 2001 and 2002. The map shows the global, annual average of the net productivity of vegetation on on land and in the ocean. Th e yellow and red areas show the highest rates, ranging from 2 to 3 kilograms of carbon taken in per square kilometer per year. The green areas are intermediate rates, while blue and purple shades show progressively lower productivity. In any given year, tropical rainforests are generally the most productive places on Earth. Still, th e ongoing productivity near the sea's surface, over such a widespread area of the globe, makes the ocean more pr oductive than the land. (Image courtesy of NASA, 2003). Solar UV Radiation and Penetration in Aquatic Ecosystems A growing number of stations and networks have shown that there has been an increase in solar UV-B radiation at the surface of and within aquatic systems7-10 which corresponds with stratospheric ozone depletion.11 Comparative measurements indicate continued increases in solar UV-B, which are masked by much larger seasonal changes and geographic differences (cf. Chapter 1). 12 Instrument accuracy has been improved in recent years and measurement deviations have been quantified.13 In addition, biological and chemical actinometers have been developed to determine UV-B doses on site during experiments and exposure.14-17 Aquatic environments vary tremendously in their UV attenuation. Coastal areas and shallow continental shelf waters have a lower transparency than open ocean waters due to the runoff of silt and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from shores. In open oceans the optical properties are largely determined by plankton and their degradation products, 18-20 with zooplankton being an additional source of DOC.21 Owing to the high input of inorga nic and decaying organic material, freshwater ecosystems usually have a high UV absorption which also depends on their level of eutrophication. 22 Effects of solar UV radiation on aquatic ec osystems and interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 97 Ozone and aerosols provide the primary filter in the atmosphere that reduces damaging UV radiation before it reaches the Earth's surface. While stratospheric ozone depletion has now stabilized and is beginning to return to pre-Montreal Protocol levels (see Chapter 1), the UV transparency of inland aquatic ecosystems remains highly variable and subject to increased UV exposure due to climate change. 23 Climate change alters the DOC concentration and hence the UV transparency of inland waters. Warmer, drier climates in particular will reduce the inundation and water saturation of soils within watersheds and hence reduce the inputs of DOC to adjacent lakes and streams. 23 In some cases a combination of acidification and climate change has led to dramatic increases in underwater UV penetration23 (see Chapter 5). The impact of climate change may be particularly pronounced in freshwater ecosystems with low DOC concentrations due to the exponential increase in UV penetration at DOC concentrations below 2 mg L -1 (Figure 4-2). Such variable levels of DOC and hence UV exposure may be important factors in determining the distribution and abundance of planktonic and shallow benthic organisms as well as influence the spawning depth of vertebrates such as amphibians and fish that lay their eggs in shallow surface waters. Climate warming has been found to increase eutrophication in boreal lakes. 24 In addition, the export of DOC from boreal peatlands increases with temperature. Since these areas cover about 15 % of the boreal and subarctic regions and climate warming is forecast to be most severe at high latitudes, the increasing temperatures are expected to have significant effects in boreal areas. 25 Phytoplankton abundance may vary by orders of magnitude driven by future climate-DOM-UV radiation interactions. 26 Other aquatic ecosystems also show that CDOM (colored dissolved organic material) is a mediator of climate-UV interactions. 26 Global warming has not only the potential to affect lake species compositions, 27 but also to increase the invasion potential by imported species.28 Besides inorganic particulate matter, dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) are the main attenuating substances in freshwater and coastal marine waters.29 DOC concentrations often show large spatial and temporal variability.30 Recent models analyzing the absorption of the components show that DOC mainly attenuates UV-B radiation while POC mainly decreases the UV-A radiation in the water column. 31 The optical effects of zooplankton and phytoplankton on UV attenuation in freshwater ecosystems are usually low,32 but bacterioplankton plays a major role (cf. Chapter 5). While DOC is only slowly degraded in the water column, it is readily fragmented by solar UV to smaller subunits, 33 which are consumed by 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 160 5 10 15DOC (mg/l)Depth of 1% UV-B (m) . Figure 4-2. Relationship between the depth to which 1% of surface 320-nm UV radiation penetrates and concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in temperature lakes. Note that at low DOC concentrations (1 -2 mg L -1) very small changes in the amount of DOC can cause large changes in th e depth to which UV penetrates. Modified from.23 Effects of solar UV radiation on aquatic ecos ystems and interactions with climate change 98 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 bacterioplankton.34 This increases the UV transparency of the water column35 where the resulting deeper UV-B penetration affects bacteria and other organisms.36 In addition, photobleaching increases UV transparency. Increasing temperatures associated with global climate change are generally expected to decrease DOM concentrations and thus increase the penetration of UV-B radiation into the water. 37 DOC is a source of dissolved CO 2 in the water,38, 39 and pCO 2 is closely related to the DOC concentration in Swedish boreal lakes.40 Acidification also decreases DOC concentrations.41, 42 Depending on its concentration, DOC can have positive or negative effects on phytoplankton growth. Low concentrations contribute to nutrient recycling (N and P)43 and availability, while higher concentrations negatively affect phytoplankton growth by shading.44 Bacteria are the main agents for the mineralization of N and P from DOC. In addition to biomineralization, phototransformation alters biodegradation to a variable degree, depending on the source of DOC. 45 Arctic and Antarctic marine and freshwater ecosystems are additionally affected by snow and ice cover. Even thin layers of snow or ice significantly decrease the penetration of solar UV. 46 Earlier ice melting due to increased temperature will expose phytoplankton blooms to higher solar UV radiation. The seasonal change in sea-ice cover is a major determinant of the Antarctic aquatic ecosystem. In addition, glacial meltwater plumes play a critical role near the ice edge and their influence extends more than 100 km into the open ocean and influences the biota by water column stratification, changes in turbidity, salinity and temperature. 47 Global warming at higher latitudes may lead to shallower mixed-layer depth, more intense seasonal stratification with shallower mixed layers and subsequent influence on UV impact on aquatic ecosystems. Plankton Plankton can be subdivided, based on physiological or taxonomic criteria into major groups of bacterioplankton, phytoplankton (including cya nobacteria and eukaryotes) and zooplankton.48 In aquatic ecology, size (on a logarithmic scale) is used as a subdivision criterion: femtoplankton (0.02 - 0.2 \u00b5m), picoplankton (0.2 - 2 \u00b5m), na noplankton (2 - 20 \u00b5m), microplankton (20 - 200 \u00b5m) and macroplankton (200 - 2000 \u00b5m). Even though the smallest organisms contribute a significant share to aquatic biomass productivity, these taxa have not yet been studied extensively in terms of UV sensitivity. Bacterioplankton and Viruses Although the bacteria are small in size, they contribute a significant biomass component in aquatic ecosystems and play a key role in biogeochemical processes. 49 Predation is the major mortality factor for planktonic bacteria.50 Most bacterioplankton do not produce screening pigments but overcome solar radiation stress by fast cell division and effective repair mechanisms. 51 As long as the repair keeps up with the damage, the population is not threatened; but when CPDs (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers) accumulate under high solar radiation, the population decreases. CPDs constitute by far th e most frequent DNA damage induced by UV-B, followed by single- and double-strand breaks. 52, 53 DNA damage correlates strongly with the penetration of UV radiation into the water column, and UV-B has a stronger effect than UV-A. When bacterioplankton was exposed in UV-transparent Effects of solar UV radiation on aquatic ec osystems and interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 99 bags in tropical coastal waters, DNA damage was detectable down to 5 m. However, inhibition of leucine and thymidine incorporation, as markers for protein and DNA synthesis, respectively, occurred to a depth of 10 m. 54 Photorepair by the enzyme photolyase, using UV-A/blue light as an energy source,55 is a major mechanism to reduce the CPD load.4 Alternatively CPDs can be repaired by nucleotide excision repair.56 Because of the path length of penetration, size seems to be a decisive factor for UV sensitivity: bacterioplankton from several boreal lakes in Canada were more sensitive to solar UV than the larger phytoplankton. 57 Phytoplankton density significantly influences the depth distribution of bacterioplankton in the water column. During the summer, dense diatom phytoplankton populations develop in the Antarctic waters off the British Rothera Station, causing strong UV attenuation in the top layers. 58 At the surface, bacterioplankton incurred large UV-B-induced DNA damage (exceeding 100 CPDs per megabase pairs, Mbp), but it was protected from solar UV-B below the diatom population. This phenomenon was particul arly prominent during January and February, when sea ice melting cause pronounced stabilization of the water column. Later in the season, this effect weakened and DNA damage was hom ogeneously distributed throughout the top 10 m in well-mixed waters. Solar UV has a decisive role in bacterioplankton community structure in marine surface waters. 59 Large differences in sensitivity were found between different samples from the northern Adriatic Sea. When exposed to UV-B radiation, inhi bition of amino acid incorporation varied substantially and there were even larger differences in the efficiency of recovery between species. In Antarctic marine bacteria UV-B a nd UV-A had similar negative effects on survival. 60 In contrast, in a high mountain lake (Spain) UV-A exerted the main effect.61 In the upwelling zones of the Humboldt Current System, PAR induced a significant inhibition of bacterial productivity followed by UV-A and UV-B.62 Both in the Arctic and Antarctic, spores of Bacillus subtilis were inactivated by solar radiation within hours. However, a covering of ca. 500 \u00b5m of soil or dust or a retreat of ~1 mm into endolithic habitats prevented inactivation of the spores. 63 Snow covers of 5 - 15 cm thickness attenuated UV penetration by a factor of 10 and pr otected the spores from inactivation. Crust formation and biofilms are additional protective measures against environmental factors including desiccation, temperature changes and solar UV. 64 Halobacteria, being Archaea, show a much higher resistance to solar UV radiation than bacteria and even tolerate UV-C radiation,65 reflecting the tolerance of shorter wavelengths penetrating through the atmosphere during early evolution of these organisms. At present UV-C does not reach the Earth surface - except high mountain locations - due to complete absorption in the atmosphere. Another decisive factor for bacterial communities is the concentration of viruses. 66 Virus-to- bacteria ratios were found to be lowest in freshwater lakes and highest in saline lakes. The viral abundance was closely correlated with the concentration of DOC. Viruses have neither effective sunscreens nor photorepair capabilities 67 and are prone to solar UV damage.68 This is supported by their seasonal abundance in central European lakes.69 However, while being sensitive to solar UV, it is surprising that the presence of viruses can provide some protection from solar UV to their phytoplankton hosts such as Phaeocystis ; the reason for this unexpected phenomenon is not known. 70 Anthropogenic pollutants such as cosmetic sun screens increase the abundance of viral particles in the water.71 Effects of solar UV radiation on aquatic ecos ystems and interactions with climate change 100 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 Picoplankton Unicellular picophytoplankton such as Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus are recognized as ubiquitous organisms of oceanic microbial loops and as the most abundant marine primary producers.72 The effects of ambient levels of solar radiation on oceanic picoplankton were studied in the water column73 using the range from unattenuated radiation to 23 % of the surface level. The radiation significantly increased cell death in Prochlorococcus, while the cyanobacterium Synechococcus had ten times the survival rate. Removal of UV radiation strongly reduced the cell death rate in the first species and eliminated it completely in Synechococcus . Natural solar radiation decreased the half-life times of the cells to a little over a day. A similar differential sensitivity of the two groups was found for Mediterranean ecotypes. 74 This generally high sensitivity of picoplankton to ambient solar radiation may act as a primary driver of species composition and population structure and govern the dynamics of the microbial food web in clear oceanic waters. 73 Natural levels of solar UV-B have been determined in the Red Sea using a DNA biodosimeter.75 In parallel, depth profiles of DNA damage were analyzed in plankton samples that had been collected from the water column down to 50 m. While the dosimeter did not show any response below 15 m, CPD DNA damage could be found in all plankton samples. CPD concentrations increased during the day and decreased over night , indicating DNA repair, but the dark repair processes did not remove all CPDs during the ni ght. Exposure to UV-B increases the membrane permeability as shown in Nannochloropsis , which decreases the nitrogen uptake capability. 76 Cyanobacteria During the early Precambrian era, fluxes of solar UV-B and UV-C at the surface of the Earth were several-fold higher than today due to the lack of oxygen in the atmosphere and the consequent absence of ozone in the stratosphere (cf. Chapter 1). Early evolution was therefore limited to UV-protected aquatic habitats. Nonetheless, there was a strong selection for protective and mitigating strategies of early organisms against solar UV radiation. 77, 78 The early UV screens in aqueous environments may have been simple aromatic organic molecules, which later developed into specialized UV absorbers still found in cyanobacteria as well as in some eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms. 77 Cyanobacteria are major biomass producers both in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and represent more than 50 % of the biomass in many aquatic ecosystems. 77 Because of their nitrogen-fixing capacity they serve as important fertilizers both in the sea and in terrestrial plant habitats such as tropical rice fields. Some cyanobacteria produce highly toxic substances, including neurotoxins and peptide hepatotoxins, which cause animal poisoning in many parts of the world 79 and pose considerable risks for human health by polluting drinking water reservoirs and recreational areas.80 In the Baltic Sea the filamentous Nodularia forms extended blooms in late summer during calm weather.81 These organisms are tolerant of ambient solar UV-B levels and outcompete more sensitive organisms even though solar UV-B has increased by 6 - 14 % over the last 20 years in this area. 82 Recent studies show that UV-B radiation treatment results in a wide range of responses at the cellular level, including motility, protein biosynt hesis, photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation and survival in cyanobacteria.83, 84 The molecular targets include DNA and the photosynthetic apparatus.85, 86 The phycobiliproteins, which serve as solar energy harvesting antennae, are Effects of solar UV radiation on aquatic ec osystems and interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 101 specifically bleached by UV radiation.87, 88 However, several studies have demonstrated an adaptation to UV stress and an increased resistance.89, 90 Long-term exclusion of solar UV decreased the photosynthetic competence.91 Adaptive mutagenesis, which has been found in cyanobacteria, increases their resistance to UV-B.92 Additional stress by exposure to heavy metal ion pollutants adds to the UV-B effect.93, 94 Recent studies show that UV-B radiation treatment results in a wide range of responses at the level of the cell. On the molecular level UV exposure causes a wide range of responses. It induces an increased Ca2+ influx via L-type calcium channels.95 The stress signal is subsequently amplified and transmitted using cyclic nucleotides as secondary messengers96 followed by the production of shock proteins. UV- B treatment increased the concentration of 493 proteins out of 1350 at least threefold in the terrestrial species, Nostoc commune .97 In addition to direct UV-B-induced damage to the DNA, oxidative stress (singlet oxygen and superoxide radicals) and damage were re ported, causing lipid peroxidation and DNA strand breakage.98 After prolonged UV-B exposures an adaptation to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress has been observed.98 Typical ROS quenchers such as ascorbic acid, N-acetyl-L- cysteine or sodium pyruvate have protective effects.99, 100 Protective and mitigating strategies of cyanobacteria include mat or crust formation,101 vertical migration of individuals within the mat, or shelf shading due to changes in morphology as observed in Arthrospira platensis. 102 In microbial mats the surface layer often serves as a protector for the organisms underneath. A mat in a high Arctic lake showed high concentrations of photosynthetic pigments in the lower part of the mat, while the black top layer was rich in scytonemins and MAAs. 103 By producing UV-absorbing substances including MAAs and/or scytonemins, many cyanobacteria are able to withstand excessive solar UV radiation.104-106 MAAs are water-soluble compounds and have absorption maxima in the range from 310 to 360 nm. 77 Upon absorption of UV radiation MAAs form triplet states which thermally relax and thus render the radiation energy harmless.107 MAAs are either constitutive elements within the cells or are induced by solar radiation.108 In many cases action spectroscopy has shown that solar UV-B (which peaks around 300 nm) induces MAA synthesis in algae and phytoplankton, while visible radiation has no effect.109 Biosynthesis of scytonemin is induced by exposure to UV-A radiation and can be enhanced by elevated temperatures and photooxidative conditions.104 Scytonemins are exclusively synthesized by cyanobacteria and are chemically very stable. They can accumulate in sediments; their abundance in sediment cores has been utilized to reconstruct variations in the light regime over time. 110 Natural populations of the same species may vary in their concentration, indicating genetic differences.111 Phytoplankton Phytoplankton are by far the major biomass producers in the oceans, and form the basis of the aquatic food webs. Their productivity rivals that of all combined terrestrial ecosystems. Another key ecological factor is that phytopla nkton contribute significantly to the biological pump: atmospheric carbon dioxide is taken up by primary producers in the sea and is cycled through primary and secondary consumers. Most of this carbon dioxide returns to the atmosphere, but part of this sinks to the ocean floor as zooplankton fecal pellets and, to a larger extent, as dead phytoplankton. 112 In effect the biological pump removes about 3 - 4 Gt of carbon Effects of solar UV radiation on aquatic ecos ystems and interactions with climate change 102 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 per year from the atmosphere and partially offs ets anthropogenic input of carbon from fossil fuel burning and tropical deforestation.113 Phytoplankton are not evenly distributed in the oceans but dominate in the circumpolar regions and the upwelling waters over the continental shelves, as seen by satellite imaging.114 Estimated cell density differences are in reasonable agreement with measurements in the field.115 Marine phytoplankton are dominated by small-sized cells of <2 \u00b5m diameter.116 A large number of recent studies points to a considerable sensitivity of phytoplankton communities to solar UV, ranging from polar to tropical habitats.117 Besides limitations in nutrients, light availability, pH and non-permissive temperatures, degree of adaptation and grazing pressure, high levels of solar radiation inhibits photosynthesis in species of different taxonomic groups. 118-121 The UV component adds more to photoinhibition than its energy share in solar radiation.122 This inhibition can be monitored in terms of oxygen exchange,123 carbon acquisition124 or by measuring the quantum yield using pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorescence.125 Nutrient (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) starvation often augments the UV effects on photosynthetic performance,126 but may affect various species to a different degree causing changes in community structure.127 This effect of nutrient deficiency may be caused by less efficient repair processes.121 In addition, nutrient uptake, such as phosphorus, may be impaired by solar UV radiation.128 Pollutants such as tributyltin, a constituent of antifouling paints, have a synergistic negative effect.129, 130 Photorepair is limited at low temperatures. While at 6\u00b0 C solar UV radiation significantly inhibited growth in natural phytoplankton samples from a mountain lake in the U.S.A.; no such inhibition was observed at 14\u00b0C, indicating th at the repair processes compensate the UV inhibition at the elevated temperature. 131 Experimentally, ozone depletion has been mi micked by adding supplementary UV radiation from lamps to ambient solar radiation. This approach was tested at three locations in Southern Brazil, Canada and Patagonia. 132, 133 Photoinhibition in terms of photosynthetic quantum yield is linked to the same mechanism as in other eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms from algae to higher plants: the photosynthetic electron transport chain is disrupted by photodegr adation of the D1 protein in Photosystem II. 134, 135 Low visible radiation enhances the repair efficiency while high PAR enhances the damage.136 Inhibition of protein synthesis results in retarded recovery. Nutrient starvation limits recovery also.136 In contrast to photosynthesis, respiration is less affected by ambient levels of solar UV radiation.137 Exposure of natural Antarctic marine plankton to UV at depths from 1 m to less than 20 m showed that some phytoplankton species died, so me flourished and others showed no effect. 138 These and other results suggest that ozone-related enhanced UV-B may change food web structure and function which in turn may affect biogeochemical cycles. 139 In Canadian Rocky Mountain lakes solar UV-A and UV-B were found to decrease algal density and alter community composition. 140 However, some studies indicated that after long-term exposure to solar UV, phytoplankton can adapt to the radiation.141 UV-A had a higher impact than UV-B on hard- bottom shallow marine communities, but the effects on diversity and biomass disappeared during species succession within a few months. 5, 142 Also, in Patagonian oceanic plankton assemblages, UV-A had a stronger effect on photosynthe sis during bloom periods than UV-B.143 However, Effects of solar UV radiation on aquatic ec osystems and interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 103 the relative sensitivity of phytoplankton to UV-A and UV-B may depend on the species composition and the nutrient state.144 Mixing is an important factor in plankton survival. In contrast to marine habitats with high mixing, lakes often show stable thermal stratification. Consequently, lake plankton communities show vertical distribution 145 and populate certain horizontal bands of optimal light conditions146 using buoyancy and active motility for niche selection. In the subtropical lake Tanga nyika, phytoplankton were affected by solar UV radiation only in the top half-meter, reduc ing photosynthetic rates, damaging DNA (CPD formation) and inducing UV-absorbing compounds, indicating that vertical mixing decreases solar UV effects by transporting the cells to depth where active repair can take place. Fast vertical mixing within the upper mixing layer of tropical marine environments can enhance photosynthesis. Under cloudy conditions UV-A can be used as a source of energy, while under slow mixing and cloudless skies UV-A is inhibitory. 147 Other targets of UV-B damage are changes in ultrastructure and pigment concentration and composition.148, 149 Besides direct effects on cellular targets, UV-B also operates via the production of ROS.150 Phytoplankton defend themselves by activating antioxidant systems. However, UV-B decreases the activity of antioxidant enzymes and ROS scavengers. 151 One mechanism of photoprotection against high solar radiation in many algal species (except red algae) is the xanthophyll cycle, which relies on the thermal dissipation of excess excitation energy thereby reducing the formation of singlet oxygen in the chloroplasts. 152 Zeaxanthin formation is also involved in increased non-phot ochemical quenching based on the migration of electronic excitation energy from Photosystem II chlorophyll to nearby carotenoids. UV exposure can enhance this process. 153 MAAs are effective UV screens that protect phytoplankton from high solar UV radiation.154 In the English channel MAAs are present on a year round basis with concentrations increasing rapidly during spring often coinciding with the appearance of algal blooms. 155 The action spectrum for MAA synthesis induction shows a clear maximum in the UV-B range.156 In the dinoflagellate Scrippsiella, daily vertical migrations have been found to be related to circadian MAA biosynthesis.157, 158 In dinoflagellates, MAAs seem to be packaged in certain organelles probably increasing the protective efficiency for specific cellular targets.159 MAAs can operate both as UV absorbers and as quenchers for oxidative stressors.160, 161 While MAAs are very stable molecules with respect to extreme temperatures, pH and UV radiation, they are easily destroyed in water in the presence of photosensitizers. 162 Some freshwater yeasts represent a small group of planktonic organisms showing both a constitutive and a UV-inducible synthesis of photoprotective carotenoids and mycosporines. 163- 165 The specific MAA is a compound linked to a glutaminol-glucoside,74 which is also accumulated by copepods and ciliates from their diet.165 Some green algae in extreme UV environments (snow algae) use sporopollenin as a UV-absorbing substance.166 Others rely on massive accumulations of carotenoids such as astaxanthin167 or -carotene,168 which provide protection against oxidative stress taxa diatoms produce toxic substances, such as neurotoxins and domoic acid, and are a severe threat to animals and humans when they form blooms. Recent blooms of the toxic Pseudo-nitzschia have caused mass mortality among dolphins, sea lions and birds along the Californian coast. 169 These blooms seem to be increasing Effects of solar UV radiation on aquatic ecos ystems and interactions with climate change 104 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 in frequency and geographical range. The organisms have a low sensitivity to solar UV radiation and escape damage of their photosynthetic apparatus by switching to heterotrophic growth. Several taxa of marine phytoplankton such as Prymnesiophyceae and some dinoflagellates produce dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) which is converted into dimethylsulfide (DMS)(cf. Chapter 5). The latter is emitted into the atmosphere and forms cloud condensation nuclei, thereby affecting local climate over the ocean. 170 Cleavage of DMSP is induced by mechanical or dark stress, by grazing or viral attack.171 This indicates that DMSP is involved in coping with oxidative stress.172, 173 Because of the pronounced vertical migrations of the dinoflagellates, diurnal patterns were recorded in DMS production in the St. Lawrence Estuary. Recently, lakes and estuaries have also been found to be important sources of DMS. 174 A model has been developed to simulate the seasonal patterns of DMS production and validated against nutrient concentrations, biological standing stock and other parameters. 175 Marine biogenic iodocarbon emissions are also significant for marine aeros ol formation and have a key effect on global radiative forcing.176 Besides changes in stratospheric ozone, cloud cover is a major factor controlling the exposure of organisms to solar UV.177 The sea-ice ecosystems in the circumpolar oceans and water bodies of the Baltic and Caspian Seas constitute some of the largest biomes on Earth. 178 The semisolid ice matrix provides niches in which bacteria, phytoplankton algae, protists and invertebrates thrive.179 Those organisms are strongly affected by temperature, salinity, nutrients, visible and ultraviolet solar radiation.180 Sea-ice phytoplankton provide the fundamental en ergy and nutritional source for invertebrates such as krill in their early developmental stages which amount to about a quarter of the biomass production in ice-covered waters. The extreme conditions of their habitat force the organisms to adapt physiologically. The production of large concentrations of MAAs is also essential for the survival of primary consumers which ingest and incorporate the MAAs for their own protection. The expected loss of about 25 % of the sea ice due to global warming over the current century will certainly affect the productivity of the polar oceans. 180 Anthropogenic acidification of boreal lakes decreas es resistance of organisms to UV radiation and affects species composition with increasing trophic level. Therefore it is assumed that loss in species diversity will increase the susceptibility of acidified lakes to other stress factors. Ecosystem stability in boreal lakes is thus likely to decline as global change proceeds. 181 Experiments in large (volume >1 m3) outdoor enclosures, called mesocosms, are useful for the study of complex impacts on food-web structure and dynamics.182-184 Mesocosms permit well- controlled experiments with natural phytoplankton communities in physical, chemical and light conditions mimicking those of the natural environment. In addition, UV radiation within mesocosms can be manipulated to simulate various levels of ozone depletion. Belzil and coworkers 182 find that while UV radiation increases can have subtle effects on bulk biomass (carbon and chlorophyll), changes in community structure may be a more significant ecological effect, because of differential sensitivity to UV radiation among planktonic organisms. These workers note that \"planktonic communities do not suffer from the catastrophic negative impacts that might have been inferred from some la boratory experiments on individual components of the marine food web\". They note, in agreement with previous observations, that ambient levels of UV radiation already have significant eff ects. Mesocosm experiments, including both plankton and their grazers, also suggest that changes in community structure are potentially more important than effects on overall algal biomass. 184 Other workers found that phytoplankton Effects of solar UV radiation on aquatic ec osystems and interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 105 growth was inhibited by UV radiation in fixed- depth experiments but not in mesocosms where vertical mixing exposed planktonic organisms to variable radiation regimes.185 A synthesis model simulating mesocosm experiments suggests that enhanced UV-B could cause \"a shift from primary producers to bacteria at the community level\".186 Such a shift in community structure could have important consequences for CO 2 levels in oceanic surface waters. A mathematical model based on a predator-prey scheme consid ers sedimentation of phytoplankton, vertical mixing, and attenuation of PAR as well as UV radiation in the water column. Surprisingly, higher inhibition by UV radiation and longer mixi ng periods can induce strong fluctuations in the system and enhance plankton productivity due to the stronger effects on the predators. 187, 188 Macroalgae and Aquatic Plants Macroalgae are major biomass producers on rocky shores and continental shelves. The macroalgae canopies form habitats for larval fish, crustaceans, and other animals. Macroalgae are of commercial importance and are harvested on a large scale from natural vegetation and aquaculture for human consumption and industrial use. Even without ozone depletion, UV-B radiation c onstitutes a significant stressor for macroalgae. Exposure to solar UV-B results in a host of biological effects on the molecular, cellular, individual and community levels. 189 Macroalgae are stressed by solar UV radiation to an extent which is genetically determined and results in a pronounced vertical stratification.190 Even closely related species of the same genus may have significantly different UV sensitivity, causing them to grow in different habitats. 191 UV-tolerant species populate the tidal zone, while more sensitive species are found in deeper waters.192 Seasonal changes in UV and visible radiation also result in a pronounced succession of species over the year in marine macrobenthic communities. 193 Besides changing salinity, temperature and desiccation in their habitats,194 macroalgae are exposed to extreme variations in light intensity due to daily, seasonal and tidal cycles as well as changing turbidity in the water column. 195 Intertidal macroalgae of all major taxa can rapidly adapt to fast changes in radiation.196, 197 Environmental conditions can be extreme in macroalgal habitats where, at polar growth sites, species have to survive in total darkness during several winter months. 198 Young specimens were more prone to UV inhib ition of photosynthesis, and species collected shortly after the winter were found to be affected more than those harvested later in the year, indicating an adaptive strategy to increasing natural short-wavelength radiation. 199 Both Arctic and Antarctic species showed pronounced eff ects of solar UV-B on photosynthesis, morphology and growth rates.200, 201 Unfiltered solar radiation proved lethal to several Antarctic deep water algae. While tropical macroalgae are better adapted to higher solar UV and visible radiation than higher-latitude species, they are also affected by ambient solar UV. 202 Both UV-A and UV-B decrease growth rate, quantum yield of photos ynthesis and cause accumulation of DNA damage. Since different species show different sensitivities, increases in solar UV-B radiation could influence species recruitment in the upper intertidal zone. 203 Excessive solar radiation causes photoinhibition of photosynthesis;204 elimination of total UV or UV-B alone reduces the severity of photoinhibition and shortens recovery time in many species. 152, 205, 206 Electron microscopy revealed pronounced damage of the thylakoid structure.207 Enzymes involved in the photosynthetic CO 2 fixation and sugar formation are affected by UV radiation and the concentration of chlorophyll a decreases.208, 209 The Effects of solar UV radiation on aquatic ecos ystems and interactions with climate change 106 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 photosynthetic accessory phycobiliproteins operating as antenna pigments in red algae are even more sensitive to solar UV radiation.210 UV-B is more effective than UV-A in decreasing growth rate.203 In a laboratory study exposure to UV resulted in significant release of organohalogens from several polar macroalgae. These substances have ozone-depleting characteristics and so potentially enhance the incidence of solar UV. 203 Most macroalgae have an efficient photorepair system of UV-induced CPDs.211 Besides DNA repair mechanisms, efficient ROS scavenging enzymes were found in many macroalgae.212 In several Arctic algae these enzymes vary significantly in activity over the growing season when algae have been collected before, during and after break-up of sea ice. 213 UV sensitivity decreases with age and developmental stage of macroalgae. The germination capacity of zoospores from five Laminariales species were found to decrease sharply after 16 h of exposure to visible and UV radiation. 214 Both zygotes and young germlings of brown algae show massive inhibition; UV-B radiation is more effective than UV-A.215 Also juvenile stages of red and green algae showed a pronounced UV sensitivity.216 Both UV-A and blue algae use light-directed movement (phototaxis) to accumulate at the water surface improving the chances of finding a mating partner, but that phototactic response is drastically inhibited by solar UV. Enhanced levels of solar UV-B may affect this vital strategy and thus impair development of kelps. 218 Many macroalgae of the tidal zone produce UV-absorbing compounds while subtidal species usually do not have this protection. However, deep-water algae are rarely exposed to significant levels of solar UV radiation. 219 Red algae have the highest percentage of species that synthesize MAAs,220 followed by brown and green algae. The protective effect of MAAs was shown in the red alga Porphyra , commercially sold as Nori, where they block thymine dimer production. 221 MAAs are very stable against elevated temperatures and UV exposure.222 The presence of ammonium increases the accumulation of MAAs. The blue component of visible radiation has the highest effect in inducing MAA biosynthesis in Porphyra .223 Polychromatic action spectra of induction reveal the efficiency of shor t wavelength radiation in several species.224, 225 Recently a new group of MAAs absorbing at 322 nm has been identified in green algae.226 The common sea lettuce, Ulva , was found to produce a UV-B absorbing compound with a maximum at 292 nm.227 In brown algae a novel group of UV absorbing pigments, phlorotannins, has been found.228 Macroalgae can be classified according to their MAA production. Most deep water algae never produce MAAs even when transplanted to surface waters. Algae from the intertidal zone often show induction of MAAs, while species growing near the water surface normally have a high concentration of MAAs, which cannot be further induced. 229 Other defense mechanisms against photooxidative stress involve the induction of a wide range of antioxidant enzymes in brown, green and red algae 230 as well as biosynthesis of several carotenoids.224 Aquatic mosses and liverworts show UV-B-related responses similar to those of many macroalgae, including inhibition of photosynthesis, growth and pigmentation. 231, 232 PAM measurements show a pronounced photoinhibition during noon, from which the thalli recover when the UV stress decreases. 107 When exposed to high levels of solar UV-B radiation they produce UV-absorbing compounds, which seem to be hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives.233 Aquatic flowering plants are also affected by so lar UV. Sea grass meadows cover large areas of sandy bottom in shallow water234 and contribute substantially to the aquatic biomass productivity.235 Photosynthetic quantum yield dramatically decreases under unfiltered solar Effects of solar UV radiation on aquatic ec osystems and interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 107 radiation. Removal of UV-B or total UV improves the photosynthetic activity.236 Transfer experiments on plants growing at 15 m to 2.5 m wa ter depth indicate an efficient adaptation of sea grasses to higher solar UV. Epiphytes growing on sea grass leaves has been considered detrimental since it reduces the photosynthetically available radiation, but as they strongly absorb UV-B radiation they exert a beneficial effect. 237 In a submersed aquatic angiosperm, UV- B exposure over 7 - 16 days caused an increase in several photosynthetic enzymes. Water transparency to visible and UV governs the distribution and abundance of submerged macrophytes in lakes in the Canadian Arctic. 238 Antioxidant enzymes were also activated by UV.239 The common freshwater duckweed, Lemna , shows strong responses to simulated solar radiation, with a pronounced increase in ROS responses. This UV-induced stress response was augmented by exposure to copper, which alone also activates the ROS pathway. 240 Related species differ considerably in their UV-B sensitivity.241 Consumers Consumers form the next higher level in the aquatic food webs after producers (Figure 4-3). In most cases several trophic levels follow each other, usually starting with zooplankton being the primary consumers. It is evident that a UV-related decrease in primary producer biomass has an effect on growth and survival of the consumers. In addition, specific UV effects have been identified in almost all consumers. 242 Zooplankton Zooplankton includes unicellular and multicellular life forms and can be classified in several size classes. It is also comprised of larval forms of fish, crustaceans, echinoderms, mollusks and other phyla. These forms will be discussed below. Zooplankton community structure in freshwater ecosystems is controlled by multiple factors, including DOC content and distribution thr oughout the water column, which regulates UV penetration (see Chapter 1). UV radiation is a potential driving force for zooplankton community structure in some lakes. 244 In shallow ponds of Finnish Lapland Daphnia only occurs when sufficient amounts of DOC are present.245 Depending on the terrestrial succession in the watersheds of several Alaskan lakes, the UV attenuation depths (1% of surface irradiance at 320 nm) vary from 0.6 m to more than 14 m. This UV regime strongly controls the species composition of major macrozooplankton. When zooplankton from a UV-opaque lake was Figure 4-3. Schematic diagram of classic and microbial marine food webs illustrating the flow of carbon and ener gy through the systems. Adapted from DeLong and Karl, courtesy of the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII). 243 Effects of solar UV radiation on aquatic ecos ystems and interactions with climate change 108 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 transplanted into the surface water (0.5 m depth) of a UV-transparent lake, it perished within only a few days, suggesting a strong link between early succession of zooplankton communities and terrestrial plant communities (a source of DOC) within the watershed. Large variations in UV sensitivity were also found in a study invol ving lakes of different UV transparencies. 246, 247 In response to high solar UV, Daphnia shows a pronounced avoidance response when observed in UV transmitting acrylic columns suspended in the surface waters. In contrast, when UV-B and short-wavelength UV-A are blocked, the animals prefer moving to the surface. In a low-UV lake, no such preferential behavior was seen. These results and those from a follow-up, open-lake experiment indicate that UV radiation may influence the vertical distribution and habitat partitioning of certain zooplankton in high-UV lake s, while predation, food availability and other factors may be more important in low-UV lakes. 248 Studies of sublethal effects of UV on the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia show increases in respiration rates at low levels of UV exposure and decreases at high levels.249 In their natural habitat, zooplankton face conflicting selection pressures. While invertebrate predators induce an upward movement during day light hours, this exposes zooplankton to strong surface UV exposure. 250 Even though Daphnia and other zooplankton try to escape from surface UV radiation by vertical migration, the organi sms cannot avoid excessive exposure. The copepod Boeckella , living in Lake Titicaca with very high solar UV levels, counters the detrimental effect by incorporating photoprotective MAAs.251 Copepods cannot synthesize these substances but acquire them from their algal diet (e.g., dinoflagellates).158 In a study of Antarctic copepods, MAA concentration was strongly correlated with UV tolerance. 252 In an alpine lake there was a strong seasonality in MAA concentrations in phytoplankton and copepods with more than three times higher concentrations in the summer than in the winter. 253 Besides vertical migration and UV screening, copepods rely on photorepair of UV-B-induced DNA damage254 as shown in species from Patagonia, Argentina.255 Photoenzymatic repair contributes significantly towards UV-B tolerance in many cladocerans.256 Some Antarctic copepods possess a less efficient photorepair mechanism, which has been attributed to the low temperatures typical of Antarctic lakes. 252 The implication is that at elevated temperatures (due to global warm ing) the enzymatic photorepair of UV-induced damage should be more efficient.257 This hypothesis was tested in living Daphnia by extracting DNA at various temperatures. UV-induced DNA da mage increased with temperature, but the light-dependent enzymatic repair more than offset the effect and the net DNA damage significantly decreased with increasing temperature. 258 This result was supported by a study of planktonic rotifers and crustaceans in Northern temperate lakes where UV had less detrimental effects on abundance and reproduction at higher temperatures. 259 However, one study found that mortality and DNA damage were as high as at low temperatures in freshwater ciliates, indicating that photolyase has an optimal temperature for its activity.260 It is interesting to note that though elevated levels of solar UV induce mutations, there does not seem to be evolutionary selection toward UV protection in halophilic crustaceans. 261 Feeding experiments indicate that UV-B pretreated phytoplankton species nega tively affect the life history of Daphnia .262 Adults were smaller, and a smaller number of juveniles with lower fitness were produced under these conditions than in the controls, indicating that UV-B had a significant effect on food quality and impaired energy transfer to the next trophic level. 263, 264 The effect of climate warming on macro- zooplankton is subtle: Copepod populations were reduced in size but those of ostracods Effects of solar UV radiation on aquatic ec osystems and interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 109 increased.265 In contrast predation by fish has a major effect on population composition and density. Several workers have reported results consistent with the hypothesis that UV influences zooplankton community structure and succession during early lake ontogeny. Engstrom and co-workers 266 studied the chemical and biological trends during lake evolution in recently deglaciated terrain near Glacier Bay, Alaska. They demonstrated that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations increased with lake age. Williamson et al.,267 investigating changes in UV attenuation and macrozooplankton community structure in these same lakes, showed a strong dependence of UV radiation transparency on terre strially derived DOC. They suggest a link between the development of terrestrial plant communities within these lake watersheds, changes in lake hydrology, and the early succession of zooplankton communities following deglaciation. These results suggest that UV radiation may be a more important factor than previously recognized in determining the distribution and abundance of zooplankton in lake ecosystems. Corals and Sea Anemones Recent accelerated catastrophic coral mortality has been linked with several environmental factors including bacterial and cyanobacterial infections, 268 increasing temperatures, 269-272 marine pollution273 and human destruction of coral reefs. Many corals rely on the photosynthetic activity of dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae).274 At temperatures exceeding a thermal threshold, corals are bleached. The underlying mechanism could be photoinhibition of photosynthesis in the zooxanthellae induced by the production of reactive oxygen species.275, 276 However, recent results indicate that corals and their symbionts may be capable of adapting to higher temperatures. 277 Like corals, giant clams harbor symbiotic zooxanthellae. Clams also suffered mass bleaching on several reefs of the Great Barrier Reef.278 Virus-like particles could also be associated with coral mortality.279 When symbiotic algae are exposed to solar radiation the host is also subjected to damaging solar UV radiation. Some stony corals expand their tentacles upon exposure to photosynthetically active radiation and contract them when encountering excessive radiation. 280 As a counter- measure to enhanced solar UV the algae produce MAAs, some of which are also transferred to the host. 274 Moreover, the host develops antioxidant defenses to protect itself from the photosynthetically produced oxygen. Herbicides also affect corals by impairing the photosynthetic symbiotic zooxanthellae. 281 Laboratory-kept colonies of the coral Stylophora maintained minimal amounts of MAAs, but the concentration of the UV-absorbing pigments increased rapidly upon exposure to broadband UV. 282 Four MAAs, produced by the zooxanthella Symbiodinium , increased first, followed by six additional ones which were synthesized at the expense of the primary MAAs. Sea anemones occur in several color phenotypes. At the coast of Discovery Bay, Jamaica, pink morphs are more abundant in the lagoon and in deeper areas, while green individuals are found in the forereef (seaward and downward from the reef crest) and in shallower areas. Genetic analysis revealed two distinct variants with different UV absorbance and UV acclimatization capacities. 283 A comparison of sea anemones with dinoflagellates or green algae as symbionts or asymbiotic species showed that the MAAs mainly reflect phylogenetic differences among the anemones rather than the presence or kind of symbiont. 284 Effects of solar UV radiation on aquatic ecos ystems and interactions with climate change 110 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 Sea Urchins Exposure to UV radiation causes apoptosis (cell self-destruction) in developing sea urchin embryos.285 Embryos of three sea urchin species from different habitats ranging from the Gulf of Maine to the Antarctic indicated significant amounts of accumulated DNA damage in the form of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD). Biol ogical weighting functions for DNA damage indicated a high sensitivity for UV-A radiation, but the most sensitive species show an increased susceptibility to UV-B correlated with the lowest concentration of UV-absorbing compounds. 286 Larvae and embryos of these species dwell w ithin 5 m of the ocean surface. UV-induced damage in the different larval stages was clearly correlated with the absence of MAAs. The absence of UV-screening substances strongly decreased survival. 287 Further, the observed delays in early cleavage and following development were closely related with UV-induced DNA damage. Reproduction in the circumpolar sea urchin Sterechinus occurs during austral spring when ozone concentrations during the past 25 years have declined by more than 50%. When the planktonic embryos were exposed in the top 1 m of the water column, nearly all exhibited DNA damage and 100% showed abnormal development. 288 UV-B removal prevented DNA damage. At depths below 3 m hardly any abnormal development or DNA damage occurred. The threshold for DNA damage from ambient solar UV-B was 25 kJm -2 (inducing ~17 CPDs mb-1) and levels >80 kJm-2 precluded normal development. The Antarctic sea ice has been thought to protect the benthic invertebrate fauna from solar UV-B radiation. However, recent investigations s howed that short-wavelength UV-B (down to 304 nm) is transmitted through the austral spring annual ice of McMurdo Sound where it causes DNA damage and mortality during the early development in sea urchin embryos. 289 The degree of damage and mortality varies from year to year and depends on the thickness of the sea ice and on the total column ozone. Amphibians During the last decade amphibian populations have suffered widespread declines and even extinctions on a global scale. 290, 291 Many different factors, including habitat destruction292, 293 and fragmentation,294-297 global climate change,298, anthropogenic pesticides304, and other pathogen outbreaks,317-319 interannual variability in precipitation, as well as climate change-induced reductions in water depth at oviposition sites, have been suggested as responsible for those global declines. 320, 321 Since the 1990s, malformations have been noted in many parts of the United States321 and in many other countries all over the globe.322, 323 Among other factors, solar UV-B radiation has been variously implicated as a possible contributing factor 324 involved in malformation and mortality, especially during the embryonic development. However, there are two conflicting views on the involvement of UV-B in amphibian declines. 325, 326 In a controlled laboratory study, leopard frogs ( Rana pipiens ) were exposed to unfiltered solar radiation or radiation without UV-B or total UV.327 Unlike natural conditions, the larvae in the laboratory could not avoid exposure. Full sunlight caused ca. 50% mortality in early larval development, while filtered solar radiation had no effect. There was a clear correlation between solar UV doses and hindlimb malformation. In situ studies in the natural amphibian habitat showed a considerable protection from solar UV radiation by DOC Effects of solar UV radiation on aquatic ec osystems and interactions with climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 111 and vegetation shading, especially during the sensitive development during spring.328 When exposed to ambient solar radiation under controlled conditions and when natural shade and refuge were eliminated, embryos and larvae of several anuran species died.329 A subsequent quantification of the outdoor UV exposure in Northern Minnesota and Wisconsin wetlands indicated that the risks for UV-induced malformations and mortality are low for both Northern leopard and mink frogs. The exposure of amphibian eggs and larvae to solar UV radiation strongly depends on the concentration of DOC in the water column. 330 One important factor is oviposition behavior: species which lay the eggs in UV-protected sites may be more sensitive to solar UV exposure than those which deposit their eggs at the water surface. 331 Amphibian species with the highest physiological sensitivity to UV-B are those with the lowest field exposures as a function of the location of embryos and the UV-B attenuations properties of water at each site. These results also suggest that conclusions made about vulnerability of species to UV-B in the absence of information on field exposures may often be misleading. 331 Red-legged frog embryos ( Rana aurora ) appear to be tolerant to current ambient levels of UV-B, but radiation even slightly exceeding the ambient levels is lethal.332 Although embryonic size is a complicated issue and small size at hatching can change very quickly after feeding, even at ambient levels, larvae exposed to UV-B as embryos tend to be smaller and less developed than non-exposed organisms. Amphibians use behavi oral, physiological and molecular defenses against solar UV-B damage, but species-specific sensitivities may cause changes in community structure due to persistent UV-B level increases, 333 but because some species may be more successful than others, changes in species composition can result.333 Fishes Although humans use about 8% of the productivity of the oceans, that fraction increases to more than 25% for upwelling areas and to 35% for temperate continental shelf systems. For about one-sixth of the world's population (primarily developing nations ), the oceans provide at least 20% of their animal protein. Many of the fisheries that depend upon the oceanic primary productivity are unsustainable. Although the primary causes for a decline in fish populations are predation and poor food supply for larvae, overfishing, increased water temperature, pollution and disease, and/or exposure to increased UV-B ra diation may contribute to that decline. The eggs and larvae of many fish are sensitive to UV-B exposure (Figure 4-4). However, imprecisely defined habitat characteristics and the unknown effect of small increases in UV-B exposure on the naturally high mortality rates of fish larvae are major barriers to a more accurate assessment of effects of ozone depletion on marine fish populations. Visual predators, including most fish, are nece ssarily exposed to damaging levels of solar UV radiation. Skin and ocular components can be damaged by UV, 334 but large differences are found between different species.335 Coral reef fishes can adapt to the UV stress by incorporating UV-absorbing substances, which they acquire through their diet, into their eyes and epidermal slime.336 Exposure to solar radiation induced \"suntanning\" in red seabream. Histological, colorimetric and chemical assays showed that the sun-exposed fish had an up to five times higher concentration of melanin. 337 In addition to direct effects, including damage to biological molecules such as DNA and proteins and the generation of reactive oxygen species, photoactivation of organic pollutants and photosensitization may be detrimental. The damaging Effects of solar UV radiation on aquatic ecos ystems and interactions with climate change 112 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 effects on eggs and larval stages may be enhanced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as retene, which is a pollutant from pulp and paper mills.338 In goldfish, embryos are prone to UV effects during early development 339 and produce CPDs under UV radiation. These are more efficiently repaired in the presence of light. 340 Solar UV radiation has been shown to induce DNA damage in the eggs and larvae of the Atlantic cod, 294 where larvae were more sensitive than eggs. Artificial UV causes massive apoptosis in larval embryos of Japanese flounders. 341 Studies addressing biological weighting functions indicated a strong sensitivity towards solar UV-B. CPD loads as low as 10 per megabase DNA resulted in approximately 10% mortality. Use of video taping and measurement of oxygen consumption showed sublethal effects of UV radiation in juvenile rainbow trout 342. Under worst-case scenarios (60% ozone loss, sunny weather and low water turbulence), solar UV-B eliminated buoyancy and caused mortality within 1 or 2 days. Fish spawning depth strongly correlates with UV exposure. In-situ incubation experiments have shown that in a highly UV transparent lake 100% of yellow perch eggs ( Perca flavescens ) are killed before hatching when exposed to full solar UV. 343 In this same lake 92% of eggs are spawned at depths greater than 3 m, while in a nearby lake with low UV transparency 76% of eggs were spawned at depths shallower than 1 m. It is not known whether the fish are able to detect and avoid the high UV at shallower depths in the high UV lake or whether this spawning pattern is due simply to differential survival. In either case, the deeper spawning depths place the eggs in colder water where it takes them much longer to hatch compared to eggs spawned in the warm surface waters. A similar phenomenon has been observed in bluegill larvae ( Lepomis macrochirus ) in a UV-transparent lake where in 19 % of nests the estimated UV-induced mortality of larvae exceeds 25 %. Most nests are exposed to relatively low UV levels because they are either located at deeper depths or under overhanging branches. 344 In fish aquaculture, specific measures are introduced, such as installing UV sunscreens to avoid UV damage to larval fish in the usually shallow habitats. 345 Other Aquatic Animals Early life stages of marine organisms, particular ly eggs and larvae, are vulnerable to solar UV-B radiation. Rocky shore mollusks show an increased mortality and retarded development upon UV exposure. These detrimental effects are synergistically enhanced in the presence of other stress factors such as high temperatures or sa linity, pointing to strong underestimation of the ecological impacts of climate change by not accounting for the complex interactions among such environmental variables as temperature, salinity and oxygen availability. 346 Desiccation Figure 4-4.

However, the latter species deposits all available MAAs into the eggs and embryos conferring protection to the progeny. 348 Conclusions and Consequences With the recognition of the importance of UV radiation effects on aquatic ecosystems, there has been a plethora of publications show that sola r UV can adversely affects aquatic organisms. These studies document substantial impact on individual species yet considerable uncertainty remains with respect to assessing effects on ecosystems. Several studies indicate that the impact of increased UV radiation would be relatively low when considering overall biomass response while often, in contrast, the response is quite marked when the abundance, distribution and effects on individual species are considered. Ecosystem response to climate variability involves both synergistic and antagonistic influences with respect to UV radiation-related effects on aquatic ecosystems and these influences significantly complicate comprehension and prediction at the ecosystem level. With respect to assessing UV radiation-related effects, the influence of climate variability is often more important via indirect effects such as reduction in sea ice, changes in water column bio-optical characteristics and shifts in oceanographic biogeochemical provinces than through direct effects. Decreas es in primary production would result in reduced sink capacity for atmospheric carbon dioxide, with its related effects on climate change. The global decline of amphibian populations seems to be related to several complex, interacting causes. While one review clearly rejected a ny link between solar UV-B radiation and amphibian decline 326 evidence from more than 50 peer-reviewed publications from around the world shows that dozens of amphibian species are affected by UV-B.325 A number of new studies have both confirmed and strengthened evidence that UV-B has an important influence on community structure of various aquatic ecosystems. In lakes, phytoplankton abundance may vary by orders of magnitude depending upon future climate-DOM-UV interactions. 26 Also, lakes often show thermal stratification and as a consequence plankton communities show vertical distributi ons where the UV regime can strongly control species composition.235 Other evidence supports the hypothesis that UV influences zooplankton and community structure and succession during early lake ontogeny.267 Mesocosm studies, including both phytoplankton and their grazers, s uggest that species composition and population structure may be more influenced by UV-B than overall algal biomass.184 These results suggest that UV radiation may be a more important factor than previously recognized in determining community structure in aquatic systems. 349 References 1 H\u00e4der D-P, Kumar HD, Smith RC, Worrest RC, Aquatic ecosystems: effects of solar ultraviolet radiation and interactions with other climatic change factors, Photochem.

Summary This report assesses on the interactions of UV radi ation (280-400 nm) and global climate change with global biogeochemical cycles at the Earth's surface. The effects of UV-B (280-315 nm), which are dependent on the stratos pheric ozone layer, on biogeochemical cycles are often linked to concurrent exposure to UV- A radiation (315-400 nm), which is influenced by global climate change. These interactions invol ving UV radiation (the co mbination of UV-B and UV-A) are central to the predic tion and evaluation of future Earth environmental conditions. There is increasing evidence that elevated UV-B radiation has significant effects on the terrestrial biosphere with implications for the cycling of carbon, nitroge n and other elements. The cycling of carbon and inorga nic nutrients such as nitr ogen can be affected by UV-B- mediated changes in communities of soil organi sms, probably due to the effects of UV-B radiation on plant root exudation and/or the chemistr y of dead plant material falling to the soil. In arid environments direct photodegradation can play a major role in the decay of plant litter, and UV-B radiation is responsible for a significant part of this photodegradation. UV-B radiation strongly influences aquatic carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and metals cycli ng that affect a wide range of life processes. UV-B radiation changes the biolog ical availability of dissolved organic matter to microorganisms, and accelerates its transformati on into dissolved inorganic carbon and nitrogen, including carbon dioxide and ammonium. The co loured part of dissolved organic matter (CDOM) controls the penetration of UV radia tion into water bodies, but CDOM is also photodegraded by solar UV radiation. Changes in CDOM influence the penetration of UV radiation into water bodies with major conse quences for aquatic biogeochemical processes. Changes in aquatic primary productivity and de composition due to climate-related changes in circulation and nutrient supply o ccur concurrently with exposur e to increased UV-B radiation, and have synergistic effects on th e penetration of light into aquatic ecosystems. Future changes in climate will enhance stratification of lakes and the ocean, which will intensify photodegradation of CDOM by UV radiation. The re sultant increase in the transparency of water bodies may increase UV-B ef fects on aquatic biogeochemist ry in the surface layer. Changing solar UV radiation and climate also inte ract to influence exchanges of trace gases, Interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on biogeochemical cycling 136 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 such as halocarbons (e.g., methyl bromide) whic h influence ozone depletion, and sulfur gases (e.g., dimethylsulfide) that oxidize to produce sulfate aerosols that cool the marine atmosphere. UV radiation affects the biological availability of iron, copper and other trace metals in aquatic environments thus potentially affecting metal t oxicity and the growth of phytoplankton and other microorganisms that are involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling. Future changes in ecosystem distribution due to alterations in the physical and chemical climate interact with ozone- modulated changes in UV-B radiation. These inte ractions between the effects of climate change and UV-B radiation on biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial and aquatic systems may partially offset the beneficial effects of an ozone recovery. Introduction Global biogeochemistry plays a critical role in controlling life processes, climate and their interactions, including effects on atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Changes in stratospheric ozone and hence in solar UV-B radi ation (280-315nm) have many different effects on Longe r wavelength UV-A radiation (315- 400 nm) is little affected by ozone depletion, but can be affected by globa l climate change. UV radiation (280-400 nm), including both UV-B and UV-A, modifies carbo n cycling through cha nges in its capture (photosynthesis), storage in biom ass and non-living organic matter, and release (respiration and photochemical decomposition). The effects of UV radiation on carbon cycling are linked to effects on the cycling of metals and mineral nut rients such as nitrogen. Carbon and nutrient cycles are also substantially affected by other components of climate cha nge, including warming, elevated CO 2 and altered patterns of precipitation, a nd there are also significant interactions between these factors and changes in UV radia tion. Interactions be tween changing solar UV radiation and climate change occur through the effects of UV radiation on emissions of trace gases, such as carbon monoxide, carbonyl sulfide, me thane, methyl bromide and dimethylsulfide. Climate change can alter the exposure of ecosyst ems to UV-B radiation by influencing the Earth system processes that affect ozone depletion (Chapter 1) as well as changes in aquatic UV- absorbing substances such as colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Biological responses of organisms to changing UV radiation and inter actions with climate change are considered in detailed in Chapers 3 and 4. This chapter examines the responses of global biogeochemistry to interactions between stratosphe ric ozone depletion and co-occu rring environmental changes in climate, land use, and atmospheric CO 2 (Figure 5-1). The primary focus is on new information obtained since our 2002 report1 although in some instances refere nce is also made to earlier key publications. Carbon Cycling There is a consensus that terrestrial ecosystems are currently net sinks for carbon, i.e. that the uptake of CO 2 exceeds its release. The net accumulation of carbon by terrestrial ecosystems has been calculated to be around 0.7 petagrams (Pg) (1 Pg equals 1015 g, or 109 metric tons) carbon per year for the 1990s, although estimates vary widely.2 This is substantially smaller than current estimates of oceanic CO 2 uptake (around 2.4 Pg carbon per year for the 1990s). However, the carbon balance of terrestrial systems is prof oundly influenced by human activities such as land-use change, which may result in CO 2 emissions as great as 2.2 Pg carbon per year.2, 3 The exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmo sphere and ecosystems is a balance between CO 2 uptake by photosynthesis, its storage in biom ass and non-living organic matter, and its Interactive effects of solar UV radiati on and climate change on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 137 release through respiration, photode gradation, and burning. Changes in solar UV radiation have been shown to influence many of these processes. Carbon Fixation The balance of evidence continues to suggest that changes in UV-B radiation resulting from ozone depletion will have little effect on carbon fi xation and growth in most terrestrial plants (see Chapter 3) and hence on large-scale carbon capture and storage by terrestrial vegetation. However, certain plant species or communities may be vulnerable to increased UV-B radiation and this may have significant ecological impacts in specific systems (see Chapter 3). Whereas in terrestrial ecosystems changes in solar UV radiation influence carbon fixation directly through effects on plants , in aquatic systems, the prim ary producers are affected both directly and indirectly by so lar UV radiation. The indirect e ffects are caused by changes in exposure to UV radiation due to va riations in the concentration of CDOM and, to a lesser extent, suspended particles. CDOM is the main UV- absorbing constituent in aquatic systems and controls the penetration of UV radiation into water bodies. Organic matter produced on land and Figure 5-1.

Interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on biogeochemical cycling 138 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 transported by rivers is an important source of CDOM to the coastal oceans.4-7 However, CDOM undergoes UV-induced transformations, resu lting in loss of colour and UV absorbance (referred to as photobleaching).8-10 Photobleaching of CDOM increa ses the penetration depth of UV radiation into water bodies an d enhances the exposure of aqua tic ecosystems to UV radiation. This increased exposure enhances the negative, direct effects of UV on carbon fixation in aquatic systems (see Chapter 4). The effects of CD OM on UV penetration are determined by its chemical composition11, and the optical properties and th e mechanisms of photobleaching of CDOM are being intensively investigated.8, 10-18 Carbon Storage and Release The storage of organic carbon in terrestrial ec osystems is estimated to be approximately 2000- 3000 Pg, with about three times as much stored in soil as in vegetation.19-21 Approximately 38,500 Pg of inorganic carbon are stored in the ocean and sediments, and approximately 750 Pg are stored as living and non-liv ing organic carbon. The effect s of changes in solar UV-B on long-term carbon storage remain unclear. Howe ver, UV-B influences short-term carbon turn- over from plant litter (dead plant material) in te rrestrial systems, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulate organic matter (POM) in aquatic systems. The release of carbon can result not only from respiration but also from photodegradation of organic matter or phototransformation into forms more readily av ailable to microbes. The photodegradation of wood is also discussed in Chapter 7. Global respiration from terrestrial vegetation and from soils are both of the order of 50-60 Pg of carbon per year.3, 22 The release of carbon differs among s ources such as living plant material and dead organic matter and is highly dependent on factors such as temperature. Altered UV-B will influence carbon release from terrestrial ecosystems through changes in the efflux of CO 2 and/or CH 4.23, 24 However, research over the past four years reinforces the conclusion of the previous UNEP report1 that the effects of changing UV on carbon release from terrestrial ecosystems are complex and are likely to vary between species and ecosystems. Carbon release from soils is a function of the act ivities of soil fauna and micro-organisms. Soil organisms may be vulnerable to UV-B damage (e.g., 25) but are rarely exposed to solar radiation in nature. Even so, plant responses to changing UV-B may indirectly affect soil organisms. Attenuation of solar UV-B modifies the commun ities of fungi and microfauna in the surface layer of Sphagnum wetland communities.26, 27 These changes in soil communities are probably related to UV-induced changes in the quantity or chemistry of dead plant material or root exudates entering the soil, for example attenuation of solar UV-B reduced the leaching of DOC and P from Sphagnum moss27 (Figure 5-2a). UV-B induced cha nges in leaf litter chemistry may also influence soil fauna, for example earthworms, although responses appear to be rather subtle and species-dependent.28 Recent studies in the Antarctic29, temperate grassland30, and arctic heath31 have also shown changes in soil microbial community structure in response to UV-B manipulations, rather than the changes in total microbial biomass that were evident in some previous studies.32 The effects of changed solar UV on the chemistry of leaf litter have been studied in a range of species. Changes in litter chemistry can occu r in two ways: by the effects of UV exposure on decomposing litter (which are called direct eff ects), or the effects of UV on the chemistry of living tissues before litter-fall (so-called indirect effects). Direct effects occur when dead plant material decomposes on or above the soil surface, when directly exposed to solar UV. Recent Interactive effects of solar UV radiati on and climate change on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 139 data33 highlights that direct photodegradation can be the dominant process in the decomposition of plant litter in ecosystems with high sunlight and limited rainfall, and that UV-B may account for 50% of such photodegradation (Figure 5-3a). In these dryland ecosystems changes in solar UV resulting either from variation in ozone or elements of climate change such as cloud cover may have substantial effects of carbon cycling. In other terrestrial ecosystems the effects of UV on litter decomposition are more complex. Exclusion of ambient solar UV-B during decomposition accelerated the break down of litter in some species (Figure 5-3b) but had only marginal effects in others (e.g., barley: 34). Similarly, exclusion of ambient UV-B may increase litter colonization by fungi in some systems35, but not others.36 Overall, the direct e ffects of changing UV-B on litter decomposition appear to depend on species-specific differences in litter chemistry, and on absolute differences in UV dose and weather conditions between different sites. The indirect effects of changing UV on litter chemistry and consequent changes in decomposition are species specific. The previous observation that elevated UV-B during plant growth and development accelerated the decomposition of oak leaf litter 37 was shown recently to be associated with reductions in the extractability of some carbohydrate fractions in litter produced under elevated UV-B (Figure 5-3c), which stimulated colonization by some fungal decomposers. 38 In barley UV-B exposure during plant growth and development caused significant changes in litter chemistry, including nitrogen, and this was associated with a significant reducti on in the loss of dry weight and nitrogen from litter during decomposition. 34 In the herbaceous plant Gunnera magellanica there were persistent differences in the fungal community colonizing litter produced under different UV environments 35, but this was not related to signif icant changes in litter chemistry or 05101520253035 0-5 mm 5-10 mm Sample depthDOC attenuatedA mm Full sun UV-B only attenuatedA B Figure 5-2. Figure 2. UV radiation influences the production of dissolved organic carbon in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In terrestrial ecosystems, recent evidence shows that UV-B exposure significantly increases the release of DOC from Sphagnum moss, the dominant plant in global peatland ecosystems (A, modified from Robson et al. 26). This effect of UV-B was not confined to the surface layers exposed to UV-B, but occurs also in deeper layers (5-10 mm below the surface) where no UV-B penetr ates. In aquatic systems, UV-B can result in the releas e of DOC from particulate organic carbon (POM). For example simulated solar radiation results in the loss of suspended POM and the production of DOC (B, from Mayer et al. 37: data are means of triplicate experiment s and the error bars are \u00b1 1 standard deviation). Other studies using light filters showed that the POC to DOC conversions were mainly induced by UV radiation (Figure 2b, Reprinted with permission from Mayer et al.37, Figure 1, p. 1066, Copyright 2006 by the American Society for Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.). The continual resuspension and exposure of deposited particulates to sunlight in shallow parts of systems su ch as the Missisippi Delta region provides an opportunity for cumulative photodissolution over time. Interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on biogeochemical cycling 140 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 decomposition. In two grasses UV-B exposure du ring plant growth and development had no effect on litter quality or decomposition.39 Increased UV-B significantly modifies the chem istry of secondary metabolites produced by and released from plants (also see Chapter 3). The majority of studies of UV effects on plant chemistry have dealt with leaves, but increa sed UV may also induce accumulation of certain carbohydrates and UV-absorbing phenolics in the bark of birch saplings.40 The chemistry of tissues not directly exposed to UV can also be affected, as in the roots of lupin ( Lupinus luteus) plants grown under increased UV.41 As with many UV responses, th is effect on root chemistry appears to be species specific.42, 43 Although these studies of UV e ffects on plant chemistry have not explicitly considered biogeochemical cycles, there is increasing evidence that plant-derived chemicals, especially phenolic compounds, ha ve major consequences for soil processes.44-46 It is notable that many of the plant-derived phenolic compounds considered to play vital roles in affecting soil processes have also been shown to be influenced by UV exposure.40, 45, 47-49 Since UV-B effects on such phenolic compounds are sp ecific both to plant species and individual compounds, the observed variation in effect s on soil processes might be expected. Since existing studies of the effects of increas ed UV-B on decomposition or soil processes have largely focused on individual species, the net effects of changed UV-B acting across areas of vegetation remain unclear. A recent modeling a pproach to the effects of climate change on decomposition suggests that the principal effect of elevated UV-B will be to increase litter accumulation and so contribute to carbon sequestration.50 However, the conclusion of the previous assessment1 that any such effect of UV on terres trial carbon budgets is likely to be local and determined by species-specific responses in both plants and decomposers has not been changed by recent research. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) in aquatic systems is produced vi a microbial respiration, UV-induced mineralization of DOM into inorganic carbon, a nd/or shifts in the carbonate equilibrium.1 Figure 5-3. The effects of UV-B radiation of the decomposition of dead plant material in terrestrial ecosystems vary with factors such as climate and plant species. In high, light, arid ecosystems the break-down of dead plant material (\"litter\") may be largely due to photodegradation, and UV-B may accelerate this process. This is clear from a study of decomposition in the Patagonian steppe (A, modified from Austin and Vivanco33) where litter was decomposed either under full sunlight, sunlight in which only UV-B had been attenuated, or sunlight with all wavelengths attenuated by 90%. (Data are presented as the annual fractional mass loss obtained from the slope of the regression between ln(organic matter remaining/initial organic matte r) against time. Error bars are \u00b1 standard error of the mean). In ecosystems less limited by water, the effect s of UV-B on litter break-down are more variable, but there are many examples where UV-B suppresses d ecomposition, as in the herbaceous plant Gunnera grown in Tierra del Fuego (B, modified from Pancotto et al.35: data are means \u00b1 standard error of the mean). UV-B exposure during growth may also influence subsequent decomposition of leaf litter, as in oak (C, modified from McLeod et al.39) where the annual fractional mass loss is significan tly increased in litter produced under elevated UV-B, and this is associated with reductions in the amount of carbohydrate released from this litter.

A number of studies have shown that algal-derived DOM is more bi odegradable and less photoreactive than terrestrial DOM.5, 51-54 The extent of DOM photominerali zation increases with decreasing pH55 and also depends on the precipitation history.56 Furthermore, photomineral ization is catalyzed by section \"Metal Cycling\"). Photochemical and microbial decomposition of DOM may interact since DOM is a key nutrient and energy source for consumers, including heterotrophic bacteria and metazooplankton. However, not all chemical forms of DOM are available to these orga nisms, and UV-induced transformations of DOM can alter its bioavailability.1 UV-induced transformations of DOM may increase bioavailability of bi orecalcitrant DOM and vice versa.52, 57 The UV-induced increase in DOM bioavailability may enhance microbial respiration of DOM58 or increase microbial biomass through the microbial loop.59 Transfers of carbon and nutrien ts between the water column and bottom sediments of freshwaters and the ocean are mediated by particle s. Solar UV can affect the dynamics of such transfers by photooxidation of pa rticulate organic carbon (POC).1 UV also can induce the conversion of POC to disso lved organic carbon (DOC)60(Figure 5-2b). Nutrient Cycling Nitrogen and phosphorus can limit productivity in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. UV radiation can affect nitrogen cyc ling in several ways, including changes in the decomposition of N-containing organic matter and through effects on nitrogen fixation. In addition, in aquatic environments UV interactions with inorganic nitrogen sp ecies such as nitrate and nitrite are an important source of reactive oxygen species, in cluding the highly reactive hydroxyl radical. Biologically labile nitrogen compounds such as nitrate, ammonium, and amino acids are rapidly recycled by the biota in aquatic systems, while N-containing subs tances that have structural features that inhibit assimilati on, accumulate in the water colum n. Interactions of UV radiation and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) provide a pathway for th e conversion of persistent DON to compounds that are more easily assimilated by aquatic microorganisms, such as ammonium.1 Ammonium photoproduction, i.e. \"photoammonificat ion\", which is affected by solar UV-B radiation,61 occurs in both freshwater lakes62 and in coastal regions such as the Baltic Sea61, where it can periodically be the largest source of new bioavailable nitrogen in the Baltic Sea.61 Solar UV can affect phosphorus cycling by photod egradation of enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase (APase) or release of AP ase sorbed to humic substances.1 Additional evidence obtained in Canadian lakes confirmed that exposure to solar UV reduced APase activity.63 Sorption of APase to clay enzyme from UV-induced photodegradation, although enzymatic activity was reduced by sorption.64 Nitrogen inputs into soil originate from a numb er of sources, including atmospheric deposition, decomposition, biological nitrogen fixation a nd, in agricultural ecosystems, fertilizers.65 Variation in responses of litte r decomposition to changing UV-B affect the release of nitrogen from decaying plant litter.34, 35, 39 The effects of changing UV on plant-derived phenolic compounds in soils may be especially impor tant for nitrogen transformation processes.44-46 Biological nitrogen fixation by fr ee living cyanobacteria can be reduced by increased UV-B radiation1, 66 (see Chapters 3 and 4). Increased UV-B may also inhibit nitrogen fixation by Interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on biogeochemical cycling 142 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 cyanobacteria within lichens1 but recent data suggest that th is does not occur in all species.67 In recent studies of tropical legumes, elevated UV ha d no significant effects on symbiotic nitrogen fixation41-43, in contrast to a numbe r of previous studies.1 In terrestrial plants the uptake of nutrients such as phosphate and some forms of nitrogen is often achieved through the mycorrhizal symbiosis between plant roots and fungi. There is evidence that changing UV-B can influence ro ot colonization by mycorrhizal fungi1, but recent evidence shows that this response varies betw een sites, even within a single system31, as well as between species.30, 68 We are unaware of any studi es that have explicitly m easured mycorrhizal function rather than colonization. Metal Cycling Many trace metals are essential mi cronutrients for aquatic organisms69-72, but most of them can be toxic to terrestrial and a quatic organisms, depending on thei r concentration and chemical speciation.73-76 Solar UV radiation has significant e ffects on the chemical speciation of trace metals, for example, iron, manganese, coppe r, chromium, and mercury (Figure 5-4). Iron Iron is an essential micronutrient for phytoplankton and has been shown to co-limit phytoplankton growth in several marine environments. 77-79 The role of iron supply in stimulating phyto-plankton blooms in high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll oceanic waters has been demonstrated 80, 81 and its effect on carbon sequestration is being intensively investigated.82-84 Fe(III) is the most common form of iron in sunlit aquatic systems, but Fe(II) is the key form that determines the availability of iron for uptake by organisms. 85 In oxic, sunlit surface waters the mainten- ance of low Fe(II) concentrations is a result of the UV-induced reduct-ion of both dissolved and colloidal, 86-89 and Fe(II) oxidat- ion.90-93 In surface waters of the Southern Ocean the photoreduction was primarily caused by UV-A radiation, although ozone depletion was estimated to increase the UV-B contributio n to this photoreduction from 3.5 to 6.2%. 89 UV-induced iron chemistry will interact with la rge scale inputs of iron, such as dust deposition, that are influenced by climate change.94 Dust deposition is the ma jor source of iron in some Bacterio- and PhytoplanktonFe(II)Fe(III) Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM)Cu(II) Cu(I) DOM transformed +R O S Organic and inorganic pollutants, e.g., Hg0 aqRe-oxidation and formation of ROS, e.g..OHAir Water Re-oxidation and formation of ROS, e.g..OH Figure 5-4. UV radiation is a key factor in the chemistry of iron and copper in aquatic systems, including its interactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM) and microorganisms. This schematic represents the UV-induced redox cycling of iron and copper, and the concomitant phototransformation of DOM and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), for example the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH), that can adversely affect bacterio - and phytoplankton and react with organic and inorganic pollutants, for example dissolved gaseous mercury, Hg 0aq. Interactive effects of solar UV radiati on and climate change on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 143 remote regions of the ocean and UV exposure can affect the bioavailabi lity of this iron. Enhanced iron bioavailability could affect both phytoplankton abundance and community structure particularly in these regions. Indeed, satellite observations of productivity in remote regions of the Southern Hemisphe re correlate with dust deposition.95 The regions in the Southern Hemisphere where oceanic productivit y is strongly correlate d with dust deposition (Figure 5-5) are those in which future changes in total ozone, a nd thus UV-B exposure, are likely to be most dynamic (see Chapter 1). Thus future changes in total ozone over this region could interact with dust deposition to alter the spatia l distribution of primary and secondary pelagic production and may place additiona l stress on already depleted fish and mammal populations (also see Chapter 4). Copper The bioavailability and thus toxicity of copper depends on its chemical speciation. It is likely that, by analogy to iron, reduced copper, Cu(I), is an important species with regard to the bio-availability and hence toxicity of copper. As with iron, reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) in oxic aquatic systems occurs to a large extent via UV-induced photochemical reactions of Cu(II) complexed by strong organic ligands. 96, 97 In the case of coastal estuaries, these strong Cu ligands are components of humic substances that can be photodegraded. Although solar UV radiation was primarily responsible for the photolysis of these strong Cu ligands, visible radiation also was involved. 98 Up to 25% of total dissolved copper detected in marine surface waters is Cu(I) which is stabilized by inorganic and organic ligands such as chloride and phytoplankton- derived organosulfur com- pounds. 75, 76 During its long- range transport in atmospheric waters, copper undergoes UV-induced redox cycling so that a large frac tion of total copper in rainwater is Cu(I). 97 It was hypothesized that part of the strong Cu-compl exing ligands found to be present in these Cu(I)-complexi ng ligands that retard Cu(I) oxidation. 5-5. The productivity of marine ecosystems is highly correlated with inputs of dust derived from terrestrial ecosystems, which may be changing due to climate change. Th is map shows correlation coefficient observed between dust deposition and marine productivity as estimated by satellite estimates of chlorophyll. 95 The time series of dust deposition is estimated from a global transport model that has been verified against observations. The high correlations (>0.80) indicate that the input of atmospheric Fe in dust elicits a very quick and discernable response in some regions of the ocean. The st rong covariance of dust input and biological activity is occurring in regi ons where productivity is Fe limited and the magnitude of the dust flux is quite small as this is occurring far from strong dust sources. These regions continue to experienced the greatest changes in stratospheric ozon e concentration and, hence, in UV- B radiation (see Chapter 1). Interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on biogeochemical cycling 144 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 Mercury UV-induced redox processes also largely determin e the bioavailability an d thus toxicity of mercury. Mercury is a globally dispersed toxic pollutant that can be transported far from its emission sources.99 Divalent mercury, Hg(II), can be methylated and bioaccumulated in the aquatic and terrestrial food chain100 and methylmercury can advers ely impact reproduction of wild fishes.74 Reduction of Hg(II)101, 102 and oxidation of dissolved gaseous mercury (Hg 0aq)103- 105 are both induced by UV radiation. Especially critical is the UV-i nduced oxidation of Hg 0aq since this process increa ses the pool of methylmerc ury. The photooxidation of Hg 0aq is chiefly mediated by UV radiation in natural brackish wa ters, and \u00b7OH may be partly responsible for Hg0aq oxidation in these systems.103, 104 The photoproduction of methylmercury was dependent on DOM concentration and type in freshwater samples.105 For example, water from lakes with logged watersheds generated methylmercury when exposed to sunlight whereas water from lakes with low levels of logging in the undisturbed wa tershed did not. Hence solar UV radiation can have significant and complex impacts on me rcury volatilization, solubilization, and methylation.106 UV-Enhanced Oxidative Activi ty of Aquatic Systems Reactive oxygen species (ROS), important in the processing of natural and anthropogenic compounds, are produced by UV-induced photoreactions of inorganic nitrogen, organic matter and/or metals.10, 18, 58, 107 The most reactive ROS, \u00b7OH, da mages cellular components such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids108 and inhibits bacterial carbon uptake.57 UV-induced reactions involving iron or copper and hydrogen pe roxide (Figure 5-4) can be an important source of \u00b7OH in iron-rich, sunlit surface waters18, 109 and can enhance the oxidative activity of aquatic systems. The hydroxyl radical and other ROS also react with natural compounds and man-made chemicals such as pharmaceuticals110-112, certain herbicides113 and commercial dyes114, as well as with naturally-occurring orga nic matter such as lignin115 and DOM.16-18, 58, 116-118 The oxidation of contaminants by ROS, however, is not always beneficial but may increase the toxicity of contaminants as in the case of merc ury (see above subsection \" Mercury\"). Interactions Between UV Radiation an d Other Co-Occurring Environmental Changes Changes in the surface flux of UV will interact wi th co-occurring changes in climate, land use and atmospheric carbon dioxide all of which have the potential to influe nce the biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the future, changes in temperature and rainfall patterns119, cloud cover, forest fires120, aquatic biological production, deforested land surfaces and aquatic circulation will inte ract with themselves and with changing surface UV radiation. These interactions will affect biogeochemical cycles, including carbon cycling, movement of CDOM from land to water, stra tification of aquatic ecosystems, and trace gas exchange between the biosphere and atmosphere. Interactions Involving Carbon Cycling The effects of environmental change on carbon cy cling may interact with those of solar UV radiation via changes in carbon fi xation, storage and release, as discussed above. The greatest Interactive effects of solar UV radiati on and climate change on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 145 source of uncertainty in global carb on budgets of terrestrial ecosyste ms appears to be the tropical regions, where the balance between the high pot ential carbon fixation of tropical forests is balanced by substantial carbon release due to deforestation and other changes in land use.2, 20 Since the effects of stratospheric ozone deplet ion on the UV climate of the tropics are minimal121, 122, these uncertainties may be of little impor tance in assessing ecosystem responses to interactions between ozone depletion and climate change in this region. However, it is notable that several reports indicate that the main driver of increased carbon fixation in tropical forests is an increase in total solar radiation driven by changing patterns of clouds.123, 124 The ecological effects of increased exposure to UV due to decreased clouds are unclear since, unlike stratospheric ozone depletion, variation in cloud cover will cause concurre nt changes in both UV and photosynthetic radiation. While many tropical plants are considered tolerant of UV, significant UV responses have recently been reported in a range of tropical plants.42, 43, 125 Thus, there is potential for a UV contribution to ecosyst em responses to altered cloud cover even in the tropics, although this is likely to be species-specific. In a ddition, changes in aerosols, for example from affect UV-B radi ation more than phot osynthetic radiation122 with unknown ecological consequences. There is a clearer understanding of large-scale carbon budgets in temperate and high latitude regions, especially for the Northern He misphere. Analysis of atmospheric CO 2 trends in the Northern Hemisphere since 1994 provides ev idence that warming may be increasing CO 2 fixation in spring, but this eff ect is offset by reductions in photosynthesis due to increasing summer drought.126 While remote imaging shows greeni ng at high latitudes over the last two decades127, 128 and increases in the length of the growing season, such changes do not occur in all high-latitude ecosystems perhaps due to interactions with water supply.129, 130 Carbon sequestration in high latitude forests due to warm ing may also be offset by increased respiration from burned forests.131 Thus, while effects of changes in the growing season of carbon budgets may interact with changes in UV exposure,1 these interactions remain ha rd to predict. Especially at high latitudes future climate changes are al so likely to contribute strongly to changes in ecosystem distribution132 (Figure 5-6), and since UV effect s on both carbon fixation and release are specific to particular plan ts or ecosystems (see above and Chapter 3), this may significantly alter regional responses to changing UV climates . Increased temperatures generally increase decomposition rates, but the magnitude of temper ature dependence varies substantially between different types of organic matter. While there is clearly a considerable variation in temperature dependence, carbon release from soils, reflectin g microbial processes, appears to be more sensitive than that from living plants.22 There is recent evidence for both soil organic matter133- 136 and leaf litters137 that the temperature sensitivity of decomposition increases with decreasing litter quality. It is also nota ble that increased temperature ma y particularly favour those soil microbes best able to decompose recalcitrant organic material.138 These effects of warming might interact with those caused by UV-B (see above), and this may be particularly pertinent for \"high latitude\" ecosystems where future changes ar e likely to be the most dynamic in the Earth system (see Chapter 1). Carbon release may also be influenced by many co-occurring environmental changes. Recent research shows that the effects of elevated CO 2 on carbon release from soil are complex.139-142 The mechanisms involved include increased root growth143, 144, altered litter quality145, and changes in the soil microbial community146-149, and so may interact with comparable responses caused by changing UV-B (see above). Interactions between UV and drought may occur through similar mechanisms , since drought substantially inhibits soil Interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on biogeochemical cycling 146 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 respiration150-152 and even mild water deficits can redu ce the carbon flow from roots to the soil microbial community153 and increase the abundance of phenolic degrading bacteria.154 Effects of Climate Change on Carbon Input s from Terrestrial to Aquatic Systems and Implications for Aquatic Ecosystems Deforestation and changes in land use have s ubstantial effects on carbon losses from soils via leaching or run-off into water bodies where it is an important source of CDOM and DOM. Shifts in soil moisture content and related changes in oxygen content affect th e microbial production of soil humic substances and thus can alter inputs of this important s ource of CDOM in freshwaters. UV-induced transformation of CDOM differs be tween aquatic and terrestrially derived DOM due to differences in composition, particularly ph enolic content. Given the well-defined effects of elevated UV-B on the phenolic chemistry of litte r and root exudates, it is possible that the composition of DOM leaching from or running-off terrestrial systems could be altered, with consequent effects in aquatic systems. That mechanism remains unexplored, but there are many ways by which climate change may enhance UV-induced CDOM bleaching. Warming affects Figure 5-6. Climate change is expected to result in substantial shifts in the distribution of major ecosystems. Present and projected future geographic distributions of vegetation types north of 55\u00baN are illustrated here: A, Present-day potential natural vegetation; B, The potential vegetation driven by the mean climate of the decade 2090 - 2100 simulated by the HADCM2-SUL coupled model, using the IS92a scenario. The future vegetation types were predicted from climatology using a set of plant functional types embedded in the biogeochemistry-biogeography model BIOME4.132 Interactive effects of solar UV radiati on and climate change on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 147 the composition of CDOM produced by microbial decomposition of seagrass, rendering CDOM more susceptible to UV-induced bleaching.155 Climate-related changes in continental hydrology can alter the production and transport of UV- absorbing substances from land to the ocean. These changes involve a lterations in discharge rates from rivers and the chemical content of the water transported a nd mixed into the ocean. Important factors influencing thes e changes include climate-related changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation, exte nt of land use change, dams and anthropogenic and natural chemical inputs to the river basins. For example, in Arctic systems boreal wetlands are the major source of DOM in streams, rivers, lakes and the coastal ocean. Changes in temperature, precipitation and CO 2 affect the concentration and di scharge of DOM from terrestrial ecosystems.156, 157 UV-B radiation induces the degradati on of CDOM in aquatic system and is especially significant at high latitudes.1, 55 Degradation of terrestrially-derived DOM in the Arctic Ocean limits its move ment into the deep ocean.6 The effect of past climate changes on aquatic-terrestrial interactions also has been demonstrated.158 Paleoecological techniques were used to demonstrate that periods of deforestat ion over the past 10,000 years were associated with rapid declines in the inputs of UV-absorbing CDOM, which in turn caused up to a ten-fold reduction in algal biomass. Climate-related change s in ice and snow cover will result in a greater area of the high latitude biosphere being expos ed directly to UV-B (also see Figure 5-6). Climate Change and Mixing in Aquatic Systems UV-induced bleaching of CDOM in the surface la yers of aquatic systems is intensified by stratification.159 Climate models predict that global warming will result in reduced vertical mixing and increased stratification in the upper ocean.160-162 Thus, the effects of elevated UV-B may interact with the effects of climate change on stratification, and the quantity and chemical composition of inputs from terrestrial systems. Observations in Europe during the 2003 heat- wave demonstrated that warming can enhance lake stratification.163 Climate-related changes in atmospheric circulation and related changes in vertical mixing dynamics in the ocean and freshwaters can also affect UV exposure of aquati c organisms. For example, in the case of phytoplankton in the ocean, increased variab ility in the deep chlorophyll maximum164 could result in more variable UV exposure, with possible consequences for primary production. Moreover, UV-B damage to microorganisms is st rongly affected by changes in climate-induced mixing of the upper layers of aquatic environmen ts and thus will affect carbon and nutrient cycling and the production and consumption of trace gases. Satellite imagery has provided a first view of th e global distribution of C DOM that controls the penetration of UV-B into the sea.165 Photoreactions of CDOM and changes in ocean circulation patterns related to El Ni\u00f1o events st rongly influence CDOM distributions. Remote sensing techniques also facilitate the global high resolution analysis of aquatic UV impacts on marine biogeochemical cycles. Relationships have been developed between remotely sensed ocean colour and UV attenuation in coas tal regions of the ocean. The relationships were applied to determine changes in UV penetration into the Mi d-Atlantic and South-At lantic Bight near the eastern coast of the U.S.A.166 These recent studies highlight th e possibility of monitoring from space the interactions of climate-related mixing trends with the chemical compounds that are produced from UV interactions. Interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on biogeochemical cycling 148 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 Interactions between Ozone Depletion and Climate Change Mediated Via Changes in Trace Gases Abundance and Chemistry The budgets of trace gases such as me thane, halocarbons, nitrogen oxides (NO x) and carbon monoxide may be influenced by changing sola r UV radiation, and thro ugh their effects on atmospheric chemistry some may also influence ozone (Chapter 6). Since climate change may influence the budgets of these trace gases, they ar e a key link between ozone depletion and other elements of environment change. There is in creasing understanding of th e responses of specific trace gases to climate change. As discussed in our previous report1, at high latitudes ice and snow can play a key role in the budgets of many trace ga ses. Climate change is having major effects on ice and snow cover, and hence on the budge ts of trace gases such as bromoform, NOx, alkenes, formaldehyde and CO.1 These reactions have conseque nces for concentrations of tropospheric ozone at high latit udes (see Chapters 1 and 6). New, high-resolution models of oceanic ecosy stems have been developed which provide estimates of phytoplankton and trace gas distribu tions with high spatial resolution globally. Figure 5-7 illustrates the use of such Earth system models to es timate global distributions of surface ocean DMS based on a global ocean biogeo chemistry physical circulation model. The ability to use high performance computing that enables future biogeochemical states to be estimated will allow assessments of UV stress on ocean ecosystems over the next 100 years.167 The use of this type of global Earth system models can provide future estimates of O 3 and UV levels that contribute to trace gas exchange between the surface ocean and the atmosphere. Methane, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds Enhanced UV-B can reduce emissions of methan e from peatland ecosystems and paddy fields, and this is partly explained by morp hological changes in plant structure.23 Emissions of methane from wetland ecosystems are highly depe ndent on the plant species present23, 24, 168 and so could be affected by changes in ecosystem distribution (Figure 5-6). Recent research has demonstrated that plants themselves can be methan e sources, even under aerobic conditions169, although the contribution of such emissions to global meth ane budgets remains unclear. Changes in light and temperature affect plant production of methane but the role of UV-B is unknown. Thus, changes in UV might alter methane budgets through effects on the balance of different plant species, or on plant morphology. In addition, the soil can be a net sink for methane in some terrestrial ecosystems.170, 171 Other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from terrestrial vegetation (e.g., isoprene) are indirect sources of CO 2172 and are important in the chemistr y of the troposphere, which in turn may influence the UV climate (see Chapters 1 and 6). The production of VOCs is sensitive to elements of climate such as increased CO 2 concentration, drought and warming.173, 174 There are substantial emissi ons of carbon monoxide from both terrestrial and marine ecosystems.1 In terrestrial ecosystems major peaks of CO are associated with periods of large- scale forest burning.175, 176 CO emissions from terrestrial ecosystems are partly caused by photodegradation, in which solar UV plays a major role.1, 177, 178 This is consistent with the observation that increases in CO emissions following burning are exacerbated by sunlight177 and demonstrates the potential for interactions between burning and changi ng UV on CO emissions. Interactive effects of solar UV radiati on and climate change on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 149 Halogen-Containing Compounds Climate change and UV-B influence the budget of halogen-containing compounds that alter ozone chemistry in the atmosphere (see Chapters 1 and 6). The generation of halogen atoms in atmospheric aerosols can be driven by processe s involving UV radiation in the marine boundary layer. Emissions of halomethanes related to c limate change may interact with the flux of UV-B to the Earth's surface to m odulate trends in atmospheric ozone concentrations. Terrestrial ecosystems may be sources or sinks of methyl halides, the balance depending on a range of environmental variables.179-182 Increased temperatures str ongly influence emissions of methyl bromide and methyl iodide from plants180, 182-184, but nothing is known about direct UV effects on these emissions. The observation that ectomycorrhizal fungi are significant sources of methyl halides181 may be pertinent since increasing UV can a ffect the activity of these fungi in at least some systems.185 Agricultural ecosystems remain a significant source of methyl bromide due to its continued use as a horticultural fumiga nt. The phase-out of methyl bromide fumigant has been constrained by the perc eived lack of alternatives for the control of major soil-borne Figure 5-7. Dimethylsulfide plays a substantial role in the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation in the marine atmosphere. This figure shows the global distribution of the flux of DMS from the ocean to the atmosphere, based on a model created by the use of a detailed ecosystem model of oceanic nutrients, phytoplankton and DMS production.167 As climate change occurs and ocean circulation changes this will alter the surface ocean distributions of DMS and change the exposure to surface UV-B. This is an example of how climate change alters the exposure of climate reactive chemicals to UV-B radiation that is dependent on atmospheric ozone distributions. Interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on biogeochemical cycling 150 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 pests and pathogens, but recent research is poin ting to economically viable alternatives, both chemical and biological.186-189 Recent observations indicate that atmospheric methyl bromide concentrations are decreasing at a rate of 2.5 - 3.0 % per year.190 However, because biogenic emissions of methyl bromide from terrestri al ecosystems generally respond positively to increased temperature, future gl obal warming may change the curre nt rate of decline of methyl bromide concentrations in the atmosphere. Marine systems also have signifi cant influences on concentratio ns of halogenated compounds in the atmosphere.1 Photoreactions involving UV can degrad e brominated and in water191, 192 and halocarbons also are hydrolyzed in the ocean.1 Halogen chemistry as related to oceanic releases of organic and inorganic bromine and chlorine has impacts on atmospheric ozone.193, 194 The production of bromocarbons by marine al gae in tropical surf ace waters leads to significant emissions to the atmosphere.193, 194 Since these emissions of halogen containing compounds occur in the same region as significant deep oceanic convection, there is evidence that this oceanic source of bromine influences tropospheric ozone concentrations. Photolysis of bromocarbons and reactions with \u00b7 OH create BrO that interacts with the ozone cycle. This is an example of where the physical climate system , through atmospheric dynamics and circulation, has feedbacks and interactions with the atmos pheric chemical systems that influence ozone concentrations and surface UV-B fluxes (also see Chapter 6). Sulfur Gases Sulfur emissions from the ocean are affected by interactions between UV-B radiation and climate change. Of particular interest are dimethylsulfide (DMS) a nd carbonyl sulfide (COS). DMS emissions influence the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation in the marine atmosphere. Oceanic emissions of DMS produce particulates (i.e ., sulfate aerosols) that directly and indirectly have a cooling effect on the marine atmosphere. Upper ocean mixing dynamics and the depth of the mixed laye r can alter the effect s of solar UV radiation on the biological production of DMS.1 Several new studies have shown that UV and climate changes strongly influence sea to air exchange of DMS by interacting with biologi cal and photochemical sinks of DMS in the upper ocean. Loss of DMS induced by UV-B is an important determinant of its concentrations in the surface ocean.195-198 However, the effects of enhanced UV-B on DMS emissions are complex and can vary from one ocean region to another.199-201 The results indicate that the influence of DMS-related atmospheric su lfate particles is modul ated by the levels of surface UV radiation. As discusse d previously UV may play a role in the production of carbonyl sulfide, the most concentrated sulfur gas in the troposphere.1 New research has clarified this role.202 Nitrogen containing compounds Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) can particip ate in tropospheric reacti ons that affect air quality (see Chapter 6). One new finding has indicated that UV radiation induces NOx emissions from terrestrial plants.203 NOx emissions can also be affected by elements of climate change204 and especially by management practices in agroecosystems.205, 206 Concluding Remarks Since our last report in 2002 there has been increasing international recognition of the interactions and feedbacks betw een climate change and surfa ce UV radiation, especially in Interactive effects of solar UV radiati on and climate change on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 151 relation to biogeochemical cycles. It is in the nature of many of these interactions that they act over medium-long time scales and as a result, unders tanding of the consequences remains limited. It is clear that climate related changes in the input of organic matter to water bodies influences the penetration of UV in to aquatic ecosystems. However, the role of such changes in specific regions, especially at high la titudes, remains uncertain. The following have been identified as important areas of uncertainty: The interactions between trace gas generation and UV-B exposure. The role of UV-B radiation in the formation of bio-available metal species in aquatic systems. The link between the chemical composition an d the bio- and photo- reactivity of DOM. The interactions of climate change induced ecosystem changes with changing surface UV-B radiation. The effects of the changing surface UV-B envi ronment on future trends in climate and atmospheric chemistry. The role of UV-B in controlling biogeochem ical cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, especially in the c ontext of changing patterns of drought and cloud-cover resulting from climate change. The influence of climate-induced changes in aquatic mixing and stratification and continental runoff on biogeochemical cy cling in freshwaters and the ocean.

The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 165 Chapter 6. Changes in troposphe ric composition and air quality due to stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change S. R. Wilsona, K. R. Solomonb, and X. Tangc aDepartment ty of Guelph, ON, N1G 2W1, Canada c Peking University, Center of Enviro nmental Sciences, Beijing 100871, China Summary It is well-understood that reducti ons in air quality play a signifi cant role in bot h environmental and human health. Interactions between oz one depletion and global climate change will significantly alter atmospheric chem istry which, in turn, will cause changes in concentrations of natural and human-made gasses and aerosols. M odels predict that tropo spheric ozone near the surface will increase globally by up to 10 to 30 ppbv (33 to 100% increase) during the period 2000 to 2100. With the increase in the amount of the stratospheric ozone, increased transport from the stratosphere to the troposphere will result in different responses in polluted and unpolluted areas. In contrast, global changes in tropospheric hydroxyl ra dical (OH) are not predicted to be large, except wh ere influenced by the presence of oxidizable organic matter, such as from large-scale forest fires. Recent measur ements in a relatively clean location over 5 years showed that OH concentrations can be predicted by the intensity of solar ultraviolet radiation. If this relationship is confirmed by further observati ons, this approach could be used to simplify assessments of air quality. Analysis of surface- level ozone observations in Antarctica suggests that there has been a significan t change in the chemistry of th e boundary layer of the atmosphere in this region as a result of stratospheric ozone depletion. The oxi dation potential of the Antarctic boundary layer is estimated to be gr eater now than before the development of the ozone hole. Recent modeling studies have suggested that io dine and iodine-containing substances from natural sources, such as the ocean, may increase stratospheric ozone depl etion significantly in polar regions during spring. Given the uncertainty of the fate of iodine in the stratosphere, the results may also be relevant for stratospheric oz one depletion and measurem ents of the influence of these substances on ozone depletion should be considered in the future. In agreement with known usage and atmospheric lo ss processes, tropospheric concentrations of HFC-134a, the main human-made source of trifluoro acetic acid (TFA), is increasing rapidly. As HFC-134a is a potent greenhouse gas; this increa sing concentration has implications for climate change. However, the risks to humans and the environment from substances, such as TFA, produced by atmospheric degradation of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are considered minima l. Perfluoropolyethers, commonly used as industrial heat transfer fluids and proposed as chloro-hydrofluorocarbon (CHFC) substitutes, show great stability to chemical degradation in the atmosphere. These substances have been suggested as substitutes for CHFCs but, as they are very persiste nt in the atmosphere, they may be important contributors to global warming. It is not known whether these substances will Changes in tropospheric composition and air quality due to stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change 166 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 contribute significantly to global warming and its interaction with ozone depletion but they should be considered for further evaluation. Introduction Reductions in air quality (from th e presence of pollutants in the atmosphere) play a significant role in both environmental and human health. Poor air quality can lead to many adverse outcomes such as acid rain and respiratory diseas e. In the context of this assessment, it is recognized that increases in concentrations of tropospheric ozone and harmful substances generated from ozone have been shown to have significant impacts on human health as well as in the environment, particularly on plants. These effects have been wide ly reported and reviewed1-7 and are not discussed further here . The quality of the air depends on a wide range of factors, including how rapidly chemicals are released and the reactions these substances undergo once they are released into the atmosphere. Sola r UV-B radiation (280 - 315 nm) provides the energy for many of the chemical transformations that oc cur in the atmosphere. For example, the energy provided causes photolysis of a number of important atmospheric trace gases, such as sulfur dioxide (SO 2), formaldehyde (HCHO), and ozone (O 3). These processes will be altered by anything that changes the amount of UV-B radiation, including th e elevation of the sun, clouds, and attenuation by some air pollutants. The release of Ozone Depleting S ubstances (ODS), when transporte d to the stratosphere, reduces the amount of ozone. Decreases in stratospheric ozone lead to enhanced UV-B radiation in the lower atmosphere (troposphere), increasi ng the rate of the photolytic processes.8, 9 As a result, there is a direct link between stratos pheric ozone depletion and air quality. There are other factors that cha nge the reactive chemistry of the atmosphere, including increased air pollution and the emissions of climatically important greenhouse gases. Changes in climate can also dramatically change the chemistry of the atmosphere. Higher temperatures can lead to increases in the rates of chemical reactions, in the amount of water vapo r present, and thus OH production10 as well as enhance emissions of volatile organic compounds such as isoprene from biological sources.11 All of these factors then potentially interact in determining the actual atmospheric condition.12, 13 Thus, while change in atmospheric composition and circulation are observed, assigning cause and effect requires careful assessment. The replacements for the original ozone depletin g chemicals (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)), such as the hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) a nd the hydrofluorocarbons HFCs, decompose primarily in the lower atmosphere. This d ecomposition can produce chemicals that impact air quality.8 Here we present a summary of recent work on understanding the impacts of ozone depletion, ozone depleting chemicals and their replacemen ts on atmospheric composition and how these may interact with climate change. This is an update of the information in the previous report.8 Stratosphere - Troposphere Exchange One direct impact of stratospheric ozone depl etion is a potential reduc tion in the amount of ozone transported into the tropos phere (Stratosphere Troposphere Ex change, STE). It has been estimated that there has been an approximate 30% reduction in the amount of ozone transported from the stratosphere to the tropospher e due to stratospheric ozone depletion.14 While there is agreement that ozone concentrations in the uppe r troposphere are very sensitive to change in Changes in tropospheric composition and air quality due to stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 167 stratospheric ozone, there remains a divergence of opinion on the sensitivity of ground-level ozone. Some calculations have predicted that up to 40% of ground-level ozone is due to transport of ozone from the stratosp here, depending on season and location,15, 16 but other estimates are a factor of two lower.14 All three models estimate that the contribution of vertically transported ozone to ground-level ozone concentrat ions is smallest in summer compared with other season in both hemispheres. The mixing of stratospheric air (a nd hence ozone) into the troposphe re is critically dependent on atmospheric circulation. A modeli ng study of the chemistry-climate interactions showed that the rate of ozone transport into th e troposphere is affected by El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events.13 An analysis of satellite ozone measurem ents also detected a dependence on ENSO, although they suggest it is due to the impact of circulation changes on in situ production.17 Climatic variability can therefore mask changes in the contribution of stratospheric ozone to the troposphere due to stratos pheric ozone depletion. The situation is further complicated as stratosphe ric ozone depletion appear s to explain most of the cooling observed in the lower stra tosphere over the last two decades.18 Such a cooling will modify STE, although it is not cl ear that this has been explic itly included in most current atmospheric models. We can conclude, however, that stratospheric ozone depletion will have a significant but small impact on tropospheri c ozone amounts to date due to STE. Significant longer-term increases in the amount of ozone brought into the troposphere from the stratosphere have been predicted due to climate change (80% by 2100).19 This calculation ignored the increase in stratos pheric ozone, which woul d increase the strato spheric-tropospheric transport further. Such changes in the upper troposphere are not dir ectly convertible into ground-level concentrations due to possible changes in chemical processes in the troposphere. However, predictions indicate that ground-level ozone is likely to increase significantly in the next century,14, 15 a trend enhanced by increases in strato spheric ozone. The predictions of these models could be verified against measured concen trations. However, the number of sites with long-term temporal and spatial measurements is fe w. This is an obvious data gap that could be addressed with collection of additional monitoring information. Atmospheric photolysis There has been ongoing work studying the fundamental atmospheric processes that are driven by solar radiation and, in particul ar, by UV-B radiation. Synthese s of data (photolysis cross sections and reaction rates) have recently been produced.20-22 This section summarizes some of the key recent outcomes of this work. Ozone in the troposphere . Ozone in the lower atmosphere plays a number of key roles. Due to its adverse impact upon both human and environmen tal health in many regions (e.g., European Union2), it is used as a key indicator of air quality. Photolysis of ozone in the lower atmosphere is the primary source of the hydroxyl radical (OH) in unpolluted, humid environments, and OH initiat es the removal process for most organic chemicals in the atmosphere, including methane and CO. It is estimated that OH initiates the destruction of 3 700 million tonn es of trace gases each year, including many gases involved in ozone depletion, the greenhouse e ffect, and urban air pollution.23 These reactions lead to the formation of products which are subsequently taken up by cloud droplets and precipitation and Changes in tropospheric composition and air quality due to stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change 168 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 washed out of the atmosphere. OH therefore plays a dominant role in the ability of the atmosphere to \"cleanse\" itself. The formation of OH radical in clean environmen ts is described by the following two reactions: 1 32 ( 340 ) ( D) Oh n m OO +< + (1) 1 2 (D ) 2OH O O H + (2) The key ozone photolysis product fo r the formation of OH is the O(1D) atom. O(1D) is an oxygen atom that has sufficient energy to react with H 2O. Another possible produ ct of light absorption by ozone is the less energetic O(3P) oxygen atom which has insuffi cient energy to react with water (reaction (2)) and primarily reacts with oxygen again to form ozone. The chemical reactions have been discusse d in more detail elsewhere.9 The production rate of O(1D) depends critically on the amount of UV radiation which, in turn, is dependent upon stratospheric ozone. As stratospheric ozone depleti on increases solar radiation in the critical wavelength region, th e loss of stratospheric ozone woul d be expected to lead to an increase in tropospheric O(1D), if nothing else changed. Th e total rate of production of O(1D) is determined by the concentration of oz one and the photodissociation constant J, which is given by () .(,) . (,) JF T T d =, (6.1) where the integral is over wavelength ( ) at the temperature T. Here F() is the actinic flux, a measure of the amount of solar radiation av ailable for initiating th e chemical reaction, (,) is the strength of ozone abso rption (cross section) and (,) is the efficiency (quantum yield) of O(1D) production. The wavelength dependence of these is shown in Figure 6-1. With decreasing wavelength, the actinic flux ( F()) of solar radiation decreases dramatically due to the absorption by (mainly stratospheric) ozone, but the efficiency of production increases (given by the product (,)(,) ). This results in a small range of wavelengths (primarily in the UV-B region) where the maximum production of O(1D) occurs. The wavelength of maximum O(1D) production shifts depending on the amou nt of stratospheric ozone, the elevation of the sun above the horizon, and environmental parameters such as temperature. There have been significant advances in the determination of the actinic flux (see Chapter 1), which is more formally defined as the amount of solar radiation available at a point in the atmosphere. There are instruments designed to m easure actinic flux directly. 24, 25 However, most measurements are of irradiance (the solar energy falling on a horizontal surface - see Figure 6-2). Methods have now been developed for converting irradiance to actinic flux. 26-31 The uncertainty in irradiance-derived actinic flux for J(O1D) is greater than 300 320 340Relative units Wavelength (nm)Solar radiation Ozone absorption Relative O(1D) production rate Figure 6-1. Production rate of O(1D) as a function of wavelength with a solar zenith angle of 60\u00b0 Changes in tropospheric composition and air quality due to stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 169 for directly measured values. The uncertainty in the conversion of irradiance into actinic flux depends on the solar zenith angle, wavelength, an d ambient conditions, but can be as low as 7% (95% confidence).27 The quantum yield ( (,) ) for production of O(1D) in the wavelength region around 308 nm is crucial. First, this is the wavelength of maxi mum production. Secondly, many of the estimates of the quantum yield at other wa velengths have been made relati ve to the quantum yield at 308 nm. Recent work has reduced the uncertainty in the quantum yield at 308 nm (298K = 25\u00baC) by nearly a factor of two.32 These new values agree closely w ith previous best estimates based on the average of various laboratory measurements.20 It is now realized that the quantum yield for O(1D) production is non-zero up to at least 340 nm. While at these longer wavelengths the product (,)(,) is small (Figure 6-1), this longer wavelength dependence does reduce the dependence of O(1D) on the amount of stratospheric ozone.20, 22 This has resulted in very good agreement between chemical and spectroradiometric measurements of the photolysis rate. 33 Measurements and models of UV actinic flux at the surface now show good agreement. 34 Similarly, measurements of OH and chemical model predictions of OH based on UV radiation measurements now normally agree to within measurement accuracy in remote, clean observation sites. 35, 36 As discussed in Chapter 1, the impact of clouds on actinic flux can be as large. 37 With such large variations, any future changes in cloud amount due to climate change could significantly change photochemically induced atmospheric processes. In air substantially affected by land, other sources of OH have now been recognized as impo rtant, such as the photolysis of nitrous acid (HONO) (predominantly by UV-A radiation) in both urban environments 38 and in forests.39 The wide variety of compounds presen t and variability of the atmospheric composition in continental air makes modeling assessments, like those described above for clean remote sites, very difficult. Observed changes in OH. The OH radical has a very short atmospheric lifetime and is present in very small amounts, making direct detection of long term trends impossi ble. Two alternative methods have been used to determ ine global trends in OH indirectly. The main method used for OH-trend detection involves interpretation of the long-term record of methylchloroform (Cl 3C-CH 3; 1,1,1-trichloroethane). Its only source is anthropogenic and the dominant sink is reaction with OH. With a good knowledge of the source, it is possible to infer the removal rate, and hence the amount of OH. Original estimates based on this technique suggested that there was lit tle change in OH since 1980.40 More recent analysis suggested substantial changes in the amount of OH occurred during the 1990s.41 The issue of unaccounted Actinic flux : The photochemically active radiation flux in the earth's atmosphere. This flux is spherically integrated and is not dependent the direction of the radiation. Irradiance : The radiation flux incident on a (horizontal) surface. Figure 6-2. Two commonly used measures of the \"intensity\" of solar radiation from the sun. Both have units of W\u00b7m-2 Changes in tropospheric composition and air quality due to stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change 170 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 emissions of methylchloroform has been raised. The magnitude of methylchloroform emissions from landfills has been debated as a result of measurements in Europe42, 43 and the US.44, 45 Consideration has also been given to the magnitude of ocean exchange,46 which illustrates how difficult it is to account for the complexity of the atmosphere.47 The most recent assessment, including a consideration of thes e factors, indicates that OH c oncentrations in 2003 are very similar to those of 1978, with the major alterations in the global OH concentration being driven by wildfires and climatic variations.23 Global increases in the OH concentration due to stratospheric ozone depletion48, 49 are therefore masked by other factors or are smaller than the uncertainties of the measurements themselves. A second method of estimating OH has recently been developed using 14CO.50 No significant trend in OH for the Southern Hemisphere in the 19 90s could be detected. Unfortunately, the data do not extend back far enough in time to be especially sensitive to changes induced by stratospheric ozone depletion. A five-year study of OH at a European mountain site 51 found no detectable long term trend in OH concentration, and highlighted that, in this so mewhat polluted site, there were clearly factors that were affecting OH concentration that were not part of existing atmospheric chemical models.51, 52 Rohrer and Berresheim51 concluded that OH concen tration is essentially proportional to J(O1D) and that scaling of OH by J(O1D), which depends on solar UV radiation, eliminated most of the diurnal and seasonal vari ation, and transformed OH into a parameter with significantly reduced variability, provided that factors dependent on local conditions are considered.51 Rohrer and Berresheim51 proposed that regional or even global OH distributions could be characterized by a simple set of coeffi cients for timescales on the order of months or even years and suggested that this approach may be used to define an 'OH index' that characterizes the oxidation efficiency of the trop osphere in different chemical regimes. This would establish a direct link between stratosphe ric ozone concentrations and OH concentrations on regional scales. An overarching issue is that most of these models are based on measured data from a limited number of locations, such as in Europe, Japan, North America, and over the Pacific. The troposphere still remains largely under-sampled with respect to OH measurements from the tropics (rain forests) or very large citi es such as those in East Asia, key areas for the understanding of how climate change and air qu ality will influence each other in the near future.53 Global numerical models of OH in the atmosphere have advanced significantly. Three dimensional models that include the importa nt known atmospheric chemistry processes 54 are now being augmented with models that include atmospheric transport.55 Such models will be useful in assessing the impacts of climate ch ange on OH concentrations. One such study has been carried out for the United States, which pred icts an increase in OH of between 10 and 15%, and significant increases in ozone in the eastern states.56 Observed changes in tropospheric ozone. Hydroxyl radicals (OH) are believed to be one of the major reactive intermediates in the atmosphe re. As stated earlier, the process of the production of hydroxyl radicals couples stratosp heric ozone depletion directly to tropospheric chemistry. The chemistry of hydroxyl radicals with organic compounds can be simply summarized in two generalized reactions: 3organic compounds removalOH O (4) Changes in tropospheric composition and air quality due to stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 171 or 3 organic compounds removalOH NOO + (5) The distinction between the two routes (4) and (5 ) is the amount of nitric oxide (NO) in the atmosphere, with the first route occurring at low NO concentrations found in remote (clean) environments. Estimates have been made of the impact of stratospheric ozone de pletion on tropospheric chemistry, using ground-level ozone as the primary indicator. There are two competing processes. A decrease in strato spheric ozone will decrease the amou nt of ozone transported from the stratosphere to the troposphere (as disc ussed earlier). Secondly, the reduction in stratospheric ozone will lead to enhanced UV-B ra diation, leading to a change in ozone due to the photolytically driven OH reactions shown above. Two different chemical transport models have been used, with Isaksen et al.57 calculating the impact of a uniform 10% decrease in ozone column, and Fusco and Logan14 using the measured stratospheric ozone amounts from 1979 and 1993. The results from Isaksen et al.57 are shown in Figure 6-3 for both the ozone amount (left hand panels) and the change in ground-level ozone (right hand panels). While the details of the models are quite different , the broad conclusions they draw are similar. In clean Southern Hemi spheric air, the ground-l evel ozone amount is predicted to decrease with d ecreased stratospheric ozone (Equ ation (4)). In the northern hemisphere, a slight increase in ozone amounts is predicted with decreasing stratospheric ozone 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 77 -3 -2.5 -1.9 (nmol/mol) Change in ground level ozone (nmol/mol) Figure 6-3.

Some features of the m odeled results differ, and the swap between ozone removal and production would be expected at lower nitrogen oxide concentrations (e.g.58), however, the changes estimated by the models indicate that the magnitude of the induced change in tropospheric ozone is small in comp arison with the impact s of air pollution.14, 59 The impact of likely future changes in atmosphe ric composition has been assessed using eleven different atmospheric climate models, and they predicted that tropospheric ozone will increase globally by 10 to 30 ppbv from 2000 to 2100.60 These models have ignored the impact of changes in atmospheric circulation, and so this increase is driven by the increase in anthropogenic emissions of gases like NO/NO 2 and hydrocarbons. Stratospheric ozone recovery is predicted to increase tropos pheric ozone by a further 3 ppbv.60 Other relevant photolytic processes. Ketones such as acetone ((CH 3)2CO), are present in the atmosphere either due to direct release at the ground or as a product of the decomposition of a range of organic compounds. They are important atmospheric trace gases,61 playing a key role in the formation and transport of pollutants. For example, acetone can decompose via direct photolysis or via OH, which can be abbreviated as follows: 32 3()CH CO OH CH COO + (6) 32 3 2CH NO CH COONO + (7) The product CH 3COONO 2 (PAN) is a well known urban polluta nt but is also stable at upper troposphere temperatures, and has been recogniz ed as a means of long-range transport of pollutants, such as reactive nitrogen.62 A reassessment of the direct photolysis reaction for acetone63 and for some other ketones64 has significantly decreased estimates of their overall photolytic sensitivity (quantum yield) in the UV-B region. The changes increase the relative importance of the UV-B region, but decreases the calculated rate of photolysis by 80 - 90%.65 This indicates that acetone will be quite widely distributed in the upper tropos phere in both hemispheres and he nce available for reaction to produce PAN. Consequently, the reaction with OH is now understood to be the dominant loss mechanism for acetone. When incl uded in calculations of the global atmosphere, these changes improve the agreement between the th eoretical estimates and observations.65 The photolysis rate for formaldehyde, one of th e key products of the atmospheric decomposition of organic molecules, has been investigated. Th ere are two different r outes for decay, and the rate of both routes will depend on stratospheri c ozone. Methods for deriving the photolysis rate from irradiance have been proposed,31 although to date such estimates have not been widely used. Antarctic atmosphere. Surface ozone at the South Pole is of particular interest as it lies underneath the region of greatest stratospheric oz one depletion. An analysis of measurement records has shown that, during November - D ecember, there was a decrease in ground-level ozone over the period 1970 - 1990.66 Since 1990, there has been a de tectable increase in surface ozone (up to 20%).67 Changes in tropospheric composition and air quality due to stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 173 In the clean Antarctic atmosphere, the NO concen trations would be expected to be low enough that enhanced radical chemistry should result in a decrease in ozone (reaction (4)), as observed in the period before 1990. The change after 1990 is attributed to the impact of additional UV radiation on the snowpack, enha ncing nitrogen oxide release.67 The extra NO produced then alters the atmospheric reactions so that additional UV radiation enhances ozone production. This effect is most noticeable during November when th e largest absolute increase in UV radiation is experienced. Measurements made on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet in 2000 - 2002 showed strong evidence of a negative correlation between stratospheri c ozone and ground-level hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2). A 70% increase in surface H 2O2 concentration under co nditions of low stratospheric ozone (less than 220DU compared to around 320 DU) has been observed.68 The increase in hydrogen peroxide was explained by an enhanced photo lysis of ozone and NO production (see box). If the impact of UV radiation on NO was not included in a theoretical model, it failed to capture the magnitude of the observed H 2O2 changes.68 These changes imply that the atmospheric boundary layer in Antarctica has become more oxidi zing due to stratospheric ozone depletion. The ecological impact of this has not been studied. Impact of air pollution on photolysis by UV-B radiation. The transmission of UV-B radiation to the Earth's surface is increas ed by removal of stratospheri c ozone. The reduction in UV-B radiation by aerosols, and pr imarily carbon black from comb ustion has been found to be significant.38 A global chemical transport model69 has been used to estimate the impact of aerosols on tropospheric chemistry. Calculations of the impact of aerosols indicate that they typically cause a 1 - 5% reduction in radiation driving O(1D) formation (UV-B radiation) in Photolysis of ozone a nd NO in the Antarctic The importance of photolysis was elegantly de monstrated by measurements of a second peroxide, methylhydroperoxide (CH 3OOH). In this clean environment, the following two reactions represent a significan t fraction of the OH reactions: 22 2 CO OH O CO HO++ + (8) 422 3 CH OH O H O CH OO ++ + (9) It should be noted that there are other reactions which produce these radicals. HO 2 can then react to form H 2O2 or other peroxides: 22 2 2 2HO H O O + (10) 23 2 3 2HO CH O CH OOH O + + (11) Additional NO can permit the following reactions to become significant: 32 2 2 NO CH OO O NO HCHO HO++ + + (12) 22 NO HO NO OH+ + (13) The NO removes methylpero xide and produces HO 2 (Reaction (13)). So, when UV was enhanced the increased H 2O2 was accompanied by a 20% decrease in CH 3OOH. Changes in tropospheric composition and air quality due to stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change 174 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 general (see Figure 6-4). However, there are re gions, notably in Africa, Europe and Asia where impacts of the order of 30% or more are predic ted due to increased aerosol release. The net effects on ozone concentrations are more mode st (< 5%) and are somewhat smaller than the direct effect of reactio ns on the aerosol surface. Fluorinated substances Volatile halogenated substances have an important role in ozone depletion and global warming. Since several of these substances are used as refrigerants, ther e is a potential for interaction between their use, their effects on ozone, and c limate change. A number of highly fluorinated compounds (PFCs) undergo degradation and tran sformation in the atmosphere and several of these have relevance to interactions between glob al warming and stratospheric ozone depletion. The ultimate degradation products are perfluorinated acids with varying chain lengths, depending on the starting material. The mechanisms of th e atmospheric transport and breakdown of long- and short-chain hydrochlor ofluorocarbons (HCFCs) have been well-characterized70, 71 and the results indicate that they are not likely to form the short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). aldehydes formed the atmospheric oxidation of HFCs, HCFCs, and fluorinated alcohols are transported in the atmosphere dissolved in cloud wa ter and react and are subsequently transported to the surface in precipitation. This mechanism has been identif ied as an additional source of longer chain PFCAs (such as of perfluorooctanoic acid), from the breakdown of fluor otelomer alcohols and possibly explains the presence of perfluorooctanoic acid in remote regions such as the Arctic. 71 These longer chain acids and their parent materi als are very resistant to breakdown and have been observed to become more concentrated up the food chain in mammals and birds,72, 73 where they may have harmful effects.74 (J[O3] ->O1D Jun, Jul, Aug) (J[O3] ->O1D Dec, Jan, Feb) -40 -30 -20 -10 -5 -1 0 Percent change in ground-level ozone concentrations Figure 6-4. Calculated change in ground-level ozone concentration due to the effect of aerosols on (UV-B) photolysis. From Tie et al. 70. Changes in tropospheric composition and air quality due to stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 175 In contrast to the longer chain PFCs discussed above, several of the HCFCs and HFCs can break down into trifluoroacetic acid (T FA Figure 6-5). These are halothane, isoflurane, HCFC 123, HCFC-124, HFC-134a, and HFC-143a. Observations in both hemispheres (Mace Head, Ireland and Cape Grim, Tasmania) between 1998 and 2002 showed that the concentration of HFC-134a had increased rapidly (3 picomol mol-1 year-1) equivalent to 12% year-1 based on measured concentrations of approximately 25 picomol mol-1 year-1 measured in the troposphere at Mace Head, Ireland in 2002.75 This increase is in agreement with the known usage and atmospheric loss processes. As HFC-134a is a potent green house gas, this increa sing concentration has implications for climate change76 as well as the production of TFA. The final environmental sink for TFA is in the oceans and landlocked lake s. Concentrations of TFA in rainwater range from <0.5 to 350 ng L -1, depending on location and distance from anthropogenic activity. 77 The predominant source of TFA in non-oceanic surface waters is likely anthropogenic as concentrations in surface water samples >2 000 years-old obtained from groundwater and ice cores in Greenla nd were not detectable (< 2 ng L -1).78 There are probably natural sources of TFA in seawater; relatively large concentrations have occasionally been detected in close proximity to undersea volcanic vents.79 Concentrations up to 350 ng L-1 in flowing surface waters have been reported from several locations.80-82 However, in landlocked lakes, they may be as large as 40 000 ng L-1.80 Reports of TFA concentrations in oceans are generally less than or equal to 200 ng L-179, 80, 82 and much of this appears to have pre-industrial natural origins.83 Based on historical production84 of HFCs and HCFCs that are potential sources of TFA as well as projections of future uses,76 an estimate of total production was made (Table 6-1). A worst-case estimate of TFA release fr om complete conversion of HFCs and HCFCs to TFA produced a total of 22 x 106 tonnes of TFA. After dilution and complete mixing in the volume of the oceans (1.34 x 1021 L), the increase in concentration above the nominal base level of 200 ng L-1 reported by Frank et al.83 would be small (0.016 ng L-1). Even if mixing were slow, concentrations in receiving zones would be less than those in flowing fresh waters or less than double the nominal base concentration. Ev en considering other sources of TFA, the added inputs from anthropogenic activ ity will be insignificant. Table 6-1.

CFF FCF HF HFC-134aCFF FCO OH TFA acid (TFA) from an HFC. Changes in tropospheric composition and air quality due to stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change 176 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 TFA is a strong acid (dissociation constant, pKa, = 0.3) and is completely ionised at normal environmental pHs and is present in the environment as a salt form. It is also highly stable under normal environmental conditions. Its stability in th e environment is a direct result of the great strength of the C-F bond and the lack of functional groups on the molecule that are susceptible to chemical or biological degradation (Figure 6-5). Laboratory and microcosm studies with TFA and related substances81, 85, 86 have suggested no additional environmental hazards from current en vironmental loadings in fresh or salt water. The smallest effect concentrations (EC50s) for TF A in sensitive species such as aquatic plants ranged from 0.222 x 106 to 10 x 106 ng L-1.86 Estimates of more sensitive responses (assay endpoints) suggested a toxic benchmark concentration87 of 0.046 x 106 ng L-1,81 which is much greater than current81 or projected concentrations in fres h and saltwater environments. The projected future increased loadings to the ocean s from fresh water due to climate change and continued use of HCFCs and HFCs, are judged to present negligible risks for aquatic organisms and humans. There is evidence that the perfluoropolyethers, substances which are proposed as chloro- hydrofluorocarbon (CHFC) substitutes, have grea t stability to chemical degradation in the atmosphere as well as very large global warming potential.88 Perfluoropolyethers (PFPEs) are commonly used industrial heat tran sfer fluids that may be releas ed to the atmosphere. In smog chamber studies on a distilled fraction of a commercial mixture containing perfluoropolymethylisopropyl ethe rs (PFPMIEs, Figure 6-6), reac tivity of PFPMIE x 10 -17 cm3 molecule-1 s-1, while reactivity with OH was less than x10-16 cm3 molecule-1s-1, indicating low reactivity data from perf luorinated alkanes, a lower limit for the total atmospheric lifetime of PFPMIE was calculated to be 800 years. PFPMIE was shown to have instantaneous radiative forcing of 0.65 W m -2 ppb-1.88 This corresponds to a global warmi ng potential (GWP) on a 100 year time-frame of 9000 relative to carbon dioxide (GWP of one) and 1.95 relative to CFC-11, a value exceeded by only a few hydrofluoro ethers. 88 PFPMIE has a longer atmospheric lifetime than CFC-11, and hence, the GWP of PFPMIE increases with the ti me horizon. For example, the GWP of PFPMIE over a 500 year horizon was estimated at 6.89 relative CFC-11.88 These substances have been suggested as substitutes for CHFCs89 but, as they are very persistent in the atmosphere, they may be important contributors to global warming. It is not known whether these substances will contribute significantly to global warming and its interaction with oz one depletion but they should be considered for further evaluation. Conclusions, uncertainties and data needs Research has now uncovered a distinct signature in air quality due to changes in stratospheric ozone. This is most noticeable in the Antarctic, where the change in stratospheric ozone is the largest and there are relatively few sources of at mospheric contamination. Elsewhere, changes in stratospheric ozone have appare nt impacts on air quality, in particular ground level ozone concentrations, which depend on the composition of the atmosphere at that location. These conclusions are in agreement with current underst anding of the chemistry of the atmosphere. Calibration and verification data for models ar e frequently taken from less polluted areas in temperate regions. Additional spatial and temp oral measurements of air pollutants, OH, and Figure 6-6. Structure of a perfluoropoly- methylisopropyl ether. Changes in tropospheric composition and air quality due to stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 177 ozone from other regions such the tropics, fore sted areas, and highly polluted areas would allow models of interactions between UV-B radiation, climate change, and air quality to be improved. The decomposition products of CFC's and their re placements do not appear to have a significant environmental impact at this time. Trifluoroacetic acid is very persistent in water, but unlikely to be found at concentrations which present a si gnificant environmental risk. Some other highly fluorinated compounds do have significant global warming potentials and long environmental lifetimes, so their climate impact will need to be considered carefully. Future impacts of variations in stratospheric oz one on air quality will depend heavily on the magnitude of other changes to the atmosphere, dr iven by effects such as climate change and increasing industrialization. The projected increa se in ground level ozone due to human activities is likely to be somewhat enhanced by recove ring stratospheric ozone in the next century. Our understanding of the atmosphere and the change s that are occurring within it are focused on relatively small regions of the globe. In particular little is known about the tropics, partially because of a lack of measurement but also because of the complexity of the environment. This lack will need to be redressed.

The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 185 Chapter 7. Effects of stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change on materials damage. A. L. Andradya, H. S. Hamidb, A. Torikaic aEngineering Technology Division, Cornwallis Durham, NC 27709 USA University Petroleu m and Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia cMaterials Life Society of Tokyo, Japan Summary Nanoscale inorganic fillers with av erage particle sizes smaller by an order of magnitude or more compared to those of conventional fillers are be coming commercially available. The efficacy of these fillers used in polymer formulations and particularly their effect as photostabilizers are beginning to be investigated. These may enhanc e or retard photodegrad ation depending on the surface coating of the particles or their chemical nature. Some r ecent data indicate their use as effective photostabilizers in some common pol ymers. However, the potential deleterious interaction of the nanoscale fillers with other a dditives in the formulation has also been pointed out. Depending on the efficiency of stabilization and the economics of their use nanofillers may provide a useful route to UV-stab ilization of plastics and rubber used outdoors. Insufficient data are available at this time to assess their potenti al impact on material and coatings stabilization. Organic fillers such as lignocellu lose continue to be investigat ed for outdoor applications. Their cost advantage makes them attractive despite th e somewhat reduced engineering properties of their composites. Recent reports, however, sugg est the photostability of these composites to depend on the source of fiber as well as the processing techniques employed in fabricating products from them. Identification of the key de terminants in terms of species, isolation and processing of polymer/wood composites is critical to developing them for long-term outdoor use. Efforts are continuing on the synthesis of new li ght stabilizers, particularly those based on a hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS), and on identifying syne rgistic for common thermoplastics. Variants of HALS-type stabilizers that reduce the loss of stabilizer via leaching or migration were rece ntly reported. Studies on the permanence of the stabilizers themselves when expos ed to solar UV wavelengths have also been reported in recent work. Identification of relevant mechanisms is important not only to under stand the interactions of climate changes and higher UV solar environmen ts with materials damage, but also to guide future design of light-stabilizers. Introduction Most of the naturally-occurring biopolymers such as wood, hair, wool, and proteins as well as synthetic organic polymers (plastics and rubber) absorb solar UV radiation and consequently undergo photodegradation. About a third of the plastic produced in North America and in Europe is used in building a pplications. These products such as siding, exposed pipes, glazing, cable coverings, extruded window frames or doors, and in organic protective coatings (See Table Effects of stratospheric ozone depleti on and climate change on materials damage 186 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 7-1). A majority of these polymers (mainly PE, PP, PVC, PC) are inherently photolabile materials, slowly losing their desirable physical and mechanical properties on routine exposure to solar UV radiation. Initially, the photodegradation may result in une ven surface discoloration of the product, but extended exposure invariably leads to loss in ke y mechanical properties such as strength or impact resistance of the material. A large body of research data exists on the types and rates of light-induced damage suffered by di fferent classes of polymers and their numerous formulations. Plastics products are almost never made from pure polymer resin; a number of additives including inorganic ng aids and even biocides are mixed with the pure polymer to obtain a formulation used to fabr icate a product. The chemical make-up of the formulation is dictated by the engineering requirements of the product and the environment in which the product is expected to function. As each of the additives can potentially alter the photo- susceptibility of base polymer ma rkedly, the database on the eff ects of UV radiation on various polymer materials and their formulations is vol uminous. The natural biopolymers, on the other hand, have fixed chemical compositions and thei r photodegradation chemis try is less variable with the source of material. Table 7-1.

Fiber-reinforced plastics FRP R oofing panels, water tanks, pipes. Outdoor applications of most common plastics are possible only because of the commercial availability of efficient light st abilizers that can be incorporated in their formulations. Light stabilizers remain the fastest growing segment of the plastics additives market (growing at 6- 11% per year). The most used of these are th e hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS), a class of remarkably efficient radical scavengers that suppress light-induced degradation in polymers. Effects of stratospheric ozone deplet ion and climate change on materials damage The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 187 A second important group consists of UV absorb ers that absorb the damaging UV-B radiation reaching the surface of material and convert it into thermal energy. Either of these stabilizer compounds is typically used at very low c oncentrations (0.5-1.0% w/w) in the polymer formulation and delivers a defi ned minimum service life for pr oducts regularly exposed to sunlight during use. As it is often the most expensive component in the polymer formulation, R&D effort by industry is focused on improving st abilizer effectiveness and on discovering more potent stabilizer varieties. An inevitable consequence of stratospheric ozon e depletion has been an increase in the UV-B component in solar radiation reach ing the earth's surface. This would be expected to accelerate the light-induced degradation r eactions in some materials, es pecially plastics used outdoors routinely, reducing their service life. The proj ected average increase in ambient temperatures from global warming is only 1.5-4.0 \u00b0C over the period 1990-20021, too small to cause a significant increase in materials degradation ra tes; however, a much larger increase in temperature that can significantly increase degr adation rates is expect ed in some geographic regions. In those regions where both higher ambient temperatures and higher UV-B levels occur together, the degradation rates for materials wi ll be considerably accelerated, further shortening the useful life of materials. The relationship between the rate of r eaction and the absolute temperature is exponential; a small change in temp erature can therefore resu lt in a large increase in the rate of degradation reactions, for reactions of low activation energy. Other climatic factors such as rainfall, humidity, tropospheric ozone, and air pollutants further ex acerbate the situation contributing to an even faster rate of degrada tion of materials exposed outdoors. Some of these worst-affected geographic regions are likely to in clude developing countries that rely heavily on low-cost plastic products in their economy (for instance China is the s econd largest producer of plastics in the world). This will also be true of developing countries where wood is extensively used in housing construction. Table 7-2 summari zes the qualitative impact of these factors on the light-induced damage to plastics and wood materials. Table 7-2.

The number of + symbols indicate the availability of pu blications supporting the effect of the particular climatic variable in increasing the light-induced degradation of the materi al. ++++ =Very High. +++ = High ++ = Moderate + = Low The challenge to the plastics industry will then be to devise strategies and innovative technologies that allow the service life of the UV -sensitive materials to be maintained at the currently accepted levels despit e a potential increase in the so lar UV-B component. A simple Effects of stratospheric ozone depleti on and climate change on materials damage 188 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 and possibly effective solution a ssumes that HALS and other stabi lizers in use today used at higher concentrations will turn out to be effective in UV-B-rich solar environments. Thus, increased concentration of these same st abilizers in polymer formulation or in wood coatings is likely a practical m itigation strategy. While it is a r easonable strategy, the efficacy of the existing light stabilizers with UV-rich solar radiation resul ting from ozone layer depletion has not been fully demonstrated. A second feas ible response might be to substitute photo- susceptible materials currently in use with be tter UV-resistant polymers or surface-modified wood products. Either response will add to the cost of the material and the products. Estimates of the global costs associated with either of these strategies are not availabl e at this time. Such estimates need to be based on realistic assessmen ts of materials damage and require the use of advanced damage estimate methodologies as well as the likely efficacy of the various mitigation options available. The research data that allows a rigorous as sessment of either of these is unfortunately not availabl e at the present time. Techniques for assessing light-induced degradation Quantifying the photodamage associated with th e exposure of a polymer material to solar radiation generally requires a knowledge of; a) the wavelength de pendence of sensitivity of the material to the particular type of damage of interest; b) a dose-respons e relationship that is applicable to the exposure and deviations fr om the reciprocity law applicable to that photodegradation processes; and c) the validity of assumptions of additivity of damage at different wavelengths and the validity of the recipr ocity law for the system of interest. Data for wavelength dependence of sensitivity (in the form of either plots of sensitivity vs. wavelength2 or as activation spectra 3 for several key polymer materials ha ve been published. Only very limited information is available on dose-response relati onships of relevant materials for modes of photodamage of interest. New analyses and findi ngs on any of these critical topics therefore contribute to better and more complete damage estimates. Recent litera ture, however, continues to be sparse on new data on wavelength or dose-response relationships for hitherto uninvestigated systems. A critical review was recently published on the reciprocity relationships in materials photodegradation.4 The reciprocity law is the relations hip between irradiance I (photons.cm-2), exposure duration t (hours) and th e resulting photodamage obtained in an exposure experiment. In instances where the law holds, the quantity (I.t) is directly pr oportional to extent of damage, implying that a short exposure at high intens ity and a longer exposure at a correspondingly low intensity to yield the same am ount of materials damage. Ev en where the reciprocity law generally applies, deviations are expected at both very high and very low irradiance. When deviation is observed at moderate irradiance, a modified form of the reciprocity rule, extent of photodamage is proportional to(Ip.t). A compilation of av ailable data on materials photodegradation reported th e value of p~0.9 to 1.0 for a majority of polymers for which data were available4, confirming that reciprocity is a reas onable assumption for most materials. Over the years, research on light-induced damage to polymers and wood have consistently relied on fairly modest analytical techniques, main ly conventional spectroscopy for functional group analysis, surface color measurements, a nd mechanical property measurements.5 However, these continue to provide new insights as illustrated by the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) study on acrylic coatings6 for which material in which a square root dependence of damage on UV irradiance was recently reported.7 Saron and Felsiberti8 demonstrated the use of Effects of stratospheric ozone deplet ion and climate change on materials damage The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 189 dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and FT IR in comparing the surface versus bulk degradation of polymer blends. While providi ng valuable information, these techniques have limited sensitivity, especially in mon itoring early stages of photodegradation. Recent years have seen a trend towards the use of sophisticated techniques for monitoring light- induced damage. The applicati on of these will allow more accu rate damage estimates to be identified and also help in designing more potent light stabilizers. Severa l interesting examples are discussed below; it is the novel application of the techniques for photodamage studies rather than individual finding from a particular study th at is more relevant to the present purpose. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), an ideal technique to study changes in bulk as well as surface of samples was used in a r ecent study on photodegradation of acrylic coatings9. The LSCM technique is likely to be used mo re commonly in future studies and may allow non- destructive and accurate de gradation profile studies via optical sectioning. Infrared attenuated total reflection methods continue to be used over the years in studying depth profiles resulting from degradation of polymer s. Work by Nagai et al.10 and others11-15 illustrate the value of this conventional technique in establishing the existe nce of a layered degradation profiles in plastic materials. A highly degraded layer just below the surface of the polymer was observed in their studies. A second new technique used in analysis of photode graded materials is atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the related probe microscopic tec hniques. AFM nanoindentation technique was recently used to study changes in surface hardne ss of fiber-reinforced vinyl ester composites.12 This technique has particular merit in st udying the newer nanocomposite materials with nanoscale fillers that are below the size limit amenable to optical microscopy. Positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS), a sensitive technique of analys is for physical defects at a microscale, has been previously employed to stu dy the photodamge to polymers. In the recent study on epoxy polymer16 a correlation between physical de fects and chemical defects (from electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy) in the degraded polymer was demonstrated for the first time. ESR is the more common t echnique used in recent degradation studies17, 18 and the observed correlation with PAS suggests that ES R data may have additional value in shedding some light on degradation induced changes in polymer morphology. Advances are also being made on ESR methods; 2-D ESR imaging was used by 18 in and other11 studying the depth profile of degradation in HALS-stabilized polymers. Also reported recently was a study on surface ph otooxidation of poly(ether sulfone) under UV-B irradiation using x-ray photon correlation sp ectroscopy (XPS) to study the evolution of -SO 3H groups on the polymer surface.19 In general, use of advanced surface spectroscopic methods (such as XPS) is important as photo-induced cha nges initiate at the outer surface of the polymer and propagate inwards. Increased use of these highly sensitive techniques to probe photodegraded polymer surfaces is an encouraging development. Effect of fillers on photodegradation In fabricating building materials and other pr oducts where superior and durable mechanical properties are important, plastic materials are ge nerally compounded with reinforcing fillers such as carbon, or glass fiber. These polymer compos ites with inorganic inclusions in the polymer matrix have dramatically improved properties su ch as the modulus and compressive strength. Even with other categories of plastics products, non-reinforcing fillers such as calcium carbonate Effects of stratospheric ozone depleti on and climate change on materials damage 190 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 or rutile titanium dioxide (titania) are typically used either as an opacifier or as a lower-cost filler (relative to polymer) to reduce overall cost of the product. Fillers account for more than 50 percent of the global plastics addi tives market. Invariably, it is the UV stability of the plastic formulation that determines the service lifetime or the cost of maintaini ng a useful lifetime of a product used outdoors under increased UV-B levels. Therefore, it is important to review the impact of novel additives including fillers on the service life of plas tic compounds under routine exposure to solar UV-B radiation. The use of fillers can significantly affect the UV-induced degradation of a polymer material; for instance, in rigid PVC com pounds, it is the titania (TiO 2) added to the formulation that is responsible for its UV resistance a nd its outdoor lifetime. Titania is the most widely used white pigment in coating formulations. A compounded pol ymer is a mixture of a number of chemical additives and interaction of fillers with any of these may lead to unexpected effects. Non- polymer components of the formulation may also be degraded by interaction with an additive. For instance, with plasticized PVC/TiO 2 system exposed to solar ra diation, the titania protected the PVC from degradation but promoted the photodegradation of th e phthalate plasticizer in the formulation. Outdoor lifetime of the form ulation was therefore significantly reduced.20 Inert fillers that do not chemically participate in the photodegradation reactions, tend to improve the photostability of polymers by shielding underlying polymer from UV exposure. Experimental data that are in line with the already-establishe d detrimental effect of common additives such as flame retardants21, recycled plastics 22, copolymers23, and crosslinking agents24 were reported in recent studies. Of particular in terest is the better elucidation of the mechanism involved in the deactivation of hindered amine t ype light stabilizers (HALS) in polyolefins due to the presence of an brominated fl ame-retardant additive in hydrogen bromide that, in turn, reacts with the HALS to convert the active stab ilizer into its inactive ammonium salt reducing the service life of the polymer. Lignocellulose fillers: The use of wood- or fiber-fille d polyolefin composites in outdoor applications is not a new technology but is presently increasing in popularity 26. In 2006 an estimated 500,000 tonnes of wood-plastic composites will be used in building products in North American markets.27 Wood fibers in general have mechani cal properties that allow the design of composites for less-demanding applications and of ten provide a cost advantage compared to the common inorganic fillers. Recent studies on lingo- cellulose natural fiber fillers suggest that these fillers can either increase or decrease the photos tability of polymer composites containing them, depending on the origin of the fiber and the weight fraction of filler used. An important variable in these studies is th e processing technique used to fa bricate the composite product (i.e., injection molding or extrusion) that very significantly influences its weatherability.28 For instance, wood shavings and kenaf fibers (4 9% by weight) were found to enhance the photostability of polyethylene composites.29 A similar result was reported for the polypropylene/palm-derived fiber composites.30 Lignin filler in natura l rubber formulations was found to exert a stabilizing effect.31 The palm-derived fibers at 10-40% by weight in unplasticized PVC were reported to increase the light-induced discoloration of the composite but left the mechanical properties unchanged on extended exposure to laboratory accelerated weathering.32 Effects of stratospheric ozone deplet ion and climate change on materials damage The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 191 Deglise and Beatrice33, however, reported the wood filler to reduce the photostability of HDPE composites with the acceleration of photodamage proportional to the volume fraction of wood used in the composite material. Studies on inject ion-molded samples of a similar composite also showed a similar result increasi ng photodegradability as measured in terms of discoloration as well as loss in mechanical properties.34 Data reported35 for PP composites with 25 and 50% w/w wood fiber are also in agreement with the above. This discrepanc y in the findings is likely due to differences in the composition of the fibers (and therefore on source of fiber) used in the composites. The chromophores in lignin com ponent of wood fibers absorb of solar UV-B wavelengths making the composites susceptible to photodegradation.36 Photodegradation of lignin results in the formation of deep ye llow degradation products, mainly paraquinone chromophores, via a series of reactions calle d the phenoxy quinone redox cycle. The brightness reversion of mechanical pulps that co ntain a lignin fraction is well documented37, 38 and recently reported for bleached chemi-mechanical pulps.39 The energy absorption and transfer characteristics depend on the chemical make-up of the fiber (especially the lignin and extractives content. The fraction of fiber in the composite determines the fraction of wood exposed at the surface layers of polymer where UV-B absorption can take place and may also play a role in determining photodegradability of a molded product. Compos ites of PP/cellulose, already photodegraded by exposure to UV-B was found to e nhance the subsequent biodegradability of the material. This confirms earlier findings of similar effects for ot her composites and is possibly due to increased surface hydrophilicity of the photodegraded composites.40 Both wood and wood-plastic composites can be protected from photodegradation by using HALS and UV absorber additives.41 Muasher and Sain42 studied the efficacy of various such additives for hardwood powder/HDPE composites a nd concluded that high molecular weight diester HALS (used either alone or with a benzotriazole UV abso rber for synergistic protective effect43) was the most effective in controlling fa ding and yellowing of the material on exposure to UV radiation. Nano-scale fillers : There is growing trend in using na nostructured versions of conventional inorganic fillers in plastic composites. While of similar chemical composition, the nanoscale fillers have an average particle size of only a seve ral tens of nanometers compared to the particle size of hundreds of nm in conve ntional fillers. The surface area of the nanofillers, however, may be as high a hundred m2 g-1 of material. The higher surface ar ea allows more extensive interface interactions between the polymer matrix and nanoparticles, resulting in better mechanical properties in the nanocomposite at much lower filler content (therefore at a lower cost as well). Therefore, nanopowdered pigments such as rutile TiO 2, monmorillonite clays, fullerenes, and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN) are being explored as the ne xt generation of reinforcing filler materials. The use of nanofillers in composite applications is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. Nanoclay masterbatche s (or concentrates) designed for automotive applications are already on the market and provide significant cost-savings when used in place of conventional fillers. Nanoclays are also us eful in making polymer alloys of normally incompatible polymers (e.g. PP and PS); these are already being used in automotive interior applications. In some plastics, such as copolym ers of ethyl vinyl acetate or PP compounds, as little as 3-5% of nanoclay can impart acceptabl e flame retardancy. This avoids the compounding problems, environmental issues, and interferen ce with HALS components, encountered with the use of brominated flame retardant additives refe rred to earlier. Recent data suggest pigments may act synergistically with conve ntional light stabilizers. 44 The paucity of Effects of stratospheric ozone depleti on and climate change on materials damage 192 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 research literature on UV-induced degradation of nanocomposite at this time allows only an initial limited assessment of their potential im pact on UV-induced degradation of the polymer composites. Several studies illustrate the effect of na nofillers in increasing the photodegradability of polymers. Larger surface area inte racting with substrate results in increased generation of free radical initiator spec ies that in turn increase rates of photoreactions. Qin et al.45 working with PE/nanoclay MMT composites found the nanofille r to enhance photodegradation of PE as assessed by spectroscopy. However, the effect de pends upon the ionic composition of the filler; and the ammonium ion associated with the exfo liated nanoclay, and may not be generic to the itself.46 By selecting a photocat alytic nanofiller a mixing nanoscale anat ase titania (a photocatal yst) with polystyrene was reported to increase the rate of photodegradation of the polymer.47 Nanofillers as light stabilizers : In general opacifiers such as coated titania filler to enhance the light stability of polymer such as PVC by shielding the polymer from UV radiation48. Nano-scale fillers now becoming commercially available have much smaller particle sizes and therefore considerably larger surface area available for interaction with ra diation. Nano-sized TiO 2, for instance, has an average particle size of about 15 nm and an average surface area of ~100 m2g-1 as opposed to conventional TiO 2 of particle size of size ~ 300 nm and surface area of 8 m2 g-1. Light shielding capability at the same volume fr action of filler increases as the particle size decreases (See Figure 7-1) provided the filler is well dispersed n the matrix. With nano-anatase form of titania, large surface area per unit mass le ad to rapid catalytic oxidation of coating formulations (based on alkyd and acrylic polymers ) compared to conventional fillers; with the coated rutile nanoparticles, howev er, effective light stabilization in acrylic and alkyd paint media compared to conventional light stabilizers was observed.49 The opacifier nanoparticle structure of rutile form of titania consisting of a rutile core, aluminum oxide surface coating, and organic top coating was similar to that for conventional rutile fi ller. Composite of polypropylene with ZnO nanoparticles also showed stabilization against UV-induced degradation with stabilizer effectiveness increasing with filler content 50. Model epoxy polymer films with nano-rutile titania was found to show UV-stability in accelerated laboratory exposure 46; the protective effect varied with the volume fraction of nanofiller in the composition. A particularly efficient photoprotective layer for use as a coating on hi gh-performance textile fibers was made by dispersing 25-70 nm nanopa rticles of ZnO or TiO 2 in an acrylic polymer.51 The same can be achieved with wt pe rcent obtain a coating that is curable, as recently disclosed in a US pa tent application. The protective base coat or a surface clear coat of the polymer containing me tal oxide nanoparticles can be used as a protective coating on a variety of products.52 Conventional opacifier Small-particle opacifierUV-RADIATION Figure 7-1.

Adequate data are not available as yet on the performance of these in commercially relevant fo rmulations. Preliminary data on weathering of LDPE plastic films by Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization, CSIRO not unexpected as similar synergism between HALS and carbon black is known for polyethylenes weathered outdoors. A recent report claimed ZnO nanoparticlulate fillers can in polyolefins di splay photostabilizer activity exceeding that of HALS compounds.53 For model liquid systems (e.g. cumene) undergoing thermal as opposed to photo-oxidation, however, Zeynalov et.al.54 found the effectiveness of a common phenolic antioxidant to decrease when nanosized filler pa rticles were used. The mechanism of increased initiation via catalysis of hydroperoxide decomposition is common in photooxidation of polymers. Therefore it is not clear whether the nanofiller materials will consistently act as stabilizers in the presence of ot her plastics additives. More data are needed before a final assessment of the value of nanomateri als as photostabilizers can be made. The preliminary research findings suggest that in some polymer formulations nanoscale filler materials can yield superior mechanical perfor mance as well as UV-B protection in polymer composites are particularly relevant to this di scussion. Assuming the availability of low-cost nanofillers with volume production, assuming more efficient photostabilization, this emerging technology may provide a lower-cost route to ma intaining service lifetimes unchanged despite any possible increase in the solar UV-B fraction. Recent Developments in HALS The most effective (and expensiv e) light stabilizers for common plastics intended for outdoor are the HALS additives used in concentrations of less that 0.6% (of the polymer). Figure 7-2 illustrates the role of HALS in reacting and removal of free radicals from the oxidizing polymer. Efficient UV light absorbers are also used where the molecule is able to absorb the high-energy UV-B wavelengths and convert these into thermal energy. In addition to the light-stabilizers, plastic compounds generally include a thermal stab ilizer package that prot ects the material from thermal and thermooxidative degradation primarily during processing. Potential new light stabi lizers continue to be reported from time to time. 55 Synergistic combinations of different HALS compounds as well as HALS/UV absorber combinations have been reported to obtain even higher levels of photostabilization 43, 56 and consequently longer service lifetimes. Mixed filler system of titania with conducting carbon black was also reported to enhance the photosta bility of injection molded poly(propylene-co-ethylene) polymer. 57 As they act via different mechanisms and this is to be expected.

Effects of stratospheric ozone depleti on and climate change on materials damage 194 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 stabilizers and polymer types that are inherently photostable in sunlight is an on-going process,58- 60 A particularly important consideration in the se lection of light stabilizers for wood or plastic materials is the permanence of the stabilizer itself especially under hi gher intensities of UV-B irradiation. Conceptually, the light stabilizer is slowly depleted on exposure either due to slow leaching out of the plastic or due to photoc hemical breakdown by UV-B. Leaching losses are significant and was recently modeled.61 As light initiated oxidation begins the mechanical properties of interest deteriorate with further exposure (see Figure 7-3). The most popular stabilizers belonging to HALS category are not used up in the stabilization reactions but are regenerated within the polymer, and an important route to their loss is via thei r own degradation. Structural changes undergone by HALS exposed to UV radiation in a PP matrix were investigated using a new reactive thermal desorption gas chromatographic (RTD-GC) method. 21 The kinetics of HALS loss and the build up of nitroxyl radical during exposure to UV were reported and the data help in better modeling of the kinetics of HALS depletion or deactivation on exposure. Chemically affixing the lig ht stabilizer entity on to the polymer chains to improve their permanence by reduci ng losses via migration to surface 62 has been reported. An interesting HALS type molecule that is also linked to a blue-emitting fluorophore molecule was recently claimed to be a 'one-step' fluorescen t brightner and a light stabilizer compound63 In specialized applications where brightening is impo rtant, as in textile or paper substrates, the additive may have considerable advantages over conventional tec hnology. Singh et.al.64 Reported the synthesis of a novel HALS-type polymeric stabilizer and demonstrated its effectiveness on high-impact polystyrene to be supe rior to that of convent ional light stabilizers. This improvement is likely a result of redu ced leaching of stabilizer from the matrix. An interesting HALS molecule also cont aining a UV absorber moiety was recently synthesized.65 In clear-coat formulations this stabili zer was shown to photograft itself onto the polymer on exposure to UV and result in reduced migration. Pickett et al66 discussed a kinetic scheme for delamination of coatings stabilized w ith UV absorbers that allows better prediction of their service life on outdoor exposure. The approach is superior to the simpler approach of using zero- or first-order kinetic expr essions hitherto used. When used in conjunction with HALS in UV-cured polyurethane coatings, Decker67 found UV absorbers to maintain their effectiveness after 4800 h of accelerated expos ure in weather-Ometer.

Effects of stratospheric ozone deplet ion and climate change on materials damage The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 195 coextruded on the surface of a PVC product to protect the unde rlying less-stabilized polymer from photodamage was reported decades ago. Most of the 23 million tonnes of vinyl plastics produced globally each year is used in building or other outdoor applica tions. Any reduction in the levels of opacifier, rutile titania, used to st abilize the rigid PVC formul ations used in building products is therefore of pa rticular interest. . A recent patent application68 proposes the use of a cap layer of weather resistant polyethyleneterphthalate glycol (PETG) coextruded on PVC, CPVC, high-impact polystyrene or other common plastics. Decker et.al. reported a similar technique for PVC, where a UV-cured highly-photostabilized protective acrylic layer was adhered to th e surface of a vinyl product to improve its weatherability.69 The acrylic clear coat carried UV absorbers as well as HALS and the composition showed improved su rface properties such as abrasi on resistance. The approach is similar to the use of acrylic surface coatings (stabilized with nanofillers) to coat high-value industrial fibers to pho tostabilize them better.51 The same concept, but using a polymerizable surface coating with a high leve l of UV absorber (benzotriazo les) intended for protection products from light-induced damage was di sclosed in a recent patent application.70 Conclusions and gaps in knowledge The recent research findings reviewed here focus primarily on the effects of plastics additives, particularly the fillers and flame retardants, on the UV stability of the polymers routinely exposed outdoors during use. Natural fiber-bas ed fillers (lignocellu loses) in polyolefin composites may either increase or decrease photosta bility of the resin de pending on the origin of fiber and the processing technique used. As the m echanical properties of these composites appear to be adequate for some applications, inform ation on which sources of wood fiber enhances polymer photostability will be useful to the indus try, particularly in developing countries. With future availability of such information, wood- fibers may contribute to low-cost photostable composites that can function in high-UV solar radi ation environments with minimal help from conventional stabilizers. Nanoscale fillers where the partic le size tends to be <100 nm is seen to be emerging as a replacement for the conventional fillers. They are effective as reinfo rcing fillers at lower concentrations and are th erefore cheaper to use. In additi on, in early studies some nanoscale fillers appear to impart antioxidant effects, phot ostability, and flame retardancy to the composite. The very high surface area of UV-absorbing nanoparticle oxides, for instance, also delivers superior photostability to the composites. On ly a few publications of preliminary data are available on the topic at this time, but these novel fillers can evolve into an important class of polymer additive in the short term. Their superior light stability suggests widespread availability of nanofillers able to mitigate the effects of increased solar UV at relatively lower levels of use in plastics formulations (or in wood coatings). However, the interaction of nanoparticle fillers with plastics additives used in the fo rmulations remain to be elucidated. Numerous studies using very se nsitive analytical t echniques (some for the first time) have contributed to better mechanisti c understanding of the chemical and physical changes in surface and bulk of photodegrading plastic s and wood materials. These contribute towards a better understanding of light stabilizer - additive in teractions as well as the mechanisms of antioxidation in polymers. Such information is invaluable in synthe sizing novel photostabilizers and in designing UV-resistan t plastics formulations. Effects of stratospheric ozone depleti on and climate change on materials damage 196 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2006 The chemistry of interactions between various constituents (including the polymer itself) in plastic formulations exposed to solar UV radi ation is poorly understood. This lack of quantitative information makes it difficult to pr edict the photodamage to a given formulation exposed to solar UV radiation, and therefore does not permit designing new formulations for specified lifetimes under different UV scenarios. A better understandi ng of how the different climatic factors interact with UV environmen ts in modifying photodamage to materials is needed. Particular important is extending exis ting mechanistic and predictive models on polymer photodamage to include the effect of change s in ambient temperature, humidity, and air pollutants, all known to impact the photodamage process in biopolymers (especially wood) and plastics.
