Incident Management Teams (IMTs) synthesize information about weather, fuels, and order resources based on expected fire growth rather than simply reacting to observed fire growth. Background and Objectives: Weather conditions are a well-known determinant of fire behavior and are likely to become more erratic under climate change. Yet, there is little empirical evidence demonstrating how IMTs respond to observed or expected weather conditions. An understanding of weather-driven resource ordering patterns may aid in resource prepositioning as well as forecasting suppression costs. Our primary objective is to understand how changing weather conditions influence resource ordering patterns. Our secondary objective is to test how an additional risk factor, evacuation, as well as a constructed risk metric combining fire growth and evacuation, influences resource ordering. Materials and Methods: We compile a novel dataset on over 1100 wildfires in the western US from 2007-2013, integrating data on resource requests, detailed weather conditions, fuel and landscape characteristics, values at risk, fire behavior, and IMT expectations about future fire behavior and values at risk. We develop a two-step regression framework to investigate the extent to which IMTs respond to realized or expected weather-driven fire behavior and risks. Results: We find that IMTs' expectations about future fire growth are influenced by observed weather and that these expectations influence resource ordering patterns. IMTs order nearly twice as many resources when weather conditions are expected to drive growth events in the near future. However, we find little evidence that our other risk metrics influence resource ordering behavior (all else being equal). Conclusion: Our analysis shows that incident management teams are generally forward-looking and respond to expected rather than recently observed weather-driven fire behavior. These results may have important implications for forecasting resource needs and costs in a changing climate.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-02-03", "cleaned_text": "Weather, Risk, and Resource Orders on Large Wildland Fires in the Western US [https://doi.org/10.3390/f11020169](https://doi.org/10.3390/f11020169) [Forest Fire Suppression: Weather is always a critical factor during a wildland fire response effort. While fire and atmospheric scientists have gained a better understanding of how weather influences fire behavior (e.g., [ [2](#B2-forests-11-00169), [3](#B3-forests-11-00169), [4](#B4-forests-11-00169), [5](#B5-forests-11-00169)]), less is known about how fire management personnel respond to variable weather, and how it affects their requests for suppression resources. Do fire managers request resources in anticipation of weather-driven growth events, or do they wait to see if the consequences materialize? Does the presence of values at risk make fire managers more forward-looking? The answers to these questions are critically important to understand how scarce and expensive suppression resources are used. [6](#B6-forests-11-00169), [7](#B7-forests-11-00169)], suppression expenditures [ [8](#B8-forests-11-00169), [9](#B9-forests-11-00169)], interregional sharing of firefighting resources [ [10](#B10-forests-11-00169), [11](#B11-forests-11-00169)], resource dispatching practices [ [12](#B12-forests-11-00169), [13](#B13-forests-11-00169)], managerial risk preferences and perceptions [ [14](#B14-forests-11-00169), [15](#B15-forests-11-00169), [16](#B16-forests-11-00169)], patterns of aerial suppression resource use [ [17](#B17-forests-11-00169), [18](#B18-forests-11-00169), [19](#B19-forests-11-00169)], and suppression effectiveness performance measures [ [20](#B20-forests-11-00169)]. Some of this work has a direct and logical connection to resource ordering, although none has examined how risk perceptions and preferences influence the dynamics of resource ordering directly. For instance, in studies of strategic decision making, [ [14](#B14-forests-11-00169)] found that managers are more sensitive to risk to homes and watersheds than to cost and personnel exposure, [ [15](#B15-forests-11-00169)] found that managerial risk preferences are inconsistent with minimizing expected economic loss, and [ [16](#B16-forests-11-00169)] found that managers exhibit risk aversion and nonlinear probability weighting. In all cases, however, choice experiments compared strategies only coarsely using variables such as expenditures and personnel hours and did not address resource ordering. [21](#B21-forests-11-00169)] examined variation in resource use patterns across incident management teams and found that after controlling for fire and landscape characteristics, 17 of 89 teams exhibited a daily resource capacity that was significantly higher than the median team. Katuwal et al. [ [22](#B22-forests-11-00169)] found that the total fireline production capacity often exceeded the fire perimeter and that, on average, 21% of the total productive capacity was retained after fires ceased growing. Bayham and Yoder [ [13](#B13-forests-11-00169)] found that fires threatening homes are dispatched more Type 1 Crews and Engines, which reduces the likelihood that other simultaneously burning fires will receive requested resources. Belval et al. (in review) [ [23](#B23-forests-11-00169)] examined the metrics for quantifying resource use and scarcity on a national (rather than incident) level for Type 1 crews and large airtankers, finding substantial differences between patterns of Type 1 crew and large airtanker usage and scarcity. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Conceptual Framework [24](#B24-forests-11-00169), [25](#B25-forests-11-00169)]. The initial response to fires is typically standardized and handled exclusively by local resources [ [26](#B26-forests-11-00169), [27](#B27-forests-11-00169)]. If a fire is not controlled during the initial response and increases in size or complexity, then an Incident Management Team (IMT) is assigned and may begin to order additional resources for the longer term. During small or less complex fires, the IMT may consist of a single person (Incident Commander), while for larger fires IMTs may consist of up to 44 personnel, including the Incident Commander, Safety Officers, Operations Section Chiefs, Air Operations Section Chief, and many more (see Appendix D in the 2019 California Interagency Incident Management Team Operating Guidelines). Such large fires often overwhelm the local area's resources, necessitating additional resources from other localities or national resources. Resources are requested by the leader of the IMT (the incident commander) but on large fires may also be driven by the operations section of the team. We refer to the decision makers as \"IMTs\" in this paper. [Table 1](#forests-11-00169-t001)). First, we define fire perimeter control and structure protection as our focal wildfire management objectives; these are commonly identified in empirical and model-based fire suppression analyses (e.g., [ [28](#B28-forests-11-00169), [29](#B29-forests-11-00169), [30](#B30-forests-11-00169), [31](#B31-forests-11-00169)]). We then craft risk-based metrics relating to anticipatory or reactive ordering. In the former case, we consider fire growth potential and evacuation potential, and their interaction as a measure of anticipated risk guiding proactive response. In the latter case, we consider fire growth and evacuation initiation, and their interaction as a measure of observed risk guiding reactive response. [Table 1](#forests-11-00169-t001). For a forward-looking manager, we expect positive correlations between resource orders with all three variables (Growth Potential, Evacuation Likely, Anticipated Risk). The relative magnitudes and statistical significance may vary depending upon managerial preferences and conditions. If an evacuation is likely, we might expect orders for resources that may be used to protect values-at-risk such as structure engines, hand crews, and aircraft for support. Reactive resource ordering may involve similar ordering patterns but occur after the growth event or evacuation, with a hope to quickly contain so as to avoid future risky growth events. We construct regression models to test these hypotheses using high temporal resolution data. 2.2. Data [32](#B32-forests-11-00169)]. Suppression resource request data come from the Resource Ordering and Status System (ROSS) [ [33](#B33-forests-11-00169)]. Weather data come from gridMET [ [34](#B34-forests-11-00169)] and [ [35](#B35-forests-11-00169)]. Vegetation data come from Landfire and the National Land Cover Database [ [36](#B36-forests-11-00169)]. Topographic data are generated from a digital elevation model from Landfire. See [Table 2](#forests-11-00169-t002)for a complete list of variables extracted from each data source. [37](#B37-forests-11-00169)]). Different agencies have varying criteria for when an ICS-209 report is required, but, generally, these reports are submitted daily for large fires (> 100 acres in timber or > 300 acres in grass or brush), complex fires (i.e., incident management teams assigned), or fires with multi-day commitments of national resources. This form provides information on the current and anticipated fire behavior and growth potential, current fire management goals, the state of the fire's containment, and information regarding resource use and needs (see [Table 2](#forests-11-00169-t002)for variable descriptions). We use the set of ICS-209 forms to identify a set of large fires on which we could test hypotheses regarding forward- and backward-looking resource ordering patterns. We focus on large fires with long-term management plans, rather than those contained during initial attack, in order to investigate the response to change weather conditions as they evolve over the course of the fire. Thus, we built our dataset around a core set of ICS-209 single-incident fires (i.e., not multi-fire complexes) that occurred in the western US (excluding Alaska, Southern, and Eastern GACCs) from 2007-2013 with three or more reports appearing in the ICS-209 archives. We limit the data to 2013 because changes to the ICS-209 implemented in 2014 removed the question about growth potential. [https://famit.nwcg.gov/applications/ROSS](https://famit.nwcg.gov/applications/ROSS)). Designed for use by dispatchers, the ROSS is the most complete source of standardized information regarding resource ordering in the US (see Belval et al. [ [23](#B23-forests-11-00169)] for data quality issues). The ICS-209 does contain information about resources committed to fires. However, we focus on resource requests rather than assignments to avoid modeling the complex dispatching decisions that determine which resources are sent to each fire (Bayham and Yoder, 2020). ROSS data includes orders from IMTs that were unable to be filled due to a scarcity of resources, which provides the most accurate information available on the preferences of the IMT. The data from ROSS includes the type of resource ordered and the date the resource is ordered. We compiled the data for each fire to obtain the total daily orders for eight categories of firefighting resources: Type 1 Crews, Type 2 Crews (which include Type 2IA Crews), Structure Engines (specified as Type 1-2 engines), Wildland Engines (specified as Type 3-7 engines), Dozers, LAT (which include Very Large and Type 1 Airtankers), Aircraft (specified as T2-4 airtankers and fixed-wing aircraft), and Helicopters (which include Type 1-3 helicopters). We merge ROSS data with incident-level data using date and common identifiers reported in the Fire Occurrence Database [ [38](#B38-forests-11-00169)]. [Figure 1](#forests-11-00169-f001)). Data on the maximum daily temperature, the minimum daily humidity, the daily mean windspeed, precipitation, the Burning Index (BI), and the Energy Release Component (ERC) are extracted from gridMET, a gridded (4km resolution) daily product based on the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) and augmented with data from the Remote Automated Weather Station (RAWS) network weather data among others [ [34](#B34-forests-11-00169), [39](#B39-forests-11-00169)]. We also integrate the Categorical Fire Behavior Index (CFBX) [ [35](#B35-forests-11-00169)]. The BI and ERC are commonly used indices known to influence fire behavior. CFBX is a composite index that translates BI and ERC into a discrete scale with values one through five, where one corresponds to smoldering and five corresponds to extreme erratic fire behavior. [Figure 1](#forests-11-00169-f001)). Within the buffer of each fire, we calculate the area of 20 Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) subclasses and 17 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) vegetation types. We use a digital elevation model to calculate several topographic statistics within the same 2 km buffer around each fire ignition point. Topography and vegetation are well-studied determinants of fire behavior. Our goal is to control for these factors in our regression rather than to study their effects on fire growth, which have been documented in previous research (e.g., [ [8](#B8-forests-11-00169), [40](#B40-forests-11-00169)]). Therefore, we calculate the principal components of the 104 topographic and vegetation variables (see supplement for details). We include the top 20 principal components, which represent approximately 80% of the variation in all of the topographic and vegetation variables. While the regression coefficients are difficult to interpret, principal components are ideal controls because they are orthogonal to each other by construction, which minimizes multicollinearity in regression models [ [41](#B41-forests-11-00169)]. [supplementary material](#app1-forests-11-00169). All data processing scripts are available at [https://github.com/jbayham/weather_risk_resource_orders](https://github.com/jbayham/weather_risk_resource_orders). [Table 3](#forests-11-00169-t003)includes summary statistics for the non-categorical variables in the dataset (see the [supplementary material](#app1-forests-11-00169)for additional information). [Figure 2](#forests-11-00169-f002)displays the location of each fire in the dataset with more complex incidents indicated with larger, redder circles. The mean size of observations in the dataset is 14,870 acres, which is large because larger fires have more observations and thus receive more weight in the summary statistics. The largest fire in the data is the Wallow fire that started in AZ and burned 538,049 acres. The maximum Area is less than the 538 thousand acres because the last few thousand acres burned after the fire was considered 100% contained and thus the suppression effort can be considered over. The largest growth event was on the La Brea fire in the Los Padres NF in 2009, where the fire reportedly grew nearly 21,000 acres in an operational period. Wildland Engines are the most prevalent resource requested on a fire followed by Aircraft. While the largest maximum request was for Structure Engines (325 during the Station Fire, 2009), the mean request for Wildland Engines is larger on average (5.19). 2.3. Empirical Models [Section 2.1](#sec2dot1-forests-11-00169). Our primary objective is to test whether IMTs look forward to expected fire behavior and risks or respond to realized events. We approach the objective in two steps. First, we establish an empirical relationship between weather conditions and observed fire growth. Similarly, we establish an empirical relationship between weather and a subjective assessment of future fire behavior given the information available today (growth potential). Second, we model the relationship between suppression resource orders and both growth potential and lagged fire growth, and their interactions with evacuation. Step one is intended to identify the components of weather that influence observed and expected fire growth in order to connect an IMT's resource ordering behavior to weather conditions via fire growth. The final step investigates whether resource ordering appears to be forward- or backward-looking under differing values at risk. 2.3.1. Weather and Observed Fire Growth 2.3.2. Weather and Growth Potential 2.3.3. Resource Orders, Fire Growth, and Growth Potential [21](#B21-forests-11-00169)]. [42](#B42-forests-11-00169), [43](#B43-forests-11-00169)]. The fixed effect regressions are estimated using the fixest package in R [ [44](#B44-forests-11-00169)]. 3. Results [Section 2.3](#sec2dot3-forests-11-00169). First, we present the results demonstrating the relationship between weather and observed fire growth and subjective growth potential. Second, we present results connecting the observed fire growth and subjective growth potential to suppression resource requests. Our results illustrate the pathway through which realizations and expectations of uncertain weather impact suppression resource requests. 3.1. Weather, Fire Growth, and Growth Potential [Table 3](#forests-11-00169-t003)in the [supplementary material](#app1-forests-11-00169)to show that the additional observations improve the precision of the estimates. Standard errors are clustered at the fire level and are robust to heteroscedasticity and serial correlation within a fire. Full regression tables are available in [Supplementary Table S2](#app1-forests-11-00169). [Figure 3](#forests-11-00169-f003)displays the marginal effects of select weather conditions on fire growth. For reference, the mean fire growth is 1.65 (1000 acres). The results generally confirm the intuition that high temperature, ERC, and CFBX increase fire growth while high humidity reduces fire growth. The figures indicate that these effects are nonlinear with significantly larger fire growth occurring at the upper quartile of ERC and temperature levels. The highest CFBX category, which is described as extreme and erratic fire behavior, is correlated with higher levels of growth, while the lower two categories described as smoldering, creeping, and spreading correspond to much lower levels of fire growth. [Supplementary Table S3](#app1-forests-11-00169). [Figure 4](#forests-11-00169-f004)illustrates the predicted probabilities of growth potential categories as a function of the ERC and Minimum Humidity. Panel (a) suggests that low growth potential is highly likely (probability of 0.80) at low ERC levels. As ERC increases, IMTs become increasingly likely to report medium, high, and extreme growth potential. When the ERC is 100, IMTs are most likely to report high growth potential. In contrast, when humidity is low, IMTs are most likely to report high growth potential (green line in panel (b)). As humidity rises, IMTs become increasingly likely to report low growth potential. These results suggest that IMTs develop expectations about fire behavior based on current and expected weather conditions. While we do not use data on forecasted weather, we have estimated the model with forward lags of realized weather and find that the results are qualitatively similar. 3.2. Suppression Resources, Fire Growth, and Growth Potential [Supplementary Tables S4 and S5](#app1-forests-11-00169). [Table 4](#forests-11-00169-t004)shows the results of four regressions, all with total resource requests as the dependent variable. Standard errors are clustered at the fire and are robust to heteroscedasticity and serial correlation within a fire in all specifications. Column 1 displays the results of the regression with only growth potential and lagged growth with fire fixed effects. The results indicate that high growth potential (high and extreme categories) leads to 10.58 more total resource requests relative to a growth potential of medium. Similarly, low growth potential leads to 6.6 fewer requests relative to medium growth potential. While the coefficient on lagged growth is positive, it is imprecisely estimated and indistinguishable from 0 at an alpha = 0.05. [Table 1](#forests-11-00169-t001)). Moreover, the stability of the growth potential coefficient estimates in Columns (1) and (2) suggest that while potential evacuation and growth potential may be correlated, it is not severe enough to substantially affect the growth potential coefficient estimates. [Table 4](#forests-11-00169-t004), for each resource type individually to investigate heterogeneity in the forward- and backward-looking ordering patterns. [Table 5](#forests-11-00169-t005)and [Table 6](#forests-11-00169-t006)show the results of the individual resource regressions. High growth potential leads IMTs to request more Wildland Engines, Type 1 Crews, Dozers, LAT, Aircraft, and Helicopters (High growth potential estimates not statistically significant for Structure Engines and Type 2 Crews). The magnitude of the estimates indicates that nearly twice as many resources are requested when growth potential is high relative to the medium growth potential. For example, the coefficient estimate on Wildland Engines is 4.73 ( [Table 5](#forests-11-00169-t005)), whereas the unconditional mean in the sample is 5.19 ( [Table 3](#forests-11-00169-t003)). Similarly, we find robust evidence that low growth potential leads IMTs to request fewer resources relative to the medium growth potential (not statistically significant for Wildland Engines, Type 1 Crews, and Dozers). However, the magnitude of the low growth potential coefficients is smaller than the high growth potential counterpart in most cases, indicating that the effect is asymmetric, with more weight placed on high growth potential. 4. Discussion [5](#B5-forests-11-00169), [39](#B39-forests-11-00169)]. Our model of growth potential indicates that IMTs internalize current and forecasted weather to form expectations about future fire activity. Our model of resource orders shows that IMTs respond predominantly to expectations about future fire activity rather than recently observed growth events. Together these results suggest that IMTs appear to be more forward-looking rather than backward-looking. [Figure 4](#forests-11-00169-f004)a show how the ERC relates to the probability that IMTs report different growth potential categories. For example, at ERC = 0, the probability of an IMT reporting high growth potential (green line) is approximately 0.10 (10%) and increases nonlinearly until the probability is nearly 0.40 at ERC = 100. The growth potential probabilities can be mapped through the regression results in [Table 4](#forests-11-00169-t004)to estimate how the ERC will ultimately impact resource orders. The predicted number of resources ordered on a fire with medium growth potential (assuming mean values for all other regressors) is 3.87. As the ERC increases, the probability of high growth potential increases, which can be multiplied by the high growth potential coefficient in [Table 4](#forests-11-00169-t004)(10.24). Using the example from above, the probability of high growth potential is 0.40 at ERC = 100, which increases total resource orders by 4.96 (0.40*10.24). We also need to account for the probability of low growth, which decreases orders by 1.22 (0.22*(5.55)). The net increase in resource orders at ERC = 100 is 3.74 (4.96-1.22). [21](#B21-forests-11-00169), [45](#B45-forests-11-00169)]. In addition, our risk metric may be an incomplete measure of the full set of values at risk, which may influence resource ordering patterns. The metric may be conflating the need for structure protection with the role of coordination and the use of different resources as emergency responders [ [46](#B46-forests-11-00169)]. Future research may focus on developing a more precise quantitative measure of risk factors that influence resource requests. [Table 4](#forests-11-00169-t004), [Table 5](#forests-11-00169-t005)and [Table 6](#forests-11-00169-t006)suggest that the models only explain up to 70% of the variation in total resource orders, which implies that 30% or more variation is unexplained. This result is consistent with Simpson et al. [ [47](#B47-forests-11-00169)] who find that resources are used in various ways throughout the suppression effort. While we limit the dataset to focus on the phase of active suppression, it is likely that a complex array of factors beyond those captured in our regression model influences ordering patterns [ [48](#B48-forests-11-00169), [49](#B49-forests-11-00169)]. 5. Conclusions [39](#B39-forests-11-00169), [50](#B50-forests-11-00169)]. Beyond the trends of rising temperatures and drying fuels, short-term weather events are expected to drive erratic and challenging fire conditions. Our analysis provides a framework through which one is able to understand how future weather variability may impact resource demands Supplementary Materials [https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/11/2/169/s1](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/11/2/169/s1), Table S1: Summary Statistics used in each Model, Table S2: Complete Results of Quasipoisson Regression of Fire Growth, Table S3: Complete Results of Ordered Logit Regression of Growth Potential, Table S4: Complete Results of Fixed Effects Regression of Total Resource Orders, Table S5: (a) Complete Results of Fixed Effects Regression of Select Resource Orders, (b) Complete Results of Fixed Effects Regression of Select Resource Orders.
