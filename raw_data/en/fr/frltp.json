It is named for Henry Hornbostel, the architect who laid out the original Druid Hills campus master plan. Antoinette Candler Creek Lullwater Preserve Lullwater Preserve is Emory's largest and most pristine greenspace, serving as a natural recreational space for students, faculty, and other Emory community members to play, exercise, or spend time with friends and family. Purchased from the Candler family in 1962, Lullwater Preserve serves as a testament to Emory's commitment to environment preservation-throughout the past half century Emory has intervened on multiple occasions when other parties pushed for development of Lullwater. Lullwater boasts environmental diversity, with an impressive spread of native white oaks, poplars, pines, sweet gums, hickories, and beeches. The preservation of this forest has allowed for the re-establishment of large mammals such as the white-tailed deer in the Decatur/Atlanta area, and also serves as an experiment grounds for Emory's biology and environmental science classes.

Marshall Hahn Jr., an Emory trustee and then-CEO of Georgia-Pacific. With the help of Georgia-Pacific, Emory reclaimed these 4.7-acres from a landfill. The woods are part of a 60 acre parcel Emory acquired in 1960, which included the Houson Mill House. In 2015 Trees Atlanta instigated a project that focused on restoring the health of Hahn Woods by removing invasive species and replanting native vegetation, particularly in two acres of the woods which serve as a key connection point of the area watershed.

The ravine is centered around Antoinette Candler Creek, which originates beneath Complex and Harris. This patch of woodland has an incredibly high level of species diversity for its size, and is one of the best places to experience nature on central campus. American Holly (Ilex opaca) A native holly, this species is abundant on campus. It is an evergreen shrub to an understory tree with spiny leaves that produces red berries in the fall. Emory's relationship with the holly began with Antoinette Candler's cultivation of the Wesley Holly. From there, Biology Professor Woolford Baker began planting a number of different holly cultivars on campus in his capacity \"campus forester.\" Palatka Holly a [naturally-occurring hybrid](https://www.uaex.edu/yard-garden/resource-library/plant-week/east-palatka-holly.aspx) between the American holly opaca) and the Dahoon holly (Ilex cassine). The Wesley Holly is an individual of the East Palatka Holly which was originally collected by Antoinette Candler. This individual was found growing epiphytically in the crook of the Wesley Oak under which John and Charles Wesley, the founders of Methodism, allegedly preached under. During a pilgrimage to the oak, Antoinette Candler observed this holly and collected it, before planting it on campus. The descendants of the original plant can still be found planted around campus. [Learn More](https://emoryhistorian.org/2018/01/11/the-legend-of-the-wesley-holly/) Calhoun Oak/White Oak (Quercus alba) Oaks are considered keystone organisms due to the fact that numerous wildlife rely on them for food and shelter. The Calhoun Oak, a white oak, was located adjacent to Emory University Hospital, and represents a significant moment in Emory's environmental history. The tree was slated to be removed in the 1940s, but F. Phinizy Calhoun, a former chair of the Department of Ophthalmology, advocated against its removal. That tree grew to be massive and survived until 2011, when it was removed after becoming infested with ambrosia beetles, a pest that attacks healthy trees. A new (but much smaller) Calhoun oak was planted in its place. [Learn More](https://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/stories/2011/09/campus_calhoun_oak_tree_comes_down.html) Pecan (Carya illinoiensis) The pecan trees on the Quad were first planted by Mrs. Warren Candler in the 1920s. A type of hickory, this species is culturally significant to many, and was traded by Indigenous people prior to European colonization. This species is primarily native west of the Mississippi, but has become widespread in Georgia and other parts of the Southeast, where it is cultivated for its fruit. Pecans have weak wood; allegedly during a commencement ceremony, one of the branches from one of these trees fell into the audience. In the time since their planting by Mrs. Warren Candler, these trees have become massive. Gingko (Gingko biloba) Also known as the maidenhair tree, gingko are native to China, where they are consumed and used in traditional medicine. Gingko are a part of an incredibly old lineage of trees and, despite being widely cultivated, is considered endangered in the wild. This species is dioecious, meaning that there are separate male and female plants. Male plants produce motile sperm, similar to mosses and ferns. Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum) The sugar maple is a large hardwood tree prevalent throughout much of the northeast and midwest United States. Shade tolerant, this species is an important forest species throughout many parts of its range. It's seeds, known as samaras, spin in a helicopter-like pattern when dropped, to the joy of many. Though famous for producing maple syrup, such practices are not common in the south, as we lack the cold winters which induce the plants to store sugar in the same capacity. Bottlebrush Buckeye (Aescullus parviflora) Though typically found in Georgia's coastal plain rather than the Piedmont, this species is relatively common on campus due to its use in the landscape trade. It can grow as a shrub or understory tree and has palmately compound leaves and long scapes of tiny, white flowers. These plants produce large seeds which are toxic if ingested. This individual is the largest bottlebrush buckeye in Atlanta! Japanese Magnolia (Magnolia sp.) This tree is one of two that were gifted to the University, and dates back to the 1920s. While this tree is still standing, its sibling was cut down in order to make space for a cement block. This tree produces many blooms in early spring, but the buds are often killed off by late frost before they have a chance to mature. When the tree manages to nurture its blossoms to maturity, the entire tree is covered in large pink and white flowers. Dawn Redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides) Dawn redwoods are a large conifer native to China which are related to the redwoods of the Pacific Northwest. Very similar in appearance to Georgia's own bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), this species is another deciduous conifer with feather needles. Fossil records of this species have been dated to 50,000,000 years ago! This species is endangered in its native range. Persimmon (Diospyros virginiana) Persimmons are unusual and somewhat uncommon trees which have historically been used by Native Americans for their fruit and wood. This species has an unusual and distinctive chunky, dark gray bark. This species serves as a reminder of the biogeographic heritage that the Southeastern United States shares with East Asia, and produces ball-like fruits in the fall. Bald Cypress (Taxodium distichum) The bald cypress is a deciduous conifer native to the southeastern United States, though is typically found in the coastal plain, rather than the Piedmont. Large cypress forests used to dominate much of the southeast, but many have been logged, leading to a decline in unique, cypress-dominated wetlands. Sterk Elm, American Elm (Ulmus americana) Large American elms were once widespread throughout the United States, but after the introduction of Dutch Elm Disease to the US, large specimens experienced dramatic declines. In the wild, the species primarily survives through younger individuals which succumb to the disease before they are able to reach their full potentials, but a great amount of work has been put into breeding resistant cultivars. The American elm planted on the Quad is one of such disease resistant individuals, and was planted in 2017 as a part of the inauguration of President Claire Sterk, Emory's first female president.

There is evidence to suggest that the pest has begun to attack ash trees on campus. Including it in the specimen tree tour would be a good opportunity to raise awareness for the threats facing this species both globally and elsewhere in Emory's forests. Notice that this specimen has a forked trunk. Near the fork in the trunk, there may be some green or dry gray-looking growths-these are the fronds of the resurrection fern (Pleopeltis michauxiana), a native epiphyte that commonly grows affixed to the bark of ash trees. Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) The eastern hemlock is an evergreen conifer typically found throughout much of the eastern United States. However, this species has recently faced declines due to the emergence of the hemlock wooly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), an introduced insect pest. This species is ecologically significant, as its evergreen foliage provides year-long shade along ravines, creating a microclimate that is favorable for Rhododendron sp. White Mulberry (Morus alba) The white mulberry is originally native to Asia, and was introduced to North America in order to support a potential trade in silk, as the leaves of this tree are the preferred food source of silkworms. While silkworms did not thrive in the US, the white mulberry did, and escaped cultivation, becoming widespread in many parts of the country. This tree produces small, blackberry-sized fruits in early summer. Turkey fig (Ficus carica) The Turkey fig is a large shrub to small tree native to the Mediterranean and Western Asia. This species thrives in hot, dry areas, and produces edible fruit in late summer to early fall. Traditionally, this species must be pollinated by fig wasps, which become trapped inside of the fruit and are dissolved by enzymes, but cultivated varieties are often able to produce fruit without fertilization by these wasps. Serviceberry (Amelanchier arborea) Also known as juneberries, serviceberries can range in size from a shrub to an understory tree, and are native to North America. In the summer, the tree produces small, blueberry-like fruits. These fruits are popular with both wildlife and humans, and have historically been used by Indigenous peoples for use in making bread.

LEED / Earthcraft Certified [Learn More](https://sustainability.emory.edu/initiatives/buildings/) Green Roof at Complex Residence Ha The green roof in Complex Freshman Residential Center sits between Hopkins and Smith halls, and was established in 2015 through an OSI Sustainability Incentives Fund grant. In addition to drought-tolerant plants and native species, this green roof boasts lights, outdoor furniture, water fountains, and electrical outlets. The goal was to design a green space that improved energy efficiency and also cultivated a space for students to study or spend leisure time. Emory works to encourage connections between nature and its community in its cultivation of its green spaces, and this green roof serves as just one example of Emory's commitment to forging environmental relationships. Green Roof at Facilities & Maintenance Building B The green roof installed along the walkway by Facilities & Maintenance Building B was one of the first installed on Emory's campus. This green roof serves as an experimental demonstration plot, with slightly different types of bedding and soils in each planting tray in order for students to make scientific comparisons. Green Roof on Eagle Hall Longstreet-Means Freshman Residential Hall, which opened in the Fall of 2010, incorporated many green aspects into its design in order to achieve its LEED Gold Certification. One of these green features was a miniature green roof, which lines the windows on the Eastern wall of the third floor. On the other side of the building, another narrow bed of plants have also found a home on a different roof outcropping. The majority of the plants here were not artificially planted, but instead native species, whose spores and seeds landed on these patches of soil. Green Roof on Mathematics & Sciences Center The first green roof on Emory's campus, the green garden topping the Mathematics & Science Center was originally installed in October 2008. The project was part of a student-led pilot study exploring the benefits of green roofs, but in the past decade had fallen into disrepair. The green roof was revived in 2016 by former Emory student Rebecca Park, who had a particular interest in green infrastructure. The MSC green roof now boasts more than 500 native plants-primarily specimens of drought-tolerant sedum and delosperma-and is cared for by students in the environmental sciences department.

By May, the administration had made little progress on meeting their demands, so the BSA staged one of the most significant student activist protests in Emory's history. On Sunday, they marched from the Pitts Theology Building, then Emory's main chapel, to Cox Hall, holding up printed signs at the doors and lunch lines and handing out statements that detailed their complaints about how the university treated black employees. On Monday, the BSA held an enthusiastically attended rally on the Quad, drawing 500 students to hear their documentation of racist actions and policies at Emory. Ultimately, the activism of the BSA catalyzed major changes to the university, including the creation of the African-American Studies program and the hiring of the first African-American administrator.
