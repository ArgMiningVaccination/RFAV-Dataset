Natural remedies to keep your vagina healthy include: Probiotics Garlic Apple cider vinegar Staying hydrated Managing stress Eating less sugar Not douching Wearing cotton underwear Using barrier protection (like a condom) during penetrative sex The pH in your vagina should be slightly acidic, between 3.8 and 4.5. A lower pH is more acidic. The normal flora or healthy bacteria in the vagina thrive when the pH level is balanced. These harmless bacteria, along with vaginal discharge, keep the vagina clean and infection-free. If your pH is too high, you may experience symptoms like redness and rash or a burning sensation. Natural remedies can help restore balance, but your healthcare provider may also want to test you for certain infections and other health conditions that can be treated with prescription medication. This article explores the definition of pH levels, the normal pH of the vagina, and how it relates to normal flora. It also discusses symptoms of an unbalanced pH as well as home remedies to help keep levels balanced. If you suspect it's unbalanced, easy-to-use at-home tests are available. Symptoms of Unbalanced pH Levels pH stands for potential hydrogen. Before discussing the pH balance of the vagina, it's important to discuss normal vaginal flora. Normal flora is made up of healthy microorganisms such as bacteria, yeast, and other fungi. Think of it as a mini-ecosystem in the vagina that is critical for maintaining a healthy pH balance. Normal flora thrive in an acidic environment. Medications, diet, hormones, and lifestyle factors can disrupt the balance. High pH levels create an environment in which harmful bacteria can grow more easily. This can lead to bacterial vaginosis (BV). Bacterial Vaginosis or Yeast Infection? Symptoms of vaginal infections that can lead to imbalanced vaginal pH include: Redness, a rash, swelling, or itching around the vagina or labiaBurning with urination or during sexual intercourseStrong, unpleasant odor or fishy smellGreen, gray, or yellow discharge Chunky texture It may be more noticeable after menstruation (period) or intercourse. Atrophic Vaginitis Atrophic vaginitis, thinning of vaginal tissue, may also cause burning or discomfort. This is more common in perimenopausal or menopausal women due to decreased estrogen levels. What Does Normal Vaginal Discharge Look Like? What Is a Normal pH Level? pH levels are based on a scale of 0 to 14 and measure acidity or alkalinity. Numbers lower than 7 are acidic, while higher numbers are alkaline (basic). pH Scale The pH scale ranges from 0 (acidic) to 14 (basic): Less than 7 = acidic7 = neutral Greater than 7 = basic pH levels vary throughout the body. The vagina's pH is naturally acidic and usually ranges from 3.8 to 4.5.

Testing At-home vaginal pH tests are also referred to as feminine screening kits and are similar to those used in the doctor's office. Some include litmus paper, while others use a vaginal swab. You collect the sample at home, comparing your results with an easy-to-read pH color chart. Similar tests provide a report of your vaginal microbiome. However, they are packaged and sent to a lab. Follow Directions Carefully Follow the directions for these at-home tests carefully to ensure accurate results. Many are invalid if they are done too soon after sexual intercourse or a menstrual cycle. What Do the Results Mean? A pH above 4.5: pH levels above 4.5 may indicate that you have an infection such as bacterial vaginosis. In this case, your healthcare provider will want to do an exam and possible testing to plan your course of treatment. A normal or slightly low pH: If you have itching, burning, or redness, and your pH is normal or slightly low, it could be a yeast infection. If you've had yeast infections in the past, your healthcare provider may recommend trying an over-the-counter (OTC) medication. How to Use At-Home Vaginal pH Tests Natural Remedies to Restore pH Balance Your healthcare provider may prescribe something to help keep the vaginal pH balanced. However, these are some of the things you can do on your own in the meantime. Verywell / Jessica Olah Probiotics Probiotics are part of the normal flora in the body, including the vagina. When they are out of balance, harmful bacteria or yeast can arise and cause an infection. Lactobacilli Lactobacilli are an example of helpful bacteria in the vagina's flora. Lactic acid, produced by lactobacilli, creates an acidic environment that helps prevent harmful bacteria from growing. Antibiotics are great for killing off bacteria that are making us sick. But did you know they can kill good bacteria in the process? As a result, the vaginal pH increases and becomes more alkaline, leaving a perfect environment for pathogens to grow. Bacteria can lead to bacterial vaginosis (BV). Fungus such as Candida albicans can cause a yeast infection. Eating a well-balanced diet that's high in fiber is one of the best ways to keep probiotics at healthy levels. Probiotics occur naturally in fermented foods such as: Yogurt Pickles Kombucha (fermented tea) dairy drink) Buttermilk Sourdough bread Fermented sauerkraut Miso soup If you are not getting enough in your diet, your healthcare provider may suggest oral supplements or vaginal suppositories. Keep in mind that these supplements have debatable efficacy and more research is needed. Effectiveness of Probiotics While studies have shown mixed results about the effectiveness of probiotics, the majority are in favor of their use. Probiotics are considered safe and may offer benefits to improve overall health and balance vaginal pH levels. Garlic Garlic is known to have antibacterial and antifungal properties. Some studies show that it can help fight off vaginal infections. When eaten as part of a healthy diet, garlic is generally safe. Oral garlic supplements are available. It's best not to use garlic directly in or around the vagina. Garlic Supplements Check with your healthcare provider before taking garlic supplements. High amounts can increase the risk of bleeding and may interfere with the effectiveness of some medications. Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) Many people add ACV to their health routine for its antibacterial and antifungal effects. If that is something you'd like to try, it should be taken by mouth. You can drink diluted apple cider vinegar or take it in a supplement form. Direct use on the vagina, even diluted, is not recommended. It may be harmful to the vaginal tissue and pH balance. The Health Benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar Stay Hydrated Drinking plenty of water helps flush toxins and regulate the vagina's ecosystem. Dehydration can lead to itching around the vagina or worsen yeast infections. Have you seen bottles of alkaline water at the store and wondered if it's better than regular water? Currently, there is no evidence that drinking alkaline water benefits vaginal health. It's best to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of pure water. How Much Water Should You Drink? Ideally, women should get about 2.7 liters, or 91 ounces, of water per day. Wondering if you are getting enough? Here are some signs you need more water: Feeling thirsty Yellow, dark yellow, or orange urine Overly tired Hungry often Flaky or dry skin Bad breath Manage Stress Stress increases cortisol, which disrupts the acid-base balance in the vagina. Some stressors are beyond our control, so managing them is the next best choice. Coping techniques include: Regular exerciseHealthy dietGetting enough sleepDeep breathingPracticing enjoyable hobbies or activitiesAvoiding smokingNo drug abuseLimited or no alcohol Eat Less Sugar Increased sugar in the body can lead to higher pH levels or fuel yeast growth. Avoid or limit excess sugar in foods and drinks such as: AlcoholSodaRefined bread or pasta Ice creamCandy Natural Sugars in Fruit Eating natural sugars from fruit is healthy in small portions (unless otherwise directed by your healthcare team). However, they still contain sugar and can affect vaginal pH. Make a note of how they affect your body and adjust accordingly. Avoid Douching Douching means cleaning the inside of the vagina with water or a solution. Women often think they are supposed to douche. However, most healthcare providers do not recommend it because it can cause pH imbalances and disrupt the normal flora. Douching may also worsen an infection by pushing the bacteria into the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. This can lead to a serious health problem called pelvic inflammatory disease. The Vagina Cleans Itself The acidic environment, normal flora, and secretions keep the inside of the vagina clean. Secretions wash away blood, semen, and excess discharge. To keep the outside clean, just use warm water on the outer areas when bathing. Why Douching Is Bad for Your Vaginal Health Wear Breathable, Cotton Underwear Synthetic fabrics trap sweat and moisture, which allows bacteria and yeast to grow. Wearing breathable, cotton underwear provides airflow. It's also a good idea to change promptly after swimming or sweating to keep the area dry. Both reduce the risk of vaginal and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Barrier Protection During Sex Semen has a pH level between 7.1 and 8. Having unprotected sex briefly increases the pH of the vagina. An increased pH is helpful when trying to conceive a baby because it helps protect the sperm. Barriers such as condoms protect the vagina from exposure to the higher pH of semen. When to Call Your Healthcare Provider Contact your healthcare provider if you have: Abnormal vaginal dischargeAbdominal or pelvic (lower belly between hips) painFeverTried home remedies and symptoms do not resolve within a few days Noticed you are developing symptoms frequently Summary A healthy vagina has an acidic pH level that helps good bacteria (normal flora) thrive. Along with discharge, pH levels and normal flora keep the vagina clean and balanced. At-home tests are available to test vaginal pH levels if you suspect they are unbalanced. Call a healthcare provider if you have a fever or pain. If your discharge is green, gray, or yellow, has an unpleasant \"fishy smell,\" or a chunky, cottage cheese consistency, call your provider. There are a few things you can try at home preventively if symptoms are mild, or you are waiting on an appointment. Call your provider if symptoms persist after a few days of home remedies or if symptoms change or get worse. Frequently Asked Questions What does \"pH\" stand for? pH stands for potential hydrogen, and it's a way to describe how acidic or basic (alkaline) a substance is. pH levels vary throughout the body. How do you test your pH level without a strip? Feminine screening kits use vaginal swabs and easy-to-read color results to check pH levels. Similar tests are packaged and sent to a lab to provide a report about the vaginal microbiome. Follow the directions for either type of test carefully for accurate results. Your healthcare provider may also recommend urine testing to rule out infections. What's the difference between acid and alkaline? pH is measured on a scale of 0 to 14. Seven is neutral. Lower numbers are acidic, and higher numbers basic or alkaline. The difference between acid and alkaline takes us back to chemistry. Acidic substances have more free hydrogen present than alkaline substances. What is the pH of sperm? Semen has a pH level between 7.1 and 8. 23 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
