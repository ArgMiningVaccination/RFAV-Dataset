We asked nutrition experts from all over the world to weigh in on the best ashwagandha supplements, evaluating each formula on active ingredients, type, dosage, and benefits targeted. After considering dozens of formulations, we landed on these top-rated picks.

[Faatimah Bah](https://mobile.twitter.com/dietitianbah)is a dietitian in Saudi Arabia. Hamshaw](https://www.instagram.com/thefullhelping/), RD, a registered dietitian in New York City and author of [The Full Helping](https://www.thefullhelping.com/)blog What to Look For in an Ashwagandha Supplement Certified organic When it comes to choosing an ashwagandha supplement, [Kimberly Snyder](https://mysolluna.com/about/kimberly-snyder/), a plant-based nutritionist and holistic wellness expert, says that first and foremost, you want to make sure it has the [USDA organic stamp](https://www.ams.usda.gov/grades-standards/organic-standards). Brands can pretty freely include the words \"natural\" and \"organic\" on product packaging regardless of whether or not the formulas are fully organic, but the USDA stamp should ensure that the supplement is made from at least 95% organic ingredients. Whole herb formulas Snyder also recommends looking for supplements that contain the whole herb rather than herb extractions. This way, you can ensure you receive the maximum amount of benefits from the plant. Properly grown and sourced Where and how ashwagandha is grown will affect how efficacious it will be. \"While ashwagandha can grow all around the world, traditionally black soil is considered the most ideal condition for this plant, which is where nature can concentrate its active compounds,\" says Snyder. \"One such place is the Nagori region of central India, where the high altitude, black soil, and limited rain and fertilizer allow the plant to flourish to its fullest potential.\" In addition to being grown in black soil, Snyder stresses the importance of going with a brand that understands that harvesting time is to be respected. \"The fruits of the ashwagandha plant should be mature but not dried out, which is when the active principles are the highest.\" Of course, not all of this information may be listed on a product label, so be sure to do your research or reach out to a brand directly before making a purchase. - What are the benefits of ashwagandha supplements? \"The most notable benefit ashwagandha supplements offer is their effect on lowering stress levels,\" says Bah. \"The herb is classified as an adaptogen, which indicates its capability to normalize physiologic processes and thereby stabilize the body's response to stress. Studies suggest that ashwagandha not only lowers stress levels but provides the mind with protection against future stress\u2014which is said to improve quality of life.\" And ashwagandha may have other benefits. \"Some people also use ashwagandha for improving thinking ability, reducing pain and swelling, and to increase libido,\" says Bah. - Can you take ashwagandha supplements with other supplements? According to Snyder, you can take ashwagandha with other supplements. \"To date, there are no major studies I'm aware of that show ashwagandha to have any interactions with other drugs or supplements,\" she says. \"However, if you're concerned or on prescription drugs, you should always ask your doctor about taking any herbs.\" - When should you take ashwagandha supplements? You can take ashwagandha at different times of the day, depending on your health goals. \"If you're looking to consume ashwagandha for general health promotion, it's recommended to take it on an empty stomach in the morning,\" says Snyder. \"If you're looking to gain bulk and strength, it's recommended to consume ashwagandha after meals.\" - How often should you take ashwagandha supplements? With ashwagandha, you can't just pop a supplement and hope to feel chill immediately. You need to take it daily. \"The key with ashwagandha and any other adaptogen is giving it time to work,\" says Lorencz. \"It can take up to 60 days of regular consumption to see and feel the benefits.\" - Do ashwagandha supplements expire? Yes, they do. \"As with any herbal or medicinal supplement, the longer it's exposed to air and sunlight, the less effective it will be,\" says Lorencz. \"It won't necessarily go bad at a certain date, but the longer it's exposed to the elements the more likely it is to decrease in effectiveness.\" Keep your supplement, root, or powder in an airtight container and in a dark and cool location to help keep it potent as long as possible, she suggests. Note that when using these products, or any type of supplement, it's important to consult your doctor for proper dosing information, especially if you are pregnant and/or breastfeeding, or have been diagnosed with an autoimmune disease.
